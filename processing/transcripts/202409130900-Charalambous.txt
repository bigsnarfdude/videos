See, there seems to be making a lot of noise. So I hear a lot of things in my headphones. Okay, I'll try to ignore that. I'll be talking to you about some recent work on the LP spectrum with my co-author, Xi Chin Liu, and in a separate work with Julie Rolette. I will be talking about the smooth case of Riemannian manifolds with the Laplacian acting on k-horns. Let me remind everyone that. Let me remind everyone that this operator is given usually in the Hodge-Laplacian form, where d is the exterior derivative and delta is the adjoint in the Riemannian metric. And we can also write it as the covariant Laplacian plus a tensor on k-forms, which is known as either the curvature or Weisen-Bock tensor on forms. And for everyone who hasn't seen this before, this tensor coincides with Ricci curvature when it's acting on. Ricci curvature when it's acting on one forms, and in general, it is known that it will be bounded below whenever the curvature tensor on vector fields is bounded below. Moreover, the Laplacian can always be extended to a self-adjoint and non-negative definite operator on the space of L two integrable k forms, but it can also be extended to a closed operator on L P integrable K forms. P integrable k forms. And its spectrum is defined as the set of points in the complex plane where the Laplacian lambda times the identity fails to be invertible on its domain. And the definition for the spectrum is exactly the same if we're dealing with a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space, but also for any closed operator on Banach spaces. Let me quickly mention that the way Let me quickly mention that the way one gets the Laplacian on Lp is through its semi-group. We start with the semi-group associated to the Laplacian on L2. We extend it to the space of LP integrable k-forms, and we can show that this is a bounded operator whenever the Weissen-Bock tensor is bounded below. With the only note here being that we take L infinity to be the dual to the L1 space. The L1 space. So we define the Laplacian on Lp as the generator of this semigroup when acting on Lp. Let me note that the spectrum on Lp integrable k-forms can depend on both P and K. So I'm going to denote it by sigma P and K. And note that for dual dimensions in the Banach space, it will be the same. In other words, the spectrum on K form. words the spectrum on k forms in lp will coincide with the spectrum on k forms for p star and point carrot duality gives us that the spectrum on k and n minus k forms will also be the same and here is again the dimension of the manifold i'm going to refer to the complement of the spectrum as a resolvent set and denote it by rho of p and k and know that equivalently this is the set of points in the complement This is the set of points in the complex plane where the resolvent operator centered at this point μ will be bounded. In general, when P is no longer equal to 2, since our operator is not in general self-adjoint, it is well known that the spectrum can contain non-real eigenvalues. And note that for this geometric operator, like for many other. Geometric operator, like for many other geometric operators, the spectrum will in general reflect the geometric structure and analytical properties of the manifold, in other words, of the space, but also of the backdoor. In general, we know that if the manifold is smooth and compact, then the LP spectrum will always be a discrete set, and it will be the same for all P. In other words, studying the LP. In other words, studying the LP spectrum for P0 is only interesting in the non-compact case, which is the one that I will be looking at. At the same time, it is possible to prove LP dependence results for the spectrum, not only for the Laplacian, but also for Schrodinger operators. One of the first such nice results was given by Hempel and Boyd in the 80s. Hempel and Boyd in the 80s. They considered Schrodinger operators over the Euclidean space and they proved the LP independence depending on the growth of the negative part of the potential. Moreover, in 92, Stern famously extended this result to the case of uniformly elliptic operators in divergence form, which include the Laplancian enfanced. The Laplace and functions. And he showed that the spectrum will be LP-independent whenever the manifold has reached a curvature bounded below and uniformly sub-exponential volume growth. And I'll come back to the definition of this sub-exponential volume growth in a little bit. Moreover, more recently with Nadine Gross, we were able to show that we also have an LP independence result for DIRAC operators and For Dirac operators and square Dirac operators over Clifford bundles. If, in addition to Sturm's geometric conditions, we also get a lower bound for the Clifford contraction. And just to make this a little bit more clear, if our Dirac operator is acting on forms, then essentially this lower bound is a lower bound of the Weissen-Boch tensor for forms. At the same time, like I said, the LP spectrum on K-forms can contain, in general, a region in the complex plane. And in particular, this is known to be true whenever the curvature of the manifold is negative at an end of the manifold and in general does not collapse. So, I will give you a first basic example: the one that was introduced by David, Simon, and Taylor, and who Davis, Simon, and Taylor, and who showed that at least over the hyperbolic space, the spectrum of the Laplacian on functions depends on p, and it's a parabola. This parabola can be written in the format of a constant, n minus 1 squared over 4. This constant, let me remind everyone, it's essentially the bottom of the L2 spectrum of the Laplacian functions over the hyperbolic space plus a z squared. Plus z squared, where the imaginary part of z gives us the opening of the parabola, and this opening depends on p and on the dimension of the manifold. So this format will appear various times during this talk. So like I said, in the case p is equal to 2, this parabola now reduces to an interval. And in fact, it is well known that the spectrum increases. spectrum increases when p decreases from two to one and then we have the dual spectrum for the p larger than two and in fact when p is equal to one this parabolic region has a vertex at the origin at the same time they showed that over portions of a hyperbolic space by some special groups that are known as geometrically fine That are known as geometrically finite groups, right? With the property that the quotient manifold is either Cas-free or has a finite volume, then the LP spectrum will be precisely the same parabolic region, but it could also have a finite number of isolated eigenvalues on the real line. And these eigenvalues are exactly L2 eigenvalues. At the same time, At the same time, G.N. Weber more recently studied the case of locally symmetric spaces of rank one and higher, and they proved that the LP spectrum of the Laplacian on functions again will contain a parabolic region. And more recently, I mentioned that Weber also showed that on certain manifolds that have various ends, and on each end the curvature becomes more and more negative. He showed that these manifolds, in fact, That these manifolds, in fact, contain a conic region in their LP spectrum. So, when I started working with the Ji Chin Lu on this problem, our first goal to see what we can say about the LP spectrum of the Laplacian on forms. And we started with the Toy example of the hyperbolic space over which we were able to compute precisely the LP spectrum on K. The LP spectrum on k forms, proving that it's in fact again a parabolic region. This constant now in front, I don't know if you see my mouse, is the bottom of the L2 spectrum of the Laplacian on K forms. So it depends on K. And then the opening of the parabola, the imaginary part of Z, will depend on N and P. And we have exactly the same bound and opening as we have for. Bound and opening as we have for the Laplacian on functions. Note that I wrote this parabola for k less than a half dimension. When k is even and k is exactly n over 2, then the LP spectrum will consist of the corresponding parabolic region, but zero will also be in the spectrum. And this zero is not always inside the parabola, it is inside the parabola for. It is inside the parabola for P near 1, but there is a gap for P near equal to 2, and it's in fact an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity. The remaining cases for K are given by Poincaré duality. So, note that the parabolas I wrote are the same for P and P star. Moreover, S K increases from Increases from 1 to n over 2, and for the same p, this parabolic region shifts to the left and therefore increases. And it reduces to an interval, like I said, when p is equal to 2, recovering the L2 spectrum on k-forms that was computed by Dolly. And let me mention that there are always two steps in this cruise. In these groups. The first step is to show that a region in this target spectrum is, in fact, in the spectrum by finding a large family of approximate eigenforms. And this type of argument requires a very rigid structure at the ends of our manifold so that we can write our Laplacian in some nice coordinates and be able to obtain a large enough family of approximate. Enough family of approximate eigenforms. As a result, examples are difficult to obtain and require a very strict structure at infinity. For the other containment, in other words, to show that our spectrum is contained in a parabolic region or in a certain region, an analytical argument is usually necessary. And the way one goes about it is to find estimates for the resolvent kernel. The resolvent kernel in order to prove that the resolvent operator is bounded in the complement of the target spectrum. So, what one actually usually does is to start with the resolvent operator on L1, prove that it is bounded on L1, the L2 spectrum is usually known, and then use interpolation to get the resolvent set for any pin. And for the hyperbolic space, we have to be a little bit careful. Space: We have to be a little bit careful for how when we're looking at k in half dimension, and I'll come back to this towards the end of the talk. So, first of all, from analytical results, we know that the resolvent for the Laplacian and functions is always, or the spectrum, if I say the containment, is contained in the right half plane. And we have sort of like a first result by David, Simon, and Taylor, who look at the case of boundary. Taylor, who looks at the case of bounded curvature and show that the LP resolvent will be bounded in the complement of a parabola over certain manifolds with bounded geometry. In other words, the spectrum is contained in the parabolic region in the case of bounded curvature. And the way they prove this result is through the wave kernel method to obtain estimates for the resolvent. Resolvent. Since they're using the wave kernel, they need, as we will see, to control the parametrics in a very uniform way over these manifolds. So they have to assume that their manifolds have bounded geometry and in particular injectivity radius uniformly bounded below. So what we were first able to do with Xi Chin Lu was by a combination of the wave kernel and heat kernel technique, Wave kernel and heat kernel technique, we were able to get estimates for the resolvent by only assuming Ricci curvature bounded below and Y is the book tensor bounded below, removing the assumption of bounded geometry. So let me say that from now on, our manifold will be non-compact of dimension n. And I will start with the heat kernel estimates that we were able. Kernel estimates that we were able to get under our assumptions. So, under only Ricci and Weissenbach tensor lower bound, we get that the heat kernel of the Laplacian on forms has a Gaussian upper bound, similar to the one for the Laplacian on functions. And moreover, if the Weissen-Bog tensor on K plus one forms is bounded below, we get an upper bound for the exterior derivative of the heat kernel. Of the heat kernel. And if the Weissenbulk tensor on k minus one forms is bounded below, we can also find an upper bound for delta of the heat kernel, of the heat kernel. Note that we have an extra blow-up term in time for the derivatives, the way we do for gradients of the Laplace of the heat kernel on functions. And the heat kernel bound for forms was already known. Was already known. It's in fact proved through the domination technique developed by Hesch-Schrader and Ullenbrock, which, under the condition of Weisen-Bog tensor-bounded below, and through Catos inequality, essentially allows us to get a pointwise domination, sorry, to dominate pointwise the inner product for the Laplacian on functions by the inner product. Functions by the inner product of the Laplacian forms, and as a result, get a pointwise domination of the heat kernel on functions by the heat kernel on forms with an extra exponential term that reflects the lower bound on the Weissen-Boch tensor. For the derivatives, we use the Bochner formula and the fact that the derivatives satisfy now essentially their sub-solutions to the parabolic equation. And then Equation, and then we apply the parabolic version of the Moiser inequality developed by Cheng Li and Yao to get our upper bound. So with these two simple assumptions on Ricci curvature and Weissen-Bock tensor on forms bounded below, we get that the resolvent operator centered at any negative enough real number and at any power. Number and at any power will be bounded on Np for Np. And under the respective additional lower bounds for the Y is and Bog tensor, we also get that the derivatives of these powers of the resolvent will be bounded on L P at large enough negative readings. The proof is fairly simple. We look at the resolvent kernel, which can be written as a time integral of the Time integral of the heat kernel through what is known as the inverse Laplace transform of the function corresponding to the resolving operator. And then our heat kernel estimates allow us to get some uniform L1 estimates for the resolvent kernel. And through Schur's test, we now get that the resolvent is bounded on Lp. In fact, using a generalized version of Schur's test, we can get that certain weights of the resolvent operator are also bounded on LP. The weight function that we use is one over the volume of the balls of radius one, and all the constants here are the ones that make Schurst test work. So, we get that these weights of the Laplacian are bounded from Lp to LQ with the proper. Q with the property that, in general, what this Schuerst test gives is that Q is greater than P, and with the weights chosen so that we can have the integrability of our kernels using volume comparison. In particular, these weighted estimates tell us that certain weighted integrals of our resolvent kernel will decay exponentially with respect to the distance. With respect to the distance between two points. And this was key in some of our further results. The other notion we had to introduce was the one for the exponential rate of volume growth for the manifold. We denote this by gamma, and this is essentially the infimum of all real numbers, such that the volume of the ball of radius r at Of the ball of radius r at x divided by the volume of the ball of radius one at x grows at most like exponential to the power of gamma. And what we are able to get is that under our Ricci curvature and Weisenbach tensor assumptions, if the exponential rate of volume growth of our manifold is gamma, then we get that the resolvent of That the resolvent operator is bounded in the complement of a parabola. In other words, our spectrum is contained inside a parabola, with constant lambda one being the bottom of the L2 spectrum on k forms and opening in of the parabola. In other words, imaginary part of Z depending on gamma and on P. So our proof is a for our proof, we modify the wave kernel technique of Taylor and replace the parametrics in that wave kernel using a power of the resolvent. The idea here is first we recenter the Laplacian so that the spectrum starts at zero by subtracting lambda one and then we use the resolvent equation to recenter the Equation to recenter the resolvent operator at z squared, two various powers of the resolvent centered at negative real numbers, and then a last operator that's a combination of the two. So from our theorem three, if we take C large enough, these first powers of the resolvent are bounded and on L1 at least. On L1 at least, and we have to now prove that this second operator is bounded on L1. And the way we do that is by writing the kernel now of this second operator as an integral where we use the Fourier transform to write it as an integral of the wave kernel applied to the resolvent kernel centered at minus xi squared. Minus x squared. Thank you. So, like in the previous proof, to show and using Schur's test, to show now that this operator is bounded on L1, it suffices to prove the uniform L1 integrability of this kernel. L1 integrability over the manifold. So, for this L1 integrability, know that what we really have to take care of is this exponential term in Exponential term in Z, right? And in other words, we have to control the imaginary part of Z. In fact, what we are able to show is that if Z is at least half of this exponential rate of volume is imaginary part, then we do have, in fact, this uniform L1 integrability. As a result, the second operator is bounded on L1 for imaginary. On L1 for imaginary part of Z large enough. And our resolvent operator now is bounded on L1 for this large enough imaginary part of Z. And by symmetry, we get theorem 4 for the case P is equal to 1. So for the rest of the P's, we know that for P is equal to 2, the resolvent is bounded away from the non-negative real line and through steps. Realign and through stein interpolation now we get for each P an interpolated parabolic region in which the spectrum will be contained. So this resolvent has replaced our parametric and to prove the key lemma that I said in other words the L1 integrability of this second kernel operator what we do is split the What we do is split the resolvent kernel into two parts, the way one usually does with the parametrics. We use the finite propagation speed of the wave operator, in other words, the wave kernel method, but at the same time, we make full use of our generalized resolvent estimates and the assumption on the exponential volume growth of the manifold. Any questions so far? Okay. Thank you. So let me remark that this exponential rate of volume growth is bounded below by the volume entropy of the manifold. And the case gamma is equal to zero corresponds to the concept of uniform sub-exponential volume growth that was introduced by Stern. Recall that by Stern's Recall that by Sturm's result and my result with our netting gross, if the Ricci curvature and Weisenbach tensor are bounded below and gamma is zero, we have that the L P spectrum on K forms is P independent. We don't get P independence in our result with loop, but at least we get that the L P spectrum is contained in the non-negative real line. But the result is interesting in more. The result is interesting in more general cases. In fact, this containment in some parabolic region for the spectrum was generalized for Taylor to certain functions of the Laplacian. To prove the result for functions of the Laplacian, he considered the Fourier transform of the Laplacian and obtained estimates through the wave kernel, therefore again needing the assumption of bounded geometry. Assumption of bounded geometry. What we did was like we tried to generalize our trick to the case when our functions of the Laplacian now have a Laplace transform and an inverse Laplace transform. If we have the inverse Laplace transform of the operator, then we can write its resolvent as an integral of the heat kernel with the formula that I write here. That I write here. In our previous case for the resolvent, the function g is essentially the function that corresponds to the resolvent operator. And the corresponding f that we look at is g at w squared. So what we consider are functions now that are defined on a horizontal strip with opening that depends on this. With opening that depends on this exponential rate of volume growth of the manifold and which are holomorphic. We assume that their derivatives have some type of polynomial decay. And we take functions g, which are f at the square root of w. We assume that they have an inverse Laplace transform. And this inverse Laplace transform has at most exponential growth, which is fairly general. Which is fairly general. So, what we are able to show is that with our curvature bounds, like in other words, Ricci curvature and Weisenbach tensor bounded below for k forms, the exponential rate of volume growth bounded above, we get that the functions f of this Laplacian will now be bounded on L1 on these strips. So we have the square root of the double. we have the square root of the w so we end up getting actually a parabolic region the proof here is through a generalization of the resolvent equation where now we use taylor's formula to write the function f as a sum of powers of the derivatives of this generalized resolver and then we have a second integral term and using uh this uh And using these functional properties that we put on the Laplace transform and our functions, we can show that both of these operators are bounded on L1 using again, at least for the second part of the operator, a combination of the wave kernel method with by and replacing the parametrics with the resolvent operator. So I will move on to some examples where I was at least in the particular case that I looked at with Julie Rolette and for which we were able to compute the LP spectrum of the Laplacian on functions under a relatively more general manifold. The case that we looked at was the one That we looked at was the one of manifolds that are conformally compact of dimension n, which Borthwick showed that essentially they are manifolds which outside a compact set, in other words, near infinity, they can be written as a product manifold by a segment of the real line times a compact n minus one manifold y. And on this complement of a compact This complement of a compact set, the metric can be given essentially as the upper half plane model for the hyperbolic space, but a little bit more general. In this case, x equals 0 corresponds to the boundary at infinity. In other words, the boundary in our upper half plane model, which is really not part of the manifold, but is the boundary at infinity. The metric is like the upper half. metric is like the upper half plane model metric, but it's a little bit more general. In front of this first term, dx squared over x squared, we allow this first part of the metric to depend on y. In other words, we allow the sectional curvature at infinity to take negative values and to approach different negative values as x goes to zero, depending on the zero depending on the point y at the boundary at infinity. In particular, since y is compact, this absolute value of alpha of y will be contained in a compact set of positive values starting at alpha zero and ending at alpha one. Maceio had studied the essentials, the L2 essential spectrum. The L2 essential spectrum forms for these manifolds. In other words, he showed that outside the set of isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity, the spectrum will be an interval, right? And this interval, we start at a value that depends on alpha zero and the order of the forms. This is sort of like the bottom of the L2 etcal spectrum. To a central spectrum. And in the case when k is half-dimensional, there would always be a spectral gap. Zero will also be in the L2 spectrum. And in fact, it will be an eigenvalue of infinite multiples. So we know more or less the L2 spectrum of these manifolds. However, the exponential rate of volume growth of these conformally compact manifolds does not reflect alpha one, but not reflect alpha one but rather it depends on alpha one in other words the lowest value of the sectional curvature at infinity so uh what we were able to show with uh julie is that at least for the spectrum of the lp spectrum of the laplacian functions we get for each one of the values of the sectional curvature at infinity for which one for each one of the alphas we get Of the alphas, we get a parabolic region contained in the spectrum. This parabolic region starts at a, or whatever, can be written as a constant that depends on alpha plus z squared with opening now that depends on n, alpha, and p. Okay, at the same time, we can show that the spectrum is contained. That the spectrum is contained now in a parabolic region. Actually, we know this result from our result with Gichi, where now the lambda one is the bottom of the L2 spectrum, and the opening of the parabola depends on the lower end of the sectional curvature, depends on alpha 1. Note that the case of hyperbolic space corresponds to alpha taking a single value. Alpha taking a single value at infinity, the value one. In general, we know that if alpha is constant, the sectional curvature is constant at infinity, we can show that a single parabolic region will be contained in the spectrum. And if now the bottom of the L2 spectrum coincides with the bottom of the essential spectrum, in other words, if we don't have isolated eigenvalue. Isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity, then we get that the spectrum will be precisely a parabolic region. In other words, we are able to precisely compute the LP spectrum for functions if the sectional curvature approaches a constant at infinity and there are no isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. Note, moreover, that this family of parabolas that I wrote. Of parabolas that I wrote here have the following property. I draw some pictures for you. As alpha increases, these parabolas become more open and shift to the right. The leftmost parabola that I wrote here, the one that's in the clear blue, is the one that corresponds to alpha zero. It's the one furthest to the left and the one that's the least open. The least open, and the parabola that would correspond to alpha one would be the one further to the right and the one with the biggest opening. Note moreover, I don't know if you can see it from the picture, but the enveloping curve to a family of parabolas for a continuum of alphas is in fact a conic region in the complex plane. And on the right picture here, I drew together with these parabolas the parabolic region where we know that the spectrum is contained and which can shift to the left, but we know that its opening coincides with the opening of the rightmost parabola. So there is no contradiction here between the two sets, right? They will never meet at infinity. And we see that we have. And we see that we have now an obstruction into knowing the LP spectrum precisely, at least from these two results. So far, it seems difficult to get a further set of eigenfunctions in the case where the sectional curvature varies at infinity. In other words, we cannot fill out this gray area between these two regions. Between these two regions. So, the variation of the sectional curvature at infinity gives us some difficulty in knowing the spectrum precisely. And moreover, we have this set of isolated eigenvalues that could shift the lambda one to the left and that also prevent us from knowing the spectrum precisely. So, in some more specific cases, perhaps we need a more specific result than. Specific result than the parabolic region. For the case of the Laplacian on forms, it was studied more recently also by Petro Siassus. He showed that in the more specific case of a manifold, which is a war product at infinity and with sectional curvature approaching a negative constant, the LP spectrum or forms will contain a parabolic region that depends on the curvature at infinity. On the curvature at infinity and on k. And with opening, that also again depends on the curvature at infinity and on p. And of course, we get an analogous parabola where the spectrum is contained and we can get a precise result. We know that the spectrum will be a parabolic region if the L1 spectrum coincides with the bottom of the lambda one, sorry, coincidence. Uh, that lambda one sorry coincides with the bottom of the essential spectrum. We can, however, control this set of isolated singularities of finite multiplicity over certain quotients of hyperbolic space with quotient group, a geometrically finite group, and with the property that the quotient manifold has infinite volume and no hasps. In this case, we get that the LP spectrum on We get that the LP spectrum on forms will consist precisely of this parabolic region together with a set of isolated eigenvalues of finite mass duplicity that are L2 eigenvalues. So I'm going to finish off with some more analytical observations about the LP spectrum and in particular the lack of duality between the LP and LP spectrum. The LP and LP star spectra, in the sense that the nature of the points in the spectrum can, in fact, differ between P and P star. And to make this more clear, Taylor showed, for example, that over symmetric spaces of non-compact type, like the hyperbolic space, for the spectrum of the Laplacian non-forms, every point inside a parabolic region will in fact be an eigenvalue. Will in fact be an eigenvalue corresponding to an eigenfunction for p greater than two, but there are no eigenvalues for p less than two. Gian Weber also proved this lack of duality for locally symmetric spaces. If we're looking at rank one symmetric spaces for p greater than two, there will be an open subset of the complex plane in which every point is an eigenvalue, whereas Is an eigenvalue, whereas for p less than 2, the set of eigenvalues is a discrete set. They showed that if we have now certain non-compact locally symmetric spaces of higher rank and finite volume now, every point in a parabolic region, except for a discrete set, will be an eigenvalue for p less than 2. So we have sort of like the opposite scenario, and we chill. And with Ji Chi Lu, we showed that this is also the case for the Laplacian on forms over hyperbolic space. For P greater than 2, every point in the L P spectrum is an eigenvalue, but none of the points in the L P spectrum is an eigenvalue for P less than 2. And for the observers that are thinking about diffusion operators, let me mention that the heat operator on these symmetric spaces These symmetric spaces, when they don't have finite volume, in other words, when they don't have casps, is an operator that's ultra-contractive. In other words, it's bounded from Lp to LQ for P less than 2. And the semi-group operator preserves eigenfunctions and eigenforms. So if a function is a p eigenfunction, it will also be an L T. It would also be an LQ eigenfunction for Q greater than P. In other words, if we know that there is some point outside the real line, inside a parabola, that's an eigenvalue for p less than one, then it would have to be an L2 eigenvalue for sure. And that's a contradiction, right? So this is why we get, and we are actually only able to we are we are actually only able to find cases over these nice spaces where the LP spectrum everything in the LP spectrum is an eigenvalue for p greater than two but not for p less than one and only in the case where we lose this ultra contractivity we can find eigenvalues outside the real line for p less than two. Another interesting result that shows this lack of duality is that we can show that lambda will be in the LP spectrum if and only if either there is a sequence of L P eigen, approximate L P eigen functions or a sequence of approximate L P star eigenfunctions. But we don't get a valid criterion like the one that we have for the Like the one that we have for the case p is equal to 2. In other words, we don't get that lambda is in the spectrum if and only if there is a sequence of approximate L P eigen functions or forms, if we're dealing with forms. So with Xiqin Liu, what we are able to show is that at least for the case p greater than or equal to 2, using our resolvent estimates, we show that we can have an L P by criteria. NLP by criteria, an if and only if criteria. Then, if our manifold has rich curvature and Weiser Box tensor on force bounded below, and we also have that the volume of geodesic bolts of radius one is uniformly bounded below, which is a condition that would essentially allow us to get better resolvent estimates for these weighted powers of the resolvent that we have more uniform. But we have more uniform estimates. And this uniform lower bound on the volume of geodesic poles of radius ones is also an indication for the ultra-contractivity of the semi-group operator over Riemannian manifolds. So a last result that I owe you, at least in the case of the, in general, if we look at a manifold where rich curvature. Manifold where Ricci curvature and Weisenbach tensor is bounded below, we know that every point in the LP spectrum for the Laplacian on K forms, apart from zero, must have come either from the L P spectrum of the Laplacian on K minus one forms or from the L P spectrum of the Laplacian on K plus one forms. We are also able to show this for the L P spectrum. It was known for the L2 spectrum. L2 spectrum from Hodge decomposition. So the way we prove this is that we start with a point in the resolvent set on k minus 1 and k plus 1 forms. We rewrite the resolvent operator at lambda using the recentering it near a large enough negative number. We know again that the first part of these operators, the first sum. Operators, the first sum is bounded on L1, and we concentrate on the last part, which we can now rewrite distributing the various derivatives. Note that in the first term, the resolvent is now acting on k minus 1 forms, and in the first term, it's acting on k plus 1 forms. And since lambda is in the k minus 1 and k plus 1 resolvent, we have the boundary. One resolvent, we have the boundedness of this second operator. In other words, lambda will be in the k resolvent. So take complements and we get now that the k spectrum must have come from the other two. So this was the result that I owed you to complete the proof of what the L P spectrum over hyperbolic space is when K is equal to is when k is equal to n over 2. Note that in this case we can actually show that 0 is an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity for all p when k is half dimension. And like I said, for p near 2, there will be a spectral gap. So the problem with this spectral gap is that the interpolation argument does not work well to give the resolvent parabola because the L2 spectrum will start at zero. Spectrum will start at zero instead of this number that depends on n. However, we can observe that the parabolas that we found are the way they should have been. In other words, for n over 2, n over 2 plus 1, and n over 2 minus 1, they are exactly the same parabolas. And as a result, apart from zero, right, everything in the n over 2 spectrum. Everything in the n over 2 spectrum must have come from the other two. In other words, it must be precisely the n over 2 parabola. So we know that zero is there and we are able to complete the result on LT. And thank you very much for your attention. This brought us to the end of our talk. Any questions? Yeah, thanks. Any questions here or online then? If there are any questions, you could unmute yourselves and ask a question. No? Oh, yeah. Can you hear me? I can hear you. Masha, it's you, yes? Okay. Masha, Masjid. Do you have a so you have this additional condition in theorem seven? What are the about geodesic balls? What are the examples for that? The uniform lower bound on geodesic balls of radius one. This is a usually you can show that it happens on manifolds. You can show that it happens on manifolds that don't have casps. If you have a casp at infinity, sort of like a trumpet that becomes zero, and you look at the volume of the balls of radius one, example, the two-dimensional volume, near the end, this will be like a very fine thin tube, and that volume will actually be collapsing, right? So they don't have this uniform lower bound on the volume of balls of radius one, and this is. Radius one, and these are the examples of manifolds where usually ultra contractivity tends to fade right as well. Thank you. So the other thing that I wanted to mention, also like based on Nathaniel's talk from yesterday, is that at least in our results, this Ricci curvature lower bound seems to be a necessary assumption. Assumption. We haven't been able to prove something by only assuming this uniform exponential volume, rate of volume growth gamma. It seems that one can get away with reaching lower bounds if you have this volume doubling. But in the case of negative curvature, even if we have this exponential rate of volume growth, we cannot really exclude the assumption on the lower bound of Ricci curvature. The lower part of Rigi curvature, and that would be something interesting, or either find a counterexample or to see if that is like really necessary. So, you mean the metric geometry information is not enough? I couldn't hear you very well, Masha. Metric information is not enough. Metric information is not enough, exactly. So, we need a curvature assumption. Yeah, volume growth assumption is not enough. Thank you. Assumption is not a thank you. Thanks. Yeah, it's an interesting comment. Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you again. Thank you. So we have break for 50 minutes. I would like to make one that you have to check out. So that you have people to know this, if you can read it today. Today. Also, if you have any comments or suggestions for people here, let me know. I already told them that it would be nice to have more organized things on Wednesdays and they actually took note of that. So that would be appreciative or constructive feedback. Yeah. Hello, David. Hello. Yeah, hello, David, hello. Um, I cannot hear. Okay, the points are there. Or is it my female voice again? Oh, I'm recording this. Oh, my God.
