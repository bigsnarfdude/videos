And today, I'm going to talk about some of my recent research progress in a very interesting flow phenomenon in insect flights, the so-called leading edge vertex and its attachment and its vorticity dynamics. So, first of all, just for some background, I'd like to introduce the basic aerodynamics of flying insects and why we are going to research. And why we are going to research the aerodynamics of flying insects. So, there are very kinds of flying insects and birds in nature, and they are very excellent flyers. Some of them flap their wings in a horizontal plane, but others flap their wings in a vertical plane. But whatever, a human tried to design some flying aircrafts or flying mechanisms back in. Mechanisms back in the 18th or 17th centuries using flapping wings, but they failed. And later in the 1910, the Wright brothers, they used an alternative layout, the so-called fixed wing layout, as the very first attempt to design a flyable aircraft. And since then, this kind of layout has been one of the most common. One of the most common layout in the nowadays aircraft designs. But recently, proposed by DAPA, the scientists, they try to design some micro-air vehicles, some Ironman drones, and try to use them in some military or civil tasks. And motivated by these projects, we look back to this. We look back to these flying animals in nature and see if we can use these flapping wings in this kind of microair vehicles. The answer is yes. And during the last five years, this kind of bio-inspired micro-air vehicles has become popular and the focus of the research community. And these micro-air vehicles can be designed as a soldier weapon. Designed as a soldier weapon and can be used in swarm recognizes rescue or even a toy for fun. So, if you want to design such kinds of micro air vehicles, you want to first know the aerodynamics of flying insects and more fundamentally, the aerodynamics of flapping wings. So, let me introduce the steady aerodynamics first, maybe some common knowledge for Maybe some common knowledge for our researchers. So we can see this figure. And this shows the lift coefficient increases over the angle of attack. And up to some value, there is a sudden drop of lift generation. And this phenomenon is called the stall in steady aerodynamics. So back then, scientists tried to explain the insect flight using such The insect flight using such kind of steady aerodynamics, but it but they failed. And the research showed that an insect-like flapping wing at a hand angle of attack cannot generate sufficient lift for flight. This is obviously not true since we see all these kind of flying insects in nature. So, scientists look back to the flapping motion of insects. You can see this figure. Insects. You can see this figure shows the wing tape trajectory of a flapping wing. And up to date, several unsteady mechanisms have been proposed to explain the high lift generation of insect flapping wings. And we try to focus on this blue period and the blue one. So, this blue one shows the absence of stall mechanism, which is one of the most important aesthetic mechanisms. As steady mechanisms for lift generation. And this mechanism is not new to us. It is related to the dynamic stall phenomenon in some other scenarios. Let's say if we place a rectangular plate in the incoming flow and the wing starts to pitch up, and as the wing pitches up, there is a separate vertex generating near the leading edge. Near the leading edge. The vertex is called the leading edge vertex. And this vertex tends to grow and then finally sheds from the wing. It lasts for a period. And this is why we call this phenomenon the dynamic stall. But for insect-like flapping wings, the generation of leading edge vertex is found to be sustained attachment to the wing for the entire scroke. So So, I'd like to show some simulations of flying insects, like hog moss, honeybee, fruit fly, and thrips. For all these four kinds of insects, you can see the generation of leading-edge vertex on their wings here, here, here, and here. So, this is a very unified mechanism in flying insects. And we want to know why for Why for a flapping wing, the LEV can be held or can be sustained on this wing during a stroke? Why the flapping motion can stabilize the LEV? Here, the stabilize or stabilization means the achievement of LEV attachment. And let's move to the second part: the lineage vertex stability. Well, usually there are four Usually, there are four hypotheses tried to explain the stable LEV on flighting wings. The first one is the spin-wise convection hypothesis, which explains this phenomenon by the convection of verticity due to the spin-wise flow. Let's imagine if there is an incoming flow passing through an airfoil at a very high angle of attack, so the flow will roll up behind the airfoil. Roll up behind the airfoil into a vertex. And if there exists an axial flow passing through the core of this vertex, it can convect vorticity to one direction and thus limit the growth of this vertex. So this is the standardized convection hypothesis. And for incyclike flight, they found that the pressure gradient from the wing root to the wing tip motivates this tipward flow. Flow. And this hypothesis shows that this mechanism is Reynolds number dependent. It's very strong at a Reynolds number close to 1000. But still, it's not well defined. For the second hypothesis is the rotational acceleration hypothesis, which is related to the centrifugal and Coriolis accelerations on the wing. Since the leading edge vertex is fixed on the flexible vehicle, Vertex is fixed on the flapping wing. So if we sit on this wing, so we can see the LEV is moving with the wing. So let's move to this corotating frame, then the rotational accelerations, they come into effect. In this hypothesis, the rotational accelerations is argued to motivate the span-wise flow behind the LEV. You can see this figure. So the spin-wise flow is not only located. The span mass flow is not only located within the vertex, but also behind it. And this hypothesis is proposed to explain the generation of span as flow in this region. So as I explained before, this hypothesis may be related to the span-wise convection explained before. And also, this hypothesis found that the effect of rotational accelerations is strong when the S Is strong when the aspect ratio is small. And also, this hypothesis, there are some arguments to this, and it's not well explained due to the relationship between the dynamic force and the vorticity. The third hypothesis is due to the effect of downwash. So, if the wind keeps flapping within a certain angle, it can generate a downwash flow within. Can generate a downwash flow within the span. And this downwash can limit the effective angle of attack seen by the wing. So if the angle of attack is limited, the generation of verticity is also compressed. But this hypothesis is found to be effective at a Reynolds number around 100, not 1,000, is within a limited parameter space. Parameter space. The last hypothesis is so-called vorticity annihilation mechanism. And this mechanism features as the interaction between the LEV and a very thin layer of vorticity beneath it. You can see this figure, the blue one shows the LEV, and there is a very thin layer containing opposite side verticity inside it beneath the LEV. So they can. The LEV so they can interact with each other and to control the growth, the growth of the LEV. But still, this hypothesis is only valid at this Reynolds number and serves as a minor contribution to the mechanisms proposed before. So, to sum up, previous research found that the LEV stability is relevant to Reynolds number aspect ratio and Rossby number. Ratio and Rossby number. And Rossby number is related to the root cutoff of this wing. And also the local LEV stability at a specific spin-wise position may be relevant to revolving radius, which means at different positions along the wing, the LEV stability and dynamics is different. So our research is to find a new way to do a spatial temporal. Do a spatial temporal analysis for the formation, growth, and attachment of the LEV using a universal approach. Here is the key point for this talk, the vorticity dynamics of feeding edge vertex. So, to introduce the setup of this problem, we simplify the insect-like swiping wing to a rectangular plate. To a rectangular plate under a unidirectional revolving motion, the revolving speed is constant for simplicity. And then we transform the inertial frame to a set of rotating Cartesian frames from the black one to the red one. This conversion is due to the revolving nature of the wing and also the flow physics. Flow physics. And then this rotating Cartesian frames is only related to the S-Move angle Î¸ in the flow field, and they are fixed during the V motion. Let's take this point A for an example. The positive radial direction shows from point A to the center of rotation. And the positive tangential direction is tangential and backward to the wing motion. Beam motion. The vertical direction is preserved pointing upward. Then all grid intensors in the inertial frames can be converted to this side of rotating partition frames using the chain rules. Oops. Sorry for this wrong code. And then we convert the vorticity equation into a cold rotating frame. Into a cold rotating frame moving with the wing here. And then let's take the radial component as an example. On the left-hand side of this equation shows the rate of vorticity changes in this direction. And these three terms on the right-hand side of this equation show the convection, accuting, stretching, and diffusion effects. And for sure, we can spread out all these terms. Spread up all these terms, but just keep an eye on this final term in the tilting and stretching, this 2 omega times UR. And this is very important and interesting as a new term in this corotating version equation. We will talk about this later. And to gather the flow data generated by this revolving wing, we did. Did numerical simulations using an in-house over, and we also did some robotic being experiments using the PTV setups. To all of this research is to have the flow data for further analysis. So, we have done lots of experiments and simulations on revolving wings at different Reynolds number, aspect ratio, and Rossby number, but today, Rossby number, but today I'm going to show some very important results based on a benchmark case at Reynolds number of 1500, aspect ratio of 3, and Rossby number at 2.56. First, we're going to compare the vertical structure generated by this wing between the CFD method and the PTV experiments. We can see the formation of LEV, the trading edge vertex, starting vertex, and tip vertex. Vortex, starting vertex, and tip vertex. And all these vertices form a ring shape, like a vertex ring, generated by this ring. Keep an eye on this leading edge vertex. It forms as a conical structure, which means the LUV is weaker near the root, but stronger near the tip. And also, we can separate the LUV into two sub-region. One is the stable LUV region, which is closer to the root. Which is closer to the root within the mid-span, and the other is the unstable or the unsteady LEV region near the tip within the outboard region. Since in this region, we can see a periodical shedding of vertex structures behind the wing. Then we used a set of cylindrical slides to cut through the flow field and then spread them into a Field and then spread them into a plan and do an integral of circulation within the LUB region. The LUB region is outlined by the Q criteria. And we have this plot here. And in this plot, we can see a saturation of circulation once the as the mean revolves up to a certain angle in this region. But also, the strength of circulation keeps The strength of circulation keeps growing from the wing root to the mid-span, shown by this green box. Then let's move to the vorticity dynamics, the evolution of vorticity in this situation. First, I'd like to introduce the CT and C by terms, which means the convection of vorticity components due to tangential and the vertical flow. The vertical flows. Here are the isosurface and the slices at the mid-span for these two terms at the steady state. So let's see this. There is a positive CT region near the leading edge, followed by a negative CT region. Just keep in mind that the radiovorticity inside the LEV is negative. So the positive CT. So, the positive CT means it can remove the radiovorticity component in this region and move them to the negative CT region. So, this plot shows the tangential convection of radiovorticity represents the spreading of LEV into the downstream region. And same here, if we see the CY term, it can further convect the radio vorticity components downward and suppress them to the wing surface. And suppress them to the wing surface. So, this effect resembles the downwash effect proposed before to explain the LEV stability. So, in this figure, using this figure, we find further evidence for this hypothesis. Then, the third term, the CR term, still we have the isosurface and the two slides at the mid-span and the quarter span. Mid-span and the quarter span. Here we can still see a positive region at the rear boundary of the LEV, which can remove the radial vorticity inside the LEV towards the tip. So if we see the, if we look at the isosurface here, this red region is mostly located within the mid-span, which means this radial convection of radial vorticity component is limited within the mid-span. Within the mid-span. Here are the two conclusions. So, this figure shows another evidence for the span-wise convection hypothesis proposed before. To sum up for the convection effect, let's imagine if there is a radiovorticity generated at the leading edge, it is first convected downstream by the CT, shown by the black arrow, and then it is. By the black arrow, and then it is further compressed to the lean surface by the downwash flow, the red arrow, and then it is moved towards the tip by this blue arrow. And then let's move to the tilting and stretching terms. If you can recall, we have this interesting term, 2 omega times u here, and we name it by the planetary vorticity tilting since 2 omega. Vorticity tuting since 2 omega means the planetary vorticity in this corrotating frame. And we do a little mathematical calculation. We can relate the P V T with the Coriolis acceleration. If we do the curl of the Coriolis acceleration, we have the P V T. And if we look into the components, the P V T R is the vertical gradient of tangential Coriolis acceleration, and P V T is the vertical. And PVT is the vertical gradient of radial Coriolis acceleration. There is a mismatch between PVT and the Coriolis acceleration. And then we look at the radial component of PVT, PVTR, how it affect the LEV dynamics. And we show the two omega always pointing upward, and the PVTR can tilt the two omega into the radial direction. The radial direction, but it's pointing to the being root. So the radial vorticity inside LEB all pointing to the tip. Then this means the PVTR can regulate the radio vorticity inside the LEV and thus help to maintain its attachment. Here are some quantitative evidence for PBTR. You can see it is located within the LEV and it is enhanced from the wing route to the mid-side. From the wing root to the mid-span. And this mechanism, the PVTR, contributes to L visibility by removing the radial vorticity, and it is effective at Reynolds number above 100. We further look into the Reynolds number effect on this mechanism, and we found that the contribution of PBTR is almost Reynolds number independent and time invariant. Dependent and time invariant once it is established. Then I'd like to introduce another, oh, sorry, another new mechanism proposed by our group to understand the LEV attachment. We call it the dual-stage radial tangential vertex tuting. So let's look back into the vertical structure generated by this revolving wing, especially inside a stable region. And inside this region, Region. And inside this region, we can see there is a mixture of verticity components in the radial and tangential direction. Since blue color shows the radial component and the red color shows the tangential component, thus the pink region shows the mixture of these two components. So we think if there is some mechanism that can transform the vorticity components in these two directions, And here we do some quantitative analysis of the strengths of these two direction vorticities, and we have an evidence show that the ratio of radial and tangential vorticity within the stable LEV is a constant, shown by this region within the mid-span. And these two components result in a constant ratio. Then let's think if there is any Then let's think if there is any transform between these two components. So we look back to the verticity equation in the radial direction and the tangential direction, especially in the vertex tilting term, the second term, shown by this red block. So the red box on the left shows the tilting of tangential vorticity components into the radial direction. And the right red box shows Red box shows the tilting of radial component back into tangential direction. Then these two terms can build up a conversion of verticity components in these two directions. First, let's see the red one. We name this TR2T since it's tilting from radial to tangential. Because look at this figure, there is a red region. There is a red region within the LEV, and this red region represents that it can shoot the radio vorticity pointing to the wing tip to the backward direction. Then the TR2T can enhance the positive tangential vorticity inside the LEV. And since the radial component of vorticity inside the LEV are negative, then this TR. Negative, then this TR2T is related to an increase of tangential velocity towards the wing tip. And also it's located at the rear boundary of the LUV. Then let's see the left term here. Still, on this figure, inside the LUV, there is a positive TT2R here, which means it can further tilt the It can further tilt the tangential vorticity back into the radial direction, but it is opposite to the existing radial vorticity inside LEV. Then we can show that the TT2R and TR2T can build up a bidirectional transform of radial and tangential vorticity components. And to understand this, I draw a sketch for this. I draw a sketch for this. So, this is a dual stage mechanism. In the first stage, let's see here: left is the wing root, right is being tip. The radial vorticity inside the LEV is negative. It is first tilted backward to the tangential direction, leading to an enhanced tangential vorticity components. And then, in the second stage, these tangential vorticity components is further tilted backward into the Tilted backward into the backward to the radial direction, but it is pointing to the wing root. It's in the opposite direction to the existing radio vorticity components inside the LEV. So this mechanism can regulate the growth of radio vorticity components inside the LEV and help to achieve its stabilization. And this mechanism sounds like a negative feedback loop for the radio voltistic component. The radio vorticity components. Okay, and to sum up, so this kind of research can find two new mechanisms for LV stability, the PVT and the dual stage radio tangential vertex tuting. And also it can relate the Coriolis acceleration with the PVT term, which has not been understood before. And also, as mentioned before, we have done some other research on the effect of Reynolds-Number aspect ratio. Of Reno-Samber aspect ratio and other parameters or wing motions, but due to the time, I cannot show this here. And finally, I'd like to thank my group at Beijing University and also the collaboration with Penn State and Liberty University in the United States. And here are a list of some recent publications of our group on this topic. So you can find more information on this in these publications. Okay. Publications. Okay, that's all. Thank you.
