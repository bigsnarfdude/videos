All right everybody, welcome back. The first talk of the afternoon will be clown service. We'll be speaking of random polygons and spherical confinement. Thank you, Philip. I want to thank the organizers and today is also for me a wonderful reminder how beautiful a landscape looks like if there is snow on the ground. Coming from Kentucky and I have been there for almost 40 years, global warming has had a big effect and I think today I've seen more snow. Effect, and I think today I've seen more snow coming to the ground than I have seen in the last three years in Kentucky combined. Okay, so to get started, this is joint work with Spirana Diao, who is here, and Utah Zigla, who's here. Some of you may know Eric Rabm, and then there are two students there at the bottom. So, what I'm talking about is a model which is very similar to what you have heard about in the first In the first two talks this morning, we are looking at equilateral polygons and they are supposed to be in the scene. So the outline of my talk is I will talk about some background and then some technical things, how we extracted our data, and then I will spend quite some time on the topological properties and the geometric properties. So the motivation of this came from biological experiments. Came from biological experiments on some virus, where essentially the biologists were able to delete the rival capsule and have the ends of the rival DNA, which is in here, sort of stick together. You can think of the ends as sort of like Velcro, and they want to stick together. And then what you see over here is sort of a slide out of a paper by those people about the NOT spectrum they observed. Not spectrum they observe. And the interesting thing is: so, down here, you see the number of crossings, and here you see a percentage. And so, basically, almost 40% of the estimate had crossings between 25 and 30. And those are not crossings in the projection, but those they mean they're actually topologically relevant crossings. Now, of course, these are estimates simply coming from the fact of how fast these things sort of migrate to each other. Things sort of migrate through the gel. So, about our model, we have equilateral polygons. And so, the motivation was that do we know what happens to the NOT spectrum if we have no bias? Obviously, in the prior example of the DNA molecule, we must have some bias because there's volume, there's stiffness and all sorts of other things. And all sorts of other things. And so, the model we want to think about here is this force. So, I call this the true probability. So, think about that: you have a random block, you take one step, you have a vertex, and then you have a sphere of radius one around it where you can go. And so you go to any point there with equal probability. Now, out of those random walks, you only want to keep those which eventually return to the origin. Return to the origin. And then, out of those which return to the origin, you only want to keep those which are confined in the sphere. So that's what I mean by theoretically sort of the two probability. Now, in order to make this happen, we have the same restrictions which Jason and Clay were talking about, that polygons have to be rooted at the center of the confinement sphere. Our generation process is somewhat different because we generate these polygons. Generate these polygons one step at a time using probability density functions. And I don't really want to elaborate on how this actually works. And so when we talk about the true probability, you have to realize this is true probability up to some numerical position. These probability density functions are very complicated integrals, which we evaluate numerically using Mathematica. And of course, there is some rounding error. And so that has to be taken into account. Into account. Alright, so data extraction. This is essentially the machinery which Eric Rayton has set up, and here's how it works. We first determine the home flight polynomial. Eric has a table of the NOT table up to 16 crossings, so not including whatever Ben has added to this. And basically, then it tells him what kind of potential links have that homefly polynomial. Like polynomial. And then we're using a part of Nodscape, which essentially simplifies the diagram. And it simplifies this diagram as much as it can. And then it claims it's minimal, and it results in a Docker code. And basically, in Notscape, there is a Docker code lookup, and you can see what kind of knot this is. And then we want that these two things basically match. And then we claim that the knot is identified. So nothing fancy. So, nothing fancy here about hyperbolic volume or anything like that. Now, we found that this procedure basically works for our purposes very, very well. Now, I will report some results on crossing numbers greater than 16. And so that has to be taken with a grain of salt. So, this not-find simplification program works basically perfectly up to Works basically perfectly up to 16 crossings where we can match it with the HomeFlat polynomial. But there's no reason to believe that it would suddenly no longer work once you have something which would have 17 crossings. And so essentially what you will see whenever I'm talking about more than 16 crossings, this is an upper bound coming from this. And so my feeling or our feeling is that for crossing numbers which were slightly bigger than 16, this should still be very, very accurate. And of course, Be very, very accurate. And of course, the larger the crossing number is, the less accurate this will be. And sometimes this failed for a very small number of oligons, and essentially we just dropped those out. For most of them, where it failed, they were complicated things, but they were not statistically significant. Okay, our sample space. Well, we are looking at polygons of lengths 10. We are looking at polygons of lengths 10, 20, 30, up to 90. Confinement radii, the smallest we can look at is 1, then 1.1, 1.2, all the way up to 2, and then these group of larger ones. And for each case, we generated somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000 polygons. So either 10,000 or 100,000. Not billions, but if you add all of those up, at least there's a circle of millions. And so here it gives you a feeling. Here it gives you a feeling of how things look. So, the top three guys are of length 90, and this is length 90 polygon in a sphere of radius one. And not very surprising, we cannot identify what that is. Here, this is in a sphere of radius two. It looks a lot more spread out. This is the not 5.1. You just take my word for it. Here you see 5.2. And below, you have lengths 50. There's the unknot. This here is negative 6, 1, so I just want to say something to this negative sign. So essentially, if there is a positive rise in the diagram, we call this the plus 1. If there's a negative rise in the standard diagram, we call this the negative 1. So we distinguish the chiral pairs. And here for 50, in this particular This particular ball of radius one, we still cannot identify what that is. And so, when you see in the data, you will see that basically we will not display any information for the really tight radii for the polygons of lengths 70, 80, and 90. And the reason is that basically the percentage of things we don't know what they are is so large that what we do is no longer meaningful. So, does that mean? So, is that because the simplification process just doesn't simplify the grade? No, no, it will simplify. I will report on that in just a second. But in terms of the not type, you cannot identify what it is. Okay? So, here you see curves, and what you see down here on the radio, down on the bottom, that's the radius. And this is what we call the topological crossing number. Where you have got to keep in mind, up to 16, that's real, and above 16, And above 16, this is essentially only estimates. And you have curves, so the black one is obviously lengths 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90. And you can see that they stop at radius 1.5. We didn't do the smaller ones. And there are several reasons for this. One of them is basically when you think about how far this would shoot up, this simplification process becomes less or less reliable. So we don't really want to report. Reliable, so we don't really want to report that that's a real topological crossing number. The other thing you can see here is if you would go, let's say, to 20, as Ben told us, the current knot table looks like, you still couldn't tell what these things up here are. And it's important to note that this includes the unknowns. Yes. How do those curves decay? You know how they, what the power law exponentially suppressed. Well, I'll come to that. I apologize there. No, no. I'll come to that. I apologize there. No, no, no, no. I was going to say that at the end, but the point is, I will not present you with any proofs of any kind. I will present you with some conjectures, but we don't know how to prove any such thing. Okay, so this is our best fit formula for what we think the topological crossing number might look like, dependent on the radius and dependent on. And dependent on the lengths. And this is sort of a 3D plot where the radius is right here and the length is up there, and this is the topological Crossing number. This R squared is not that R squared, that's the R squared module of the fit. And there is actually, this is the mean distance between the black points and the surface. It is there, in fact. I'm not claiming this absolutely right on. Now, the thing you should think about here is that essentially what this says. Is that essentially what this says is that the topological process number grows as L squared when you have this scenario in confinement. I'll come back to that when we talk about the average crossing number. That also grows for obvious reasons as L squared. And that's very different than, as we heard this morning, on the average crossing number in unconfined things, which was L bar L. L. And then what you see here basically when the radius becomes smaller, then essentially this sort of makes this L square term even stronger. And this thing here at the end, this is just what we needed to make it fitting. I don't have any particular attachment to those buttons. Okay, so what do we see here? This is the unknots. Again, black. Again, black is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, all the way down to 90. And you can see that they are virtually extinct at radius 1.5 for these larger lengths. And yes, I would expect that that also be exponentially. I mean, if it is like that in the unconfined space, it certainly ought to be that in the confined space, but how much faster I don't really know. Okay, now I'm going to talk about. Now, I'm going to talk about individual NOT types, and these graphs are very confusing. So, I want you guys to concentrate on a particular curve. So, let's say you're going to pick this blue curve, you see it going up, and then you see it going down. So, what is this blue curve? Well, this is 50 edges. And we are counting out of a sample of 10,000 in this particular range, we're counting how many knots we see of crossing number six. We see of crossing number six. And so you see that it goes up and then it goes down. Now, when I, for example, look at length 20, I only see it going down. Now, our conjecture would be that you would have data of the radius less than one, it would also start to go down. And I'll explain a little bit more about this here in just a second. And here, this is crossing number fifteen. This is crossing number 15. And if you look very carefully, you can still see this going up and going down phenomena. Okay, wait a minute. Okay, this is just an example if you look at something fairly exotic. So this is a connected sum of three trephoids. This is 20 steps. And we see these things. And this don't And don't put too much attention to the shape of these curves. They're rare, but they're there. That's really all what I want to show with this particular slide. So now let's talk a little bit about the theory. And so I want you to look at this graph right here. And let me sort of explain this. So we are keeping the radius of confinement fixed. Keeping the radius of confinement fixed, and we are varying the lengths. And thus, pk is the probability that we see a nut type k. So clearly, as we heard from Clay, there's something called the stick number. So till we reach that stick number valve, we see nothing, unless L0. So then the probability you see something when you have very few sticks is very low. Sticks is very low, and then sort of it increases, reaches a peak, and then it decreases. And our guess would be it decreases exponentially fast. And so, why does it decrease? Well, because as the length increases, the knots become more and more complicated than this guy. And so this guy is dying out. Over here, we have a similar picture. Now we are varying the radius, and we're keeping the lengths. And we're keeping the lengths fixed. So if you think about unconfined polygons of lengths L, then any nut type you can form will have a non-zero probability. So this is what this dashed line is. And this U, this is the unconfined, basically, probability that we see this particular guy. And then as the radius increases, this becomes more likely till it reaches a peak. Till it reaches a peak, and then the knot complexity, this decreasing radius, starts to exceed the knot complexity of this guy, and it sort of dies down. Right here, this is a proposed fitting function of the not probability to find the not k depending on l and r. And this term over here, that's essentially the exponential decay as the length increases. Okay? And this r minus 0.6. R minus 0.6, well, in our model, R minus 0.5 would asymptotically blow up, and theoretically, you could have equilateral polygons in a radius slightly bigger than 0.5. At 0.5, you're just bouncing between two poles, so it doesn't make any sense. And so, we don't have any good reasons for these terms here, except that they sort of work. Roughly. And so. And so, what do we see here? This is for the trefoil. This surface here, this orange surface, is what you get from this model. And this is the surface and our data points. So, the blue are sort of above, the black are below, and this is photo 052. It's not perfect by any means, it might get better. Perfect by any means. It might get better if you have much larger samples, but it's not a bad fit either. All right. Okay. Then I want to look a little bit at the behavior of composite nut types. Okay, and so you see here two pictures. So let's look at this one first. This is the radius. And what we have listed here is. And what we have listed here is the NOT 61, 6,2,63, and the composite of trepholes, where we didn't distinguish here between Mr. Granny or plus or minus trephos. Doesn't matter, just two tread force. And so what stands out here? Well, first of all, if you look at the prime dots, you see that 6,2 is more likely than 6.1, and 6.1 is more likely than 6,3. This is something which also has been observed. This is something which also has been observed for unconfined models of all kinds. And the explanation most commonly given is: well, the 63 is a chiral, and so i chiral things is sort of less likely. And then the composite guy here is in the middle. So the same picture as you see here, we see over here. And so, what have we done? We have taken this data and converted it to a relative frequency. To a relative frequency, such that when you take like 2.0, you would add this value, this value, and this value, and this value would get 1. Okay, so across a vertical line, they always add up to 1. And so the most significant uptake from this picture is you see the relative decline of the composite. Composite goes down, and the other three guys sort of retain the same order. If you wonder about these bars, these are sort of These bars, these are sort of estimates of what error estimates. Clearly, since we have relatively few nuts for these large radii, they are large, and then as the radii becomes smaller, the error brush go down. We have not attached the error brush to everything because let me just clutter up this picture. Okay, so the message I want you to keep in mind is the composites go down as the radius declines. Declines. This is the same picture, same picture versus lengths. You see essentially that the prime dots are in the same order and the composites, there are lots of composites. This is for radius 3. For a smaller radius, the composites would be depressed. And this is the product fraction. So let's come to some conjectures. So, for unconfined, what's the situation as the lengths go to infinity? Unknots vanish, composites take over, alternating prime and non-alternating prime vanish. Here you see some sort of data. This is for radius three, a hundred thousand polygons. The orange is the unknot. This is the prime alternating non-prime prime non-alternating composite. Prime non-alternating composite, and these ones are the unknowns. When you look at the actual numbers, you can see that the prime alternating guys start to come down. So for the confined space, our conjecture would be as follows. Again, we see no unnots, no surprising. And then we claim that the probability to see non-alternating primes goes to one. And that is basically based. Is basically based on the following idea. So, suppose you have a composite knot somewhere, and here are the edges. Well, what will happen as the length becomes longer and longer, you will eventually pierce it. And you will pierce it many, many times, and so this factor basically will disappear. And then that essentially the alternating primes disappear, you can simply Disappear, we can simply argue along the lines that when you look at very, very complex knots, the percentage of alternating climbs was zero. And so eventually you will see non-alternating climbs. Here you have the same picture versus the radius. And this is the same as you saw before. This is our sample. There's the action frequencies. I want to talk a little bit about this. Bit about this. This looks the same as you saw before. The only difference is we have squiggles instead of equal signs. And why is that? Well, because really it depends on what this length is. So if you just think the length is six, well, we learned this morning what we're going to see. The only thing we can see are unnods and the trephoids, which are alternating prime. And so clearly, this statement cannot be. And so, clearly, this statement cannot be true. Furthermore, if you basically would fix relatively short lengths, and in two talks from now we'll see some guesses of this, then it's still possible that you will have composite nuts, but a relatively small number. So, this would only be true if L is really relatively large. Okay. Here's some more evidence Some more evidence about the composite knots. So, here we listed how many knots of each crossing number we found. And over here, these are the composites. And the only thing I really want you to see is as the complexity goes up, the percentage of things which are composite goes down. And this is over all radii, all lengths. This is not distinguishing anything. Here we have some things about alternate. Things about alternating versus non-alternating. And so I just want to pick out one line and tell you what it says. So if you pick 12 crossings, that's the number of alternating knots. That's the number of non-alternating knots. So 59% or almost 60% of the knots are alternating. But in our sample, only twenty percent of the what we found are alternating. And the quotient is basically roughly is zero point three five. Is 0.35. And so for 16 crossing knots, 27% of those knots are alternating. We found only 3.1% in our sample, which are alternating. So this quote goes down. And so this is again lending support to that non-alternating knots, essentially. That alternating knots die out. I will skip this in terms of time. I want to sort of I want to sort of look at this for a little longer. So, what do we see? These are all eight crossing knots, including the composites. And this is the observed frequency. And there are a couple things which sort of stand out. So, the first one is I want you to look at those three. And if you look at these three numbers, these are the three non-alternating knots. They are larger than all the numbers you get for alternating knots. Alternating modes. These are the composites. The underlined ones, those are fully amphicural, and you see that among all the alternating knots, those three numbers are almost not quite the lowest, but they're among the lowest. I want you to pay particular attention to this 818. So there are only 47. What is this guy? This A18 is. This A18 is based on a conway-basic polyhedra. And this is essentially this polyhedra. This is a four-regular graph. And for those of you who are not familiar with this, you can simply turn this into an alternating diagram by making each of these nodes a crossing. And then what you observe, this diagram, this projection has no digons and there are no flies. Okay, and so this is basically. Okay, and so this is basically only showing up 47 times. Now, if I would look at the same stuff for nine crossings, 940 is disguised. And it only appears eight times, which is also the lowest frequency observed for this knot. And for 10123, this is this guy, we didn't see it at all. And so this is the only 10 crossing knot which we didn't see at all. Those frequencies look similar if you do completely unconstrained if you look at completely unconstrained polygons, you get similar frequencies. I'm not aware of anybody, or I have not seen, studies of unconfined things which have lots of this complexity. Jason or Clay, have you done anything like that? Yeah, so I don't have any data to compare this, but it's going to be very hard to get those samples. It's going to be very hard to get those samples. Okay, so that's can I ask about the 4.1 connects out 4.1? Yep. That's significantly lower than the power. Yes, and we would attribute this that 4.1 is a power. The other guys are not. Why is 818 so rare? Well, that is an interesting question. I have looked at this and I have looked at this in various ways. So, if you, for example, would look at the number of minimal diagrams that you can form, which give you this knot, this is the only one. For most of these other knots, you can have many more diagrams than for this one. So, for whatever reason, they're very hard to form. But that's really all I can. Okay, but that's really all I can tell you. I think you would make that same experience if you take a rope and you might actually tie this thing. So I don't have any good insight or explanation. All right, so this is what I wanted to tell you about the topological properties. We did not compute things like the genus or the Alexander prolonged or anything like that. We just concentrated on not types of processing. So I want to move it. So, I want to move it to geometric properties and see how much time I have. So, the first thing is for unconfined polygons, what do we know? We know that the curvature is given by this and the torsion is given by that. That's a result, I think, of Brassberg's. And so, the way you should think about this is that if you have a random walk, then of course the average curvature is pi over 2L. And this 3π over 8 is sort of a This 3π over 8 is sort of a penalty you have to pay in extra curvature for closing it up. And this is an asymptotic result, and this is sort of an error term. And for torsion, it's a very similar story, except the penalty now affects it negatively. Okay, so let's look at our results. So, obviously, in a confined space, curvature got to be increasing. And so, the formula we came up with, which was basically models. Came up, which was basically modeled on the previous bobbler. We added an extra term, A of R. And this A of R in a radius of 1 is about 0.57 radians per turn. Radius 2 is about 0.2 radians per turn. And so this is the increase in curvature. Now, that makes perfect sense. Confinement increases curvature. Now here, torsion. Now here, torsion is decreased, which is a lot harder to understand. Why does torsion decrease when you have a confined sphere? And this B term is basically given here, and you can see this sort of fits very well. I don't want to spend any more time on this. I want to talk about curvature versus not types. And so the first thing you see is the curvature is relatively. See, here is the curvature is relatively large, and you will not see any difference of curvature from nodding differences when you display the full curvature. So, what do we have to do? And what we do is we look at the difference of a curvature of not specific crossing number minus the average over all polygons of the same length and radius of confinement. So, that's what this delta stands for. What does delta stand for? And then we divide it by L, so it's a curvature difference per edge, and that allows us to compare polygons of different lengths. I will explain this picture down here in just a second. I first want you to see some data. And this is up to 10 crossings. And so I just want you to concentrate on the curve for 4. And so what you see here, it goes down, crosses the x-axis, which means it has the same curvature right here. It has the same curvature right here as the average of all polygons. And then it's below, and then it comes back up. So it crosses this axis twice. And we would propose that these things eventually come back up as well, but for the lengths we have here, you don't see this very clearly. So let me try to explain what we now believe goes on. So here is sort of a schematic picture. Fiction. So elevated means the crossing number of what you're observing is above the average. Depressed, it means it's below the average. Now, initially, for short lengths, if you have a knot, then you have to pay a penalty. There will be larger curvature needed to tie this knot. Now, when the length goes up, the average will be more complicated. So, eventually, you reach a point of equilibrium where your curvature Equilibrium, where your curvature is sort of the same as the curvature of the average, and the way we want to think of it, the topological complexity of what you have is basically the same as the average. And then this gap widens. Why? Because the average basically of the polygons becomes more and more complex. Now the thing which took us as surprise was that then why would this suddenly gonna go back up? Suddenly, gonna go back up and eventually have more curvature than the average. And so, our explanation is roughly sort of as false. So, in this tail end here, these knots become very rare, so exponentially rare, according to what we believe is true. And so, to form a very simple knot with a lot of edges requires some sort of special structure on the edges. Maybe they have to just zigzag back and forth. And so that. Back and forth, and so that flexible structure creates more curvature on the average, and this is why this happens. Now, you can say, well, this is a pretty small module. This is sort of really not really good evidence. But we sort of see the same thing. We see the same thing when we look at the radius. And so, what I want you to point out here: if we find, so this is versus the radius, and if I concentrate again on the 4, Concentrate again on the four, I can clearly see it dips down and then comes back up. So it crosses twice. And even for these larger crossing numbers, you see them going down, and here they're coming up. They're not all going to the positive thing. That's because you don't have anything on the radius less than one. And that's length equals 30. You know, we have similar pictures for other lengths. And so the evidence of what I just described to you is stronger than. Described to you is stronger than just saying this is for an example. GC that over a large range of lengths and confinement break. And so again, in a get through my talk, I will skip this, but the model here is very similar. Okay? All right. I don't want to spend much time on torsion. The only thing I want to say here is as follows: that, so this is the unknot. This is three. This is three, four, and five, six crossing numbers. They're nicely ordered. Here you see the larger crossing numbers. And so not only does confinement decrease torsion, lot complexity does as well. Now, I would really love to hear an intuitive argument which sort of explains that to me. I don't have one. So why does torsion decline when you're not? Torsion declines more if you're not more complicated. More, if you're not more complicated. We don't see anywhere here that these things cross the axis more than once. Okay, so we don't have that same behavior as we see for curvature. Yeah, this is the same picture for versus the radius, and again, they're perfectly ordered according to bus mechanics. Okay, average crossing number. So, this is the So, this is the average crossing number. Here's our fitting formula. And it's basically comprised of two terms. The first one is an L squared term, which essentially says, well, in confinement, the average crossing number goes up as the length squared. And that sort of makes some sense because if you have already n segments and you introduce a new one, it could cross every one of those segments once. And so it gives you an n squared term. And this term over here. term and this term over here this essentially is the L the lengths which we saw before so if the radius is very small very large this goes away these sort of more or less go away and you see constant times this term which we know is true for unconfined polygons and you see the fit is very very good this slide shows you the average crossing number for lengths 30 and Crossing number for length 30. It's again a delta. So it is the difference between the average of all versus the particular crossing number we observed. And the only thing I really want to say is they're sort of nicely ordered according to crossing number. All right. I'll just look at this. I'll just look at this picture just for a second. So, the thing is, what maybe stands out here a little bit is that the alternating prime nuts seem to have a slightly higher ACN than the non-alternating composites. Okay. I want to talk a little bit about RISE because that again is quite interesting. So, the first thing. The first thing you should see is for the phantom, well, we better observe that the average rise is zero. Okay, so then what you see here, these are all sort of chiral knots. 4, 1 you don't see because it's covered up here, the rise of 4, 1 is also 0. And the rise of the unknot is in this line 2, it's also 0. So this is versus the radius, this is versus the length, and we sort of see the same thing. Of see the same thing. And so the interesting thing is that roughly for each of those nut types, the rise looks constant. Well, same here, looks constant. And that, of course, has been observed before in the unconfined scenario. And here, we look at the average value for length 30 and radius 3. We have computed the average of everything we see of the rise. And this here, And this here are numbers which come from these papers down here. Basically, Jason and his group have rope lengths minimized these knots. And out of the rope lengths minimized configuration, they computed the rise. Biologist Stasiak termed the term ideal knots for this. And so this is called the rise of the ideal knot. And you can see these numbers match very, very nicely. Very, very nicely. So, for the mean ride, it's independent of length, independent of confinement, and it's roughly equal to the mean of the ideal configuration. All right. Last thing I want to talk about is the rise squared. Okay? And here it's versus the radius, here's versus the lengths. Here's versus the lengths, and what do we essentially see that it fits very nicely a quadratic function? Okay, so the rise squared behaves essentially like a quadratic polynomial. Now, the interesting thing is here on this slide, so if we look at the rise square for a nut type, then you see this grows linear. Linear. Here's the thing versus the radius, and we claim it grows like basically a constant plus a constant divided by r. So you may say, well, should this be r or r squared? It's very difficult to distinguish this, but we also created plots of this where we used one over r instead of r. And then you can see sort of lines up indeed. So I just want to concentrate on this one here. Concentrate on this one here. So, how would you explain that this grows linearly, but here it grows quadratically. Well, there are two explanations I want to give. The first one is the mix of knots which you see here changes. Right? And so, basically, what this will be, it will have more and more complex knots. And so, what that means. Knots. And so, what that means on this, that essentially, if you fix a knot like this one here, that essentially dies out and it doesn't contribute much, and it gets replaced with something which has larger eyes. And so that is not an immediate contradiction. However, you could still wonder: why does it grow linearly? So, if you think about this, at length 90, if you look at one of those small knots, If you look at one of those small knots, the average crossing number was in the range of two to three hundred, right? And to form this knot, only a few crossings are needed. And so, why do all these other crossings not contribute more than sort of something linear? And in order to answer this question, we looked at the standard deviation. And so, what you see here, this is the 5.2 knot, positive. 5.2 knot, positive 1, radius 1.3. And we looked at the rice distribution. The first thing is that it's approximately normal distributed. And then here you see lengths 20, lengths 30, and lengths 40. And so what you see is that the shape of this changes. And so you can ask what is the standard deviation of this distribution. And so this is what you see here for. Is what you see here for the unknot, the positive trifold, and for one. And roughly, these standard deviations behave like a square root function, while the phantom sort of is linear. Okay, and so essentially, if you now think about that, the behavior you would get would be like the standard deviation squared in order, then this would be a quadratic, and these things would be different. All right, so I want to sort of conclude this by just sort of being normally distributed is like the kind of thing you see in a diagrammatic model because you could bunch of crossings, right? But you don't usually see it in a space model because maybe those are far away and it's a big change in crossing difference. So like is this because you're in tight confinement? Like it's just as likely for things to be a little in front as a little behind? Like they're all pretty close? Or that's what I would say, yes. Yes, I don't have any additionality decay as the radius goes up. Does it get less normal as the radius goes up? The problem is we don't have enough data. See, when the radius gets up, we still You see, when the radius gets up, these things become sort of rare and the error margins get very large. So I cannot answer that question. So, the open questions, is there anything we can actually prove? Well, maybe some of you can. I have not been able to. An interesting question is: what happens for the radii less than one? And our model doesn't give any insight into this, except we can speculate. That. You would love, as Clay mentioned, to eliminate that rooted condition, but our step-by-step generation works because we exploit the symmetry of having to return versus the radius, right? And so once you remove this, then you don't have that symmetry and this whole generation process falls apart. And what I told you initially that I was motivated by these experiments, the molecular Experiments the molecular biologists have done. And of course, our model can serve as a benchmark of what you might see if there is no bias of any form. But the most immediate things which come to your mind of the bias which you have, well, for physically relevant things, the polygons are thick. You have volume. And here we have no volume. And the second thing is that DNA is stiff. And in this And in this confined thing, this really plays a role. If you have unconfined large polygons, then this model is pretty good. But here, you would like to make polygons stiff. And there, again, we don't know any way of how to do this in a mathematically, really, really clean way. You know, we have played around with this, but we don't have any results. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any more questions? So you have this nice parabola picture, which I think is quite convincing. If you flip back a few slides back, this is a good one. So, you have a bit of data over there on the right-hand side, like you have some samples become more or less. Can you actually say that you could rip out one of those samples and look at it? Can you actually see the ordered, more ordered behaviour and confirmation? I think we have never tried that. But if you remember the pictures I showed visually identifying anything, it's yeah, so I could now. Yeah, so I could know. Would be interesting, yeah. Maybe contact matrices or something might show you when things line up sequentially or something like that. It's a hack. Yeah, actually, that's a good idea. It's really hard to get data in there. This is a hard problem. The next stop is that uh eating out perhaps
