And then you look at like the front of your phone, really like this with this and you put on some of the people. Okay, everyone. The last talk of this point session is by Neil Jimines. He'll talk about bounds of vehicle in these zero geometric stability. Thanks, Sergei. Thank you, the organizer, for making this happen and inviting me. So, yeah, that's the title of my talk, and this is joint with James Pedag and Rahim Moussa. Okay, so I guess this is a neostability workshop, and there's going to be a lot of stability, right? Basically, I'm going to tell you things that are true, but like the model theory of the CF0, and then we'll just do stability together here, right? So, you actually don't need Theorem, right? So, you actually don't need to know anything about the CSU, almost. Okay, so for now, we're going to work in a super stable theory, we're going to work in some monster model U. Okay, so here's the first definition that we're going to look at. So, fix a type P over some parameter A, some A definable set X. We say that P is weakly approximate to X if for any A satisfying P, it is independent. P, it is independent of RA for any finite topo from X. Okay, and we say it's orthogonal if this is true for any non-flocking extension of the type. Kind of a general stability definition. And then there's the same thing for types. So two types P and Q over A are weakly orthogonal if for any A satisfying P and B satisfying Q and B are independent over A. Okay, and we denote this with the Okay, and we denote this with this little perpendicular thing with a little w per week. Okay, and then if I pick two stationary types over maybe different set of parameters A and B, they are orthogonal if for any C containing both A and B, the non-forking extensions P to C and Q to C are weakly orthogonal, and we denote this by P perpetua. General stability. General stability theory. Okay, so of course, you know, if two types are weakly orthogonal, it doesn't mean that they are orthogonal, right? But so, like, one direction work, if two types are orthogonal about the same parameters, then they are weakly orthogonal, surely, but the converse is false. But we have something almost as good. So the first fact is that if P over A is stationary and non-orthogonal to X, And non-orthogonal to x, then there is d such that p to the d, the moly power, is not routinely orthogonal to x. Okay, so if you're not orthogonal, then some moly power is not routinely orthogonal. Okay, and the question is, can we bound t? Can we actually find a bound for that t? So, I mean, the proof, right, the general stability theory proof of this, it's not, you know, doesn't give you a bound. Okay, so an important. Okay, so an important, maybe the first result in that direction is the following theorem by Rushovsky. If p over A is stationary, regular, and non-orthogonal to x, then the moly power of e to the 4 is not rupture orthogonal to x. Okay? But of course, I mean, the regularity assumption is very restrictive, and in particular, because I'm going to focus on finite rank. This would mean minimum. So, what we're going to do is working But what we're going to do is, working in finite rank DCF0, we will remove the regularity assumption and then we get an optimal bound in terms of Europe. Okay, now for types, what we have is that if P and Q over A are not orthogonal to stationary type, the same sort of behavior happens. There are N and M such that the nth molecules of P is not weakly orthogonal to the nth molepool. not quickly orthogonal to the nth Modic power of Q. Okay, so again, same question, like can we round n? So I'm not aware of any results in the literature when people do this, but maybe that's just me. In any case, we will again provide an optimal bound in terms of Eurank for finite rank times in the CL3. Isn't one n equals one and then the other one is the one that you remember or And the other one is the one that you remove? But I thought, isn't it from the canonical base of one organization over the other and the additional variables? Not sure I understand the question. So if you relate this to the previous case, isn't it really the case? If you take x to be q, that's basically m equals infinity. Yeah, it's m equals omega, then this is the previous case, basically. So you need an arbitrarily long molecular sequence on one side, and then this is back to the other. And then this is back to the previous slide. These two things are related. But not in a necessarily obvious way, right? But I mean, yeah, it's the case that basically what we're going to do is we're going to prove something like that for DCF0, and then we're going to deduce the other case. Does that satisfy you, Anada? All right. Okay. Alright, okay. Yeah? You got satisfaction. Alright, good, good. Okay, so one of the key ideas, and this is really coming from work of Jim and Rahim, is to connect with weak orthogonality and definable group action. Okay, so here's the definition of internality and almost internality. So pick a type B, pick a type P over B stationary. That P over B stationary and X an A type definable set, B containing A, we say that P is X internal, almost X internal. There are some extra parameters C, summarization of P, non-forking extension to C, and then a finite number of realization of X such that A is in the definable closure of C along with the CK. If I replace this by ACL, I get almost internal. I get almost internal. Right, so basically, you're in the algebraic closure of x, but you need new parameters to do it, is the idea. Okay, now a classic theorem of geometric stability is that if we have this configuration, right, so like P over P, that is X internal, then the group action of B of P over X, which is the restriction to realization of P, a photomorphism of the monster model that fixes. Of the monster model that fix B union X of U pointwise, that's P type definable. So just think of this as automorism groups of the type P, but fixing B and X. So this becomes type definable under these assumptions of internality. Okay, now for the rest of the talk, I'm going to work in even more restrictive context, which is Toddweight Transcendental. Which is totally transcendental. It's really, really stable things. Okay, so now if I take a mp that's x internal but also x weakly orthogonal, then this automorphism group p over x is definable actually by, because we're totally transcendental, and by weak orthogonality it acts transitively on the realizations of p. Okay, that means that I p is isolated and the final. That the type is isolated and definable. Okay, so we actually have a definable group action in that context, and that's going to matter for the next definition, which concerns definable group action. So if I have a definable group action, G, of finite Molyran, it is K generically transitive if there is an orbit in Sk, right, of the diagonal action. So Jim talked about this earlier, the pointwise action, such that the Mollier rank of Sk. Such that the Mohi rank of Sk minus that orbit is strictly less than the Mohi rank of Sk. Okay, so it's not exactly K-transitive, but it has a very, very big orbit. Jim did a wonderful picture of this earlier. I'm not going to. It was pretty, I loved it. Okay. Now, the fact is that if phi to the K is weakly orthogonal to X and X internal, then this automorization group acts generally. Automation book at generically K transitivity. Okay. So of course now we're thinking, okay, maybe we can bound that degree of generic transitivity. Okay, Jim ruined my question here. So the conjecture from Gorvik-Cherlin is that if G and S is a connected, definable, homogeneous space with the model rank of S n strictly greater than zero, if G acts generically n plus two transitively, generically n plus 2 transitively, then Gs is isomorphic to PGLN plus 1 of F acting on Pn of F for some algebraically closed field F. Okay, so this connects to what Jim was saying by the following corollary with the same assumption that means that this action cannot be generically n plus 3 transitive. So quick proof of this, if it was generically n plus 3 transitive, then by this conjecture it would be also generically n plus 2 transitive, then it would be. generically n plus 2 transitive, then it would be this PGLN plus 1 PFF acting on PFF, but that's not n plus 3 generically transitive. That's the core. So basically this is like the strong Borvik Charlie conjecture in short. Okay, now the theorem of Jim and Rahim is that the Borvik-Charling conjecture is true for ACLC. Okay, and I'm going to use that later in the talk. This is kind of one of the key ingredients in the proof. Okay. Okay, so the bad news is we tried to prove Law Victorian for DCF0 and we couldn't do it. But what we could do is we replace Molyrang by differential dimension. There was a dimension in DCF0. That's just a differential dimension. I'm not going to talk too much about this, but there is one. And you can just state the same conjecture for that dimension, right? You have genericity and everything. And then it works. So the geometry. Okay, so the geometric for Victorian convex job is true for this zero. Okay, not going to go into too many details about that. But the corollary in this yet zero is that if I have p in s of a, where a is algebraically closed and p is of dimension d, if p is non-orthogonal to some a definable set x, then the molecular p to the d plus 3 is not weakly orthogonal to x. So this gives us our first result, right? We have First result, right? We had a type P that's not of the normal subject-definable set, and then we found a bound on this molecule where it would be optimal. This is kind of the first result that we get of that type. And this is really a quick collary of this, so I'm just going to sketch the proof. So here's the sketch, right? So by non-orthogonality and general stability theory, we get an indefinable function f from P to some other type Q, and Q is To some other type q, and q is x internal. That means that we can assume that p is also x internal because if q to the d plus 3 is not quite orthogonal to x, then so is p. Okay, so we can just assume that p is x internal. Okay, but then the binding group cannot act d plus 3 generically transitively, so by what I said on the previous slide, p d plus 3 cannot be weekly of topic or 2x, so it has to be non-whekly of the To x, so it has to be normally optimal to x, which is the colour. Okay. Now, so I'm going to leave that behind for a little while, and now I'm going to focus on types instead of types and tidy tangles. Right, so now we switch to the other question. So, pick some p and q in s of a in d C L 0 and assume that. A in DCF0 and assume that P is non-orthogonal to Q, then for some N and M, we have P to the M is not orthogonal to Q to the M, and we want to bound these numbers. So that's the second question. It should be algebraically closed to get this stationary. Or I'll try that. Okay, so here's the theorem. I'm just going to state it, and then I'm going to spend the rest. State it, and then I'm going to spend the rest of this talk proving it. So, let P and Q be an S of A with A algebraically closed, types in DCF0, of rank n and m. If they are non-orthogonal, then p to the n plus 3 is not weakly orthogonal to q to the n plus 3. Okay, so we have a bound in terms of the rank. All right, so most of the rest of the talk, I will just prove this. And yeah, so I mean, the proof is sort of like general stability theory and Sort of like general stability theory, and you just need to know a lot about stability and the model theory of DCSU. But it's really just stability. And the key difficulty is really in the profile, really witnessing forking over A, not over some larger set of parameters, and also witnessing forking using MOLI sequences, not just some arbitrary sequence optimalization. So these are like the two key difficulties. So, you know, if at any point you think, oh, you know, the proof should be done now, just might be because I'm not going to be able to do that. Should be done now. Just might be because I'm trying to avoid this state. Alright, so let's get to it. So, alright, so now I'm going to say just a little bit more about DCF0. So, DCF0 differential equals fields of characteristic zero. The language is just a language of fields with a derivation. That's totally transcendental. It has a lot of good stuff, you know, elimination of imaginaries, emulation of quantifiers, all of that. All of that. Okay, very important to us is the set of constants. So these are just the elements on which the derivation is zero. And we need to know that the induce structure on C is that of a pure algebraically closed flow. Okay, so the derivation doesn't do anything, since it's zero. Okay, and we also will need to know Silver Strichonomy for DCI0. So I'm going to state it now. I'll state it again later when I'll need it. So let give you a minimum time. It so let P a minimal type. There are three mutually exclusive possibilities. So if P is non-locally modular, then it is non-orthogonal to the field of constants E. So that's the first possibility. Basically, up to non-orthogonality, the constants are the only non-locally modular type. Okay, if P is locally modular, If P is locally modular and has a non-trivial geometry, then it is non-orthogonal to the generic type of a simple manner kernel. If you don't know what manner kernels are, it's okay. You don't need to for the story, so don't worry. I'm serious, I'm just going to state properties, and that's all you need to know. Okay. If P is locally modular, trivial, then okay, nothing more can be said, but you know, locally modular, trivial, these are like really sort of easy types to understand. Well. Easy types to understand. Well, I shouldn't say that. For this proof, they're going to be the nice case. Yeah, trigger types in this year are actually very, very difficult. Okay, now, if P and Q are minimal, you can imagine that we have some results bounding this M and M, witnessing the non-whical polygonality, and we want to reduce to the minimal case as much as we can. That's kind of the classic idea in geometry experiments. Reduced to the minimum. How do we do this? Okay, now I'm back in a totally transcendental theory. This will work in any of your favorite totally transcendental theories. So let's do it. So pick a stationary type over A. A vibration f from P to F of P is an a definable function with stationary fibers, and I call it proper if the re-rank of P is. if the Eurank of T is strictly bigger than the Eurank of this should be F of sorry should be F of P here strictly bigger than the Eurank of F of T strictly bigger than zero okay and I say that P has no proper vibration if no such exists okay and you can you know as an exercise you can see that this is the same as the definition that Tim gave earlier to just be more convenient for me to use this one okay so if A is a realization So if A is a realization of P, and then we have a vibration f from P to F of P, then this is just a notation. P index F of A is just the type of A over F of A. This is a complete type, there's no problem here, and it is stationary because of the definition. There is a big A missing. Sorry? There is a big A missing? A big A missing? Well Yes, yes, thanks. Yeah, there's a big A missing. You're right. Yeah yeah, of course. There's a big emission here, of course. Of course, we also have to think about it. Thanks. Okay, now here's the lemma. That's due to Rahim and Anan, but yeah, as Jim said, probably disappeared earlier. This is kind of a not so hard lemma. So if we take some type of L that has no proper vibration, then either it is almost internal to a non-locally modular minimal type, or there is a locally modular minimal type R over the same set. Type R over the same set of parameters, okay, that's kind of perfect, such that P is inter-algebraic with R to the N for some. Professor that it is over the same parameters, and maybe you can see where I'm going with this. In DCA0, we also know that if it's a non-equally modular minimum type, it's the constants. So, we also get the same parameters. That's kind of one of the key points. Yeah, it might. I mean, you know, I was just being very careful with my context so that no one gets mad, but no, no, the other one, right? So you can't, I guess you can't remember. But thanks, you're right. I think that this time in their papers, Poma stated general stable case. Yeah, it's assumption. So I don't know. I looked at the abstract and I think that key is finite point. Yeah, right, they do say finite point. Okay, so finite fuel rank maybe should be pretty simple. Yeah, it's possible that you need to assume that, yeah, it might be right. Okay. So, in any case, I'm going to apply it in this year to you. So, fine. Okay. So, here's a lemma that's quite straightforward. Every stationary type P over A has a maximum. Over A has a maximal sequence of proper vibration, and by that I mean a sequence of stationary type P equals P0 to P1, blah blah blah to Pn vibrations such that the urine goes down at each step and the fiber of each vibration admits no proper vibration. Okay, so it's like the sequence of proper vibration that you can't refine. Okay, you can't get anything finer than that. Okay, these lengths are the lengths of any two possible subsets. Are the lengths of any two possible such maximum sequences? Are they the same or not? I mean, I say that you get one by iterating, but I don't know if you could get two different lengths. I would guess yes, but I'm not sure. I'm entirely sure. And you're assuming finite rank? Yeah, right. Oh, yeah, yeah, finite mind. Yeah, nowhere in finite mind, finance. Yeah, yeah. It wasn't. Yeah. Thank you. Finally, Okay, so suppose that P and Q are stationary non-orthogonal, that's what we want to prove something about. What can be said of their sequences of proper vibrations? We have two sequences of proper vibration. Suppose there are none of them, what we can say, what can we say about these? Okay, here's a straightforward lemma. Yeah, PQ over S in S. You know, PQ over S in S of A, and then we have P to F P of vibration. If P is non-orthogonal to Q, then there is A satisfying P such that either Q is non-orthogonal to F of P or Q is non-orthogonal to the fiber of A. This is really straightforward working calculus. And we want to use this lemma to just reduce to the case of two fibers. So if I put one type, you change the parameters and say the fibers, right? Right? Type of B of F F A has new parameters, right? Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's okay, right? There's change ring types, so. Right, so yeah, I mean, yeah, okay. These two are not about the same parameters, but this type is stationary because it's a vibration. No, no, yeah. Yeah. Is that okay? I mean, for weekly or for funality, this may be problematic in the middle. Yeah, no, but that's yeah, you're right. Yeah, no, but that's yeah, you're right. It is indeed problematic, yeah. Right? Remember when I said, yeah? Okay, so we need two sort of transitivity of non-orthogonality lemmas that I'll use constantly during the rest of the talk. So suppose P and Q are stationary types of finite URL. Then if P is non-orthogonal to Q, if P is non-orthogonal to Q Q Non-orthogonal to q, p is non-orthogonal to q if and only if there is a minimal type r such that p is non-orthogonal to r and r is non-orthogonal to q. Okay, so that's the first lemma. The second lemma is a bit weirder. Okay, so suppose p, q and r are complete stationary types with r minimal. If p is non-orthogonal to q and q is almost r internal, which in particular implies that q is non-orthogonal to r, then p is non-orthogonal to r. Okay, so. Tower. Okay, so again, these are sort of Schworking calculus lemma, except for one direction of the upper lemma. So I'm going to say a bit more about that. So the only if direction of the first lemma, okay, the only way we could prove that is to use the decomposition up to domination equivalence of a type into a modeling product of regular types. I guess it's kind of like a big theory, right? And in particular, that type R in the first lemma for the only if direction might be over a larger set of paths. Direction might be over a larger set of parameters. Okay, so again, more problems. Okay, so this is going to come up, right? We're basically going to need to make the parameters small. Okay, now we're going to try to reduce to the case of fibers. So, fix P and Q over S of A of join N and M, and consider F and G the first two vibrations in a maximal sequence of popular vibration for each type. For each type, we show that if p is not orthogonal to q, then p to the n plus 3 is not really orthogonal to q to the n plus 3. In DCL0, I can't say here, but in DCL0. Okay, so we proceed by induction on the Eurank of the terms in lexicographic form. Okay, so the base case is when P and Q are algebraic, then the P rank doesn't say anything because they are orthogonal. Okay, that's done. So suppose they are not algebraic. So, suppose they are not algebraic. Now, by one of our lemmas, there is a minimum t such that p is non-orthogonal to t and q is non-orthogonal to t. Okay, cannot we use another or one of our lemmas to say that t is either non-orthogonal to f of p or non-orthogonal to p f a, some fiber. Now, if t is non-orthogonal to f of p, then also q is non-orthogonal to f of p and we're done by induction. Okay? Good. So. Good, so assume T is orthogonal to F and by symmetry T is orthogonal to G of Q. Q of Q is the vibration of G. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do the same little proof on the other side. Oh, P, thanks, yeah, thanks, thanks, okay. I see, I see what you put down, yeah, yeah, F of P. Okay, so if T, okay, so now we know that T is So now we know that T is equal to Pf of A and Q G B for the A for P and B for the shape of Q. Okay, so we have reduced to this basically, this configuration. Again, I should just draw a picture. Those are nice. So we have PMG and we have J Okay, I'm getting here. Okay, I'm going to remove these fibers. I'm projecting downstairs, okay? So the fibers are here, and we're reduced to the case where two of these fibers are non-orthogonal, but also the fibers are non-orthogonal to P for that one, and then the Q fiber is non-orthogonal to P. This again, I mean, this follows from the floating lemmas that we did earlier. And then we can also assume that the base F of A and G of B are independent on. An independent of the IP because of ours. P will already be with your non-organic. Okay, so reduced to that. That's the first step. Okay, now these two have no proper vibrations, right? The fibers, because we took a maximal sequences of proper vibrations. So that means that we can find minimal types R and over F of A and A and S over G of B and A, but they are respectively almost internal. But they are respectively almost internal. Okay, so again, we're going to need to remove this F of NGO engine. Okay, now back to the CLGO, right? So these types R and S are also non-orthogonal and right, and therefore they are in the same part of the trichotography. So we have three cases and we will deal with each of them separately. So the first one is they're both non-orthogonal to the constants, the second one is they're The second one is they are each non-orthogonal to the generic types of two a priori different simple manning curls, and then each is non-orthogonal to a trivial minimal type. These are the three things we need to deal with. Okay, so for the non-locally modular case, it's actually the easiest case. So we use the following consequence of Bar Victorian for ACF0, which is that if A stationary type of urine n, if P is none of the normal to the constants, then P to the N. Constants, then p to the n plus 3 is non-organized to the constants. Okay, this is the same sort of proof that. Oh, yeah, weekly. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah, yeah, of course. Okay, otherwise it's not that hard. Yeah. But okay, this is actually, you need to prove, you know, Barbicane for CFO. So you can W here, it's hard. Okay, and the consequence. Okay, and the consequence of this, and elimination of imaginaries for the constants, is that if P and Q are both non-orthogonal to the constant N of Q rank N and M, I missed the wheatly here again, but Pn plus 3 is not wheatly orthogonal to Qm plus 3. Again, I'm missing a little level. Okay, and so now if PFA and G and QGB are almost internal to the constants, then this is also the case for P and QA. Then this is also the case for K and Q, and we get the result, K1 dot. So that's the first case dot. Okay, the other easy case is trivial pigeon trees. So if P and Q over I are minimal, trivial, and they're non-orthogonal, then they're actually also not weakly orthogonal. Elimination of human generic? I'm a bit confused. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't remember. So you have a generic constant is gonna be. A generic constant is going to be algebraic over m plus p, m plus three realizations of p? Yeah, so that that's the thing is to get it to be a constant and not something in the eq of the constants, right? In general, you get something in C EQ, right? And you need elimination of image joints to get to be an actual constant. It's a bit subtle, but you need it. Okay. Right, so for the trivial case, if they are both Right, so for the trivial case, if they are both minimal trivial and non-orthogonal, then they're already normal p orthogonal, so you can see that this is going to help. So if P, F of A, and Q G B have no proper vibrations, then we can find these trivial minimal types of F of A A and G of B A such that they are interalgebraic. P F A is inter algebraic with R to the K and Q G B is interalgebraic with S to the L. Okay, but Okay, but then R to the K non-forking extension to GB and S to the L non-forking extension to FA are also non-nuclear orthogonal. And by interalgebraicity, you actually get that the fibers are non-nuclear orthogonal. Okay. And because it's already non-nuclear orthogonal, right? You only need one realization. This already implies that P is non-nuclear orthogonal. Offering computation here. Because F of P is dependable, okay? Yeah, right. I mean, that's what I yeah, that's not what I said, but. What I, yeah, that's not what I said, but you're right. I said something completely different, but you're right. That's right. Okay, so trivial case also done, so we are left with a case of locally modular non-trivial, which is maybe the hardest. Okay, so first we'll need to reduce the two men in kernels that they are non-orthogonal to the same parameters. So for that, we need the following fact, which we shall speak so colorik. Fact, which we shall have to soakhlovic. So if R is over P and S is over C and they are the generic type of Manium kernels, if P and C are independent over A, then they're actually both non-orthogonal to the generic type of a Manium kernel defined over A. Okay, so that's sort of that will allow us to make the parameters drop down. So in our context, that means that we can find using That means that we can find U in S of A, that's the generic type of a manufacturer. Sorry, can you repeat that, Zoe? In the fact, you're assuming that R and S are not auto, right? Yeah. You're right, no, thanks. Yeah, you're right. Thank you, thank you. Yeah, right. I forgot to say that. Thanks. Okay, so. Okay, so in our context we can find this manning kernel generic type of manning kernel U, such that they are both non-orthogonal to u. Okay, and so again by applying all our forking lemmas we obtain that u is non-orthogonal to pf of A and U is not orthogonal to Q G B fibers and then also that U is non-orthogonal to P and U is not orthogonal to Q. Okay, and again as we did before we may assume that U is orthogonal to F of P and G of Q otherwise we would To f of p and g of q, otherwise we would be done by induction. Okay, so in essence, we replaced R and S, which were two different generic types of manning kernel, by U, which is the type of a managed kernel, over A. Okay, so we drop down the parameters, and we also only have one man kernel to take care of. Okay, right, so that's what I say here, right? So we have reduced to the following, right? F from P to F of P has no proper vibration. has no proper vibration, P is non-orthogonal to some U minimal of A, and U is orthogonal to F of P. Okay, now here's a funny lemma. Under these assumptions, there is a type of A such that V is U internal and P is interalgebraic with F of P multiproduct V. Funny for King Lennon. Okay, so of course we also get the W for W we get the For W, we get the same thing, right? So for Q, we get some W such that Q is integrated with G of Q multiproduct W. On the other side. Now you can do a bit of working calculus to show that V and W also have no proper vibrations, so they are in the algebraic with V tilde to the K and W tilde to the L for some locally modular V tilde, W tilde over A. Again, we're almost done. And we're almost done. Now P is inter-algebraic with F of P moly product V tilde to the K, and Q is inter-algebraic with G of Q moly product W tilde to V L. Finally, the forking member tells us V non-problem to W and therefore also V tilde non-problem to W tilde. So there's a lot of reductions here. But okay, I mean, here's a fact, right? Here's a fact, right? This u and v are locally modular and non-orthogonal, then their Molly squares are not weakly orthogonal. I forgot a little W here again. Okay, so in our context, V tilde squared is not weakly orthogonal to W tilde squared, and that immediately gives us P squared non-completely orthogonal to Q squared. Again, forgetting my W. Square again, forget my W's everywhere. Okay, so that's that case done as well. So now we can put everything together and we obtain that if P and Q are over A, with A closed, types in DCF0 if you rank N and M, if P is non-orthogonal to Q, then P to the N plus 3 is not really orthogonal to Q to the N plus 3. That's the result. Okay. Okay, and here's the corollary. So suppose that A is algebraically closed and that P over A is observing n, non-orthogonal to the A definable set X, then P to the N plus 3 is not weakly orthogonal to L. So we get the bounds in both of our questions. So I have two remarks about this. So the first one is that this corollary improves the previous bound that was in terms of differential dimension. Internal differential dimension, as the rank is always lower than the dimension, and also the boundary status. So there are C internal types of rank N, which are P and plus 2 with ET operator. Okay, I guess I'm going to end this talk early, so we can go to lunch. So here's a question before I end. What about CCM? Okay, so usually when you prove something about DCL0, you think, okay, can I do it for CCM? Can I do it for CCM? Complex manifolds? Yeah. Isn't it more natural to us? Can you do it for Axford? It might be more natural, but it might also not. Okay, here's why I'm thinking about this here. So, as far as I can tell, the only problem with that is that we don't have the file, the Russia socolomic file, okay. Uh so we don't have this descent of parameters for locally modular non trivial files. Locally modular non-trigger types. Okay. So as far as I know, there is a classification of locally modular non-trigger minimal sets in CCM, but up to normality, but we don't have this descent of parameters in CCM. But as far as I know, that's the only thing that's missing. This was asked in the paper of Brahim and Omar, and I mean, yeah, they don't know how to do it. I mean, I don't know how to do it, but someone knows how to do it. Yeah, let me know. Okay, so I guess I'll stop here. Okay, so I guess I'm gonna stop here. So thank you. Any questions? So you said at the beginning that the balance is sharp. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I said it. Oops. But I was going to ask whether it's sharp on the end side too. So you you have it with uh n plus two ends. Uh you mean yeah, like the three ends. Yeah, yeah. I don't know about that actually. I'm not sure. I don't know about that actually. I'm not sure. What's your question exactly about? Do you have examples where you need to go to n plus 3 and n plus 3? Or n, both in a n were bigger than 1. I think so, yeah. I'm not sure, yeah. Shouldn't you just take sh shouldn't you just take um uh like a generic enough system of linear equations and take the projective quotient? Projective quotient like homogeneous linear equations take the projective quotient and prove that the binding group is PGL of the appropriate dimension. And then both direction system? Yeah, but do it for two very different generic systems for different M and M. Yeah, I think that would be a problem. Yeah, I was wondering if you use at all the fact that the theory has the At all, the fact that the theory has the C D Per conclusion. Well, because you know that tells you that if things are not independent over the intersection of the algebraic closure, that means that there is both of them are the fit which is internal to the non-modular rank one factor. Yeah, so the constants, you know, in this case. I mean, I guess, I mean, we're using the trichotomy, but you don't need the CBP to prove it, so. No, I mean, we're using the trichotomy, but you don't need to prove the CBP to prove the trichotomy, I guess. No, you need to know that we only non-modulate time. I guess might be sorry. Can you say we said we can zoom in if you're non-mutual? So it can go in if you need to have you need to know that the only non-modular type of a data set is the complex. Yeah, we need to know that. Yeah, yeah, you're using that in the part where you use for control. What several elements? Uh I don't know about that. Yeah, I'm not sure. Honestly, what would happen in that context? So I guess I can say one thing, though, is that the geometric problem is true in several organizations for finite fine types. So you should get the same weaker problem in terms of dimensional. Sorry? Finite line or finite dimensional? Finite dimensional. Yeah, no, I know, I know. I know, so you get the weaker ones that I stated at the beginning for me for me. State of the beginnings, yeah. But this this part. More questions? Oh, that's thanks. Any announcements? But we have a picture. Yes, can you make our announcements? You're the uh the chart. Since we are interrupting the take us outside, he has to go outside.
