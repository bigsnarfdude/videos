that the generally in general not always as this example we want shows but in general should be determined by the dynamic of the movement so that's an important conjecture um so uh like i said there was a theorem that said that we can actually work with the limit and the reason is that this dynamical degree is submultiplicative so what i mean is that Is submultiplicative. So, what I mean is that if I let dn be the degree of dnth be the degree of the nth of it, then we've got this inequality that dn times dn uh is less than equals dn plus. I think it should be the other, right? Sorry, I've got some typos, right? Um, well, we'll figure this out anyway. So, um, let's see how this works. So, um, let's get So let's get a more intuitive idea of the dynamical degree. So if we have a rational self-map just on projected d space, well, I can think of it, at least on an open set, as being given by a d plus one couple of homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. And I can assume they have no common factor because I would just factor that out if they did. And the dynamical degree is indeed just the degree. Indeed, just the degree if I take the angular, I can get a setup like at this point, and it's just the degree of f to the m to the 1 over. So it is exactly as you would expect. And now we can see why we have sub-multiplicativity. So if f to the m is given by a couple of polynomials, and let's say these have to be a, and f to the n is given by a tuple of polynomials that are homogeneous. Of degree B, then the composition is given by this tuple. And I can see that if I put in a bunch of homogeneous polynomials of degree B into a degree A polynomial, I get polynomials of degree AB. So we do indeed get this inequality, and so I did have it wrong, and I did correct it. You might ask why we don't actually have an equality because it looks like degree AB, but the point is that we can actually. But the point is that we can actually get common factors. So there are examples where there is some common factors, and that drops the Green Jungle. So let me give an example, and this is really the example I gave before, where we were looking at the map x squared, but if I look at it as a map on P1, I can write it like this as homogeneous polynomials, x squared, y squared. And then you can just see that in this case, we've written out. That in this case, we drag irritating x to the 2 to the n y to the 2 to the n, and the degree is 2 to the n, and so the dynamical degree is 2. Okay, so that's nice. Let me find another example. And like I said, we don't in general have this. It's tempting to think that the degree should be multiplicative like that, but because we have cancellation in general, we only get an inequality. We only get an inequality, and a nice example of this is the notary map. So, this is a birational self-map of P2. And if you look at the birational maps on P2, that's a group called the Klimona group. And it's basically generated by this measure map here, by the group here, along with the automorphisms, which are PGL3. So the PGL3 matrices that were this. So, here, if we look at this map, xyz is given by yz xz xy. And when I apply the second iterate, I see that I get x squared yz xy squared z, x, y, z squared. And I see that I can factor out x, y, z. Now, when I do that, I see that x squared is actually the identity. So, if I look at the degree sequence, it's just going to alternate one, two, one, two, one, two. To one to two, and when I take the n through of this sequence and take the limit, I get one. So the dynamical degree of this is one, and every map has a dynamical degree at least one. So one is as low as you can get. Let me see that. And what I said before was it was tempting with our examples. If you just start working with examples, it's tempting to think of the dynamical degree. It's always Degree is always an integer, and if you work with things like p1, you'll start to think this, but it's not true in general. So, here's some examples. I think this is due to Johnson and proper. If I take x equal to a2, so really this is going to be a birational map of p2, but I'm just going to look at the morphism of a2, which is good enough. And f is going to be the map that sends uv to uv, u. u v to u v comma u and if i think of it in terms of matrices it's really thing saying that u is going to something of degree one in u and to be one in v and v is going to something of degree one in u and degree zero in v so f is really associated to this matrix a and i can use that fact to compute the nth integrate and it's given by this and that's really just coming from computing powers of this matrix a which we can do A, which you can do, and you can see that the eigenvalues of this A are golden ratio and maybe something like one over the golden ratio, minus one over the golden ratio. And so if you do that, what you see is that the degree of f to the n is exactly going like the Fibonacci number. And so the dynamical degree is actually one plus root five over two. So kind of an interesting example. Kind of an interesting example. Let's do another example and notice I haven't really changed the example too much. Before it was FUV goes to UVU, and now it's FUV goes to UVV. And just this slight change makes things a lot different. And if I think about what the difference is, well, if I look at the matrix that we get in this case, mu is going to something of the. is going to something that would be one and mu and degree one and v and v is going to something that degree zero and mu and degree and now i've got something whose eigenvalues are just one and i can see that it's triangular when you got one put it in this point and let's notice that this map is much easier to understand what it does to points than the first map with the fibonacci numbers and in some sense the dynamical degree is telling sense the dynamical degree is telling us this the fact that it's um dynamical degree is one is saying that the dynamics are much tamer than in the preceding set so i can think of dynamical degree one is having somewhat tame dynamics compared to okay so i can't meet my slide i hope you can see my slide i might be blocking it um i'll just give a list of all the theorems and you can read them but i might as well say a few things I might as well say a few things. So, dynamical degree, in the algebraically stable case, it's known that the dynamical degree is just the spectral radius of some matrix. I won't say too much about this because it's not relevant, but if you know about the stability group, it's fine. Tiller and Favreau in a very nice paper showed that you actually get this algebraic stability condition for birational mass point two. So, there you get algebraic integers. Favour and Janssen showed that for maps of A2, like the one we did with the Fibonacci numbers, you always get algebraic integers. And in fact, they always satisfy the limit of pronouns of n2, like the Fibonacci numbers. The degrees satisfy the pronouns. And there's a nice result that shows no matter what base field you work with, they're only going to be countably many different dynamical degrees. So even if you work over a huge uncountable base field, there's only finitely many, only countably many distinct dynamical degrees. Countably many distinct dynamical groups. And so, um, well, I guess in my slide, I asked the question you immediately answered, but hopefully, that's okay. Um, this led to the suspicion, at least, that the dynamical degree should always be algebraic. And we were able to show in 2019, this was our first work with Keller and Joss and not with Krieger, that there exists a dominant rational map P2 to P2 who's dynamical to. P2 to P2, whose dynamical is transcendental, and it should say that one shortcoming of this is that math is not birational. So, for birational maps of P2, we know that it is the case that they have to be algebraic. So, we need to go outside of that. And then I'll say later on, Holly Priger joined us, and then just this year, we have a proof that if you go up to If you go up to P3, then now there's a birational. And the strategy is not so different, but there are a lot of subtleties that arise when working with birational maps that we could avoid in the non-birational case. So it wasn't easy to get the extension, although the overall strategy is the same. So let me So let me just see how you pretend. Let me explain how the non-birational case works. So what we start with is we're working in P2, and we start with this map here, which is a fairly nice birational map. I guess they say it's an involution. And then we look at this, what we call a monomial map. And this is again, if we think about the matrix. And this is again, if we think about the matrices involved, this looks like the matrix AB minus V A. If we look at the matrix of exponents, and what we want is we want to make sure that the eigenvalues of this matrix have no real powers. So no positive power of an eigenvalue is a real number. And if you have this property, then if we take f to be the composition sigma. To be the composition sigma of sigma and tau, then the dynamical degree, the first dynamical degree, is always transcendental in space. And so I'll explain a bit about how we do this. So how do we do this? So I'll just say a few things first, because these sort of maps have been around not exactly this map, but people have studied maps of this sort. People have studied maps of this sort for a while. And the first thing was that if we look at the monomial map tau, Favrea showed that the dynamical degree of tau is now the great number, this square root of m squared p squared. And since this one is an involution, the dynamical degree of sigma is just one, just the same way that we notice that it's dynamical degree one. And there is the important thing that's There is the important thing that's exploited, and this was really done in the insights here with Fermatius and Jeff, was that if I look at the degree of f to the n, I can get a relation between that and the degree of tau to the n. So we can relate that. And I'll make this explicit. So we're going to let dj be the degree of tau to the j, which we can sort of understand. In fact, we know its radius of convergence. We know what dj, we know that dn to the 1 over n tends to raise. one way of magnitude is to a squared plus b squared um but if we want the dynamical degree we've got this nice result that it's the unique positive number lambda that gives us this solution so if i make a generating series d of x is dj x to the j then there exists a unique positive real number lambda such that d of lambda is one and that lambda is the dynamical And that lambda is the dynamical degree of our map F. So there's two sort of steps to the proof, and neither is really trivial. The first is showing that this indeed, this solution does indeed give the dynamical degree of F. And then the second part, which is also non-trivial, is showing that this AND is not an algebraic number. So I'll explain how these steps work. So the idea is really for showing this. The idea is really for showing this expression that I gave is really coming down to this value of tree techniques. I think that t is an expedite. And I'm not an expert, so I won't try to say too much about this. But if we let dn be the degree of tau to the n, and we let en be the degree of f to the n, then the value to p could be do give you a recurrence. But the degree of f to the n can be related to the degree of tau to the n in this way. It to the degree of tau to the end in this way. And just for convenience, we're going to set d of 0 to d1 and d of 0 to d2, whether that actually makes sense or not. So now at the level of generating series, if I take this expression and I make a generating series, it's really just saying that. So here, these are the degrees of the f to the ends, and these are the degrees of. ends and these are the degrees of the tau n's and so we've got this relation and then the dynamical degree of f is of course just one over the radius of convergence of this because if i look at what e to the n to the n over n tends to dynamical degree of f, we know by just basic calculus that's one over the radius of convergence, interest map E. We know the radius of convergence of E. And what happens is, And what happens is when d of z is one, that means I have a pole at e. And that is telling me that that's where I hit the radius of the. So because of that, that's how this works. Of course, I'm being a little hand-wavy, but hopefully that kind of makes sense. That once, when d of one is, when d of z is one, d of lambda is one, then to make this equation make sense, somehow this has to be going on. makes sense somehow this has to be going off to infinity so I'm approaching where this that's the idea and now what I'd like to focus on is how we show that a solution to this is transsender and we're going to use a sort of an idea that goes back to Clovaya and Zanye from a long time ago and it's basically an idea from Diophantine approximation Diphantian approximation, which says the following, right? The general philosophy is: suppose I have a power series now. And if you like, it could be an integer power series. And suppose I have some additional structure, maybe it satisfies a differential equation or it satisfies some occurrence. And suppose I know that it's not algebraic as a power series. So for example, e to the z is certainly not algebraic as a power series, then the philosophy. Then the philosophy should be that if I plug in most points, most points in q bar, then I should expect, because the power series is transcendental, that when I plug in the value, I get something transignal. Now, that's not always the case because either the zero is one, but it is the case that if I take any zero, any algebraic number other than zero, I do get something translated. Get something transcendent. Now, obviously, for this velocity to work, I need to have some special structure about FX, because otherwise, I could point hook up counterexamples to what I'm saying. But when we have that additional structure, there are very nice results of this fragrance. So the original is a result of Sigo Shadowski and the sort of state-of-the-art version of Steve Deuper's. And it says that if we take a function like e to the x or a function satisfying Or a function satisfying a homogeneous linear differential equation, and these certain things about being entire and all these sorts of things, then up to excluding a bad set of finite values, we always have transcendsce when we plug in, when we specialize in the method. So, this is the famous Siego-Shabovsky film. And this was later a different time. Later, a different analog was found by Philip Arm and Anchesky Fabriko. And it says that if you have a molar series, so a molar series is like something that satisfies a differential equation, but instead of a derivative, we use an endomorphism. So it might look like something like this. F of Z to the K is P of Z F of Z. So think of F of Z to the K being like a derivative, but now we're applying an endomorphism instead of differentiating. Of it to set instead of differentiating, applying an endomorphism to that. Then you want to get an analog, that outside of a computable set of bad values, when there's coincidence, the set of values might be countable, the bad values, but it's okay. And so if we look at this, we can see what our general approach should be. We've got this power series. This power series DFZ, which is transcendental, as a power series. And we'd like to say that for most of the outside of the bad set of values, if we specialize inside the radius of convergence, we get something outside of some bad set X. That we should get this, and then what we hope is that this value one over lambda, which is right on the cusp of where we can evaluate the, we hope that's not a bad value. So there's two points. That's the general strategy. So what's the idea here? So what we're going to do is we're going to take d of z and we're going to try to produce rational functions that Uh, rational functions that are very good approximations to d of z in this sense, and then if I think about it, um, if I plug in a value alpha, well, if alpha, say, smaller than one, then I expect this to be very, very small. And what that should mean is that if these have integer coefficients, let's say alpha is a rational number, I'm getting a very good rational. Rational number, I'm getting a very good rational approximation to d of pi. And then, if you know anything about transcendence theory, you know that's exactly how you prove things, how Louis Liouville proved numbers like one over 10 with n factorial. This summation is transcendental by producing very good rational approximations that were so good that the only way they could hold was if the if alpha was translated. And this is connected to Roth's theorem says, you know, you can't, you know, in some sense, we can on a You know, in some sense, we can quantify what we mean by how good the approximations have to be to deduce translates. So, we're going to do that. There is some subtlety here because we also have to show that the approximation is bigger than zero because it could be that the approximations are very good because they're all the same and they're just equal to d of alpha, which happens to be algebraic. So, we have to avoid that as well. So, to do this strategy, what we So, to do this strategy, what we needed was we needed a closed form for this power series. And what we had was we did have that expression for D relating it to E. I don't remember it exactly, but it was something like this. So we do know how to compute the power series D of Z, so that does allow us to give a closed form for the power series D of Z. Value series D of Z, and there's actually a very nice closed form. So, what we do is we take one of the eigenvalues of that matrix, A B minus B A. So, I'm going to take A plus B I, and I'm going to take these set of values. And then, what we do is we look at the fact A plus B i to the n. And what happens is at some point, and it's going to lie in one of the Is at some point, and it's going to lie in one of these regions of the complex plane. So maybe if a plus bi has an argument that's very close to zero, it's going to lie over here or over here. Let's say it lies here. And what I do is I compute it as a complex number, and it's some c plus di. And if I'm in this region here, I'm just going to take c plus 2d, and that will be my dn. And well, that will be some expression I use to compute DM, and I do the same thing. So we can figure out what DM is. It's just the real part, gamma J times this Xavier J, where gamma J is chosen based on which region is the claim of the end. Okay, so hopefully that made sense. But anyway, there is a mechanism. There is a mechanism, and what's nice about it is if I think about what's determining this, is a plus bi, I can write it as r e to the i theta, and this theta is an irrational angle. And so what's happening is that there's no real recurrence in terms of which region of the plane I am data to be on. So that's really the key here. Like I said, we're interested when data is rational and inactive. When theta is rational, and in that case, yeah, dj does not satisfy recurrence basically because the angle is rational, so there's never going to be some, you know, some n such that if I'm in this region, then every n later I'm in this region, right? Eventually at some points, you know, I might be very close n later, but eventually I'll start to drift away and land in a different region. So there's no, it doesn't satisfy all the points. And that itself is enough to tell me that the power series. enough to tell me that the power series d of z is not a rational power series when in fact it's not even an algebraic power series which is good because now we can invoke this philosophy where we can hope that when we specialize and at values at most values we get something that's transitable in particular if we can show that the one over lambda lambda being the dynamical degree is one of these values Dynamical degree is one of these values, then you'll get the lambda is well, I'll talk about that. So what we see is that if I think about what's determining my function d of n, it's just the real part of this, and the z to the j is really being determined by this. The gamma j is really being determined by the angle. So if I think So, if I think about theta, if I think about theta as being some real number, then when I look at n theta, if theta is not algebraic, well, if I pick an n so that this is very close to an integer reference, then if theta is over here. Theta is over here, then when I apply n plus one theta, it'll be very close to theta in terms of the argument. And so, I mean, so if I, I'm sorry, I feel like I'm getting a little confusing, but if I take zeta to the j and zeta to the j plus n, if n theta minus a is very close to zero, then the angle that I get with zeta to the j, it's going to be in the same region as ata to the j. J, it's going to be in the same region as A to the J plus 1, unless I'm very close to your back. That's the idea. Hopefully, that made sense. I don't know if it did, but I'm not going to worry about it now. And now, what we're going to use is we're going to use this p-iadic subspace theorem. And like I said, this was used by Korbay and Zanye, Adam Chewski and Bugeot. So, this is a known technique for showing that numbers are transcendental, and I'll explain how this works in this context. This context. So there's really a few stages of the proof. So the first part is to produce rational approximations to the of z, which kind of makes sense if we think about the original Liverpool proof of the existence of transimal numbers. And like I said, the idea is we have this irrational angle theta. And if we get a nice continued fraction approximate of it, so it's a rational number that's very close to theta. Then if I look at this zeta to the n, it's very close to lying on the positive. It's very close to lying on the positive real axis. So, in terms of the angle, zeta j is very close to the angle of zeta to the j for every j. And what that means is that I do get a sort of recurrence, except for the bad j's where I just happen to be on a border, and zeta the j plus n happens to pass over the border. But that should happen very rarely. But that should happen very rarely if the angle difference is small. So, what we do is we pick that end and we make a rational approximation that looks like this. And this is basically just capturing the idea that it looks kind of pretty rough. Like I said, because we can be close to boundaries, it's not quite this, but up to some bad number of indices, we can control this. So we are able to quickly. So, we are able to produce rational approximations to DXZ that have this property. And we do understand what these VNs are. They're basically very easily understand. And now we want to show that this P of n is a sufficiently good approximation that allows to deduce transcendence of these values d of n. And so here's where the subspace theorem comes in. And I'm going to give just a quick overview. I know a lot of people know this stuff. Quick overview: I know a lot of people know this stuff much better than I do, but I'll just say it anyway. So, for this, what follows, I'll just let K be a number field. What we have is a set of places of K, and I'll talk a little bit more about this. But basically, places come into two flavors. They're either finite or infinite. We only have finitely many infinite places, and we can think of these as giving us our absolute values. So, in the case of Q, we have case of Q, we have the addict absolute value for the P prime. And these are our finite places. And then we have the normal Euclidean absolute value. So that's the infinite place. And of course, we can just extend this framework to different number fields. And how it works is for finite places, what we look at is we look at the ring of integers, and they're basically parametrized by the prime ideals. The prime ideals. These are dedicated domains. We get a discrete valuation, and we take the local ring, and that will give us a that will give us an absolute value, which I described here. Presumably, people know it, and if they don't know it, it's probably not very useful. But I'm just giving a quick overview like this. So, this is just extending what we did before with the p-adics. And then, with infinite places, we're basically just looking at complex embeddings. Just looking at complex embeddings. So we might have some real embeddings, and each of those gives us an absolute value where we just use the ordinary Euclidean app, we apply an embedding, and then just apply the ordinary Euclidean absolute value. And then for complex embeddings, for each pair of complex embeddings, we get an absolute value like this. Okay, so the important point about this is that we actually. So, the important point about this is that we actually have a product formula where if we take the product overall absolute values, we get one. And the reason this makes sense is because almost all of the absolute values are one, as long as I should say c is not zero. Almost all of the absolute values are one. And just a technical point is for the ring of integers, if we have a set of places that include Of places that includes all the infinite places, then we can make what we'll call the ring of s integers, which is just the set of numbers where the absolute value is at most one for every v outside of x. And then finally, we've got this, what we call a height of a vector. And what we do is we just take the s height, we just take the product over all. Take the product over all places and if, and we look at the max of these, and we just take the product over all. Okay, so I did say we would use the subspace theorem, but I'm going to use something that's kind of a little nicer than the subspace theorem in this context for us. It might be a little hard to understand, but I'll give an example. If you just read it, it's a little hard to understand. Basically, you start with a Basically, you start with a finite set of places, and the important thing is it should include all the infinite places. And it says that you're going to pick one of your places inside of here, and we're going to take an infinite place. And suppose you have a set of numbers, x1 through xm. Then how it's saying basically the sum can't be too small compared to the max. Now, it's bounded above by a constant. It's bounded above by a constant times this ground. So, as long as no finite, no proper subsum vantages. So, let me just give an example of how this is useful. I'm going to look at the rational numbers, and I'm going to look at the two-addic place, and the three-addic place, and the infinite place. So, s is just going to be these three absolute values. And I'm going to let x1 be some two. Let x1 be some two to the n. I'm not going to say what n is, and I'm going to let x2 be three to the m, and I'm not going to say what three to the m is. And what this says is that two to the n minus three to the m is bigger than or equal to some fixed constant. So I'm going to use the infinite absolute value. The max of this just becomes the max of two to the n and two to the m. That's just the absolute values of these. And then if I look at Of these. And then, if I look at what Hs is, well, I can see that it's actually also the max of 2 to the n 3 to the m. And here, if I look at this product, well, if I look at 2 to the n, x1 is 2 to the n, the 2-added value, absolute value of this is 2 to the minus n, the infinite absolute value is 2 to the n, and the 3-addic value is 1. So this is just giving me run. So, what it ends up saying. So, what it ends up saying is that 2 to the n minus 3 to the m is actually pretty big. It doesn't get, it can't get really small, right? Of course, the c can be, we don't know what the c is, that's the problem. But in particular, if you look at Catalan's conjecture, 2 to the n minus 3 to the n equals 1, notice this is saying that once n and m are big enough, you're not going to get any solutions to Catalan's conjecture. So it's already saying there's only finitely many solutions, of course. Solutions, of course, um, in some sense, maybe the hard part is showing, uh, you know, once you get a bound to show that you don't get any solutions up to that bound because the bound is enormous. That's what Neilesk did. But the point is, this is giving us something very powerful. And so, how do we use this theorem? Well, like I said, we took a truncated series to get an approximation to P of Z. Approximation to E of Z. And so we also have some friction terms that we need to add. So we had a nice rational approximation like this. And if I let d of alpha be beta, and I assume beta is an algebraic number, then I can think of this as saying that beta minus alpha to the n beta minus v1 alpha minus v n alpha to the n minus. Minus some sum of terms off which are in plus n stuff like this is actually very small and if you squint your eyes this isn't so different from the two to the n three to the n sort of situation you've got a bounded number of terms here we've got a large number of terms here but they're all kind of they're all relatively small um Relatively small. So we can use more or less the same ideas we used here to show that we get a contradiction if this is small. And where does the contradiction come into play? Well, the contradiction comes into play with the assumption that beta was algebraic. Because to invoke this theorem of embarrassment, we need to take things that are algebraic. That are algebraic. So, what we're going to get is we're going to get a conclusion that, well, beta has to be transcendental for this to occur because we've got an approximation that's too good. We get a contradiction. Of course, there's one other way we could get a contradiction, which is that this sum could actually collapse to zero, or some sub-sum could collapse to zero, because a variety of theorem assumes no proper sub-sum thing. So we have to verify. So, we have to verify no proper subsummity. And so, I get a recap of this strategy, what I just said here. The Corvaya-Zanier strategy, and they use the crew of transcendence of certain numbers, is you assume towards a contradiction, like this beta, when you plug in alpha to the power series as alphabetic. You use this Veriti's version of the subspace theorem to show that this can only occur when V is equal to theodic. When V is equal to the n of alpha, say n flaps is or some sub sum flaps is technically, and then show that this can't equip. And this part is typically where you need to use ad foc methods. There's not really any deep theory that you can invoke with, but you just sort of power through. Let me see how I'm doing for time. I guess I have to end in a few minutes, maybe, right? Yes. Seven minutes. Yes. Okay. So, well, seven minutes a lot, actually. Okay, I can finish early. So just to return, to reiterate, we had this expression. And when we plug it in, we get this. And like I said, we take this to the other side, and this ends up being very small. And what we're going to use is our set of places. What we're going to use as our set of places is we're going to use all the places where alpha v is not equal to one, along with the places, and all the places where beta, which is if alpha, is not equal to one. And we're going to just pick a fixed embedding into complex numbers and use as our infinite use v naught as our infinite place from one of our infinite places. And so when we invoke a very system, much like we saw with Various system, much like we saw with the two to the n, three to the n, where we were taking all places where one of these was not one, while with the infinite place, uh, the exact same strategy there, with a little more work, applies. Um, so what the conclusion is that if d of alpha is algebraic, then in fact, all the the n alphas have to be the same for large n, and they have to be equal to d of alpha. So that's the only way it can be algebraic. So that's the only way it can be algebraic. And now, what we use is we can actually show, and it's kind of a miracle, but with our approximations, that you could just plug it in and check that you actually get an inequality. So DF alpha is always bigger. Somehow, whenever there's a gap, DF alpha actually helps DF alpha go up. So somehow you can never get an inequality. And so the conclusion is that DF alpha. Is that d alpha is trans and then the conclusion of that is that our original map has transnal dynamical. I only have a few minutes, and because it's much more technical, I want to say a few things about, I don't want to say too much, but I want to say how we did the birational case. And like I said, if you want to do the birational case, you can't work with P2. We can't go to P2. We have to go up to at least P3 and presumably even a surface, a rational surface, and sorry, a projective surface would. I have to think about that, but I'm pretty sure E would be for, yeah, I'm pretty sure for a surface dynamic should be a lot of great. So here we've got a birational mapping of input P3, and it's a little similar to the one before. What we do. What we do is we take for a three by three matrix with determinants, say plus or minus one, we make a monomial map as before. And the reason why we want determinant plus or minus one is that will ensure that this is actually a birational map. So before in the two by two case, we had a monomial map with two variables, and it wasn't a birational map, it had eigenvalues a plus b i, a lines bi, and the determinant. i a9 spi and the determinant is a squared plus b squared which is greater than one if we do this then we actually get a birational so that's the uh the freedom that we have and so what we're going to do is we're going to pick a nice matrix a which uh this might be a nice self-preza this is negative of the identity um so it's it's like the measure of evolution and then we conjugate by a specific by rational A specific birational involution feed as before. So it's the same sort of strategy, slightly more involved. And just as before, well, we still are able to get a generating series relation that gives us that the dynamical degree is some solution to f of lambda equals one, where f is a power series that satisfies some sort of relationship with. Relationship with something that well behaves. This required a lot more work by Jeff and Matthias, in this case, to find the expression by the lab. And the transcendence results also required a lot of technical implications, which here are polypain to the picture. But the interesting thing was that we actually had We actually had very technical conditions, and it wasn't at all clear to us that there were any matrices A that would actually satisfy these conditions. In the 2x2 case, the conditions were quite straightforward. All we needed was a 2x2 matrix AB minus BA should just have the property that no positive integer power is real. But now we actually had a long list of technical conditions that needed to be verified. Verify and we use the theory of algebraic groups to show that they such a exist. And in fact, if you look at SL3Z and you put a natural ordering on the elements, you can actually show that the set of bad matrices A actually has density zero. And my colleague Matt Safriano has this expression here. He's talking about finding hay in the haystack where, you know, you know. You know, you know, almost everything you pick is good. Somehow, you can't prove that any specific thing that you pick is actually in this good set. If you like an example, right, almost every number is transcendental, but it took a long time before people were able to prove, you know, that certain numbers were transcendental. So we had this problem of actually finding a specific A to be able to give a specific example. Sample. And Jeff Diller used the mathematical package to find a thing by three matrix that works. And the entries are actually bounded by 14. But what ended up having is that we had to show that a bunch of about 60 integer linear recurrences associated to A have no zeros. And what we ended up using is because of linear forms and logs, we could actually get exact bounds. Get exact bounds that we needed to check up to, and then we just checked by a bunch of primes. And it was quite a fun endeavor, but it took a lot of computational power to actually find the Hayden Haystack. So, but the important thing is that we do have an explicit example. So once again, thanks for the invitation. And yeah, if people have questions, I'm happy to answer them.
