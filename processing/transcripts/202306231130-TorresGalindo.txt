Perfect. Thanks to the organization for the opportunity to be here, and especially to Carlos Agoya. You are my best Mexican friend, of course. First one, my sense of humor in English is very, very what? So if I But so if I make a joke, just smile. The purpose of this presentation is to understand carefully this work. This work doesn't appear in the original schedule of the Congress. And I changed my presentation and I want to explain carefully why this Explain carefully why this word appears in my presentation. Basically, this presentation deals with the stimulus representation problem, a nice problem and a well-known problem, I hope, in algebraic topology, and how this problem relates with stratiforms and especially with these spectral circles. So This is for me one of the most important questions in algebraic topology. I don't know if it's a well-known problem in algebraic topology, but basically you can see the question in this slide. It's a natural question in algebraic topology. Can you represent alomology classes using manifolds? Manifolds with some conditions. Some conditions, closed-fit and oriented manifolds. And the natural question is: with these manifolds, can you represent all homology classes? I think that this is a natural question because the most natural samples of homology classes in higher dimensions come from this kind of objects. So it's really, really a natural question. Also, to understand algebraic topology. I invent myself a history. I tell myself a history to understand the basic tools of modern algebraic topology. And the history goes around this particular question. In this picture, you can see basically a picture that represents the problem. There were no pants and a function. Of course, this is a manifold with boundary, but just drop the boundary. Just drop the boundary in your imagination. So, this particular question deals with many parts of algebraic topology. Basically, I want to explain how this question relates with vertices and spectral sequence. And the final part, I want to show you how this relates with spectral sequence with CK coefficients, border with CK coefficients using strategies. Coefficients using the strategies, basically. The best part of the conference, the historical part. A well-known mathematician introduced the notion of homology and the fundamental group in this paper. It's a famous paper, 1895. 1895, he introduced the notion of manifold, the fundamental group, and also the notion of homology. But this paper contains some problems, some problems about his definition. Of course, Poincaré didn't know the notion of manifold, as many of you understand in this moment. In fact, a pair of years later, a mathematician wrote. Of years later, a mathematician wrote a letter to Poincaré and said, He, oh, Poincaré, take care. I found an example of a three-dimensional manifold in which your definition of betty numbers conflicts with your duality theorem, the Poincaré's duality theorem. But Poincaré was a clever mathematician. He knew that the result was true. Result was true, so he wrote a second part of analysis. In this second part, he got a complete proof of his duality theorem, but for this, he introduced a polydereral structure for a manifold. A polydereral structure is like a triangularization of a manifold, but in higher dimensions. He didn't give a proof of this structure, he just mentioned this. Structure. He just mentioned this structure and made the demonstration. It takes at least four years to give a complete demonstration that any meaningful has such a particular structure. Maybe this is a picture that represents the ideal homology representation, the idea of homology in the In the minds of Poincaré, but I guess that with this polyeral structure and the idea of many mathematicians, Noether, Eilenberg, Steenrod, Tom, many mathematicians, developed this idea and we arrived to the notion of singular homology. A homology. Singular homology is a super theory in mathematics. It's highly computable. But for me, in singular homology, you lost the intuition. It was really difficult to me understand singular homology. Just deals with the similar problem. I understand carefully the meaning of, well, at least I hope carefully the meaning of singular homology. In this moment, the natural question appears. The original idea of Poincaré about homology and singular homology are the same, are we the same, are closer? What is happening here? This is a philosophical question, of course. But resolve this question carefully is part of this presentation. So, many mathematicians know the... Many mathematicians know the problem, know this philosophical question, but nobody made any progress in this in this setting until René Thompson appears in a sense. He is not a mathematician. He is a super mathematician. He was the first person that defines carefully the notion of cover this. Carefully, the notion of cover disrupt. He defines the notion in order to solve a particular case of the steamroad problem. In this paper, I hope that this is a, I guess that this is a well-known paper, he introduced several notions and resources in Rothford. He's in French, and I like this picture. The picture is looking to me and say, what are you doing? Me and say, What are you doing? It's a pills mail, of course. He resolves a particular problem, a particular case of the steamroot problem. He starts with a manifold and a question about if a homology class can be represented using pseudo manifold. In this picture, all of us know that for the torus, this is possible. Torus, this is possible. Of course, representing manifold classes using sub manifolds is a particular case of the single problem. But here resolves this problem. How do this? Introduce the ring of covertness. This is represented in this picture. It's a well-known definition today, but this was the first mathematician that introduced. Is a mathematician that introduced this idea. Resolve the problem to represent homologic classes using pseudo-manifolds. And in the last part of the article, he shows the gap, the first sample of a homology class that cannot be represented in the steam rod sense. This is the lens space of seven dimensions over C3. Over C3. This is a multiplication of the distance space. Basically, for some technical reasons and using the obstructions to the problem, he maybe using the basic case in which he can make the computation of the obstructions and he arrives to this conclusion. Here arrives to this conclusion. So, the next part: how relate with borders? Of course, for many of you, maybe this is natural thing about this, but Atija introduced the notion of borders at 61. Basically, I explained to me using this question how the push, how it's possible that two manifolds represent. How is it possible that two manifolds represent the same homology class in a topological space X? It's not an easy question. If you know the notion of vertices, of course, it's pretty easy to see the answer. But if you don't have any clue of how to resolve this problem, it's really hard to resolve. But basically, if you use the notion of COVID and you can extend the functions, you can be pretty sure. You can be pretty sure that the manifolds represent the same homology class, the same homology class under the push forward. The usual picture, is zero and is one are covered, and you have functions. And the push forward of these manifolds represents the same class. It's pretty easy, but nobody, Atija defines this carefully at 61. At 61. I am not pretty sure that this word is correct, but I just say that this is an invariant for this word. Finally, how relates the problem with the spectral sequence. Spectral sequence is another tool that you need to know in algebraic topology. In algebraic topology. I don't know how to explain this. Basically, a generalization of exact sequence to other contexts is like a page, a page of differentials, kernel under the image. A lot of computation. And basically, Conner and Floyd defines oriented vortices on the category of spaces using the same idea of vertices. idea of vortices. This is a general size homology theory. Any general size homology theory has an spectral sequence. This theory relates with usual singular homology. Just take the push forward. This is not a natural transformation. This is a supernatural transformation. Just take the push forward and you get this natural transformation. And our no result Our new result, maybe for some persons, is that make computation with the spectral sequence is really difficult, but using basic ideas, he arrives to this proposition. The spectral sequence is trivial if and only if in a topological space X. only if in a topological space X, a CW space X, if and only if you can represent all homology classes in the synergy transit if you want to check that all classes in a topological space can be representing the Singrod sense maybe you can use this tool to resolve and give an as well of course make this computation is really difficult Make this computation is really difficult. So, he got a nice word, but maybe I think that this you can use this in easily. You need to make the computation of this spectral second. This is really hard to do. So, more about this. We need to use the word CK and And we need to change the coefficients. Another useful property of the single problem is that you can boil the same question using another coefficient. The first example of this is unoriented vertices. Basically, you state the stimulus problem in C2 coefficients, homology with C2 coefficients. So, in this case, you need to use just closed manifolds, manifolds. Manifolds, many false compact and without boundary, and you can revolve the steam rod problem. Why? All of us know that if you use C2 coefficients, you have a fundamental class and you use the push forward. The next sample. The next sample comes with A. The same problem, but with CK coefficients. In this part, you need to use your imagination. You need to use your imagination what is a CK manifold, which is the correct notion of a manifold in order to establish the syndrome problem in another coefficient. If you know the answer, it's pretty easy to see. Maybe somebody tells you, take these manifolds, and with this, you can resolve the stingrot problem. But if you don't know the answer, If you don't know the as well, it's really difficult to see the kind of manifolds that you need to use. A clue. The clue comes with the Bolkenstein sequence. The Bolkenstein sequence appears in singular homology. And you know this theory, you know this theory, maybe you know this theory and you are looking for this theory or at least for the elements that appear in this theory. And I guess that if you And I guess that if you take a pair of ears, think about this, and try to complete this part of the diagram. Maybe some of you arrive to this picture. This picture represents the notion of C3 manifold. It's a manifold with boundary, with an orientation, but the boundary has a special decomposition. Special decomposition. The boundary is three copies of the same object. The pans represent an example of a C3 manifold, but you need to use in this moment some identification. This identification comes with an embedded and this embedding preserves the orientation. It's not just a function, it's a continuous function. A continuous function that preserves the orientation of each part of the boom. Yes? It's pretty easy when somebody tells you, but see this kind of object of objects is not easy. It was done by Sullivan. Sullivan just say, use this. Perfect. And finally, to complete our theory, we need to understand the notion. Need to understand the notion of CK manifold with boundary. More or less, it's pretty easy to understand. You have a manifold with the boundary of the manifold are three copies of the same object. So you can use three copies of the same, the other manifold to complete the boundary of another manifold. Just see a picture. If you take this semi-spare and complete the boundary. And complete the boundary of the pans, you get is two, and is two is the boundary of another manifold, the D3 manifold. So you complete the boundary of another manifold. With this, you can revoil the steenrod problem in another coefficient, but also get this commutative diagram. So, Diagram. So, what happened in this case? Some results. Well, no results. I hope. First result. You can represent all classes in homology with C2 coefficients. If you start with a CW complex, take a homology class, you can find a manifold closed and a function. And a function, and the push forward of the fundamental class reach the homology class. If you have a manifold, you can represent the homology class using submanifolds, but you need to just for these dimensions in lower dimensions for put a name. Put a name, you can represent classes using pseudo manifolds. If you want to represent a homology classes in maybe higher dimensions, you need to use a function. Maybe the functions need to make a twist to represent all the classes. An important result for this talk is not easy, but in this ring, the torsion is of The torsion is of exponent 2. It was done by Wall. And our last example. In another coefficient, stands where it's not. The non-serum classes in this space cannot be represented using CP manifolds. But the person, I don't remember, the mathematician just mentioned. He didn't have any proof. He's he didn't have any proof, he just said follows the Tom's paper, makes some computation, and you can see this. He doesn't make any computation, just mention. So, a faster introduction to a stratify. This is the professor Matthias Creg. He is an important mathematician for several for several. Mathematician for several reasons. He done his PhD studies under the supervision of Hirsebruck. Hirsebruck is also a well-known mathematician. He introduced the notion of stratifolds, the theory of the notion of stratifolds, and also was part of my jury thesis. So it's really important to me. A faster introduction to stratifies. You can resolve the stratifault theory in a sentence. You want to resolve the steamroot problem, but instead of just manifolds, you need to use more general objects in order to represent, to resolve the Steinroth question. But he resolves the Steinroth question using the theorem of A L. Using the theorem of Eilenberg and Steinrot, if you have homology theory, antithomology theory fulfils the dimension action, they are natural isomorphic. So, Craig makes some definitions and carefully defines a homology theory that looks like usual vertices, but that resolves the same road problem in this sense. In this sense, using basically, he used the Ellen Marie syndrome theorem to resolve the syndrome representation. Faster, basically, he starts with a differential space. Differential space is a space, it's a topological space with a subset of special functions, smart functions. You impose some conditions. Conditions, these conditions assure that you can define the notion of tangent space. If you read the book of Craig, it takes less 10 minutes to understand this notion, but the important thing here is that in a differential space, you can define the notion of tangent space, and with this notion, you can give a nice stratification of the space. Just take the image. Basically, an example. The most important example of a differential space comes here. Take the con of S1. The set of functions are functions that are smooth, but near the point, the function becomes constant. With this differential space, you can see easily that. Space, you can see easily that any point in this part has dimension two, but this point has dimension zero. The definition of stratifole, a stratifole is a differential space with some particular conditions. This particular condition appears in this slide. Basically, he impose some additional conditions. The these differentiable spaces, you um I forget this space, you take points of dimension I, and these points are in fact a manifold and some additional condition. In this part, you have the two pair of a bump function. To pair of bound functions, the bound functions that come with a germ of functions that comes take a point, the point lies in a manifold, you have a gerb of functions, but also it sees the general functions if you see the point in the wall stratiform. But basically, it is in points, this is a stranger condition. The restriction gives an ISO morph, and you can find one function. And you can find bound functions inside the functions, the smart functions, and dimension of any point is less or equal to that n. A stratifold is a set in which you glue manifolds and you glue these manifolds carefully to get a homology theory, basically. They are a manifold of the dimensions. A manifold of the dimension zero, one, two, or three are they are glue, but you glue these manifolds in order to fulfil these conditions. Another example. This guy is an example of a stratiform. It's a stratifa of dimension. You can check all the conditions. There is no problem. There is no problem. And another example of stratiforms come with P stratifles. Basically, you have an stratifold, you have a manifold with boundary, you need a colour, and you have a smart function from the boundary to the stratiform. This function is smooth in some sense. In some sense. And the set of functions are functions that, when you restrict to this part, is a smooth in the usual sense. If you see the function in this part, it's just a function in the stratifa. It's a smooth function in the sense of a stratiform, and it commutes with the column. This construction gives many examples of stratifts and And with this notion, we boil, we use this kind of stratifax to develop the notion or the theory of CK stratify for several reasons, basically. You can make computation with this and use an in usual homology. And we use this kind of objects in the CK stratify. So The last KFAT. I don't know how Craig sees this feature. We need to impose some condition in the stratification of the stratiform. The k-notion here is this. But it's this: the coimension one of the stratifold needs to be empty to take your stratifold, lock points of dimension n minus one, and this set is empty. With these stratifolds, CRED defines a homology theory. This homology theory. Theory no, s is of stratable s is of stratiform. I need another notation. Yes, it's of stratable. You start with the stratiform of dimension n and the co-imension one is empty. I need another notation. This is the usual notation. With these subjects, here a boy. Boys. Avoid a homology theory, just copy and paste the usual vertices, the usual oriented vertices, and he arrives to this theory. In this sense, he resolves the syndrome problem. Basically, when you look at this theory, it's like usual vertices, but you use stratiforms instead. Use stratiforms instead of manifolds. In this sense, he resolves a simple problem. You need to impose some orientation in the top stratum. If you drop the orientation in the top stratum, you get the same result. Oh, just drop this S. You have the same result with C2 coefficient. But this theory is like usual bodies. but this theory is like usual borders just take another elements not take just manifolds take a strategy so our theory is pretty easy to say to explain why you don't use the notion of ck manifold the notion of the notion of stratifold the notion of ck manifold Stratifold, the notion of CK manifold, and revoil this theory in order to resolve the syndrome problem with CK coefficients. It's a muster, of course, but you can understand this kind of theory easily. And we introduce the notion of the theory of CK manifold just follows this pair of ideas, and we get the spectral result. There is no problem. There is no problem. You just make some computations and need to show that some fundamental class exists. Make some computations in homology. Be careful with some definitions. And you can see that you can define the stratipholomology theory. And this stratiphologomology theory looks like usual vertices, but this usual theory gives is Gibbs is isomorphic to usual homology with CK coefficients. This is our field result. It's unexpected result. My advisor say, you can do this. And I say, yes, of course, why not? And make some computation with Carlos and we get the result. But of course, when you introduce a new theory, you expect to resolve another problem using this. This result at the beginning of our investigation, we want to explain the T Jaheer several spectral sequence for CK vertices, and we want to explain what is happening in the filtration that appears in this spectral sequence. But we have a little problem using this term. This theorem comes from Haggaiten. This is the version for CK stratifies. At the beginning, we think that this result applies for any number, but in some point, we see that we need to impose this condition. Cannot number. I want to explain carefully. I want to explain carefully why this happened. So there is here applied here appears a clever observation correct impose this condition. Impose this condition. Craig impose this condition. If you don't impose these conditions, your homology theory becomes trivial. He imposed this clever condition. I don't know how. He said this. Impose this condition. If you impose this condition, you have a homologitary isomorphic to a A singular homology. Basically, it's possible. Maybe just make a demonstration, like in my case. But you can impose another condition. Why not? So, Hagai. Hagai then impose additional conditions over the stratifolds to get new homology theories. They are different. And using this kind of stratifold, basically he imposes conditions over the next co-dimension. Co-imension one and two are empty, co-imension. One and two are empty. Cohen, one, two, are three are empty, and so on. With this, he defined his homology theories. Is natural? I don't know if this is natural, but with this kind of object, he states this, well, no result, this result, to explain the filtration that appears in. That appears in the Atijah Hirsu spectral sequence for oriented borders. Maybe I want to make it's pretty easy to understand. Here, start with the usual stratifa theory. This is This is just a homology theory. If you impose another additional condition, of course, this theory is like a subset of this theory. In this theory, you impose conditions over the co-dimension one. In this theory, you impose conditions over co-dimension one, co-dimension two, and so on. Co-imention two, and so on. It's just an inclusion of homology terms. If you use many of these items, you arrive to oriented borders. This is this result, basically. But the Basically, but the Hag I10 results in oriented borders is just a filtration, a natural filtration. This story, these are inclusions. The homology theory of this part is natural and inclusion in this theory and so on. With this, he explained the frequency that appears in oriented vortices. We try to do the We try to do the same for CK coefficient, for CK Bordis theory, but we need to impose this condition. So one demonstration    Of course, in general, understand this positive of tower is really difficult, but using these ideas is pretty easy to understand. Basically, you want that in these pairs appears these stories and the natural transformation, the natural transformation. The natural transformation, the natural transformation as just enclosed, is truly natural to understand the Posnico. So we're using this. But you need to check this condition. The inclusion is an isomorphism if the sub-indices fulfil this condition. M is less or equal to R, but the theory. The theory becomes trivial in this window if n is greater than error. At the beginning, we think that this theory for CK-oriented versions comes naturally. We don't understand the problem just until the end. And basically, And basically, the idea comes from the net picture. You can understand why the word n appears in this presentation. It's just a picture. You need to check this condition, basically. And the construction comes in the following way: you start. Following way, you start with a picture of you see three stratiform and you try to complete the picture. You say, oh, how can I complete the picture? We need to. We need to close the boundary. There are not many objects that you can use. So you put the con this is a stratiform. This is basically a stratifold without boundary. And in this moment, You close your stratiform, you try to show that this stratiform is the boundary of another stratiform. So you take again the con is something like this. This is maybe a better picture. Here you have this guy, you take the cone, and this guy is the boundary at least. The boundary, at least, of this subject, but a problem appears in this moment. This point, this is a point of dimension zero. And with this point, when you use this construction, the point, this point comes here, but the point is a point of dimension one. This is a problem. It's a problem about the definition. If you see this, these theories, you impose some conditions in the limit of the points of the dimension of the singularities that can appear in your strategy. And this is a point of dimension one. We have a problem. We have a problem in a particular case. Particular case appearing in these subindices. The problem appears in these sub-indices. We need to check that this theory is trivial. This theory is trivial for a point. In other words, you start with a stratiform and you need to show that this stratiform is the boundary of another stratiform. This CK stratify is the boundary of another stratifo, but you have some problems with the points of certain co-dimension in this point. These points at the boundaries and the bounds at this guy can appear points of dimension one. If you have a point inside the boundary, this point can is a point of dimension of dimension at least for most zero. The singularities that appear in this boundary is at most of dimension zero in this window. But this construction, for using this construction, you had points of dimension one. So this construction is not valid. You can use this construction to show that this is true. This is zero. For that reason, we impose this condition. N is a point N is an up. I don't know how to explain this. How to explain this? When I told my advisor this problem, he said, You have a big problem. How do you want to resolve this? It was a nightmare for me. I was scared. I said, I can, how this can be possible. Two years spent to do this. This is another expected result, and the result doesn't apply. Apply, but I don't know how this happened when I check the conditions for this guy. It's pretty easy to see that your stratiform is not a stratifold, it's just a usual manifold. It's a manifold. It's a usual manifold. It's not a stratifold. It's a stratifold without singularities. It's just a manifold. And this manifold, this bone body are cat copies of the same object. These are copies of the same object. Of the same object. But this is a usual border. This is a usual oriented vortices. And use the well-known result that the cover disgrace has not a torsion. It means that this guy is zero in usual vertices. So you can find an Find a manifold and the boundary of that manifold is this guy. You don't need to include singular points. I put this guy here, put this guy here, and in this moment, this point of dimension zero doesn't appear. So, I basically you can kill the singularity points. You can use objects that have no this kind of singularity of dimension zero. And using this, you can take the cone. And the cone just has a singularity point, and this singularity point is a point. At this singularity point is a point of dimension zero and is a correct verticine for a correct. You can use this as a vorticing for this turtle and you check and you arrive to your result. For me, it was a nice result. I was very happy with when I found this. It's just a little, a tiny part of. A tiny part of the world theory of all the theory of bore disease, but for me was okay. And for this reason, I imposed this condition when I told to my advisor, you can impose this condition and resolve the problem. He was happy and say, yes, all is okay. Tomorrow you get your PhD presentation and go ahead. I was happy in this moment. It's really the best part of my career in mathematics. I was the most happy man in the universe for a little second. A little bit. Say, oh, it's okay. I understand the carefully. This is all for this presentation. Some problems for you before. Some problems for you before end. When you some question for you. Maybe you don't like the next question for you, but it's possible to resolve the steamroad problem using a computer. The steamroot problem using a computer. I mean, I gave you a manifold with a polyderellate structure. You can use a computer and it's possible that you find or give an answer that this class can represent by a soup manifold or not. It's possible to use a computer to resolve this problem. To resolve this problem, I mean that a polar structure, with a polar structure, you can compute a singular simplicial homology, and you can use a computer. With this idea, you can resolve the problem, yes or no? It's not an easy problem, but maybe it's possible to use a computer to resolve the problem. Another thing? Another another thing. When you see the literature, you can find many examples of non-representable class. There are not many. Basically, you can find in the literature these examples more. Can you use stratiforms to make to void samples of no? Void example of non-representable class using this theory. I don't know. I hope that in a moment you can do this. And I forget another question for you. But this is all. Thanks. You can see this in other words. You can see this in archive, but soon in Ajete. And you can find this in archive. You can see in the pair of papers the stratifold structure of the manifolds that cannot be represented using manifolds that appears in this presentation. You can read this carefully. Any question, just write in a mail. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you for your answer. I will start with the questions in the company. So when k equals 2, do you get how old, like, how old is this all? How well does this all work? Do you still have the theorem and then it's just you don't need to worry about Z2 because that's our problem was understood? Or is it that some piece of this breaks? Can you repeat me again? Slowly, please. Why did you only consider K odd, I guess? Ah, to avoid this point. This resume is not true if K is an even number. Doesn't apply. Apply doesn't apply the proof doesn't apply. The proof doesn't apply. The proof doesn't apply. Yeah, but also the strategy that you considered in your projectory, you have you have some conditions, and then some conditions are the computational one. Well, that condition that could So that would be the map. So point aligned. Can you repeat the question, please? The proof doesn't apply. I don't say that the result does is not true. result does is not true but the proof doesn't apply if you use a uh an even an even number doesn't apply okay can you give any sense of what why uh uh because uh you can consider a con yeah uh you can resolve this in the Can resolve this is the point you have, you have managed because the Bob Maybe with a picture, I want to revoil the illustration in this particular case. In this particular case, you are using a stratifa, say C-forward stratiform. Basically, this is a manifold and the boundary has four copies of the same object. This is a manifold, but the problem to use the coin is that appears a point of co-dimension zero and in that strategy. Strativore and at the cone, these points become a point of dimension one. These theories impose some conditions in the limit points of the dimension of a singularity of a point. Basically, in these indices, points of dimension zero can appear in this particular. In this particular instance, points of dimension can appear in the bombing, basically. And the problem is that if you take a cone. Why does the cone have a singularity when you show the cone that I showed in the presentation? You close the boundary. You close the boundary basically, but this is a point of dimension zero. When you take the cone over this object, this is a point, this point runs, start here, runs for this, but this point is a point of dimension one. I mean, I understand that it's just, I don't see where the parity of k comes in. Well um yeah okay when because we have a keypoint uh gate of your model as I say when you don't have all force so everything is manifold because it because it's just you can get a small boundary for this part you don't know Part you don't know this is possible, yeah. For that reason, you need to use the code, but you have a problem if you make this construct when this is an even number. You don't know. The result says that the torsion in this ring is of exponent to doesn't have odd torsion. For that reason, we can smooth the corner basically using. Correct basically using usual manifolds. So, I had another question. This is just to follow up because so sort of the condition that there's no strata of co-dimension one, does that have something to do with the fact that co-borders with free boundary is trivial? So, that you couldn't, I mean, if you represent classes, but you have free boundary, then anything is cobordism. Then anything is comported, so you can't and to repeat the expression. So it's because you have to show that in dimension zero you have zeta case. If that's not the case, you don't put that condition, no, because everything is trivial. And if you consider that the condimentum was empty, yeah, you prove that the radical continues with this coefficient is a coefficient. If your code mention one is empty. Yeah, but that's what it's meant. Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. So, if you have co-dimension one strata, does that mean that you can have cobordism with free boundary? Because boundaries have co-dimension one, so and that would well-that was my question. Like, is is is is that why you have to impose the condition that there's but really manifold, really you don't have boundaries. You are capping or or the boundaries. They are closed, but have just different case, but but yeah, but but but but but a but a strata like is a singularity of codimension one, right? If you if you have like a free, like, I mean is it a I don't know the SNK like push. I think if I'm not looking at that. In North Korea, they did that. And I just think about the change in which in the machine. Ah, yes, this is a correct theorem. This is a correct theorem. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's condition. The same apply if you impose if the condition and you understand the boundaries in the decay case, calculus of the same case. So, but if you don't need to impose that question, why this material is. Take a point, take a point. Suppose that you don't impose this condition, just suppose then you can take the convergent is just interval. By definition of the functions, it's the same that I just did. Is the same that I just yesterday this is a point of ordination if you don't impose this condition this point becomes zero in this theory just what it means this is a boundary variable boundary for basically a strategic point theory with a you know this is this is exactly what I said I think right so so because Because cobordism with free boundary is zero, and that's why you get something trivial. That's what I meant. Yeah, no, the boundary for the region for speed table. Yeah, no, it's not boundary in that sense, but that's the point is that, like, you know, any manifolds are coordinate to each other if you allow like free boundary, which now you don't call boundary. Free boundary, which now you don't call boundary, but you call them n minus one stratum, like singularities, right? But that's that's why like you have to impose this condition, yeah. If you can call everything, the theory becomes previous here. But it's a previous point of view, of course. You involve the conditional, you know what is happening. I mean, that case with this condition, because simply Becomes a similarly useful sorry if you if you if you impose if you doesn't impose any condition the theory becomes circular this is the explanation if you impose condition the theory became becomes a singular model With another condition, you can get an explanation using the attributes of the spectrum sequence at the film station that appears in the curve. So just to recap, like saying this is like equivalent to saying that you can resolve Steamroat's problem if you allow singularity, like if you allow these strata folds with singularities up to dimension n minus two for any theory. Sorry. Well, that's the geometric model. That is the geometric model for your technology. Another question? Final question for you. If you involve another cohesions, you don't know which kind of theory you get. Is another model of theory, but you don't know the extra. But you don't know the explanation of which theory, which means in the meaning of the new theories in a derived proportion. With this condition, the theory is playing this part. With another condition, you get the filtration of the Attitude Solute spectral second. Or another random condition, you don't know. Maybe you can say points of co-dimension. Points of co-dimension prime numbers are empty. What did you get? I don't have any. They are just homology theories, but you can explain something with this random theory. I don't have any. Maybe there are no questions. I just wanted to make a comment. Well, all this machinery sometimes is really difficult. Yeah, you can. Sometimes it's really difficult. Yeah, you have to find the models for classes, like atomic classes. It's really difficult. I think it was the old topology, algebraic topology, the old Ponkai style that really died and right now formed with the correct topology. But for example, there is a question by Suleiman that I don't want to write in the plan. Right into the black box that you are going to start A United cannot be recognized by the proof that In the first no in AGT, yeah, to use it's already known that is true, but use this machine already to prove that. Well, thank you, Arg. Just a short announcement. The female
