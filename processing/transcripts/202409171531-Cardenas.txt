Come here. Uh we talk about uh dramatic social change and trip to it. I don't tease. Thank you. Thank you. So I presented myself before in Varsan and I will speak today with Diana Carvenas. So my name has been said twice already. Hi, I'm Diana Carvenas. And today we'll be presenting with Roxanne Sabina, a project we are working on together. So we work on this project since 2017 designing the algorithm, but the actual theory behind it, which is a theory I developed on climatic social change and social change processes, I started very earlier in my career and I published a paper in 2017 and it started from that. So during this conference, we talked a lot about Conference: We talked a lot about different kinds of social change like climate change, disease. Some people mentioned AIDS, there's some wars, opiate crisis. Do I forget something? Floods, floods, floods, fires, fire, forest fires, everything. So there's a lot of var variety of social change that can be very dramatic and affect a whole bunch of people. And it affected a whole bunch of people. And according to the United Nations, if it continues like this by 2030, this is not long ago, like crisis such as the COVID, there will be an increase by 40%. So that's a lot of change. Our main research question is: can we model when a society will experience social change? By social change, we mean the process. Change, we mean the process by which we transit from one societal state, let's say stability, to chaos or dramatic social change or something worse. So we're really interested in those transition from one state to the other. What causes it and can we forecast or predict this? There are some scientists, sociologists say that in the last hundred years it has been accelerating the pace of social change, and I think we feel. Phase of social change, and I think we feel it even more with the media around us and looking at television and everything that's going on. So we have designed first theoretical model, which is what we call a topology of social change. And we argue that there are four societal change. Sorry for I don't know, changing computers, sorry for this. But there are four societal states. First, stability. States. First, stability. It's when things are going quite well, nothing much happens, and it's sort of building on positive society and it's going well and there's a lot of resources also. Incremental social change, it means that there's some changes, but the equilibrium of society is not ruptured and it balances each other. So if there's a Each other. So if there's a small disequilibrium, it comes back and then it goes like this. Primatics changes when there's a rupture and that something breaks. There's a before, a now, isn't this? A before and now, and an after. Sorry, it's part something different in English. And there's collective inertia, which can happen when there has been a big dramatic social change. Been a bit dramatic social change, and we cannot get out of that state, and things just get worse and worse and worse. Or when people try to have change and go to a democratic system, for instance, but no matter what they do, they stay in that system and they cannot go out of it. So, that's me. Yeah, okay, you added that, yeah. Yes, yes, sorry. That's a change. That's a change. It's not the World War. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, that's fine. I just need the light. Thank you. Yeah, just to follow up on what San was saying, these numbers that we have here, they don't really mean that stability equals one or equivalent plus one equals two. It just simply means that these are actually different states. We mean them to be different categories, but at the same time, there is this continuous level underneath it because they're associated with a continuous of resources. Next slide, please. Oh, sorry. Come on. Come on. Okay, so now the question that we're asking is that every society starts with an initial and a priori societal state. We start, for example, in Canada, we can consider ourselves in a fairly stable society. That's when something happens, an event occurs. We can think of fires, we can think of COVID, we can think of many potential events that occur. And then the question that we're asking is what's going to happen as a resulting societal state? As a resulting societal state, what is going to be our posterior state following that event? And to answer this question, we created a decision tree, essentially, in which we have our prior societal state here when an event occurs, and then what's the process that leads to the potential societal states that are here. So here we have, I don't expect you to read everything in detail, don't worry. To read everything in detail, don't worry. These are essentially the same states that we presented earlier, but they're just the different potential outcomes that can occur from a single event. And how do we get there? By what process? So the first thing that we propose is that we're going to talk here about the characteristics of social change. So an event happens, and how can we characterize this event? How can we characterize the process? This event, how can we characterize the process of social change? And the first one we're going to talk about is the pace of change. Is it fast or is it slow? We can think of, no, yes, we can think of COVID as part of the COVID crisis as fairly fast, right? Things closed from one day to another, but we dramatically had to change a lot of things from one day to the next. But then we can also think about elements of it that have been fairly slow. Like it's just become part of our everyday lives. Of our everyday lives. I got COVID recently, that's why I'm wearing a mask. And nothing transitioned, nothing is happening. So there's the pace of change. Thank you, Maxine. That leads to two potential branches here. One that is a rapid event and the other one is a small event. And then what happens? Well, we consider the second characteristic of social change, which is a rupture in social structures. The rupture in the very structures that sustain our societies, like the health system. Health system, education system, transportation system, government, etc. etc. And there's also another type of rupture that is possible, and that's in our behaviors. Whether the way we normatively, normally behave has been dramatically changed, altered from one day to a... Who cares about the other day to another? It hasn't been altered. So is our system intact or not? Or are our normative behaviors intact or not? Intact or not. And in our model, we didn't really have a reason to believe that ruptures in systems necessarily always lead to behavior, system ruptures, or vice versa. So a behavior can come first, a behavioral rupture, our behavior can change dramatically and that leads to a system change or vice versa. The system changes and therefore we must change our behavior. So in essence, we've put them together as the Essence, we've put them together as the same part, the same barrier. And lastly, the last characteristic of social change that we talked about is the threat to social identity, the threat to who we are as a group, not only as an individual, as Yana, but us Canada, as Canadians, as Quebec, as a social group. Are all these different elements of the social change leading to Leading to a sense of threat to our identity. And what happens here is that we then consider our initial a priori societal state. We experience an event and that branches us into, depending on the pace of the event, as rapid or slow, it branches us into one of the branches which then opens to another branch and another branch leading to the most likely posterior state. So we use the initial information. We use the initial information, the characteristics of social change, to estimate the potential a posteriority of change. Quickly, this is an iterative process, meaning that we consider the a priori state to get to a conclusion of what the a posteriori is, and then this one becomes the a priori of the next one, and then etc., etc., etc., which means that we're consistently. Which means that we're consistently iterating the potential states. So we have one tree for each initial social state. That's what F4 reps. I'm going to talk really quickly about one way in which we've used this exactly in the COVID for to model the COVID crisis. We took indicators based on indicators based on our theoretical model. We try to match what we believed, what these variables, what these theoretical characteristics of social change with observed variables and we fed them to our algorithm and obtained a model that looks like this. Here on the x-axis. Yes. No, x, y, yes. Here. Here, we won't do a differential equation. We're still at x and y. Here we have the different societal states that were postulated. Here we have time. And each one of these represents the most likely state at that very event. And what we see here is that we're modeling in the United States, the model says that it's starting an incredible social change, and then when lockdown was And then, when lockdown was, when the increase in the virus was in the air, we moved towards dramatic social change with lockdown. It came back into some level of incremental social change, shifts to dramatic social change, again during lockdown and finally coming back into incremental social change with a similar pattern in Canada, except that we started in stability, which offers a slightly different pattern of models in time. Models in time. I also want to say that if you have questions about the modeling, Jean-Marquin helped us actually did all the coding and everything, so maybe he's here to answer questions. We also did, and I can explain you the results after if you want, but we also did it in different contexts such as Cubita and election, like trying to predict with the algorithm does it match actual move from democracy to autocracy or vice versa using independent. Versa using independent indicator, and the result says that it's yes, so there's some sort of validity we can say to what you are doing, but also using the algorithm to different contexts of change, not just COVID or because social change, when people try to predict it, sometimes they often focus on one type of change, such as armed conflict, and then they go and dig into that concept. Text, but we are. Concept text, but we argue that we can understand social change more broadly. So, in the past, what we've done is try to understand social change and to conceptualize it. The theory I presented to you includes more than 5,000 papers that we have read through this abstract and then the papers by themselves, both in sociology and in psychology, to understand what those characters kind of just from our minds, unfortunately. And then we model the algorithm. And then we model the algorithm. Now we're more in the validation phase. We try to understand also the consequences of social change and can our algorithm help us to understand more those consequences such as well-being. And we did some simulations. And in the future, we would like to keep anticipating social change, maybe more far in the future, looking more at the consequences. Looking more at the consequences and include notions of collective memory. I'm not sure we define it the same way. For us, memory is more like events in the past of a group that might influence more the trajectory or the narrative of a collective history. So can we include that into the algorithm? Because even if you're in a stability state, maybe if you have a past of colonization, well, maybe that's going to play something. Maybe that's gonna play something if you have not had it. And maybe we want to basically create a toolbox for deciders so they can use that to when an event occurs, maybe in a community or before doing a social before doing a a change, let's say in an organization, implementing a change, sorry, then they can use the algorithm and try with the Algorithm and try with different parameters of the indicator to actually look if it makes sense or not to do that change and maybe change the bit the pace or the other parameters. So thanks for listening to you to us and if you have questions.
