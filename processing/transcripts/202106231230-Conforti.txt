Which is certainly a topic I'm interested in. It's one of the ways I got into off-model transport. So, looking forward for the talk. Go ahead. Okay. Thank you very much, Aaron, for the kind introduction. And also, I would like to thank the speakers both for inviting me and for helping me in switching the time of my talk around since I had some scheduling issues for the speakers had anything to do with. The speakers had anything to do with this, Jovan. No, I'm joking. Yeah, you said I thank the speakers, but oh, sorry, so I thank the organizer. Yeah. Yeah, not the speakers. Sorry. Well, anyways, I thank everybody. I mean, it's very nice to be here. So let's make it this way. Sorry. Okay. So I'm going to talk about a class of Hamilton-Jacobi equations that arise in connection with the Schrodinger problem. In connection with the Schrodinger problem. And in particular, I'm going to discuss uniqueness of solutions, so the so-called comparison principle. But before doing this, let me give some motivation. So why did we come to this? First of all, let me recall something that has been discussed extensively through the conference, which is duality. So we have the So, we have the probably the most famous one, the Mosh-Kantorovich duality, which asserts that the squared Vassersten distance is in duality with Emil-Jacobi. So essentially, the Vassersten distance between mu and mu is the supremum over nice enough test functions phi of the expectation of phi zero against mu minus the expectation of phi against mu, where phi zero. Against nu, where phi zero is just the propagation, the backward propagation of phi along the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Then we come to the classical Schrodinger problem, so independent particles, Brownian motion. And you, well, one of the various ways in which you can rewrite the duality result is the following. So you take exactly the same statement that you had before. That you had before. But now, in order to get the entropic cost instead of Wasserstein, you have to propagate along Hamilton-Jacobi-Belvand. So you will pick up another Laplacian here. Okay, so of course, duality is a very rich concept. It has plenty of nice applications. So you would like to get similar results also for the more general class of Schrodinger problems that you get. Of Schrödinger problems that you get if you go back to the original thought experiment by Schrodinger, and instead of taking the cloud of independent particles, you take a cloud of interacting particles. In this case, there is not really an explicit way to obtain a static formulation of the problem. Let me remark that the static formulation of both Moshkantorovich and Schrodinger. Morskantorovich and Schrodinger are kind of essential in order to write down this duality results. And I guess the intuition to see this is that both in optimal transport and in the classical transport, once a particle knows where she starts and where she has to end, she will either follow a straight line or a Brownian bridge, but she doesn't have to coordinate with the other particles. And somehow, if you turn on the And somehow, if you turn on the interaction in the particle system, then she will have to do so. So the reduction to the static problem is not really clear. But still, you would like to get some kind of duality result. So you can resort to an optimal control approach. So the idea, which I'm going to explain in the next slides, is that you can obtain a duality result if you interpret the fluid dynamic formulation. Interpret the fluid dynamic formulation of the Schrödinger problem that you're looking at as a control gradient flow problem, and then you leverage the machinery of control in order to get a duality result. Let me to fix ideas. Let me give one example of these Schrodinger problems with interacting particles, which is the mean field Schrodinger problem. And you see that it's in its Benam-Muconier formulation, you can interpret it as the problem of steering. Has the problem of steering the gradient flow of the energy that you get summing up the entropy plus the interaction. You steer it through a control psi, you pay for the size of the control effort, and you have to join new. And this is the picture that is quite recurrent in the talks we have seen so far. So the Schrödinger problem is in general terms a problem where you steer known dynamics to steer non-dynamics towards a target law, trying to make minimum
