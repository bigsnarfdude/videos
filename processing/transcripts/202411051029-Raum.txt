Fourth key load speaker, Seven Rong, I'm sorry. And he's going to talk about Carmen Sa Vitebra, so from the Pomui Vitebra point of view. Thank you. Thanks to the organizers for inviting me. And thanks to Lufthansa for giving me extra time to prepare this talk. I was a bit surprised to get asked for a talk specifically on full emissions, but thinking about it, I think it's a great. But thinking about it, I think it's a great opportunity because, exactly, of this problem session, we have learned a lot in Feast Dialog, I think, how to do mainly classification there from the Ponamus Brows world. And it has been a whole endeavor to transfer some of the ideas that were put in place in the 70s, 80s in Phonemus Bras to the Feast Algeria world. And actually, it would be a very nice thing to do a similar thing for Atan, subaltern, and true points. Town subalterras and truepoids because theory in phonulturas is at a different level. We are looking at non-amanable phonometeras because the amenable case has been settled for so long and we understand it really well. And it's a whole different set of techniques that one uses in phonometer. So I want to tell you a little bit about what happened before in the 80s. There are still some questions that one can produce from the amenable case, Severe. Case there, which are not at all solid in the C-star rubber for coupoids. And then move on to what happened after the 2000s with Soren's deformation rigidity and all the results that we have in this direction. Trying to give you some inspiration for type of questions one could consider and type of specific problems one might run as test cases to develop techniques. Because there are some specific Some specific methodological problems that we have when trying to do things in C-styles bus because a lot of the machinery that runs in Panama Brus doesn't work at all in C-styles bus at the moment and it would be good to change that. So this is an overview of my talk. I will first get you a little bit of the notations. I mean notations are a little bit different in phonemic browser and I wasn't exactly sure how much phonometrus everybody knows. Sure, how much for Names Bros everybody knows. But I thought, like, let's better play it safe than sorry and say something about the background. Then I will talk about problems about phonemes-bright Cartan sub-algebras that have been considered. And not less important, certainly those problems that have been solved with Cartan sub-algebras. Because, like, Cartan sub-algebras are such an important piece of structure of a phonalgebra that you can use it in all kinds of That you can use it in all kinds of different situations to prove, for example, super-rigidity results for groups which have nothing to do a priori with group points, right? So I wanted to talk about that. And then I just, if I remember correctly, I just selected two problems. I didn't want to swamp because this is a long list of problems, but just selected two which I think were actually interesting in the phonemics robot and can still also give some inspiration. We next start with the definition. A ponometric is just a sub-ameter of V of H for a complex Silvert space to be separate points and satisfy the bicommutant of M equal M. I mean this is a direct definition of it. You could also equally ask Splosdim topology of point-wise convergence on the Hilbert space if you prefer. So F prime is here just a notion for the commutant, like those elements. Like those elements of the operators on H that commute with every element in S. Okay, this is the commute. Okay, so important to know, if one wants to study Cartan sub address, how do the Belian ones look like? The typical example is L infinity of X acting on L2 of X, where you fix the measure, or some family of measures. I mean, like you can accommodate the non-separable case. Commutate the non-separable cases if you like, but I will very soon say everything will be separable from now on. So, this type of questions will, I mean, like you can ask them, I think it's reasonable, but most of the theory for non-bloods does not really work so well because measure theory is even so much more sensitive to non-separability than topology. So, now let's start with some basic decomposition theory. Phonomera, in contrast to a season. Phonometra, in contrast to a C-style drawer, can be completely described if you just know its simple factors. And a simple factor should be a little bit refined because it's actually not that. What you get is a direct integral decomposition. So you have a diffuse part of some measure space and you have to integrate fibers, and you get such a decomposition which is as unique as it could possibly be. That means if you have two families of von Neumann-Brush, MX. Fonnomen's brass and x, which are factors, meaning their center is trivial, and give you the same algebra as direct integral over this measured length. Well, almost everywhere they have to be the same, so isomorphic, right? And this space x that I take here, which I integrate, is just sort of the underlying space of the sensor Wafen-Gelfan duality as such. I cannot just take characters on it. So, in order to avoid So in order to avoid long theory formation, I just say L infinity of X isomorphic is it. Okay. So far so good. I reduced my theory to factors. I'm happy. Now we're working only with simple objects. I mean for von algebra, a factor is exactly a simple von algebra. Those where the closed two-sided ideas were actually only the trivial ones. That's just a way that is phrased much quicker. And it's common. And it's come. For algebra, there is a time classification, a little bit analogue to stably finite versus purely infinite, with the difference that it actually works. Every fun algebra. I mean, you don't need any regularity assumption. Every vector will be of exactly one of those types. Type 1, type 1 2, 1, type 2 infinity, and type 3. This is a refinement of type 3 for which I don't care because modular theory. Because modular theory allows you to reduce basically any question you could have about a type 3 factor to a type 2 infinity factor, and then you cut it down by a projection, which is finite, and you end up with a 2,1 factor. Type 1 factors are not so interesting, that's just your age. You have to ask much finer questions in order to get interesting questions here. That's not really part of Von Neumann network theory, I would say, anymore. So, for us, this means. So, for us, this means we reduced all considerations to type 2.1 factors. Okay, type 2.1 factor, and now let me give you the definition because so far everything is black boxed, that's an infinite dimensional factor emitting a non-zero tracial state. Okay, so that's objects. People have been mostly concerned with since the 2000s with all this deformation rigidity theory. Theory. Now let's go to Cartan subalgebras. So a Cartan subalgebra in a phonalgebra, it's a bit of an easier. You have this maximum and the median self-adjoint sub-algebra. Some people forget to stay self-adjoint. And you get a normal faithful conditional expectation down. And now the regularity condition is a little bit easier because you just require that a unitary normalizer generates a phenomenon. Okay. There is a slight difference to the von Emmaj bar between the von Emer and the C-star. 4-2-1 factors that are the ones that we are interested in, the condition expectation exists automatically, so no problem there, and it's actually going to be unique. And if you want to look, and there are good reasons to do that, at Cartan sub-algebras in other types, but type 2. Of algebra in other types, but type 2.1. Luckily, modular theory is very compatible with that. That's ensured by the fact that you have this conditional expectation, and you can also reduce these problems to the 2.1 case. In theory, in practice, it's sometimes really useful to still do things in type 3 case, but then everything would get much more technical, and I prefer to tell you stories which are kind of key. This unitary normalizer, you could do it slightly differently, like you could take the partial normalizer, so partial isomorphism. Partial normalizer, so partial isometries that normalize A, or the stable normalizer, as we call it. That's what you do in C-star plus usually. So based C-stars and things. Right, now two examples. So the group measure space construction, that's a cross-product over a Lebelian phoneme. That's what I describe here. And I just give you this definition because I will do an analogue also later for equivalent relations. Do an analog also later for equivalence relations and so on, then we know what we're talking about. So you have a crude gamma. It's acting in this case on a measurable space. Measurable space means you have a Boyle space, well, equipped with a sigma drawer, and you fix a measure class. And probably you want to have your measurable space also right away standard, like kind of take a Borel subset of 0, 1 with some reasonable measure class, the integral. Some reasonable measure class, the interval 0, 1. That's the thing that you want to think of. And your transformation should be non-singular. That means they preserve that measure class. A measure of a set is zero before transforming it by a group element, if and only if it's after doing the so. And in this case, you can construct that phenomenal algebra, and most conveniently it's defined, I think, in terms of the unique phonology. In terms of the unique fundamental that is generated by a copy of L infinity of x, the unitaries ug that are multiplicative and conjugate functions the way you would expect. Top g is the left action that just takes, if you could evaluate at points f to the function that takes an x and evaluates at g to the minus x, right? I mean, just the usual action you have, with a real difference you cannot evaluate pointwise in this setup. In this setup. Okay, then there's this conditional expectation that you require. That makes the whole thing unique then, and it should restrict to the phrase on the unitaries. So a unitary UG is sent to one if and only if that group element was the unit of the group, and otherwise it's zero. And so on that part, the sub-function that's generated by the UG, there you get the UG trace. And that fixes the construction already. And that fixes the construction already. It's like a distract on the characterization of the refused cross product. And if you have a free ergodic action, and free is a little bit short for what I would call essentially free, every proof element has a fixed point set of measure zero. Then you can do this cross-product construction and you get a Cartan sub-algebra inclusion. L infinity of x is going to be Cartan inside. Is going to be Cartan inside, and that's now very easy to check. You have the conditional expectation just from the start, it's a short argument using Fourier coefficients to show that it's maximally Belian, and then you have the regularity to split in, because that's exactly the condition here. So, this is the carton. I guess so far, nothing surprising. This cross product is type 21. It's an MVP action, probably as a measure-preserving, meaning that in the class of Meaning that in the class of this, there is a probability measure that is preserved by the action. Okay? That's a clarification. Type 21. So these are the actions that people are looking a lot at in fundamental theory, probability measure preserving, free anti-golic. Okay, but if we wanted to look at Cartranza, obviously group actions won't suffice. So now we're going to update everything to equivalence relations because that's a correct analog of... Correct analog of topologically principled groupoids. So we define right away a 2-1 equivalence relation. A 2-1 equivalence relation is an equivalence relation on a, let's now say, standard probability measure space. I fix my probability measure in a class so that things are not like they exist something. I just want to have that measure fixed already. And this should be just a measurable subset of x times x. This is much easier. Of x times x. This is much easier than in the target report case. Just take the subspace Borel structure. The orbits are countable. That's a built-in separability condition. Just by the way, in here, standard probability measure space means that it's countably separated. So this is also a suitable, separable object. And every partial automorphism whose graph lies in the Groupon solution must preserve the probability guideline. The probability measure. The way one would, I mean, this is one of two typical ways one defines probability measure preserving. It corresponds to bisections to preserve the probability measure, if you will. And then you want to have it ergodic in the sense that if you take any subset and you ask it to be saturated, so if it contains one point, it contains a whole orbit, right? Then this set must be. Then this set must be either conul or null. Right, this is the correct thing. Invariant subsets are null or con-so that's the correct replacement for GDC. Okay, and you see like a few simplifications occur compared to the topological setup, but essentially it's really like an etal topological principle coupoid, or for that matter, principle if you like, even. So that's just a measurable setup, translated from things you know. Measurable setup, translated from things you might know or should know. And the countability assumption, I mentioned that already, this is just for measure theoretical reasons. I mean, it's a standard assumption, which gives zero, just separable phonometer one. Okay, so you can produce such an engraving relation from a group action, take any ergodic and PMT action, not necessarily free, and just doing the naive thing will give you a 21. thing will give you a two-month equivalence relation. So you don't have to assume any freeness. The nice thing is in the measurable category you can quotient out the isotropy as such in contrast to the topological coupoid setup where you take the theory of the isotropy, get a non-trivial extension possibly. These extensions just are trivial, so this is what you actually want to do. And it's a result of Felderman and Moore that every two-bonne equivalence relation is of this kind. Is of this kind. I mean, we can do this in a larger framework of measured equivalence relations, but in particular, two one-equivalence relations are obtained like this. So we are often happy to just choose a group action that implements our equivalence relation, and we have these nice little group elements lying around, right? I mean, this means like we have global sections. This is good. That's what it means in the topological setup. Right, okay, that's what I. Right, okay, that's what I already said. This is just a topologic analog, you take a effective quotient. Okay, the Feldman-Muhr theorem is like basically the perites or measure theoretic analog of the Renault reconstruction theorem, or Kumjan-Reno, probably. So you take an aqua's relation to one, right? And then you could associate Then you could associate the Fonham trial to it first. I suppress for the moment physics because that just makes the notation more messy. And I think if I say in the end you could just amend the whole construction with the cosycle, then everybody will be happy with me still. The same construction as before. You take this copy of L infinity of x, and this time you take partial isometries from the full group, I mean the partial full group. Partial group that just implement the corresponding action for all F. I wrote it this way so that I don't have to take care of the support conditions. And then you have to give this conditional expectations. This time it gets a little bit more difficult in the sense that you don't have just your one, but you just get the indicator function on the fixed points. And all this is well defined. Thanks to the measurable category, everything is a little bit easier going. I can just write out these formulas. And then you get a cut answer by drawing. Okay, as I said, I will now just throw a code cycle in there. The only place where you have to add this code cycle is at this attribute multiplicative. There, the partial isometries will multiply, taking the code cycle into account, and that would give a more complicated formula and would prohibit me from just writing multiplicative. So I just Just writing multiplicative, so I just said, like, I will tell you, you can do it. And Felman Moore told us that every Carton sub algebra to one factor actually arises this way, and it uniquely does so. It's not stated like this in the original paper, but this is a condition, obviously, functorial for isomorphisms. So, isomorphisms of equivalence relations will be reflected in isomorphisms that preserve the Cartan sub-algebra for two-one factors. Exactly what you expect and what hope. Factors, exactly what you expect and would hope for. So we are good. Questions about cross-functional address are also questions about equivalence relations. And now we go to theory development. Now we have set up the basic framework and we can start to ask questions. The one major question people are in phonometry must ask is: how unique is my Cartan subalgebra? How many are there in this type of questions? Okay? And in the highest. Okay? And in the hyperfinite one factor, this was the first type of results we got. Perdman and Moore state this as a theorem. They use basically the arguments of Henry Duet. There's a unique hyperfinite 2,1 equivalence relation. A hyperfinite equivalence relation is one that is an increasing union of equivalence relations with finite orbits. Those won't be type 2, 1, right? Oh. Oh, this makes me think I stated the wrong definition. Sorry, I should write infinite orbits. Orbits of R are infinite countable. Sorry. I could excuse myself and say, of course, it's countable. I meant infinite, but I didn't. This was a mistake. Infinite countable. Sorry. But then you get this two-month equivalence relation, and that's unique. This is the analogue to results of Marian phoneme. Results of Marian phenomenon prove that the hyperfinite one factor is unique. I think this has been abundantly advertised in the C-Science R community that there's just different steps. That we do look at hyperfinite objects first, do the stuff there, then prove that the general object was hyperfinite and there the classification result applies, right? It's a structure result plus a concrete classification result. And the same was done in the equivalence relation setup Khan, Feldman, and Wei. Set up Khan, Feldman, and Weiss proved a bit later that every amenable to one equivalent relation is hyperphytic. Amenable could mean different things here. There's this notion of simmer, of like measurable crew points and amenability for that. That is one notion if Kern Fredman Weiss did their own very crewpinition of amenability, where you require basically a measurably varying family of means on the orbit. But either of these in this setup is luckily equivalent. There is no question about what's our right definition of almond ability in such situations. And this means, if we take into account what Feldman and Moore told us, that the hyperfinite to one factor has a unique Cartran subalgebra up to conjugacy by an automorphism. Conjugacy up to automorphism means I have an automorphism that is defined on Is defined on the factor, in this case, I hyperfine it to one factor, and it carries one cartan that I gave you to another cartan that I gave you. That's uniqueness of the contributibility automorphism. Okay, but so that's the first classification results we had in the 80s for Cartanza-Algebras in Vonami Bras. Okay, let me just take the time. Good. So that's the contribution up to automorphisms. But contributing up to automorphisms is not the right notion. And this is despite the good result in the amenable case. And this should be a warning. In Fonbrash, this is not the right notion. We can't really classify Cartan's up to automorphisms in a reasonable way. I will make this precise on this slide. Conjugacy up to innovisms is the right thing. Why? Because that's conjugacy up to conjugacy. Controversy. Yeah, sort of, but I mean, like, it's, it's, it has more like, like, there's a logic reason for that. I mean, like, one can actually make this precise. So there are two results that illustrate this well, I think. So the first one is like, okay, let's take it separable. One factor, separable in this setup does not mean that this phenomenon is separable as in a topological space. It means that it can. Space, it means that it can act on a separable Hilbert space, okay? Basefully. So, just in order to prevent any confusion, we say separable for Neurobra, but we do not mean separable as in topological space. It means either the pre-dual is separable or it can act on a separable space. Anyway, that's a technical aspect which should be clarified, though. But then you can make several statements about classification of GATAN server numbers. Like Stefan at the time is. Like Stefan at the time, with one of the students, they proved that the space of Cartan subatquas is actually standard Borel when you look at it in the space of like the F-verse Borel space. You represent for, I mean, one way to look at it is you represent your von algebra faithfully on the Hilbert space, then you have the F-verse Borel structure on all von algebra sub-algebras of B of H, and you look at that subspace, that standard Borel. And this is probably the one and unique Borel structure that we reasonably want to put on sub-algebra of a phonograph. And what they could prove, they could prove much more, but in this context, the important thing is that the equivalence relation of unitary contiguancy, meaning contuguency as in classical contiguancy, is actually a Borel equivalence relation. Actually, a Borel equivalence relation. The subset in x times x is a Borel subset. Okay, and that's good because this means logicians are happy with this. They can tell us much more about the fine structure of such equivalence relations, and we can ask much finer questions. This is not the case if you look at contributing up to automorphisms, because there are examples of two-one factors which are separable, where this equivalence relation is what one would call complete analytics. Is what one would call complete analytic. This means if you have any analytic equivalence relation, so an equivalence relation where this image is not Borel, but it's a subjective image on the Borel map of a Borel equivalence relation, that's the definition of analytic. Any such equivalence relation can be embedded as a Borel spectrum, I mean as a equivalence relation. Okay, so this is the worst possible thing you could expect. It's universal for a large Universal for a large class of equivalence relations that you don't really understand about it. I mean, it's not that logicians don't find this interesting, but they just cannot say much, I mean, as much about it as with the Borel setup. So this is the setup that we are looking for. Okay? So there's a good mathematical reason why unitary conjugacy is actually the right notion here. Difference in the two contrasts. Oh, yeah. So, in unitary contributes, I want to have contributes by an inner automorphism of the phonograph. I want to have a unitary in my phonograph such that if I take u u star, a u a u star, I do get b versus the exists. There exists an alpha in the automorphism group of M, such that alpha of A is a physical. This obviously implies this one, because a reno-automorphism is an automorphism, but the other implication just has no reason to hold it, and it gives really a stark contrast when you start to ask questions about classification. Okay, so I have no intention. I have no intuition, unfortunately, about whether in the setup of amendable these algebra and amendable topological coupoids, automorphism or unitary conjugacy is the right notion. Maybe approximately in a is the right thing, that's a compromise that one often has to make in these algebra, but I wanted to point out that this might be actually relevant if one wants to be. This might be actually relevant if one wants to do classification results. Even in the manable case, it's not completely clear to me what the writing is. Having said that, I forgot to remark, of course, in terms of open problems. I mean, of course, there are justification results for certain actions, like Jordano Putnam's Kauf, for example. This is, I guess, a prototype of such type of classification. Guess a prototype of such type of classification results, but there is a lot of marking skill. We don't have a very good machinery even to make a conjecture about how a classification of amendable topological principle coup points, which are minimal, probably, would look like, right? I mean, there's no setup whatsoever to formulate even a reasonable conjecture there, analog to an Elliott conjecture. Because in the fundamental setup, we have a one-to-one analogy, we have a unique type-to-one. Analogy. We have a unique type to one hyperfinite or unique to one amendable factor and a unique cartan. The classification works. Of course, it's silly because it's one object up to isomorphism, but there is a classification. I think like in C-Statquas, one might want to look a little bit more into classification problems also on this demandable setup, purely from a topological crewpoint point of view, not only from dynamical systems. Okay, back to this one. Um any questions so far? Uh no this was a mandatory pause to let anybody everybody prize including me and this had a good reason because now we're doing modern stuff like anything we did since the 2004 number is either free probability based or like deformation rigidity based and I I think for probability theory has a lower chance to be transferred to these algebra, so I will basically exclusively talk about deformation theory rigidity motivated and proven results that use deformation rigidity. And the first thing is one more methodological reason why unitary contribule for cartridge of altruists is the right notion to look after. And this is what goes by the name of intertwining by bimodules. Name of intertwining by bimodules was introduced by Thorin in a paper of 2006 where actually Cartan sub-algebras were in the focus. And I give the definition only for those here, or I give characterizations for those here, for Cartan sub-algebras. It works for arbitrary subfound algebras, and it's really important in theory, but it would be a little bit too much and wouldn't serve any purpose here to do that. The point is the following: if you have two Cartan sub-algebra of a If you have two Cartan subaltras of one factor, then you get a hands-on characterization for unitary conjugacy. You know that A is unitary conjugate to B if and only if one of the following two conditions is satisfied. These are equivalent, actually. One I post here to get a little bit of a feeling in how far unitary contributes is on the first place weakened. The second one is what you actually work with. One is what you actually work with. So the first one says: actually, the only thing that you have to do is sort of implement via partial isometry homomorphism between the two on some corners. That's all you need to do. If you have that, you get unitary contributions. Dact already tells you the squirrel. You can do things very locally. Patching works in for Number Braffs often automatically. In C style brush, this would be a technical obstacle. Would be a technical obstacle because patching requires to overcome some technical conditions with regards to covering dimension or some other sort of approximation issues. The other one is that you just get a certain sort of analytic condition. These are unitarily conjugate if and only if there's no net of unitaries UI. net of unitaries UI that in a sense moves A I mean sorry witnesses that A moves far away from B or is far away from B. More specifically you look at the conditional expectation from the fundamental M onto B. There's a unique one variant to one factor setup, so that's good. And you look at the following type of expressions, ui, and you multiply from the left and right with elements, arbitrary elements from m and And then you take the conditional expectation and the two norm, and this would go to zero for that net UI. If no such net exists, that's already sufficient to get unitary contributions. And now you see like you have a proof strategy. The typical way you use this is, well, assume for the sake of getting a contradiction that they are not unitarily conjugate, then there is a net of unitarily. Then there is a net of unitary CUI that satisfies this, and then you work with this. This is the way you work with intertwining by biometrics for natural distribution. Okay? You want your projections to be non-zero in the. I probably want to, yeah. Okay. Okay, good. Yeah, non-zero projections. Okay. And the way I stated it's also non-zero partial isometry V. Let's just fix that single condition V should be non-zero. Okay, what I just said was this last condition can be checked in practice, actually, right? Okay, as far as I know, there's nothing that even resembles closer, I mean, even from distance, anything like intertwining by bimodules in the C-style program. I might be wrong here. The C-style program. I might be wrong here. I'm not a classification person, but I think this is a piece of methodology that really has to be developed if one wants to transfer some of the results and ideas from the Fundamental Robbery to a C-stat robbery. And there will be probably more obstructions. There will be, as I just said, probably obstructions coming from some approximation, and there might be obstructions coming from a K-theoretic nature. I mean, this is a typical thing you assume or expect. You think you assume or expect. But I don't even have a candidate. It's a few years ago that I thought about how one could do this for the last time. But there's no good formulation that I could come up in the few times I tried. But this would be a very interesting piece of methodology. Okay, so this is intertwining by biomarkers usually combined with the actual deformation rigidity type of argument, and this Type of arguments, and this is what I'm going to explain next. Okay, so deformation rigidity does, as the name suggests, oppose two things: deformation with some rigidity property. And what does this mean more formally? I mean, like, formally, deformation is usually, let's say, a sequence or family of maps indexed over the reals that has something like the following property. I take the easiest version here now. This is sometimes the correct thing to do. Certainly, in the very early papers, this was. Certainly, in the very early papers, this was exactly how it was done. A deformation over a C-star, sorry, sub-fonometric A, think of it as a Cartan, sub-baltra idea, would consist of a sequence of UCP maps, normal CUCP maps, I should write, phi M, which converge point-wise in two-norm, so strong operator topology, two-norm, it's all the same in this case, to the identity, but But they are small outside of A. And this is usually formulated in sort of an orthogonality type of property. You can, in phonology, always look at the two-space, and then you could look at the orthogonal complement of the sub-algebra, and on that one, it should actually decay fast. So it's, I mean, like the original examples of this came from this Hobart property that was mentioned in the last talk. If you have a group with a Haubert property and you take a semi-diagnostic cross-product, so it's a group measure space construction with that, then the Cartan, the group measure space Cartan that you have in there will admit some deformation like this, because you could take the positive pipe functions, use the Fourier multipliers, and just multiply Fourier coefficients with the corresponding number coming from your positive pipe function. Coming from your positive height function. And since it's a C0 function, this will be a map which is compact over A in a suitable sense. That is one instance of being small outside of A. It's compact over A, where compact over A have to be still formulated correctly, but all this is getting a little bit technical. You should really just have in mind, like compactness must get into a relative notion, then you can use it. Okay? Yeah? Question. These CP maps, are their domain their domain and range is L, right? Yeah. Okay. And the identity is in A? Yeah, yeah. What the identity is in S? To the identity, it's an identity map on M. Okay. So the following condition should be satisfied. So for all M in M, phi n of M converges into norm to N. Well, that's the condition I mean, that's the point was. Thank you. Any other questions? Sorry, I'm aware that keeping things without formal definitions is also a challenge, but keeping things with a formal definition is another type of challenge. So this is a post with some rigidity property, and this usually is taking the following form. You have some sub-algebra B, and you should really think of this as the other. And you should really think of this as the other cartridge. And this one is rigid in a way. Namely, that whenever you have a family of UCP maps that converge pointwise to the identity, then it should actually usually converge uniformly on the unit ball. That's a much stronger type of convergence. So the rigidity property allows you to update information on point-wise convergence to uniform convergence on a specific Uniform convergence on a specific subaltery, or its unit ball rather. And uniform estimates, then you can work with this infusion. Because, I mean, the typical argument in the Fonaldo is you do an infimum over a certain scalar product and have to prove that it's non-zero. And if something converges uniformly, then this uniformity will happen to help you to control the infimum, right? That's exactly the way you use these things. You usually do some. You usually do some expression like a scalar product that reflects in something like m phi n, I assume z, what? That you a b and here the n. This type of expression you you would usually control and and then uniform convergence will make it possible to let B run uniformly or run over the whole unit ball of B. Or run over the whole unit ball of B, and that will usually show you that some element in a Hilbert space must be non-zero. This is a way that this is continued, but that starts to get a little bit technical. I mean, just want to indicate why uniform convergence is such an important thing here. The source of this rigidity is, I mean, in the literature, there are basically two types of rigidity that we frequently use. Frequently use. One is of the nature of property T, like property T of groups. And this was the first example that Sorin used, which is HT Tartan sub algebra, where you actually took the cross product of the colour. Just the two torus with SL2 set acting. That's just the group phoneme of this one. And we know, I mean, this is the typical example of a group that has relative property T. So one should think that everything over this has a property T, sort of. And at the same time, this group has the Hogo property. So these were the two things that he played out against each other, and showing that. Against each other, and showing that any Cartan that is Ht has sort of the Hobbit property and is relatively property T also at the same time would automatically be conjugate to the standard Cartan and that was the first uniqueness type of results for Cartan. For a special class, right? I mean like things started out small but it held at the time. The good result, I mean the good consequence about this one was L to Betty numbers were suddenly an invariant of that phenomenon bar. This was in. Uninvariant of that phenomenon. Well, this was important at the time. Okay, so this is a basic setup of deformation rigidity. Any questions about that? I'm happy to explain more, but I mean, it always gets technical very quickly. Okay, then let's leave it there and add an additional thing. It would be not the complete truth if I told you that this is how deformation rigidity is used. Deformation rigidity is used, and this is the most like how to say, like, birds perspective description you could give. But in practice, another condition is extremely important. It's often not explained if people tell you about deformational rigidity. And that's the point that you need some handle on your sub-algebra beyond just a deformation. And this is what is in the literature usually a weak compactness or so. Compactness or so. Weak compactness is a property that generalizes the following type of situation. Let's say you have a group gamma and let's say this is either profinite or the following thing happens, the image of the action map has a relative compact image. This is a compact action. We would call that like this. Call that like this, and weakly compact is a little bit of weakening of that. It has the interesting equivalent characterization in terms of such an inclusion being co-amenable in the phonometric world. And then now this rings probably much more of a bell why this could be relevant. This one is more of a technical nature, one feels, oh, compactness, okay, it feels nice, but how would I work with that? But if I take Work with that. But if I tell you that such a C, such a Cartan algebra is weakly compact in David, and only if the whole algebra is, if this is co-amandable, meaning that the whole algebra is mandible relative to L to A, then this is something that one really starts to feel we can play with this. Because the typical games are: you have a manable phonomas, sub-altras, and you play with all the theory that we know about how mannable T behaves, and you play it out. Behaves and you play it out against usually like how certain approximations can work or not. Okay, so this week compactness is a very important thing that should not be forgotten. If one ever wants to implement any scheme like this, one should really start with pro-finded actions also, probably. Okay, and yeah, pro-finded actions historically were also the first ones where one could get a good classification result for arbitrary cut-hands. That was Saba Popal. That was Osaba Popa. Take the free group, take a profile at action. I mean, actually free group, take a free profile at action. It's always probability measure preserving. It's always ergodic, so that's fine. Then, the group measure space construction has a unique card-hands up algebra up to unitary contributions. Okay? So, this was the first plain uniqueness result for Cart-Hanshab algebra. And weak compactness came from the fact that the free crudes have this complete metric approximation property that you use in order to cut down on finite parts, like a little bit of a strengthening, I mean a severe strengthening of the agent. Okay, so let's talk about group meta space Calthan-Basque. I want to forgot to put plain. Ah, forgot to put plain. One thing I want to talk about is what other methods beyond just deformation rigidity as a setup do we use? Where do we get extra information about the Cartan sub-algebra from and how is it exploited roughly? So one thing that one can frequently prove is uniqueness of good measure space Cartan sub-advas, because we can take Fourier coefficients, for example. But let me just say that a Cartan that arrives. Like a cartan that arises from such an inclusion, that's called a Group measure space cartan. Okay, so this is just the name for it. And this means you can take Fourier coefficients. If you have an x, you take x u g star, and take the conditional expectation. This allows you to study Fourier coefficients and their properties. The typical type of questions you ask is then, let's say we have another algebra, like another Cartan. I look at an I look at an element in the air. Okay, let's take the Fourier coefficients and let's look at how large the true norm of a single coefficient can be. If one calculate a lower bound on that, that it's relatively large compared, I mean, if you look at it from the Kubeta space cut on point of view, then often one gets a conjugacy result because intertwining. Intertwining by modules will essentially reduce to computing Fourier coefficients. Okay, I mean, like, look at this, like, let's say B is a group measure space data. I take arbitrary elements from M, well, write them as finite sums over like a function times the UG. The functions draw out of the conditional expectation, so what is remaining is the UGs. You put them to the other side, and then you see that you have actually three equals. And then you see that you have actually three coefficients there. Okay, so this is why we stepped in. Okay, the other thing is, and that's also something to keep in mind, there's a co-multiplication around. So what you could do is, in order to understand structural results of such group measure space constructions, is you could actually look at the co-multiplication that basically embeds that infinity part just in the first practice. They are the infinity part just in the first fracture of such a tensor product, but on the group part, it's the standard co-multiplication that one sees on the group algebra, Eugene Tensor Eugene. That map can be sometimes used in the following way. You look at your Cartanza alphalgebra, and here you map it forward with delta, and you actually study whether it embeds in something else on this side, which will be a much stronger result than just making it embed into a suitable subalgebra here. Okay, so this is usually the way. So, this is usually the way this mechanism, this co-multiplication, would be used. And the type of results you would get from that are just already much stronger. Like you get, you need group measures based cut on sub-algebra. For example, for, I wanted to write something concrete. Don't bother if you don't see what this group is right away. It's an amalgamated product over some essentially three groups here over something like copy of set. Copy of set. You can do that much more generally, but this is a concrete example. And you take any free and mixing probability measure preserving action. Mixing is a strengthening orthodox. And then there was this unique group measure space cartan. The nice thing about these things was that you could take any free mixing probability measure preserving action and that it paired together with certain rigidity results for orbit equivalence relations. For orbit equivalence relations, because once you find the measure space Cartan and want to say, oh, I give myself another group measure space construction, and I assume just the Fonnemschmatt isomorphic, then your first step is to recover the Cartran subject. This is what I wrote explicitly. Once you have the Cartran sub-Arge, Feldman-Moore tells you the orbit equivalence relations of the thing, the ones that I denoted are of the action. And then you have to recover from that, the group action. The group action. That's a whole different story. That's also a very interesting question. But I think that would go far beyond one talk on CATANS, but then I can give another talk on that. But interestingly, this is the same type of technique. Sorry? Because you didn't say anything about X. Oh, it's just a standard probability measure space. That's a standard setup. Standard probability measure space. Just take the 0-1 interval with restricted in the back measure. 01 interval is restricted in the back measure. That's isomorphic to the one. There's a unique standard, the probability measure space that's what you use. That's why I say that's what you're learning about X, right? What do you mean? I mean there's space X, right? Where your gamma X, right? It's not necessarily like you're saying there about X. Every standard probability measure space that is diffused is isomorphic to the one that I told you. There's a conal set in such a space which is bijective to a conal set in the 0, 1, and the measure. In the 0, 1, and the measure class will be mapped to the measure class. So, in a way, x doesn't the structure of x doesn't make it. No, no, that's the nice thing about the measure theory setup. Like, the topology, as I mean, like, the topology is sometimes a problem, right? We don't have this issue. It's a unique standard probability measure state sets diffuse. Yeah, there's a unique point. Because too, if you look at the gamma which you now have, right, there are certain restrictions or where you can access gamma from the From the doctrine, right? Not really. I mean, you can, I mean, like on the measurable setup, there's no restriction, right? I mean, like, any action that you write down on a standard probability measure space, and anything that you write down anyway will be a standard probability measure space unless you do an effort to not get one. But then you have up to isomorphism with zero one interval. But it's still kind of mixing of every. Yeah, in these resides, we still have to use mixing in the second topic. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, mixed thing is, I mean, like Bernoulli shifts would be fine, but Bernoulli shifts had been long-treated already. Not for W star super rigidity, because there we don't have the orbitative rolls rigidity results. In contrast, Bernoulli shifts are far from rigid there. But yeah, it's just. Yeah, no, no, no worries. So I mean, that's good. I should have maybe said that there's a unique one. The topology is really like kicked out. It's really about. It's really about it's much more groupy in the sense. Okay, the other type of result that one gets with this one in Popaba used this Fourier coefficient techniques. Adrian Jana used this co-multiplication thing and he could get such a result for these theory actions of profit groups. Okay, so next actions on the So, next question. Oh, yeah, right, exactly. So, a next pattern from the theory in von Amsterboss. What do we learn about proving uniqueness of Cartan-Sabelsburg, proving contributions of Cartan-Sabelsburg? What actually happens is that one first proves a very strong absence of Cartan-Sabelsburg results, understands how this works correctly, and then one relativizes this and makes a relative argument which will prove uniqueness of Cartan for units. So the structure. The strong absence of Cartan subalgebras is something we call a strong solidity regime. And this has been relativized. Let me show concrete results that went along these lines. There was this result of Kipp van Sinkler in 2013 that if you have a hyperbolic group, then the group von Undebra is strongly solid. Let me give you the definition to see in how far the strengthens, absence of Hart-Hansabas, and in how far this. But and in how far this works well along the lines that I tried to indicate before. It requires that the normalizer, somehow I put a straight n, I don't know, the unitary normalizer here of a diffuse phenomenal subalgebra is amandable. Diffuse means there is no minimal projection, so any cartan will do that, at least in a to one factor. And amenable is amandability in the sense of analog words. In the sense of phonalgebras. So that means, since L gamma is not amenable as a phonograph, there cannot be any cartons because you would take A to be your hypothetical Cartan. It is diffused because it doesn't have any minimal projections. It's isomorphic to L infinity functions on that 0-1 integral, as I said, just explained. Then you look at the normalizer and the Fonamishwaite generates, and and that must be a n a metable Fonamishwaite sub algebra. So it must be a proper subalgebra of L gamma, right? Proper sub-algebra of L gamma, right? So this is the way you rule out existence in Lofkartrans. The good thing is, this allows for relativization. Diffuse for Nobel Drop algebras are exactly the ones that do not have an intertwining bimodule into the complex numbers. This is a very fancy way to express diffuse, but it helps you to relativize things. The typical way you would then do is like, oh, my sub-altar does not have an integer. Not have an intertwining bimolecule to a given Cartan subldera. That's the correct relativization of being diffuse. And amenable, I indicated that already, there is a notion of relative amenability, so that's the notion that you can get there. And if you do that and work very hard, then you get the corresponding uniqueness of Cartan-Sabatural results. Now, for any free adoric probability measure per serving action of a hyperbolic group. Hyperbolic group. Okay, so this was along these lines at one first really proves a very strong structural result for the group algebras and then gets a relative version that covers the halts of a quadruplace. So here again, where do the different ingredients come from? Okay, hyperbolicity allows you to get certain co-cycles of your group that through standard constructions in the field give you a deformation. Deformation. Then you have for hyperbolic groups, you do have weaker mannibility, that's the replacement, that gives you this weak compactness. And then the rigidity property is a little bit more difficult to explain. It sort of gets subsumed in all this business with relative amenable versus embedding in certain sub-algebras. Suddenly, one starts. Certain sub-algebras. Suddenly, one starts to play with these things and then you have to work hard and get this result. Okay? Okay. Right. Okay, this is a little bit about what one does with phonogras and their Cartan sub-algebras. Now I wanted to tell you a little bit about how Cartan sub-algebras actually used to get structural results on other phonogras, in particular group for algebra. In particular, group phonometers. So there's this notion of W star superrativity. It says, I mean, a group gamma, let's say, a group gamma, is W star superrativity. If given any other group that has an isomorphic group von algebra, already the two groups had to be isomorphic. So this colloquially is usually referred to as the group von algebra recovers the group. I guess they said you need one up to isomorphism. There are refinements of that which give this whole thing a little bit of a functorial touch. Any isomorphism between two groups on algebra comes essentially from group theoretical data plus an inner automorphism. And whenever you can prove this one, thanks to the techniques we have, you actually prove the other one. So Sorian came up with this formulation, which is a bit more in line with what we usually do in. A bit more in line with what we usually do in modern fundamental theory. And this is a very bold conjecture of Kant. He got inspired by lattices on higher end equipment, where in the 80s, there were all these rigidity besides most of rigidity, macro super rigidity, the arithmeticity rigor and all these things. And Kant said, well, I mean in Lacculus, in a Lie group, it's a little bit like a group in its uh pornometra, right? Ponametron, right? So there should be a certain rigidity around here, and let's go right away to the fullened conjecture or filter problem that any ICC property T group is W star subologic. Okay, so that was the conjecture from the AF from 82. Let me show you the first example of any W star suborbit group. This was more than 30 years later. So, Jonah Popavas used this. So Prabhas used this type of Cartan sub-algebra business in order to get their hands on the following type of groups. You look at iterated generalized ref products. Okay, a ref product is something where you take a group and another group, you take the first one as a direct sum indexed over the second one, and then you shift the indices and take a semi-direct product. That's a ref product. Product. That's a rest product. And now you can do a generalized rest product where you actually do not act on the group self but on cosets of that group. You had to do this several times, where you start with a certain amalgamated product and then to do two steps of generalized rest product and then you would get a group that is W starts to write it. This was the first example. I mean like it's a masterpiece. I mean like it's it's really like like complex there, but but it worked out. So the But it worked out. So you see in the setup of generalized REST products, these are generalized Bernoulli shifts, right? So the whole Cartran business was really key in there. No, no, they are the first group at all that were Super Richard, beyond the trivial group, I guess, and prime cyclic groups. I guess you don't count them. And they are not, I mean, the prime cyclic groups are not ICC. Groups are not ICC. But they do have properties. Okay, so the question you asked was answered a few years later. I do remember in 2016 it was. In AIM, we did discuss this type of problem. This was one of the major problems in the community. Let's find the first example of a group that at all contracts satisfies its contracts and Kifan, Niona, Osin and Sun, they managed to do this. Soon they managed to do this and found reasonably concrete groups. They come as extensions of such a thing. It's not a semi-direct product, but you do basically have this red product type of character of the group, but the group has property T. So this is a, I think Fernandez Weis were stunned when Dennis Ossin told them, like, yeah, there are groups like this. They're extensions, they look like REST products from that point of view. From that point of view, because the action of this lambda m here is, of course, via the initial shift. But they have property T groups. So this was the big surprise. And if you do this with certain hyperbolic groups with property T, I'm done in a minute or two. Should I just push it? No, or just split right. Maybe I just finish the slide and then so there you could find the first examples. Let me go very quickly over this one. So, another problem that could be solved was a problem about like it's a sort of problem about homology of phenomenal groups. So the conjecture is that whenever you have a group that has some positive algebraic number, then the corresponding group should have unique cartons of algebra up to conjugacy for any free algebraic. To contribute for any free adverticropility method for serving assets. Hopper-Waas proved this for the first algebraic number being positive plus a weaker mannability needed. But this would mean that one gets actually a non-trivial sort of hormonology theory for phonemas of a specific kind. I even gave this recite exactly. This is for Babas also saying. So this is, I think, one important problem that's about the uniqueness of Khartan. That's about the influence of Cartan. And another one is this one about the number of Cartan sub-algebras. There are examples where there's exactly two Cartan-sub algebras, that's a contributing, that's concerns from the 80s. And by now, you understand a little bit better the zoom of possible equivalence relations. But the following question is open: like what type of equivalence relations can appear? And in particular, already for any natural number, n, is there a two-one factor? Natural number n is there to one factor with exactly n Cartanza's optimary contribution. This is also. These are kind of questions that are still open. And now I finish.
