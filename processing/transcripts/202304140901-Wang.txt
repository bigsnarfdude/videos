Contact homology, so this is introduced by Hutchings and here in the talk we already saw in Morgan's talk. She also gave a brief overview for it and I will bring you a little more in my setting. So first let me give you some motivations for those type of questions. It says that it's a natural question to ask how these flirt theories behave under surgery operations. Operations I'll incorporate the basic surgery operations. So I will remind you what the connective cell model I'm taking, in particular I'm using the 1C1 handle attachment model. And this is of interest in other floor theory as well, in the linearized technology. This is study by Woodrow and Vancouver. Sorry. And in the three-dimensional, in other three-dimensional gaze theory, we have But in the other three-dimensional gauge theory, we have seen this important triangle of isomorphisms that relates ECH and Hager-Flohr plus minus Y homology and molecule from cohomology, which Morgan also mentioned. So this is by Colin Virginia Handa. This is by Taubs and this is by Kuto Hanumi Taubes. And each of these isomorphism takes about 500 pages of work. So, and it's very hard to trace through exactly how the structures behave in each theory. So, I guess can we get some formula like? I guess a communist formula is technically known in Hegerfler. The chain homotopy equivalence is constructed for the minus version. And you can do some algebra to have a homology version for the plus version. But yeah, then, so I will give a chain level description of ECH, which technically also corresponds to the one that's not actually known in monopole. So I think monopole, the homology version is from homology, is known by people. Is known by people, but maybe cohomology is also not known on the chain level. Alright, so this brings me to next point, which is chain level picture gives what we're finding we're understanding of invariance, gives information, quantitative parents. So you can ask for a connected formula for easy. Ask for a connected sum formula for ECH spectrums that we heard about. This will be nice in the future work. And okay, and then the more grand proposal, I guess, is to study how, use the connection formula techniques to study how ECH coordinates and maps map to construct ECH co-voilism maps. Without going through, I guess. But this will be a lot of work. Okay. More work than I'll cover. We'll cover. Can you clarify what you mean by ECH cohorts in that? Yeah, so I guess. So my kindness sounds. Okay, I'll say the result. It's really a lie, but so. Really, a lie, but so we have the idea is to count these index zero curves. So I'll give a chain homotopy equivalence. Okay, let me state the result. So ECH of Y1, exactly. Oh, okay, I must do this. ECH of Y1 given two concept manifolds. I have a fees as F modules, isomorphism as F modules, and code DMAS. And furthermore, well, actually, in fact, I'll construct a homotopy equivalence. From maybe I'll show it from cone first. The filter cone, which I'll define to you what it means. So filter, the cone is the cone on the U map, the sum of the UMAPs, to the filter H complex. HCH complex, which I'll tell you what it is as well. I think Morgan mentioned briefly. So this is what you see age of the famous. Sorry about the right in the corner. So in my paper, I do not c show you what a converted map is. But maybe because you have such a formula, you can predict w what the curves are. I don't know. What the curves are. I don't know. Okay. Okay, so now let me tell you some more background on ECH and review the connect system operation and then tell you a bit about the differentials as well as through the whole microphone in the connect complete dimension of the connect system. Dimension of the colour thing from. So, okay. Background ECH. So ECH is a three-manifold invariant because the corresponding Siddharthwitten and Hager-Kuer theories are. But then we do take the input of a contact manifold and pick a bunch of auxiliary data. So, in particular, Auxiliary data. So, in particular, we take a contact form, non-degenerate contact form. That's in the current kernel of that is your contact structure. And from the contact form, Movin told us that there is a rate vector field that you can associate to the contact form. It's unique. And then from the vector field, you get a bunch of reborn bits. And then ECA generators are the so-called orbit sets. So we usually denote it as Mi, no sorry, gamma I, Mi. Or maybe you'll see in some notations as well. So gamma I is the underlying simple orbits. So these are embedded. And then these are the covering multiple C. And then we have a technical condition that if gamma i is hyperbolic, meaning that the linearized return map has only real ID values, then we require the multiplicity to be one. Okay, so this is the chain complex generator. Okay, so this is the chain complex generators. Let me tell you a bit about the differentials. Oh, this is a little better. Oh, I think I should have erased the raise ball. Okay, so differentials. So the differentials so these are pseudo-homomorphic curves and let me the ambient contact mammoth hole is RY. This sublectization is mentioned in Ursula's talk as well. And then you take internal S nambdal, this is your sublactive form, and E3. And ECH differentials. Oh, yeah, I need to tell you what J is. Here's a generic lambda-adapted J. So this is what Morgan was saying as well. You require the J to be R invariant. It sends partial S to the rate vector field and it rotates Rotates it sends the context structure back to the context structure rotating positively. Okay, so now I have a J, I can consider the pseudo-holomic curves, so ECH, differentials, and ECH index one, ECH index one, J holomorphic curves with punctures. So these are, it has to satisfy the usual J holomorphic equation with asymptotic ends and the orbit set probability. Set or village or all of these sets. So in a picture, it looks something like, I don't know. You can have genus, you can have many positive n's and negative n's. We require a minus one. So the magic is this ECH index. What is it? It is the topological index. This is in contrast with the Euclidean-Freckling index. So by topological, I mean the input of the index is a second homology class. And it's a sum of, okay, I won't be too precise about this, but this part is correct, but then there's a sum of certain way of summing the coming center index. The Kali Zenner index. I need to pick a trivialization of the context structure over all the orbits. You can do that. These are the trivializations. Maybe I'll just say quickly what these terms are. See, okay, I'll pop right over here. So I'm going to Sorry, moving a little quickly because some of the information is mentioned by Morgan's talk, but please slow me down if you have questions. Can you see if I erase using this? Okay. Thanks. So C tau is a relative push to number. So these are counting. So I've given a homology class Z in 2y beta. So this means that my curve have alpha as the positive answer, but this is really in the, if you project it to a three-dimensional beta. It counts the zeros of generic section fixing certain trip. Certain tri um like you you have to have boundary conditions on the uh the boundary. Well these are punctures, but you cut them off. So they lie in a compact set. So these are the first relative first string class. And Q tau is also very interesting. This is independent of the representative of the homology class. Of the homology class. And it counts also something called relative intersection hearing. So similarly, you want to, you can try to count intersections between two homophobic curves, but you need to make sure the intersection doesn't, you don't allow the intersection to go to infinity. So the true validation required will The true validation required, well, you want near each curve, so if you have x and s prime, you want to fix the small neighborhood so that these are raised and events and rays and they don't rotate with respect to the trivializations near the orbit, at the orbit. And then the last thing, colour zero index, I won't say much, but all of our mentioned is the ease measures. This is these measures, okay. Measures or rotation of your linearized return flow, a return map. Okay, so we have some components purely that are purely topological, and then we have this kind of dynamical term, all contributing to our ACH index. To our ACH index. And the nice thing about ECH index is that low ECH index, so low meaning less equal to 2 are embedded with possibility, except for possibilities of bridge covers of tuba cylinders. So these tripod cylinders can be branch covered, but we just call them little cylinders anyway. Okay, so I think that it wraps up the basics of ECH. Now let's get to some structures of ECH. So this includes a action filtration and a UMAP, which I'll be using. Um okay, so we saw an action flotation um So the, I guess I should define first what the action is. An action of that orbit set, let me now denote it as mi gamma i. So this is the orbit set, is defined to be the sum of the integrated around gamma i, the contact form. I forgot to multiply by multiplicity. Multiply by multiplicity. Okay. And this action gives you a filter ECH complex, ECC complex, by the Stokes theorem. So this is a subcomplex. Okay, that's what I'm going to talk about for now, for the altered EPH. And you also have U maps. So these are degree negative 2 chain maps. chain maps or ECH you can't since it's a chain map you can also consider the homology of this map. Okay these are defined by wanting index ECH index two curves, so the homo curves, passing three by a generic base point. Read HNR base point. In particular, this base point cannot be on a report. So, passing through base point is a codeman two condition. You're counting index two curves, you still can count them. Okay. I want to talk about for now. Any questions? Okay, now I'm. Okay, now let me tell you a little bit about the connective sum. The connective sum is not really convex or even dynamically convex. It has this like hyperbolic orbit that I'll tell you about. So that's why I'm here. Well, we learned about the added complexity of non-convex. Okay, okay, yeah. Okay, yeah, one steam, one handle. So this is the operation. It's more general. You can attach different handles as well. I think that's been talked about in this conference as well. So what you do is that you consider a the usual R4, standard R4, DX with the For DX with the standard subjective form, D D W, X Y, Z W. You consider the contact type hypersurface. Well, first, it's just the hypersurface, I guess. Caught up by the equation, that's square, square. The exact form is not super important. You just want it to be a, you want the view that you will. Uh you want the viewable vector to be well this vector field to be viewable. Partial x partial y t v partial t. So everything's very explicit. Now that you have a, sorry, I claim this is a loud vector field and then you can compute the contact form associated to it, this hypersurface. And then you have some ray vector here which I tell you what. ray vector field which I tell you what it is. So the ray vector field looks something like x partial y minus y partial x plus 2z partial w plus w partial z. So I guess this is a very classical operation and people have actually studied the dynamics, what happens when you connect to some of them. So the point is that this one gives you an This one gives you a free orbit near the connected sum sphere in the ascending manifold of this F. So it's cut out by the first three terms. Plus, these were equal to one. This is the W equal to zero. Manifold. Okay, what else do I want to say? And then this is the only resort in the parameter sum operation. The kinetic sum operation, like after in the attaching, in the ascending manifold, in the resulting kinetic sum. And furthermore, I won't tell you, but I will, you can see that the context structure restricts to H. You can identify with control C, control W. And this is the trivialization I'll be using as well, which is very convenient. Okay, so what else do I want to say? Okay, this is a positive hyperbolic. Possibly of hyperbolic orbit. And that's very important as a positive pathway orbit. Okay, so now I have a choice whether to tell you. Okay, I'll tell you first. Okay, I will tell you first what the ECH chain complex looks like in a Kaneki sum, and then I will tell you a bit about the two-homeway curves in a connected sum, in the symplectization of the Kaneki Sun. So this is the promise definition of the code. So this is just the usual mapping code. But the degree is kind of weird because my U map is of degree negative two. So I'll just write what this means. So I'll just write what this means. Given a chainmap mu, I can, okay, this is the map from ECC Y1. This joint union Y2, which is the same as ECC of Y1. Let me just use the mod two coefficients. Okay, so Okay, so it's a map from this chain complex vector itself. And then we can construct a cone complex. On the vector space level, cone of mu is just two copies of this complex. So for ease of notation, I will actually just call. I will actually just call this whole thing C0 plus C0 minus 1. And then minus 1 is a. And then I can further identify this with a chain complex. I mean, I can take that to be a definition, I guess. Well, not definition. So CH. Well, not definition. So CH, what is it? It's defined to be this chain complex. So I'm counting all the orbits that have been Y1 and Y2, attaching that to it, attaching a hyperbolic orbit to it. Oh, this is C0CH. Um okay, so Okay, so you may ask, why is this step true? I might have very long orbits crossing that connect to some region, and I can ignore those orbits by considering filter DC complex. So really, I am maybe I'm jumping ahead of myself. I'll leave the I'll leave the model there. Oh, okay. I think I keep this step is fine. This is my definition. I keep messing with. This is just by definition. I'm taking an isomorphism between C0 to CH because I'm just attaching H to all the possible orbit sets that are already being worked. That are already in Y1 and Y2. The next step is to identify the cone complex on a vector space level with the ECH complex of the clinical sum. And this amounts to making the observation, which I think is folklore, that given any L action, a real number, I can find I can find a radius R of L such that any orbit crossing the kind of sum sphere of radius sphere of radius R of L plus action Mass action greater than tau. So this observation gives me the following. If I only consider ECC chain complex up to action out, oh maybe I didn't even define what this is. Sorry. Okay. This is counting. I think I said I only wrote the symbol, but I didn't define it. So this means that you're counting all these sets. That's up to action now. So, okay. So, by considering ECC, the filter ECC, we have that, so we only consider orbit sets up to action L, so we cannot consider these non-orbits. So, this is what considering GCCL gives us. So, what we have is that actually not this stuff, right? Actually not as the front. I'll write it. CP FY1 and then the sound with the with a certain radius is okay I didn't you should really be careful about the lambdas as well, but I'm kind of suppressing it. So I can't really on the vector space level identify that with identify that with C0H which is a column by definition. So I'm decomposing the orbit sets in my kinetic sum up to action L with C L and with orbit sets that are either contain the hyperbolic orbit or orbit sets that don't contain the hyperbolic orbit. That's on the vector space level. Oh, I can see that there's a isomorphism between the ECC complex and the comb. Now let me tell you about the differentials. Like how to match the differentials of the comb and the differentials of CCC. Maybe let me just say, remind you, differentials of a comb is a triangular A triangular thing, so this is C00, del 0, 0, which is del 1 and 0 identity, plus identity through del 1. So you're really just considering the differential thing both sides. And there's a degree shift. This is an app which I denote. Some of you actually know that as new. Okay, so let me tell you about the different shows or the Tell you about the different shots or the pseudoholomorphic curves by one by two. So this is also study by many people when they were considering finite energy foliations in the kinetic systems. So in particular, I'm thinking of the things that I should By patients thinking, or I think Paulo El Salmo has the python, sorry, Paulo So the theorem says that given any j collateral j That's in the region away from the connected sub-region. I can find J prime, which is also lambda adapted, such that I see two families of or two families are invariant families of a holomorphic aren't holomorphic planes. Helmorphic planes. So if I look at the OCRAL's S2 region, it's actually foliated by two families of plants. Sorry. They're not supposed to overt finger set to their foliations. So this is PN, it projects to the northern hemisphere. And then I have another plane which is isotonic to the same hyperbolic orbit. Pyrebolic orbit. I can say this projects go southern hemisphere, projecting via R cross Y to Y to northern and southern hemisphere. Um furthermore. Furthermore, these planes have opposite asymptotic leading coefficients, so they call this a PN and P sub and P n approach H from opposite side. This is also important in the asymptotic It's also important in the asymptotic analysis for me when I want to figure out what the curves can behave like. What else? There might be something else, but I'll just say these two for now. So yeah, so this foliation in particular gives me a no-crossing phenomena. So I have many. I have maybe I'll draw it in picture. Again, I have kind of this picture. I have the sphere. I have this emphatization of the subsphere. And what's coming by two planes? Okay, anyway. There's some formulations of these. R cross ST. Oh, you also need to throw a nature vessel. Oh, you also need to throw in a trigger cylinder over H. Fully the entire thing. But the point is: Lemon, no crossing is that if you have curves with ends that don't end on this hyperbolic orbit, then these cannot happen. Then these cannot happen. Because if it crosses the current sound region, it must have an intersection with one of the planes or triple cylinders. And there are different arguments you can use. The easiest is Christmichael's formula of this q tau, which we saw as the relative intersection pairing. This is the count of the intersection of, so I'm really looking at. So I'm really looking at Q tau of displaying C with let's say PN or the tribus liner or PS, the arguments are similar, whether you intersect one of them. Okay, so I'm considering Q tau, which I can, since I told you, is independent of the choice of a homological representative. This is zero because I can just shift one of the planes up. And I'll tell a link. The asymptote linking number is also zero because they don't share any orbits. So asymptotic linking is defined when your two curves actually isenthyl to the same orbit, then you consider they're linking with respect to each other. But if they don't even share an orbit, then it's zero. And then we know this, but this one is very good to one because we know they intersect, and by intersection positivity is one. Intersect positive is 1. And it's a positive 1. Okay, so this is a contradiction. So they cannot cross. We don't have such curves. So this, a consequence of this is that, in particular, in a connected sum, oh, I guess, yeah, okay, anyway. In the connective sum, the differential effects coming from orbit zap without hypolygorbit to orbit. Without hyperbole orbit, so overset without hyperbole orbit, it's just decomposed as such. I guess I actually denote this as not 0, 0. So when I said this is the definition, I lied. This is like a consequence of no crossing. Sorry, but I will just write this as. So now I can actually write this as the core variable. Partial 0, 0 is equal to. Partial 0, 0 is equal to the partial, the sum of the partials. So, what about the other differentials in a simplicization of connected sum? Let me first write it artificially as this matrix. So there's no content here. I'm just writing my differentials, organized my differentials this way. So, this in particular means or is that curves. Curves that go from orbit sets with C raised H to C0. So we have H 0 equals 1. So these differentials are denoting these curves, E plus C G minus 1 curves. So what about these curves? The heuristics from linearized contact homology is that such things Economy is that such things shouldn't exist, and I really, really don't want them to exist because I want this to be like a triangular matrix. So this is the reason it doesn't exist in linear S counter topology is that in their case, there's only one positive S tag n, and this hyperlogy or you can just make it very small, then by energy, by action reasons, you cannot have any curves coming out of that has. That has H as a single positive end. So, in my case, surprisingly, it's also true. There, no, maybe I'll uh okay, right hold index one connected curves and letters with H and S I really just need an ACH index. But I really just need an extinct index uh i equals in one for the for the differentials, but I would need other Freddy index one curves later. So I I guess this proposition states this way. So these also don't exist. I won't tell you the proof of this, but it's essentially analyzed using two facts. One fact is that there are two families of pseudohomo planes approaching age in opposite directions, and the fact that age is a hypothesis. And the fact that H is a hyperbolic orbit. And then the consequence of this proposition is that, okay, this is very simple. It's just zero. But a similar argument of proposition will actually tell you: whenever you have curves that has a positive NH and a negative NH, so So I'm now considering these differentials. It actually security separates out the trigo cylinder. It's the same similar argument to no curves in this scenario. So it's really, and then the Schrödinger Senators have index zero. Okay, and the consequence of this proposition is that, I mean, I'm not going to use it. I mean, I'm told I'm not going to use any proofs. You can ask me later. So this can be written as H. So you have a, this means that if you have an orbit that contains the H, you just get rid of it and then you consider the rest differential and then you attach an H to the end. Okay. Okay, so this is actually the hardest for me, but I guess this differential is conceptually the most interesting because it only Conceptually, the most interesting because they correspond to the UMAP. So now I consider partial H. I want to organize all the differential mixes this size so I can show you the chain homotopy equivalence. So these are, okay, I guess I don't have enough space. Correspond to U maps in the original manifold. In the original manifold. So maybe y1 and y2 here. So why? These are the differentials that look like this. And x1 coming from, well, the positive ends don't have hyperbolic orbits. The negative n has one hyperbolic orbit. And you can kind of see that already. You attach one of the fluids. See that already. You attach one of the planes, and those planes are about index one, I didn't tell you, and then those correspond to kind of the index two curves. So I guess this is the heuristic, but how do you see that? There are really two ways to see it: one is the natural thing to do, the other one is to do it. Natural thing to do. The other way is to not do any work. So the first way is similar to what I already said. You consider A next bars A cross one. Okay, actually. So I consider a U map, so these are U maps that fix a generic base point index to and I just move this base point to one of the beyond one of the points. And in this process, I can consider the SFT limit of that of what happens in this process. And really, to be precise, I want to consider the model space. Precise, I want to consider the modi space of index to curves. That's I do that. Here are curves with zero Z1P union P Z2. So now this is passing through an interval in the coordination one condition. So this one 1 condition. So this module space is of dimension 1, and you want to consider the boundary of partial M2. And in that process, you will see this particular breaking and some other homotopy terms. So this is really Actually, maybe I'm not gonna say more on this because you will see exactly what the formula is in the second method. So the second method is a way is to just recall that there is a chain homotopy equivalence given by the change of base points. Given by the change of base points. So when I define a UMAP, I picked an arbitrary base point. You might ask, what if I pick another arbitrary base point? And the point is, if you pick Z1 and Z2, like as two base points, then you can You can, there's a chain homotopy that connects the PCC, the UMAP defined using this space point, and the UMAP defined using this base point. So let me call this this interval eta. Then there's a J-homotopy equivalence connecting UZ1, UZ2, that's partial K, that's K partial. So this is what I didn't want to write here, but the K is the The K is the K is the I still have to read every case. So, candy, pounds, easy index one, curves, passing zero the interval eta. Ata. So, this is what's already shown in the foundations on BCH, I guess. But what I do is that I get rid of a base point. I pick such an interval such that it goes through one of the planes, well, it has to go through one of the planes, and I just get rid of that base point. So, in particular, if you have a modular space that's a finite set of points, you get rid of some curves, it's still a modular space that consists of finite sets. Space that consists of finite sets of points, so it's still compact and everything's nice. Okay, K comes. So now I told you what the players of these are, and then the final claim is that I can use this equation to obtain an honest equation of relating a U map relating this. So equation is that. So the assumption is that u in the planet is some um zero. So zero zero again means that the positive and negative ends don't have hyperbolic, this special hyperbolic orbit, plus one over h, zero h. So these are the building that looks like this. Have a differential, and then you have a plane. This is equal to partial 00k00 prime plus k00 prime partial 00. So k00 prime is instead of passing through eta, I pass through z dot unit. Okay, so this is all right, so I told you a bunch of equations like this. I can actually construct the chain homometophyte. I can actually construct a chain homotopy equivalence. So I guess I had a half one minute. Perfect. So the claim is that there's a chain homotopy equivalence given by identity H zero H A zero zero. HK00 prime. Okay, so in order to check it's a Cheham and Topi equivalence, I don't need to do too much work because I already did the work. So this is lower triangular and isomorphism on the vector space on a diagonal. So I just need to check that it's a chainmap. Partial comb. I show kind of pixel up. And using all the equations that I this one That I, this one and the ones that it raised, you can check that this will give you either channel to be. And then you use some direct limit argument to lift this. Maybe let me say, so this is from cone of L to ECC of the connected sum of L. Then you pass this to the homology level and then you get the connected sum formula. Okay, that's all. Any questions for Linda? Examples where you can now Yeah, I guess so this I don't know if they're fun you can attach a one handle single one handle so that's uh connected something with S1 plus S2 and then you just cut To and then you just recover whatever it is from Hagerflur, which is nice. I guess you verify that there are some morphisms. Yeah. Can you also get the U-map for the off-to-legconic sum? Yeah, yeah, you can. People tell me that the cone can be understood as a model of the derived tensor product, and there's a natural U action there, which is just the U1 tensor identity, which is homotopic to identity tensor U2, which you can see in Easy. Intensive V2, which you can see in ECH because these are, of course, homotopy. Because once you have a single connected manifold, then by this, you have a homotopy between the two UMAPs. And then you just need to figure out things related to UMAP evolving the hyperbolic orbit. And Oliver and I were doing that. Yeah, it's not too bad, I guess. It should just be determined in terms of the original. Yeah, you can, you can interpret it with the user. Any other questions? Oh, great job if you like. Okay, great. We have nine minutes for coffee and tea. We'll be back here.
