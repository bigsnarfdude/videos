Um okay um can you hear me? Okay can you hear me? Well, okay. Um so thank you very much. Uh thank you to the organizers for the opportunity to speak here and to give the opportunity to participate online. Um the I will talk about a non-linear DIRACO. A nonlinear Dirac equation with a specific type of nonlinearity, which is called or which we call at least a soler type. So, this is based on joint work that has been continuing and is ongoing with Danco and Edgardo from the Catholic University in Chile, Julian Ricot, who is now at Polytechnique, and also at the beginning with Sébastien Rotteau from Metz and Nam from Unich. Okay, so I will start by introducing the equation. So it is a lot like a Schrodinger equation, where instead of putting a normal Laplacian for the kinetic term or the one that Luca puts, I put a Dirac operator to do something different. But it also has some physical applications in models like graphene or in other other uh in motivation that come from uh from general from special relativity and and uh extent to model uh a fermion interacting with its self-generated field and so on have these models have have originated so uh okay we have id on one side uh psi which will be uh which will have two components uh everything will be in one plus one dimension so one space one one time So, one space, one time, and D is this one-dimensional Dirac operator with a mass n. So, to define this Dirac operator, I put like a derivative term with some matrix alpha and a mass term with some matrix beta. And the requirement is that alpha and beta are anti-commutating matrices, hermitian, and that the R-square is equal to one. So, if you take equal to one so if you take a particular choice for alpha to be um zero i minus i zero and beta uh one zero zero minus one then you get this explicit expression but you can take any other uh choice of uh of pauli matrices and there are different communities who use all of these possible other choices so this is this linear part of the equation So, this is this linear part of the equation, like the kinetic energy term. And then there is like a potential term that comes with the same beta matrix as the mass term. So it's like the particle feels a modified mass. And actually, this is a good choice. If you want to confine a direct particle, it's a good idea to make a modified mass and actually to make a smaller mass. That's why I wrote. To make a smaller mass, that's why I wrote minus f, and then in order for this whole non-linear term to be like the derivative of some capital F with respect to psi, it's convenient to make the mass dependent on the C2 inner product of this psi multiplied by beta with psi itself. So, this is a point-wise, so for each x, I compute. So, for each x, I compute this inner product in C2. I compute, I have a number, and then I evaluate some function f on this. And for the function f, so what makes this the solar model or solar type nonlinearity is that we have this beta matrix in here. If we don't, you have many other possible non-linear Dirac equations, which all will have slightly different properties. Uh, slightly different properties with some initial conditions, so this behaves nicely. Um, so if you I won't go into what you have to ask precisely from the F, but you can think about the non-linearity that you would like to put in a non-linear Schrodinger equation as well. So you think about powers or things that look a lot like a power, and uh, so the p equal one case and So, the p equals one case, f of s equal to s. So, the cubic equation is the Soler model, which actually goes. So, the paper of Soler is, I think, from the 80s or maybe 70s, but actually Ivanenko wrote a paper in Russian way before. And it's also called sometimes the massive Gross-Neveu model in one dimension, or simply the cubic non-linear Dirac equation. Equation. Well, to be precise, you have many cubic nonlinear Dirac equations if you take other types of nonlinearities. So, maybe also to fix ideas a little bit, if I take the sigma 3 matrix as the beta matrix, so the 1 minus 1 matrix, then this is just the first component squared minus the second component squared. And this is what goes into the nonlinearity. So, okay, this is the model. So, okay, this is the model. And then we are interested in solitary waves. So, for solitary waves, you look for things that are not exactly constant in time, but they are oscillating with one constant frequency in time. And then they decay in space in X. And of course, the explicit expression that you can put here will depend on the value of the frequency of the oscillations that you put. That you put. So these are solutions to an equation without time now. And then, if you just have one dimension, so you just have one derivative left. So we reduce the PD to an ordinary differential equation, and you can just check that it has a solution in one dimension for each omega between zero and n. Strictly, we will have a solution which is unique up to translations and multiplication by a constant phase. So phi zero at each point x is two components. And then so with the with the conventions for the Pauli matrices, it was here, I made a plot of the upper component, which typically in some is typically called v and the lower component. Typically called V, and the lower component, which is called U, as a function of X. So you can see that they are exponentially decreasing. And the colors are omega close to zero is in yellow and omega close to m is in green. So for the green ones, you get a first component that looks a lot like what you would think of as a ground state for the non-linear Schrodinger equation, something with one bump and very smooth. Very smooth. And then, if you get further and further away from M, you get a steeper profile that actually has a maximum away from the origin. And it looks like the solitary for the Schrödinger equation is not a coincidence because if you just scale the solutions correctly, then you can see that if You can see that if omega goes to m, this corresponds to the non-relativistic limit in this context where I have already put the speed of light equal to one, so you can't take it to infinity anymore. But it means that you're very close to the bottom of the essential spectrum of the Dirac operator, and that means that it looks a lot like the solitary wave for the corresponding Schrodinger equation. At least have the Equation. At least, if this F that is here is like a power, or in any way scales like a power, if I get closer and closer to zero. Because you can see that the L infinity norm goes to zero if omega goes to M. Okay, so just okay, these are the solitary waves, they exist. But then are they stable? Because that's Are they stable? Because that's one thing you can wonder about if you're interested in seeing them in some physical experiment. You want that if you start from a small perturbation of the solitary wave that you stay close in a suitable sense. And there are not so many results. There are some results on the linearized equation in the non-relativistic limit. So, again, this is the limit where omega becomes close, gets close to. Gets close to m from below. And these results are really you take what you know very well for the corresponding Schrödinger equation and you look at you apply analytic perturbation theory basically for this linearized system to say that if things are if the Schrödinger equation Are if the Schrödinger equation is linearized non-linear Schrödinger equation is stable, then the corresponding Dirac model will also be stable in a small interval, which you can't control because it just there exists an open interval of frequencies omega where the model behaves as nice as the Schrodinger model. And then there are some results in dimension three. Dimension three about asymptotic stability, where it is shown that in dimension three, and with a lot of assumptions on the spectrum of the linearization, like absence of resonances and Fermi-Golden rule, if all of this works, you can run the machine and apply a lot of estimates to show asymptotic stability. And there are also, which I didn't write down, a few results, but where the model is not a translation. Is not a translation invariant. So, where, for instance, you switch off the nonlinearity as localized, you switch it off away from the origin. Okay, so we have the equation, we have the solitary wave solution, and then we want to linearize it. So, that's what I put in this very busy slide. You take an initial data, which is You take as an unset for psi of tx this oscillating part and then the phi zero omega x which you know is an exact solution and then a small perturbation p of x and t you plug this in the non-linear equation that I put before and then you only keep the terms that are first order in p. First order in P. I don't say linear in P because you will have both P and the complex conjugate of P. So, what you can do then is, just as in the case of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, you define a vector P, capital P, which is the real part of P and the imaginary part of P. And if you choose, you have to put in some factors of I to Put in some factors of i to bring it in exactly this form, but at the end you get an equation for p, which is block anti-diagonal with nice operators on the diagonal. So for the Schrodinger equation, this p has two components. Here we have Dirac. So already this small p had two components, this big p has four components, and each one of these things in the block is the Dirac operator minus the omega. Operator minus the omega. And then you have terms that depend on the solitary wave solution, which was v of x, u of x. So this is the explicit, at least for power laws, it's an explicit function. Otherwise, we can know properties about them. They're exponentially decaying and so forth. So you get this operator. I know many people dislike this, but I know many people dislike this, but since I come more from spectral theory, I prefer to put the I where it belongs in the Schrodinger equation. And so what does it mean to be linearly stable with this convention? It means that the spectrum of this huge block operator is real, because then I go like i times something real, and that means that I oscillate. If I Oscillate. If I have here something that becomes imaginary, I can see that I get the number and also it complex conjugate. So if I get something that has an imaginary part, then this will lead to solutions that in the linearized equation grow exponentially. So this is not a proof of anything for the non-linear equation, but at least a strong indication that there There will be instability of the solitary waves in the nonlinear equation. Okay. Next. So we have this operator with two blocks. The Schrodinger convention is to call this guy L minus and this guy L, this whole thing L plus. Even if L plus is smaller than L minus, but Smaller than L minus, but that's the convention. And you can learn some easy things about this equation. Like, for instance, that you have a kernel that's related to the translation invariance and the invariance under multiplication by a phase. If you put like for p zero phi zero, then you have l0 and phi zero, and this gives zero. And if you put zero and if you put the derivative then you will in the first component then you have l2 on phi zero prime and that's also zero um this is general from the symmetry and then you have some things that are more uh like coincidences from uh from the symmetries of this solar non-linearity and from the fact that we are in one dimension that you also have the eigenvalue minus two omega which is Omega, which is always there. It's a joint eigenvalue of L0 and NQ. So it will is an eigenvalue both for this one and this one. So I said that we needed this operator to have a real spectrum, at least for the essential part of the spectrum. This is it's easy to see that this happens because these components that are here are exponentially decreased. That are here are exponentially decaying, so we only have the part that comes from the Dirac operator minus omega. And that's the same here and here. So the Dirac operator minus the Dirac, the spectrum of the Dirac operator, the free Dirac operator, is from minus m to m. Sorry. Sorry, everything, the whole real line except for a gap between minus m and m. So when I shift it with omega, then I have the same thing, but shifted with omega. And then if I put it in the empty diagonal, I get plus and minus the same spectrum. So that's why I'm trying to change colors here, but I don't know where this is. Okay. So the SMS. So the essential spectrum is from minus m minus omega to m minus omega. Sorry, this is very huge. And then the minus of the same thing. So that's from here to here. Okay. So even if this is a very thick line, actually, I just wanted to color the part of the real axis in the complex plane to say that there is the essential spectrum. And now Essential spectrum. And now we know that all the other, the rest of the spectrum will be eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. So we have two of these at the origin, the ones that I mentioned from translations and multiplication by a phase. And we also have plus and minus two omega, which might be embedded. Which might be embedded in the essential spectrum. So that's already gives an idea that it's not a good idea to say that there are no, to try to prove that there are no embedded eigenvalues. But these are like the basic considerations that you can get from this expression. And then here is a summary of our new results. Ah, new from already more than a year ago, but A first thing is that the L minus operator, the one that was up there, has no eigenvalues in... I sorry, this should be zero, sorry. Because we've seen that L zero is L minus, has a zero eigenvalue, which is phi zero, but it has known below, at least up to minus two omega. To minus two omega. So I recall that the essential spectrum was from minus m minus omega, here is somewhere zero to m minus omega. So all of this is essential spectrum. We know that zero is an eigenvalue and minus two omega also as well. And then what we prove is that there's nobody in between ever. Between ever, um, you can say, Yeah, well, okay, well, um, but it's in some sense related to the idea that for the Schrödinger operator, if you take the ground state, then it is really the ground state as a solitary wave, then it's really a ground state in the sense that the linearized operator will have no spectrum below zero in this. Zero in this case. Phi zero, the ground state will be an eigenfunction associated to the eigenvalue zero, and there will be no spectrum below. For Dirac, the linearized operator has an unbounded spectrum from below. So of course there is spectrum below zero, but at least there is this gap. And this gives some important information. important information and then the other operator the l l plus one has uh exactly one eigenvalue in uh in the same interval um so the proof that we wrote uh was for um was for power non-linearities but you can actually actually generalize it at least to all the things that behave At least to all the things that behave like a power for small values for omega close to n that behave like a power. Okay, the nonlinearity behaves like a power for small values of the argument of the nonlinearity. So this is this pink is for L plus, which has the same essential spectrum. And it might have some eigenvalues here and there, but at least between zero and Between zero and minus two omega, we know exactly what happens. And so, if this L L minus thing on L minus was the analog of being a ground state, having exactly one eigenvalue below the ground state, okay, and above minus two omega, is the analog as the condition in Priyake Shata-Strauss about the same operator. I don't know which notation they use, having Notation they use having exactly one negative eigenvalue. So here it's not exactly one negative eigenvalue, but exactly one in this interval just below zero. So that's one thing. And then a second thing that we show is it seems very disconnected, but it uses very strongly these first two points, is that We have this Fakitov-Kolokolov condition. So that means that if this condition holds, so this is a condition about phi zero of omega and x, I square it, I take modulus squared in C2 and integrate in L2. And then I take a derivative with respect to the frequency. If this is negative, then no eigenvalue branches pass through zero. So, what you have for Schrödinger is that if this is negative, then you have orbital stability. And also, the contrary, so this is a lot weaker. But it was not known for Dirac. And I will explain in a minute what I mean by eigenvalue branches passed through zero. And then a third kind of result is really Using the fact that, okay, for Schroedinger, you can show quite easily by using actually this thing. You can see that the square of all eigenvalues is real. And that's just because you have uh l plus and l uh no l minus and l plus if you think that z is an eigenvalue you write this equation for some eigenfunction psi and then the equation then you can see that z squared will be an eigenvalue of l minus l plus if you take the square here of this operator then you have l minus l plus of this operator then you have l minus l plus and l plus l minus zero zero psi equals zeta squared psi and then since psi is not zero at least one of the two by two blocks is non-zero so either z squared is an eigenvalue of l minus l plus or of l plus l minus and then since l minus is positive you can You can see that L minus minus one half is positive when you're orthogonal to its kernel. So you can define, this is a bounded operator when you're orthogonal to the ground state. This thing will be an eigenfunction of L plus L plus this function will be an eigenfunction of l minus to the one half l plus l minus to the one half if this upper part is different from zero and otherwise you do it the other way around so zeta squared l minus to the minus one L minus to the minus one half psi two by just taking the bottom the upper half of this equation and multiplying it with L minus to the one half. So here what you have constructed what you are seeing is that zeta squared should be an eigenvalue of this operator and this operator is self-adjoint so it has real eigenvalues. So if you have this positivity which you have If you have this positivity, which you have for Schrodinger, then you can see that zeta squared is real valued and all the eigenvalues are either on the real axis or on the imaginary axis. All of this was for Schrödinger because I used an absolute value of L minus. I used that L minus is equal to absolute value of L minus and I can take square roots of it and so on as if it was a number. It's uh is as if it was a number, so all of this is not working for Dirac, but nevertheless, if you have eigenvalues that are that so such that zeta squared is not real, still you can get bounds that are better than what you would get just by using by not using this condition. Still, this tells you something so. Still, this tells you something. So these eigenvalues that are somewhere in the complex plane away from the axis, we are not yet able to prove that they don't exist, even though numerics suggested. But if they are there, you can have bounds for them. And these bounds are better the more this norm of Q, which was Which was the difference between L plus and L minus? If this thing becomes small, which happens, for instance, if I come close to the non-relativistic limits, then these bounds hold. So these are three results which are with very different techniques. And I am very short on. Short on time already, so I will not say anything about the proof. But we have these three ingredients. So the eigenvalue branches that pass through zero allow you to say that no eigenvalues can be complex by passing through zero. And the bound on the real part of z squared allows you to say that. That no eigenvalues, so the real part of z squared, for instance, if you have this kind of quantitative bound, then the real part of z squared is positive. So this means in the complex plane that I'm here in the complex plane. So this is a real axis, so that I'm here or here. And the other thing, the fakitov kolokolov thing means that I cannot pass through zero by. That I cannot pass through zero and go to the imaginary axis. So if we combine these two conditions, that can be made very explicit for the power laws because we have the expressions. So we can just compute the derivative of the L2 norm of the ground states with respect to omega. And we can compute the norm of this Q of omega and check if it's smaller than this crazy number. This crazy number. So, if we combine these two conditions, then we can say that for some values of the power non-linearities, for some values of p and some values of omega over m, both conditions are satisfied. That is what is shown here. And for p equal one, we can do something special which is a little bit better. So, in all of these. Bit better. So, in all of this area, we know that for sure that the linear, we've shown that the linearized operator has no purely imaginary eigenvalues. Unfortunately, we are not able to prove complete spectral stability, which would mean that there are no eigenvalues except on the real axis. So, we cannot exclude eigenvalues that are in the Values that are in the complex plane, but away from the imaginary and the real axis. So this is the picture we get, and it has several interesting things. So p equal 2 is the quintic equation. So that's for Schrodinger, that's where you go from stability, which is all the smaller powers, to instability. To instability. And the interesting thing is that for Dirac, okay, if you are very close to here, yes, you are unstable. But if you go lower, if this non-relativistic effects become, if this relativistic effects become larger, then you're actually nicer in the sense that you are more stable. So this is one of the puzzling things. And also in numerical simulations, you can see that if you are here. I don't see my cursor. If you have a power of p and a frequency somewhere here, instead of blowing up or exploding in some way, you actually make radiate something away and you make a solitary wave that falls somewhere in here. Okay, it's hard to draw with this. So these are all numerical things that are very. All numerical things that are very puzzling or challenging to prove, I think. So, also, I hope with this talk that it's a very short time, but I hope to advertise the problem because most things are wide open. I want to stress that. So, here I've listed just a few of them in increasing order of, I don't know. I don't know. In random orders, let's say, to be on the safe side. One of the things that would be possible is to generalize the result about this single eigenvalue of this operator L plus for general F. So, as I said, the proof in the paper is for powers and it relies actually about on a kind of novel. A kind of novel way to implement the min-max principle for a Dirac operator and to use this in the non-relativistic limit, but the results generalize for all values of omega. Numerics suggest very strongly that as long as you are in the one-dimensional case or in the radial case in higher dimension, that is when your linearized operator is of this form. Of this form, then there are no eigenvalues outside real cross-imaginary axis. But to prove this, I have tried all ideas that I had. So it seems that they don't occur. But maybe it's just a coincidence and it's very hard to prove. In dimension two and three, so all our results are really in the one-dimensional case. The one-dimensional case, and that's because in some points we need the simplicity of the eigenvalues, which is easy in one dimension and probably false in higher dimensions. And then one interesting thing to think about is that for this, especially if you want to go to non-linear notions of stability, to orbital stability, this variational principle that characters This variational principle that characterizes the ground states as minimizers of something under some constraints and things like that is really, really important. For the Dirac equation, we don't have a good variational characterization as yet. So one of the things that we are working on right now is to see that See that this minimization for the Schrodinger non-linear Schrodinger equation is this Gagliard-Donida-Vez-Sobolev inequality, and to see an equivalent form for the Dirac case with the Soler nonlinearity. So, we've done this for the other nonlinearity, for the Kerr non-linearity, really coming from the complete opposite direction, but for the Soler of the Opposite direction, but for the Solero nonlinearity, it's completely different. So that's something that we're working on right now. I don't know how I'm with time. I think I'm over time. So I would like to thank you very much and apologize for being over time. Thank you, Mario. Is there any question? Any question? Yeah. So it looks like you control eigenvalues between negative 2 omega and 0. What's about to the left of negative 2 omega? Can you prove that there are no isolated eigenvalues there? Can you control it? To the left of minus 2 omega for the L zero operator? For the last, yes. I have five notations in my own slide. So, for this one, you have known for the power laws with P bigger than one, but that's not written in the paper yet. So, okay, for p equal one, you can do a little bit better and you can exclude you, you know, that's for okay, so. that's uh for okay so try to make it growing and even get some colors um minus omega so okay for l minus or l zero uh whatever you call it you have zero n minus two omega and nobody else you know exactly the spectrum of l minus in Of L minus in for p equal one in one dimension, and then for all p's, if p is smaller than one, then you can it's perfectly so okay. The spectrum of L minus is symmetric with respect to minus omega. And for L P smaller than one, you can get some guys over here and over here. Over here and over here. And for people bigger than one, you don't. But this last point is one thing that we think we can prove, but it's still written out. So just, but for P equal one, yes, it's written. And I think it's correct. Was it your question? Yes, thank you. Okay. Questions? I have one. I have one. So, from the beginning, you are fixing the nonlinearity to be a power, right? But later, you give the system of the solitary weights, and they exist in this range, 0, n. But the range doesn't depend on the non-linearity. No, so well, you can take as nonlinearity, you can take a power or things that are reasonable in the sense that they are going to zero. Going to zero fast enough and going to infinity fast enough, going to zero at zero, going to infinity at infinity, and so on. And then the solitary waves exist in this whole range, yes. And in 2D, do you have the system of the solitary waves already? Or sorry, yes, yes. In 2D, you have, yes, you can show that. Yes, you can show that you can use a decomposition. Ah, you can use as an endset decomposition in total angular momentum. So you have to take some care how this looks with spin and so on. But this is very standard. And then you find a system of equations that has been studied in particular in three dimensions, but all proofs adapt in a straightforward manner to two dimensions. In a straightforward manner to two dimensions as well, to show that this ODE in the radial variable has a solution that goes through zero without oscillating, which would correspond.
