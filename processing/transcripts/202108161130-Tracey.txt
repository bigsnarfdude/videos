So, it's nice to have your Tracy speaking to us on the fitting height and insoluble length of a finite group. So, you can, I'll mute myself and you can start. Okay, thank you, Donna. And first of all, thanks very much to both Donna and Bob for the opportunity to speak. It's such a nice conference. And yes, so today I'm going to talk about the So, today I'm going to talk about the fitting height and insoluble length of a finite group, and this is joint work with Bob. So, I'm going to begin by just speaking a little bit sort of generally about length parameters in finite groups and giving a little bit of motivation and history and giving some ideas as to why length parameters are useful in finite groups. I should say, actually, before I start that, usually by a length. That usually by a length parameter, I'm going to mean the length of some sub-normal series in the group, and as we'll see, these are quite useful for reduction problems. Okay, in the second part of the talk, I'll speak a little bit about angle elements in groups and some conjectures which connect these elements to certain length parameters. And in the third part, I'll talk about some conjectures related to these connections and some recent progress. And finally, hopefully, there's time, I'll talk about some consequences of these results and proofs. And in particular, I'm going to speak a little bit about the question, which finite groups can have an element contained in a unique massable subgroup. It's not immediately obvious why this should be connected to length parameters, but I hope that over the course of the talk this will become a bit more clear. Okay, so let's begin with some motivation. Let's begin with some motivation. Why do we actually care about length parameters? Well, let me begin by fixing a positive integer n and a group theoretic property which I'll call curly p of n. So this is a group theoretic property depending on n. And I'm going to assume as well that p of n is closed undertaking subgroups and quotes. So we could take p of n, for example, to be g satisfies p of n if and only if the exponent of g divides. only if the exponent of g divides n and i'll talk much more about this in the next few minutes i'm then going to talk about the p of n problem and by the p of n problem i mean the following question does there exist the function f of dn such that all finite degenerated p of n groups have order bounded above by f of dn and the most famous example i guess of this of this question is the restricted burn site problems Is the restricted Burnside problem. So, this is exactly when we have the example above, i.e., we define P of n by saying that G satisfies P of n if and only if the exponent of G divides n. Okay. So you might see on this screen that I've split the screen in order to mitigate for not having a blackboard. So I hope this helps. That the previous slide will be on the left of your screen and the current slide is on the right. The current slide is on the right. Okay, so generally speaking, how do we tackle this P of M problem? Well, one approach that one can use is to use a subnormal series. And by a nice subnormal series, I mean two things. The first thing is that the B of n problem can be answered affirmatively in the factors of the series, gi mod gi minus one. And secondly, that the length of the series That the length of the series can be bounded above by a function of d and n. Because if we have these two properties, well, actually, before I say that, I should say that in general, of course, if we take the minimal number of generators of a factor, then this cannot be bounded above by a function of the minimal number of generators of g famously in general. But Shreer's lemma does state that the minimal number of generators of g i mod g i minus one is at most the index. one is at most the index of gi in gi plus one times the minimal number of generators of gi plus one. So that's something. And if we iteratively apply Shreer's lemma and one above, we see that the order of our group G is bounded above by a function of d, n and or, where r is the length of this subnormal series. And then finally we apply two, and this shows that the p of n problem has an affirmative answer. Problem as an affirmative answer. Okay, so let's look at a specific famous example of this. So again, let's go back to the example we had on the previous slide. So we'll assume that g satisfies p of n if and only if the exponent of g divides n. And so as we mentioned, this the p of n problem then is the restricted burnsight problem. So the restricted burnsite problem famously asks does Restricted to Burnside problem famously asks: Does there exist a function f of dn such that every degenerated finite group G of a component n has order bounded above f of dn? So I'm going to talk about this just for a couple of minutes. Well, it's a problem, of course, that one can state to undergraduates because you just need the definition of a group, really. And usually, if you when you try to solve. Usually, if you when you try to solve it, you start off by looking at small values of d and n. Well, if we start off with the case d equals one, then this is the easiest case because in that case, g is cyclic, so g must be cm for some m dividing n. When d gets bigger, things get hard very quickly, even for d equals 2. So let's instead increase n and see how we get on. If n equals 2, then one of the first Then one of the first problems we probably did in group theory was to show that G is elementary abelian, an elementary abelian two group. So G is C2 to the E for some E at most D. If N equals 3, then that's why I proved in one of the early papers that the order of G is at most 3 to the 2d minus 1. The case n equals 4 was dealt with by Sanoff in 1940. With by Sanoff in 1940, n equals 5 was Higman in 1956, and then Marshall Hall did n equals 6 in 1958. So all of these examples were focusing on settling the restricted burnside problem for small values of n. But as far as I know, nothing was really done on the general case until 1956 when there was a huge breakthrough made by Hall and Higman. And they use this sub-normal series approach that we described on the last slide. And let me tell you a little bit about that. So, in their paper, they first address the soluble restricted burnside problem. So, the soluble restricted burnside problem is sort of exactly what it says in the 10. It asks if there exists a function f of the n such that every degenerated finite soluble group of exponent dividing n has order bounded above. As order bounded above by f of dn. So actually let's take g to be the finite soluble group, dg is at most d, and the exponent of g divides n. Now, just to remind you, in order to use this subnormal series approach from before, we need to consider one of these nice subnormal series, i.e., it needs to be the, so that's the soluble restricted burn site. The soluble restricted burn site problem can be answered in factors, and secondly, that the length of this series can be counted above by a function of L and D. Okay. So which series to use? Well, very natural series to use for soluble groups is the fitting series. So fitting subgroup of a finite group is, of course, the largest normal null potential subgroup. Just normal little point subgroup of G. And then we have a very naturally defined fitting series. So we take f1 of g to be the fitting subgroup, then f2 of g is the pre-image of the fitting subgroup of g mod f of g. Now, if g is a finite soluble group, then this fitting series terminates. So in that case, it makes sense to talk about the fitting height, the length of this series. And in this case, we write the fitting height as f h of g. The fitting height as FH of G or curly FHG. And Hall and Higgman's theorem from 1956 they actually prove much more than this, but for our purposes, it would be enough to say that FH of G is at most 3 log N, where G is a finite soluble group of exponent dividing. And just a quick remark as well, for an arbitrary Well, and for an arbitrary finite group, we can do the obvious thing and define the generalized fitting series. This here, we just replace f by f star, and there we there we get that series will terminate, and then we get the generalized fitting height, and we sort of define that as f h star and v. Okay. Using this subnormal theories reduction from before, it follows from Hall and Egman's theorem. It follows from Hall and Higman's theorem that the soluble restricted burns out problem has an affirmative answer if and only if the important restricted burns out problem has an affirmative answer. And with a little extra work, one can see that the soluble restricted Burnside problem has an affirmative answer in exponent N. So this is if you want to think about specific exponents. If and only if the P-restricted Burnside problem has an affirmative answer in exponent P to the E for each P. To the E for each P-power divisor, P to the E of N. So, another example of a consequence is that because the restricted burnside problem at this point was known in exponents 3, 4, and 5, the soluble restricted burnside problem follows in exponents dividing 60. Now, Hall and Higgins also addressed the insoluble case, but of course, for the insoluble case, one needs a different series. So, for this, we're going to use the insoluble length of G. And the insoluble length is defined as follows. We take the shortest normal series in G with the property that each factor in this series is either soluble or a direct product of non-abelian simple. Product of non-abelian simple groups. So one can find examples easily if a G is soluble if and only if the insoluble length is zero. Sorry, I should have said that it's the insoluble length is the number of factors, of insoluble factors, sorry, in this series. Yeah, G is soluble if and only if the insoluble length is zero. If we take the symmetric group of degree at least five, then this insoluble length one. Length one. And I should remark as well that there is a naturally defined upward insoluble series defined in sort of an obvious way. So in that case, we take R0 of G to be the soluble radical of G. And then you look in the quotient and you take the soccle, which will be a direct product of finite simple groups. And that gives you R1 of G. And then you go in the quotient of R1 of G and you take either the sock. Of G, and you take either the soccle if that's non-trivial, or sorry, either the soluble radical if that's non-trivial, or the soccle, and you just keep going. So, how come Holland Higman's main results? So, the first result is that they say assume that the outer automorphism group of a The outer automorphism group of a finite simple group is soluble. This is Freer's conjecture, which wasn't known at that point. Then there exists a function h of n such that the insoluble length of g is at most h of n for all finite groups of exponent n. And the consequence of that is that if this, if Schreer's conjecture is true, and also if there exists a function g such that the order of Such that the order of a finite simple group T is at most G of N D whenever T is degenerated of exponent dividing N, then the restricted Burnside problem has an affirmative answer in exponent N if and only if the P restricted Burnside problem has an affirmative answer in each prime power divisor exponent dividing N. Of course, we know that one and two holds due to the classification. So whole and Due to the classification. So Hall and Higman's work produced the restricted burnside problem, P groups. And of course, Seldom and Officer's incredible work in the 80s and 90s went on to solve the P restricted Burnside problem. Okay, so I hope that that's sort of an example of how length parameters in finite groups can be really useful. And I'm now going to move on to I'm now going to move on to. There'll be a little bit more history at the start of this section, and then we'll get on to some new stuff. So, this section is about angle elements and length parameters. So, many of you probably know what an angle element is, but I'll just start off with the definition. So, as far as I know, Schenkman in 1953 was the first to introduce the notion of a so-called weekly central element of a group. Group. So, a trivial statement: an element x of a group G, of course, is central if an only if the commutator of g and x is trivial for all g and g. And Schengen generalized it. They defined an n weekly central element, x of g, to be one that satisfies g x x dot dot x equals one, where by this we mean the iterated commutator where n appears x times, sorry, x appears n times. Times sorry, x appears n times now. Around the same time, Gruenberg proved, and this is actually the reversion of what he proved, he proved that if G is soluble and finitely generated, and every element of G is n weakly central for some n, then G is no co. However, Grunberg called n weakly central elements left any. Uniquely central elements, left n-angle elements, and this is the name that stuck. So we'll call them left n-angle elements. I should also say that if x is left n-angle for some n, then we just say that x is left angle. But why were they interested in left angle elements? Well, when Burnside was working on the restricted, what we now call the restricted Burnside problem in the early 20th century, In the early 20th century, he noticed that if g is any group of exponent 3, then every element x of g satisfies the commutator of g with x commutes with x. Or in other words, every element of g is left to angle. Now, Burnside's proof made repeated use of this property, and he remarked that this property could be viewed as the underlying reason why finitely general Underlying reason why finitely generated groups of exponent three are finite, indeed, and important. So then in the 1930s, Zorn cited Bernside's remark as reason to study the finite group in which every element is left in. And he showed that all such groups are nilpotent. And then Grunberg's subsequent work in the early 50s led to renewed interest in the These led to renewed interest in these so-called angel conditions in groups. And the general sort of hope or belief was that strong angel type conditions in a phonetically generated group would imply nilpotence. Just to remind you that a group is nilpotent, of course, if and only if there exists an n such that all length or weight n commutators are trivial. And so if angle conditions implying nil potency would be very useful because for angle conditions you want Useful because for angle conditions, you only need to work in two generated subgroups. What about angle elements in finite groups? Well, if G is a finite group, then of course all elements of the fitting subgroup are left angle. But famously, the converse also holds in this case. And this is Bayer's theorem from the 1950s. And Baer's theorem from the 1950s. So if g is a finite group, then f of g is precisely a set of left angle elements of g. This is not true for the analogous problem with infinite groups. There one thinks about the Hirsch-Plotken radical instead of the fitting subgroup. And it's known to be this theorem doesn't hold. And in 2013, F. Jenny Kugrow and Pavel Shemiatsky. Kugrow and Pavel Shemiatsky proved that properties of angle words associated to a phase X, these are the if related commutators with a G on the left and n copies of X on the right, they prove that these properties of these angle words can give us information as to how close X is to being contained in the fitting subgroup of G, at least in the soluble case. So, this is a sort of generalization. So, this is a sort of generalization of Bayer's theorem. And I need to really make precise what I mean by this. So, I'm just going to have one more definition. So, g is a group, x is an element of g, and for a positive integer n, I'm going to define eg n of x to be the subgroup of g generated by these angle words. And we call eg n of x the nth angle. Egn of x, the nth angle subgroup of x in g. Now, of course, if g is finite and x is a left angle element of g, then this group, this nth angle subgroup of x in g, is trivial for some n. Okay. And in particular, again, this is a trivial statement, but you'll see hopefully the way I'm making it in a moment. The fitting height of EGN of X. Fitting height of Egn of X is zero. The fitting height of the trivial group is zero. And Kukrow and Shumiatsky proved the following generalization of Bayer's theorem in 2013. Let G be a finite soluble group, and X is an element of G, and N is a natural number. And let's assume that the fitting height of this nth angle subgroup is R. And Cooker and Shuniatski prove that X is Karnatiatski proved that X is in the or plus first fitting subgroup of G. So the result tells us where X appears in the fitting series. They also made a couple of conjectures. The first says that something similar should hold for arbitrary finite groups. So if G is a finite group and X in G, then their conjecture is that if the generalized That if the generalized fitting height of one of these EGN of X's for an arbitrary n is OR, then X should be in the OR plus first generalized fitting subgroup of G. And the second conjecture that I'm going to mention concerns this upper insoluble series that I mentioned a few slides back. So, the second conjecture says that if the insoluble length of Egn of X is Of Eg L of X is L, then X should be in the L term of the upper insoluble series for G. So don't worry too much if you don't remember the definition of the upper insoluble series. We'll actually make a reduction in a second, which means that you won't have to remember. And Bob and I proved last year that conjectures A and B hold. So I'd like to. So, I'd like to tell you a little bit about the ideas in the proof. So, the proof has three main steps. The first is actually due to Kukrom and Shumiaksky, and it's a really nice reduction. They prove that conjectures A and B follow from a third conjecture, we'll call conjecture C. And that is as follows. So, if I'm a group and let alpha be an automorphism of G. An automorphism of G. And let's say that the commutator subgroup G alpha is equal to G. Then the conjecture states that these angel words of alpha and G should actually generate G for any choice of N. And now I should make a quick remark that I'm tweaking a little bit with this notation because the angle words in this case are computed in the group. Words in this case are computed in the group G semi-direct alpha, but I guess quite clear from the definition. Okay, so that means we just need to prove this conjectural. This brings me to step two. So, step two is an inductive theorem. A really easy thing to notice if A really easy thing to note if G is a finite group and alpha is an automorphism of G, then we have this property that the commutator subgroup of G with alpha is equal to G if and only if the X conjugates of alpha generate X, where X is this semi-direct product G with alpha. So, to prove conjecture C, another way to do it is to show that if X is some finite group and alpha is an element of. Finite group and alpha is an element of x such that the conjugates of alpha generate x, then this group EXL of alpha together with alpha generates x. Okay. Now the obvious approach to this problem is to use induction on the order of x. So if x is a counterexample of minimal order and we have some proper solution And we have some proper subgroup of x, which contains alpha and such that the h conjugates of alpha generate h, then we know that this e h n of alpha generates h with alpha. So this leads us to consider the subgroup generated by all proper H that satisfy this property. And we're going to call this subgroup yx of x. Going to call this subgroup yx of alpha. And our question is: when is yx of alpha a proper subgroup of x? Because the way we've constructed it, if x is a counterexample of minimal order, then yx of alpha cannot be equal to x. But when you look at examples, yx of alpha being a proper subgroup of x seems quite rare. And our inductive theorem says the following. It says that if we're in this situation where the conjugates of x, sorry, the conjugates of alpha in x generate x, and yx of alpha is a proper subgroup, okay, then alpha must be contained in a unique maximal subgroup of x. I should say here that we could actually prove this result more generally, so we can use instead of So, we can use instead of just an element alpha, we can actually prove it for a subgroup A. So, this is the person that you sees on your screen. And a very short, straightforward argument shows that conjecture C actually follows immediately from this inductive theorem. But this is all we need to prove. And this leads us to the final step. So, in order to prove the inductive lemma, we're actually going to use subnormality theory. And I guess the most famous result in subnormality theory is Whieland-Zipper Lemmas. This is from 1939. So, Wieland-Zipper lemmas essentially means the following. If we have a finite group, and like we have a subgroup which is normal in every subgroup. In every subgroup is contained, then it will be normal in the group. But that's not necessarily true if you replace normal with subnormal. However, Wielan Zipperland says the following. It says that if we're in this situation, so G is a finite group and A is a subgroup of G and A is subnormal in H for every proper subgroup H of G containing A, then either A is subnormal in G Subnormal in G or A is contained in a unique maximal subgroup of G. And there's a really nice generalization due to Paul Flabel from 2010, which says that, okay, let's say we have a finite group in a subgroup A, a group G, such that A is subnormal in all but at one property. I'll put at most one. And either A is contained in a proper normal subgroup of G or A is contained in a unique maximal subgroup of G. So it's not too difficult to see that I think this is indeed a generalization of Vieland Zipper Lemma. And we're going to, in fact, generalize Vieland Zipper Lemma further, and this will allow us to. Further, and this will allow us to prove our inductive theorem. First, we need a little bit of terminology. For a finite group H and a subgroup A of H, we're going to consider the normal closure descending series for A. So this is defined by starting at H, then we take the subgroup A to the H, so the subgroup generated by the H conjugates of A, then we take A to the H. Then we take a to the a to the h, and we just keep going. And we're going to take f of a h to be the final term in this series. So here we have that's the f of a h conjugates of a generate f of a h. Just a quick example: if we take the symmetric group to be four and to be h and we take a subgroup generated by a three cycle. Take a subgroup generated by a three cycle, then A to the H is the alternating group, which is also equal to A to the A to the H. And so F of A H is the alternating group of degree 4 in this case. Okay, we can now state our generalization of the Lanciper language. So let G be a finite group, A proper subgroup of G, and let's G and let's suppose that this set f of a h for the groups h lying between a and g, let's assume this guy has a unique maximal element. Then either a is contained in a proper normal subgroup of g or a is contained in a unique maximal subgroup of g. So it's not as obvious here as as with the Flaville theorem that this is indeed a generalization, but it's just a couple of lines to see that. A couple of lines to see that. And I'll just mention: I won't say anything about the proof, but it follows from some observations about this normal closure designing series. And we also use the Flamel theorem as well. And then now the inductive theorem follows very quickly. It follows as a corollary of this. Of this Vieland-Zipper Lele generalization. And I'll just write the proof here, but all I'll say is that it just follows from the fact that if a to the x is equal to x, then of course a cannot be contained in a proper normal subgroup of x. And this completes the proof of conjecture C and conjectures A and B as well. I should mention at this point. I should mention at this point actually that, as you can see, none of the results use the classification of finite simple groups. In fact, initially we had a proof using the classification, which I think was about 50 pages. And then Bob came up with these really fantastic idea for this approach, this classification-free approach. So I think I can say that because it was Bob's idea. Um okay. So uh I'm just going to tell you about a few consequences um of these results now. Um the first consequence is on the subnormality of these EG of N alpha groups. Um so again let's take G to be a finite group and an alpha an automorphism of G and we can And we can take iterated commutator subgroups, G alpha, G alpha alpha, etc. And they're all subnormal in G, of course. But it isn't obvious that these groups E, G, N and alpha, are subnormal in G. In fact, that's one of the main blockages in proving the results. But a somewhat surprising byproduct of our approach was to show that, in fact, these EG. These eg of n alphas are actually always subnormal in g. We also can say a little bit more about sort of what the last term in the series looks like, looks like. Okay. The second consequence is on elements inverted by an involutory automorphism. So let's GBF and let alpha And let alpha be an involution, be an automorphism of G of origin. Then alpha will invert some elements of G. So by inverting, we mean that x to the alpha is equal to x inverse, where x is an element of g. So let's take j g of alpha to be the set of Be the set of elements x and g such that x to the alpha equals x inverse and the order of x is odd. Then over the course of our proof, we could show that J G of alpha is actually equal to, the group generated by J G of alpha, sorry, is actually equal to one of these groups, Egn of alpha, for some well-defined n. And so a corollary is that if If the commutator subgroup of G and alpha is equal to G, then JG of alpha this set actually generates G. And something that's also quite somewhat interesting is that if we just have G alpha gene alpha arbitrary, so leave out this condition that's the commutator subgroup T alpha equals G, then the group generated by J G of alpha can be bounded of. By Jg of alpha can be bounded above by a function of the size of Jg of alpha. And if we use the classification, then we can get some actual bounds in terms of Jg of alpha. But this is all again classification-free. The final consequence that I'd like to say a little bit about is the question that I mentioned, I think, on the first slide of the talk. And that is, And that is which finite groups G can have an element contained in a unique maximal subgroup of G? So when you start to look for examples, there are some obvious ones. So if G is cyclic of prime power order, then all elements of G are contained in a unique maximum. Sorry, apart from the generator, I should say. Or any generator. Or a generator. Another easy class of examples comes from affine groups. So if we take Q to be a prime power, take the field FQ and take the affine group FQ semi-direct FQ cross. And it's not difficult to see that a generator for FQ cross is contained in a unique maximal subgroup of G. In fact, the group generated by this guy is a maximal subgroup itself. Maximal subgroup it's selling. But what other groups are there? Well, before I talk about that question, I just want to make a quick remark. So if G is a finite group and A is contained in a unique maximal subgroup, it seems reasonable to assume that in this case, the unique maximal subgroup which A is contained is quotient, because if not, then we can pass to the quotient by. Pass to the quotients by the core. So we're going to assume that for the remainder. In particular, this assumption implies that the conjugates of A generate G, okay, and hence for any minimal normal subgroup N of G, G is equal to N times the group generated by A. So this makes our life a bit easier. Now the remarks. Now, the remark completely does the soluble case for us. If we have, so let's say we have G again having an element containing a unique maximal subgroup M of G with M core free. If G is soluble, then G must be of the form N semi-direct A, where N is an elementary abelian P group, and A acts faithfully and irreducibly on N. And this is the first part of our reduction results. Our reduction result. The other groups that can occur are almost simple groups. And finally, we can also have the case where G has a unique minimal normal subgroup N, which is non-abelian. So in this case, G can be viewed as the subgroup of the automorphism group S, where S is the group involved in N, with the symmetric group of degree T. Of degree t. And then we can say that up to g conjugacy, viewed in sort of standard REITH product language, A looks like an element of the automorphism group of S, which we'll call B, followed by T minus 1 ones. And then on the top, we have a T cycle. And moreover, B in this case is contained in a unique maximal subgroup of the almost simple group generated by S and B. S and B. Okay. So this result essentially reduces our classification to the case where G is all simple. So let's think about the all-simple groups. Sporadic cases can be dealt with computationally, and there are plenty of examples. For example, in the monster group, there are For example, in the monster group, there are elements of orders 47, 59, 71, 87, and 94. Each have a unique maximum overgroup. If I remember correctly, in each of these cases, there are two conjugacy classes, and it's the first one listed in the atlas in each case. So that's the sporadic. They're the sporadic cases. So, what about the alternating groups? Alternating groups. Well, again, the case n equals 6 can be dealt with computationally, so let's just assume that g is either the alternating group degree n or the symmetric group degree n. And suppose that we have some element A in G that has a unique maximal overgroup. So we'll do the obvious thing and we'll write A as a product of disjoint cycles. Now, if the group Now, if the group generated by A has more than two holes, but we've got more than two disjoint cycles, then A of course is contained in at least two maximal intransitive subgroups. So M has to be one or two. For example, let's suppose that M is one. Well, so in other words, A. So, in other words, A is an end cycle. Then, A fixes a block system consisting of blocks of size D for every divisor D of N. That means we can have, by our condition, we can have at most one proper divisor, proper non-trivial divisor of N. So, N must be either P or P squared for some prime P. And then Bob has a result on maximum subgroups of. Has a result on maximum subgroups of almost simple groups of prime power index, and we can use this to determine the primitive overgroups of such an element A. And this essentially gives us what we need. The case m equals 2 is a slightly more involved, but sort of similar arguments. Okay, and just for completion, I'll just give you the full result. So this is. So, this tells you exactly when an element of the symmetric or alternating group is contained in a unique maximal subgroup. So, various conditions. For example, in 2, when we have an n minus 1 cycle, then we have to make sure that n is not a prime power, because in that case, the n minus 1 cycle will be contained in a point stabilizer, of course, but maximum subgroup, but also it will be contained in an affine primitive maximal subgroup as well. Group as well. And various other conditions we need as well. Okay. So as you can probably imagine, the finite groups of Li type are the hardest cases. So I'll just give you a couple of quick ideas in the last couple of few minutes of the talk. So let's G be a finite almost influential group with a couple of literature. Almost stable group with the sock-lovely type. And again, let's take A to be an element of G is contained in a unique maximal subgroup. And again, we'll assume that the commutator subgroup of GA is equal to G, which is not really much of an assumption here. So the obvious thing here is to, well, first of all, let's, I'm just going to talk about the simple case. The almost simple case is Shintani descendants. Shintani descent gives us almost everything we need, but it's also a bit more fiddling than that. But for the purpose of this talk, I'm just going to speak about the simple case. So assumed E is simple. So the obvious thing here is to write our element A as U times S, where U is unipotent, S is semi-simple, and U and S commute. Now G is twistedly ranked one. Now, if G is twisted Lie rank 1, then we can solve the problem by inspection of conjugacy classes and maximal subgroups, which are well known. So I'm going to assume that G has twisted Lie rank 1 plus 2. And the first key step is as follows. If G is a finite symbol group of Li type, with twistedly rank at least two, and A is an element of G contained in a maximal parabolic subgroup. In a maximal parabolic subgroup of G, then A is contained in at least two maximal subgroups of G. We actually prove a bit more about the types of maximal subgroups that G has to be contained in in this case, because we need that for using synthanic descent in the case of outer automorphisms. But this is the statement for simple groups. So, this allows us to reduce to the case where. This allows us to reduce to the case where A is fairly simple. By royalties. So let me just give you a few ideas from the classical case. So here we use all the fantastic literature from Clyman Liebeck and Old Ronnie Google and all great work on SS cases and Ashbacker. So, yeah, so we're going to So, yeah, so we're going to consider the classes for Masterbacker's classification. So, determining when an element of a semi-simple element A is contained in a subgroup from Ashbach or C1, which is the reducible maximal subgroup for C3, which is the extension fields. It's kind of similar to the alternating group cases that we dealt with before. For example, if we For example, if we lift the associated quasi-simple matrix group and V is the natural module, then we see that if E has more than two irreducible constituents in its action, then of course it's contained in at least two reducible maximals. So we may assume that either A acts irreducibly on a natural module or it has precisely two irreducible constituents. And then there are reductions as to both. There are reductions as to what finite symbol groups can occur. So then it's kind of in a similar way to the alternating group cases, we can find arithmetic properties that n must satisfy for in order not to be contained in more than one extension field, maximal subgroup of G. Of course, other arguments. Of course, other arguments are needed to deal with the other geometric maximal subgroups of G7, C2, C4, C5, C6, C7, and C8. The class S groups require something else. So let's say that we have a semi-simple element A of a finite quasi-simple group G, and let's say we've shown that it's contained in each geometric maximal overgroup. Group. And let's assume that A is also contained in some class S maximal O M of G. Well, our reductions in the geometric cases show that E must have pairwise distinct eigenvalues in its action on the natural module. And it turns out that by studying the representation theory of the finite quasi-simple groups, one can prove that a maximal class S subgroup M of G. Maximal class S subgroup M of G containing a semi-simple element with distinct eigenvalues is quite rare. We used many papers to do this about small degree representations of classical groups. So I'll just finish by giving you the sort of two theorems. So the first one is just as an example, this is the As an example, this is the story for PSL. So I stated it in the quasi-simple group, easier. And the numbering on these conditions in part two is just referring to the Ashbacker classes. So there are two conditions, for example, to avoid C6 maximal overgroups. And then the last one is for class S. And I thought it'd be nice to include an exceptional group as well. And I know you won't have much time to read these, but I guess E8 is one of the most exciting exceptional groups. And there are three different cases for E8. We can say exactly when A is contained in a unique maximal subgroup. In these cases, the cases of A having order 31 or 61. Or 31 or 61 require separate statements because we can have so-called non-generic maximal overgroups. We don't know if they can be maximal overrouts or not, but there are possibilities. I should say is for the outer automorphism case, we don't get quite as nice a result because Shintani descent doesn't give us enough information for subfield maximum overgroups. So we have to sort of include that as a. So, we have to sort of include that as a condition. But in any case, I think I'll stop here. So, thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Gareth. Thank you.
