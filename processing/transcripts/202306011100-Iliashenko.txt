All right, so for the last talk in this morning session, we have Anton Nilashenko telling us about the betting numbers of NILI G2 and NILI Kerry Manifolds with Vioco Chabam. Okay, so before I start, I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me and giving me the opportunity to talk. To do a talk? Thank you. Yeah. So, what's the plan for the talk? So, the main idea will use the revising box formulas to get information about the body numbers near the G2 and near the KD manifolds. The talk is going to be split into three parts. In the first one, you will look at the estimates or You will look at the estimates on the two curvature type self-adjoint operators and we'll get the estimates on those two operators coming from the bounds of the sectional curvature. Then the next section will actually define the Weisenberg eponymous for harmonic forms and we'll see that if you have certain inequalities on those two eco-virtuals. Those two ecuratory operators, then sourcing Ibachi numbers are going to vanish. And finally, step number three, you'll take the first step and the second step, and you combine them to get the sufficient conditions of the vanishing of batching numbers based on the balance of the sectional recurvature. So this is just the outline. I'll talk more about each curvature operators, and I'll talk about the ways in DocuFollow our circuit themselves. Or the ways in Docker formula circuit themselves. Then I'll talk about the specific cases, such as the nearly Egyptian manifolds, and very quickly about nearly S6 manifolds. And then I'll talk about one example. Okay, so the first section is cursory operators. First, a quickly affixed annotation. So we have a compact connected to a manipulator. To a manifold, we always have an osnormal local frame, we always identify it in a disturbance. We have a decay for the K the tensors, as K is symmetric, as F2, not it's just a tracer system, it's two iterations, the K forms, and then we have the eculcani in the midst of the product which takes two iterates and give us a And give us a and gives us a for it. Also, if you have a standard decomposition of Riemann, the coverage of the tensor in the dimension at least the three. So it splits into the traces, Yurisha pirates, scale part, and the Yukival part. So basically, the standard information, and we also have the condition that the manifold is. You might fault this Einstein. Because the examples it will have in your G2, in the minifault, they are always Einstein. So we are going to use this fact. And we also have the construction the while it answer is it is true. So now we define what a curvature tensor is. It's just a four form which has um two properties. And do your properties. So we have some asymmetries in the indices, and we have the Hivian identity, and obviously, the set of all the curvature tensors is the module over the continuous functions. A quick observation is that if you have two symmetric tensors, then your product is a curvature tensor, hence all the components of the curvature. Everyone encourages are also encouraged. Okay, so for the next part, we just follow a little bit of the Burging Young culture, which when you say R belongs to the control middle R is it again? So this is just the Euruman ecology. And it obviously is a thing. Yeah, so for here we just follow you bringing your question, which was the, I think. I'm not sure. But they are the people who email some of the estimates. So first, when we have a curvature, we can define the operator ahead on it, which it gives us. Which it gives us a self-adjoint operator on two forms, and it acts on two forms by equiduction. Also, we have the A circle operator, which is also a self-adjoint operator, but now it acts on a symmetric two detectors, also by conduction. And also, you have the usual sectional curve here. And this is just remarked that even though Remarked that even though we define a head as acting on only on two forms, we can just extend it on any forms just by taking the conduction of the first indices. And here is a quick observation that since well apparently always C3C3, then the image under the W circle map is also going to be a T3 as well. So we have the following equipment identity. Following equivalent identities, and here, but this I just mean if we take G Nemitz product G and then we apply the sectional cursion map, or we take G Newspaper G and we apply the head map, just either suggesting suddenly multiples of the identity. And when I manifold this Einstein, we can easily see that the difference between W hat and R hat is just a multiple of identity, and the difference between Identity and the difference between a W circle and R E circle is also just a multiple on the identity, but only on the iterators to the tensories. So just a quick observation again, since W circle is always iterates free and they differ by constant with our hy circle and traces elements, then in what of those operators you preserve the traceless symmetric to e dynamics. It race as symmetric to dynamics. So now we assume we have some bounds on the sectional equivalent. Say it's bounded below by small delta, bounded above by big delta. And then we just change the center of R by moving it a bit. So we have those three conditions adjusting on the ecology, so it's easier to work with. Sorry, can you think back just to you're replacing R by some multiple of production? Yeah, so instead of R I just have R A minus some multiple of genomics product G, it's also a curvature. You think so? So you're saying that if R hat is between the delta and big delta, then R hat. So if this is true and I do this, I get this. So now we want the estimates on the So now we want the estimates on the head of the operator based on the bounce and the sectional equivalent. One of the statements we need is just the usual equivalent. It can be bounded using the bounds of the sectional equivalent and the progressive creative. Egreeman each curvature is always a dynamic combination of sectional ecurator. A combination of sectional economic e-terms, soviets, ecollect at the ones in the gun. So, this was the Ethereum Education, and they have the following statement. There's no table on this one. Table on this one. That's what Gonsaldo, right? I completely find the inequality. Okay, so we have the following Ethereum, which says if we have a bound on the S sectional recurvature, then we actually have a bounce on this self-adjoint operator ahead, which acts on two forms. And the eigenvalues are in this integral. And here I just mean we take this part minus. Mine is this expression here, that's the lower bound and the upper bound is this, a plus with this, it just and how he does he prove this if he takes an eigenvalue small r hat, big arcad, if he takes the corresponding eigenvector. Since we like removed r, you can also see how it changes r the not a hat. not a hat so it just by a multiple of identities so the beta is also an eigenvector eigenvector for r not hat and we can see what the eigenvalue is and then we take our eigenvector we take the economical a form so this is the economical you write down the equations which means The equations, which mean that beta is eigenvector of this separator, and then we just divide through by the maximal EPJ, and that's the norm. Then we have this inequality here, and we can see that each term here is just then equal to one. There is at most so many of them because of the rank. And this term is just the sectional curvature, so we if we combine them, we get exactly this estimate. them we get exactly this estimate so you you yeah so this is the statement you get yeah yeah so actually you know we can improve this estimate for a nearly eg2 or nearly a cadmiums but only on certain establishes so i didn't say what those i mean you probably you know what those stress bases are and and you can pretty easily show that And you can pretty easily show that R head and W head preserved for those spaces. So it's a self-ish operator on those SL spaces as well. And we can see that we have a better estimate than the previous Ethereum gives us. So here we now have a 7 over 3 both for the replicator and the previous one it would have given us only You're giving us only 11 overtreated. And then ideas pretty much the same. You take eigenvalue, eigenvalue, eigenvalue, eigenvector. But this time when we have the economical form for eigenvector beta, because the corresponding subspaces are isomorphic to the algebra, we can have a canonical form, which also gives us a form which also gives us an extra condition that the sum of the beta i's is zero so we can use this fact we know there is at most a three of them because nearly egg is a dimension uh nearly a six is a dimension of a six so the rent is at most e3 so we have at most e3 of those is over so that's k I'm sorry, it should be P as well. Yeah, I'm sorry. It should be P as well. So there's three of them. So if you take the amount of one, you can see that it's norm is the sum of the norms of the other two. And we have the same inequalities as on the previous slide. But now at this time, But now at this time, then that means P is one, so it's rank two P is two, then you're saying that just it is zero. Yeah, so if there are some conditions on what it yet you can do, yeah. If I could have the same inequalities on the E previously. Why do we know that the yeah, why can we assume beta to satisfy this? Because we know that this is this is true. Yeah, so by assumption, the beta is of this form or of a magnitude, and there's some computations that show you can define. To show if we can define economical reforms which give us this condition as well. Yes, basically because of those two facts. You can just use the, you're assuming beta is in lambda 214, and you can find some basis in which let's say it's right two, right? So you have one block and then zeros. And then imposing that it's in lambda 214, you'll show that it's SMG. Maximoto SG2. Maxwell Taurus and G2 trace this. You could put any analytic Maxville torus and trace this. Hey, there's a question from Derek Harland in the chat. Sure. How does this estimate use the nearly Kaler nearly G2 hypothesis? So if it's not a nearly G2 and nearly Kaler, then those two spaces are not yet preserved when we apply our head map or NPW head. Now, a question for me. Can you briefly define what a nearly G2 uncle is? Yeah, everyone else has been calling nearly parallel. Yeah, I'm sorry. So the structure of this thought, first I talk about the estimates and then I talk about what EG2 is. It's sort of like at this point, all we need to know is that it also. Is that it also spaces are it preserves and we can find the economical basis. So those are only the two functions in our. So just finishing this, this is the same inequalities we have in the previous slide, but before we had each one of those is less than or equal to one, but now we know that the sum is equal to one, so we have a better estimate. Can I see again? I'm still confused with something. For example, if I do this for S6 or S7, which are isotropic, so the curvature tensor, so the sectional curvatures are all the same. The small delta and the big delta are the same. So the term on the right-hand side is zero. Then this becomes negative. So this would tell me. Then this becomes negative. So, this would tell me that the Eigen filters of R hat. What am I doing wrong? It's possible. So, when you are thinking of R hat acting on the two forms for a positive recurrence, it acts with negative eigenvalues. Yes, the minus. All the definitions you have are up to is 10. It's a bit strange, it's a bit strange. It's always the fight of the definitions, yeah. What's very one between seven and one between seven so for each times the sectional package. It is sevenly just a constant. The constant, it depends on the download. So, you next give one the similar estimates for our circle. And again, Burkinj and Kershaw showed that you want to follow this Einstein, all the eigenvalues of R circle and transfers asymmetric to tensors are in this interval. Are in this interval. So, if you want to talk exactly on this set, you have to use the understand. Otherwise, it's not equal to. And how does the approval go? Exactly in the same way as before. You take eigenvector, eigenvalue, you find economical a form, you write down the equations, which mean the eigenvector, which means that H is the eigenvalue. which means that h is is the eigenvector of uh r not a circle and then you divide you through it by the maximal h ej and you get the and we get the estimate we want but actually even when we assume the manifold is einstein so we have this estimate but we can have actually a better treatment of the Better treatment of this equation here, and we can get better estimates which now involve the Einstein constant. So you want to have two intervals. Originally a paper by Burkinha and Garcia, they have only one estimate, but you can actually improve it. I mean, you not improve it, but actually, you can also define a second one. And evolving is not like a subset of the. Evan is not like a subset of the other one, so you both are equally divided. How are they proofs? Yeah, again, we start in the same fashion. We have the equations in which age is the eigenvector. But now we have a little bit more careful treatment. We don't just divide it through by the maximum one, we take the maximum one. But before that, we also But before that, we also remove our historical bit so it's only a positive, and then we have and then we divide it through by the positive maximal hj and we can get those inequalities. Rich are better than on the previous slide. So, this is just an example of one inequality, and in a similar fashion, you can find all four. This is the SMS if we have an trace asymmetric to the tensors. And you know that in the nearly equal setting, this space splits into two. But unfortunately, there are no economical forms in those two spaces, so you can't really improve the estimate. Can't really improve the estimate specifically for any of the EK or any of the EG2. So all we use is that those spaces are Einstein. And that's it. So you're saying that in the R-Circle case, you're using the Boche Einstein? Yeah, I'm only using it right that is Einstein. Yeah, that's specific to. I use that is NeuroDigit2 and your D2. Maybe you draw. You can only call your forms on the stats basis of addresses or symptomatic to the answers, but I couldn't define any, so we just had this. But it's still better than the original estimate. If I remember correctly, I think we know what those forms should be, but they weren't able to give you an improved estimate, is what I get correctly. I mean, it it's one or the other. It's one or the other. Like in any way, this yeah couldn't improve you improve this. It's specific to a new digital neural digit again. So now we talked about the evising working formulas. You want to apply those estimates we had before. Of course, this is the general evising working formula. We have Yellow Plausion divided in terms of the rough. Of the roughly, we have the curvature terms. Very quickly, even the way this is a two-form and it simplifies like this. When it's ion signed, it simplifies even further. And you can immediately see that the head operator here pops up. For the three forms it's it's a little bit more complicated, but at first it just it simplifies like this. Just simplify it like this. And you can also simplify it a bit more in the Einstein case. But that's all you can do. So now we go to the specific cases of manifolds being near the G2 or nearly. So we all, you know what nearly G2 manifolds are. It's when a number of FI is a multiple of psi, this multiple is just This multiple is just eta0, some non-zero equal constant. Even now that those manifolds are Einstein and all the constants we don't have a digital structure, we obviously have this plane. This is just the description. And here is the effect that we can show that W you had applied to U just zero, and this exactly means that W you had it preserves omega to 14. And since we know that W hat and R hat differ by constant, on this subspace, both of them will preserve The presolve umega to A14. And next, a very crucial effect which is used is that the harmonic form, so neural G2 manifolds are of special algebraic type. So every A2 form is in omega2A14. So every harmonic 2 form is in omega 2A14. Every harmonic form is in omega A3A27. I didn't say what Mega 327 is, but we'll see it on the next slides. Maybe, again, you mentioned this before, but I just want to say that all the stuff in this section is known already. Just we compute those formulas in a very transparent Transparent at a linear algebra way. So everything is done very simple. So this is the Weisenbulk formula for E2 forms and nearly equated manifolds. And we know that the harmonic E2 forms are in omega to 14. So we can immediately get the following statement which says if you have a certain lower bound on the lower bound on w hat then b2 equals zero and the proof is done by integration and if you take the statements from the first part of the talk you can actually you get a sufficient conditions on the evaluation of v two based on the bounds on the sectional equator. And this is exactly the bound and this is exactly the inequality we need to get this one. It to get this one. So the theorem is stronger than the property, right? No, of course. What I meant is you don't need that inequality at the bottom. That's sufficient, but there's a weaker condition that applies. Yeah, yes. So for your three forms, it's a little bit more complicated. It's a little bit more complicated to the evidence about the formula. At the original, you show the steps already, so yeah, all of this is known. Sorry, going back to the previous question, I think it was it that you were saying that maybe it's easier to check the thing in the modularity of the thing. Yeah, so it might be easier to check the thing, but you don't need that to be true. You just need, well, even the theorem is sufficient, but not. Even the theorem is sufficient, but not necessarily necessary. Well, he's going to show that it's not necessary. Just a comment. Yeah, so all those statements are sufficient, but they don't have to be necessary. So in the case of constant curvature, so this is a big delta of the second. This would say that two deltas. This would say that 2 delta is less than or equal to 3 quarters tau zero squared. Is that actually true for the constant? Yeah, do you have any examples of nearly each two of a constant assumption? I don't each either. Well, it's just it's just to check if this actually would imply that the seven sphere has. Would imply that the seven sphere has V20. We know it does. But just to check, I mean, because if this is weaker than the metric of radius one turnout is forward further from the correctly, so then you would want two delta to be less than three. Delta is one, so two of those need to be yeah, but I think that would be good to say. It's also what point out, I think there are examples in theory, the GG animals would be too. There are examples where B2 equals zero, but if the three is not, B3 is and B2 isn't. Yeah, sorry, but it's all a kind of example. Alternate proof in metric. See what? Alternate proof in metric. Okay, so for the three forms. For the three forms, you will have the you need a battery a description of three forms. So we have this diamond map. This diameter map is an isomorphism between those spaces. And you can explicitly define the backwards map, how to go from those spaces to this space, and also the formulas. So we have some. So we have some epic constants here. I mean, nothing especially about those epic constants, but they all rematter, of course, even we have the estimates. So you first will simplify the Weisenbog formula for on this subspace, and then we know that all the harmonic forms are actually in here, so it can be. Here, so it can be simplified even more. First, we introduce the divergence operator and symmetric to be14, where there's a formula. Also, when we have a symmetric two tensor, we can define h e to the map, which is a just a two e tensor, just uh a contraction of nameless phi. Yes. You're going very fast, but You're going very fast, but it's not so easy to understand all these problems because they are written in the index notation. For me, it's not geometrically clear what they actually do. Yeah, I know it's not geometrically. Yeah, there is one, but that was the whole point. Like, if you get all the proof, it's just using the contractions. So it's very easy to check. The question is, what is H2? So in the previous it started we have this diamond map. That's the algebra action. Yeah, that's the algebraic action. So it maps irreducible SASpaces to irreducible SARSpaces. And we can find exactly. And we can find exactly what it does on each subspace. And here's the formula one can check. This is the inverse map of the diamond map. So if you have a gamma of this form, A, a diamond FI, you can actually find all the components of A just based on gamma. So you define the gamma effect. You have the formulas. And have the formulas for each by the way. So you the H2 is some kind of kernel operation, but extend it to symmetric two tensors instead of vector two tensors. You can write it for it for free, but it's computationally faster to derive with on something because I know many people are averse to this kind of thing. And also in the previous definition, aren't those terms all of them? Are those terms all of them? Because this is a street form. Yeah, you shouldn't have the three colours. Yeah, you should make it. It says K form. But we are using it as a three form. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a tackle. There should be no dots. No, no, it it it this is it works for everyone. Yeah, but your sigma only has three indices there, so so you're doing it on sigma equals. Oh yes, yes. Oh, yes, yes. Yeah, I'm sorry, yeah. So we have a two following maps and the next preposition it tells us an explicit description of echarmonic forms in terms of those two maps. So if M is nearly Eg2 and you have a three to the seven form which includes all the echarmonic forms, Which includes all the e-harmonic forms. Then, by the previous slide, we know it has to be H diametrify for some H in asymmetric tracers to trace. Then we know that beta is harmonic if and only if the following two conditions hold. And how is it done? You know, it's like a curve of H. It's a curve. I mean, it holds. No, that's a differential equation. Yeah, it's still used. Tilda is a differential operator. Okay, because I thought it was some algebraic. Okay, because I thought it was some algebraic version of H, but that's not the equation. So it says that H is some kind of eigen tensor of the kernel as such equation. And how's it done? You know that eharmonic affiliates on the compact space are the form is eharmonic if only if a d beta and this beta are zero and you check what a debata I mean and you check the conditions when a debate is E0 When Ed beta is E0, and when Ed star E beta equals E0, and you get exactly the statement E0. So this is the pi 14 E part, this is the EPI 7 part, so they both have to be E0. So age is always symmetric. And from here, you can, yeah, so it is simply this, and we know that the variant has to be zero as well. Sorry, can you get back on slide, please? Just really quickly. Yes. Yes. So if div h equals zero, h to control. No, it's definitely not. The conjecture on the index is here for a bit. It always occur. But it tell me not curve. Okay. So we had this proposition which it it tells us is something about the harmonic forms. Something about the harmonic forms. When you do the computation for the Weisenberg formula, you know that each set has to be something diamondify. And based on those isomorphisms, actually you find what is something it has to be. So we have the following proposition that nabul of H should diamond to phi equals all of this diamond to phi. Of this to diametrify, and now we assume beta is a harmonic, then we know it's in 327. So we know that this holds, we put it in here, and we got the following, the formula it has to hold. Sorry? Are you saying every theta in omega 3, 1, omega 3, 2.1? Excellent is what this one. That's correct. H diamond five. That's correct. Yes, yes. Yes, yeah. Yeah, this space is isomorphic to this space. So we get the following formula, and so you can have our estimates for the three forms. So if m is nearly egg2 and you have the following bound on w circle, then the three equals zero. And yeah, and so we can take the proposition the first behalf of the term and we have the sufficient conditions for b3 to be zero based on the bounds on the sectional curvature. So we have u2 there and it's or so. If this one holds or if this one holds, then the b3 equals zero. And the the three was a yes we're not sharp yeah then I quickly go through the near the system efforts so so just before you do what are there cases where you do know enough about the spectrum of where you know enough about enough about these differential harmonic forms to be going through. Like if you know something about WS, are there any cases other than the I'm always beginning constant case just because that's the only one I know. I'm just gonna say so this is like the biggest problem that in all the known cases like explicitly if you take homogeneous spaces we know what the EP2 and EP3 are but we can also find like all the AW circles on All the W circles on the all the R circles, all the sectional curvature bonds. So, like, all you can do is just check if it goes. I'm not sure about the applications, so if you have any ideas, I open to them. I'm going to show an example. Basically, you can show that in some cases this theorem can be used to include something about the bed numbers that we already knew, right? And in some cases, anything. Right, and in some cases, inequality doesn't apply, and but then there are still that choice definitely necessary. And then there are some cases where uh yeah, I was just thinking about one of our space or I think it was B2. Yeah, but I think B3 different from zero is more difficult. Yeah, yeah, no, I think that's so you could turn it around, right? And if you know It's just like a good cat. Then you can turn that around if if you know V3 is not zero. This was technically changing for it. It works if that model is zero. It works. So the next section is just quickly go over the results. I mean Over the results, I mean, it's saying a type of results from the nearly ecator is ex manifold setting. So, just a basic definition of what a nearly ecator is. We have an SU3 structure, we have this form omega, R is the real part of omega, and we say it's nearly the category of those two. Those two equalities code. And there's a couple of other various equivalent descriptions of nearly eclipse manifolds. But I'm going to use this one. And also, you just know that all the neurally ecator a6 manifolds are Einstein and I R? Yeah, so R is the real you're really you're part of a I know it's a bad annotation if people use epsilon class minus yeah especially the problem is the code exactly it's my fault because in our meetings I was using this because it's easier to write faster for me and then I told him we shouldn't do that to paper but they saw that so yeah so So, in here, the category is 164 and standard. And standard constant is 5. Here we also have the isomorphisms. Here, this diamond maps. So, this is again, it's all known. We can define the isomorphism. We can define the map which takes from space on the right to space on the left. Yes, so the spaces we are interested in particularly are those ones and those ones. And S2 and minus is just symmetric to tensors which actually you commute with J. S2 plus are the ones you wish you commute with J. And the ones which you commute with J is split into a tracer ones and multiples of G. So This is the main effect, which is also of great importance by Foscolo, which says that on the nearly echelon 6 manifold, all the harmonic 2 forms are in omega 2, 8, all the eharmonic 2 forms are in omega 3 as well. So we can quickly get the basic multi-formula for. You get the evasive motive formula for two forms. You can see that you can write it using this W headmap. And so we have the following inequality. If we have a lower bound and that we have on this subspace omega to 8, which includes all the economic forms, then beta equals 0. And as before, this is the inequality and the balance in the sectional equation we need to get this one. So it also, it also. This one. So it also tells us if this false, if two equals zero. So for the three forms, again, it's a little bit... I'm sorry, I'm still on two forms. If you got... Here you can see that for the two forms, omega two, eight is isomorphic to a traces is isomorphic to. A traces is symmetric to a tensors which you commute with a j. So you can actually get the Weiser-Boche formula for two forms, but in terms of this W isircoma. So you know if it's in omega to H, then it's equal to H diamond R for some unique H. And hence, we can get this statement here. And again, you get the inequalities which tell us. Which tells us if I have a lower bound on this operator here, then between zero. And we can, you know that I can actually take S2 plus and not and put it in here, but as I said before, we don't have any better bounds, so it doesn't you make a difference. So I'm just gonna keep at this one. And as before, if we get the propositions, it says if we have it also. If you have those two conditions and the balance in the sectional curves should then be two equals zero, and this is exactly what we need to get for this one. Can you go back to the previous slide and what's the difference between yeah, so this one involves combinations of big delta and small delta and this it doesn't involve that but I think this one it does not imply Does not imply it at all. So the both are the weighted. So we have two different ways of getting b2 equals zero. And we can do the same for the three forms. After some time, you find this formula which it has to hold if it's a harmonic form, which lies in omega 312. omega 312 then beta is h timed r if some unique h in this is subspace so we get the formula and and hence we get the proposition which says again if you have is some lower bound on w circle then b3 equals zero and again as before you get the conditions which means if you get b3 equals zero you're based on the bounds of the sectional version so that sense that if you have neutral killer b3 If you had communicated with B3 non-zero, delta has to be at least two or two or two. So it can't be two small or yeah. Yeah, so in the S3 times S3 case, what happens? Delta small, delta is that one is fine. But it but it's four, what about the other one? At least one of them has to fail, right? And that's the one that fails. And that's the one that fails because what's big delta and street is two case? Probably three. Okay, so I'll go to an example. And as I mentioned before, it's not really an application because we know what An application because we know what V2 and V3 are in almost all the cases. So, the best we can do now is just check if all the results are consistent. So, we take a normal homogeneous space. And when you have a normal homogeneous space, you have an explicit formulas for the curvature, sectional curvature. And you can also You have those formulas when the space is not normal, those are a little bit more complicated, so we just stick to this one. So we have explicit formulas. This is the example we check all the statements on. It's SU3, cross-su2, mod U1, cross-su2. This is just a quick A quick description of the space. So as you turn on the bottom, on the bottom, is embedded like this into the enumerator. Eigum is embedded in this way. If I take this metric here, then the space is a normally homogeneous space. We can also check that it has a near the EG2 structure, and we can find all the Then we can find all the the constants like et al node, Einstein, the constant and sectional uh I'm sorry, yes so this is just the description of the algebras and the space of colour splits. It has some information, I'm not going to spend time on this. Okay, so if you use those formulas I showed before for how to calculate the curvature on the normal homogeneous space, we can actually get the exact bounds on all the types of curvature operators. So we know that the sectional is between one-fifth and 37 over 5, and similarly you can get exactly all the eigenvalues. Exactly, all the eigenvalues on omega to 13, the traces isometric 2 detectors. So, all those serves are sharp. And we can check, does the first turn imply the other ones? Of course it does. So, exceptional implies this one, which is true. And we can also you can like see how if or off were. So, this part is kind of far. Is kind of far. You also get that the balance on the sectional occurrence implies that there is a balance on the R circle, and we can see that one of them is too sharp, so we didn't do so bad. Yeah, so everything is consistent, we don't have any problems. And then we can also check if anything of the two and the three statements are also econsistent. So in this case, we know or So, in this case, we know already that B2 equals 1. So, it must be false that this is a true. And we do know that it is false because we can achieve a smaller eigenvalue. Hence, no eigenvalues. This part here shows that those conditions we have are sufficient, but not yes, sorry. As in this case, B3 equals E0, but unfortunately, Unfortunately, this inequality is not true. So we can't use it as it gets zero. But in some cases, we can. Sorry, 56 over 5 is smaller, but bigger than 9. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, so actually I was a little bit short on time, but that was it.
