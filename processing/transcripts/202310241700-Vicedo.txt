My talk will be broadly based on these two papers. In fact, mostly on the first one. And I'll touch on the second one towards the end. So the topic of the talk is about the connection which emerged in the recent years between gauge theory and integrable systems. So let me give you a very rough idea of what this involves. So the way you get integrability out of gauge theory is this was first proposed. Theory is this was first proposed by Costello in 2013 and then further developed by Costello Witteny and Yamazaki and then Costello Yamazaki more recently. So the idea is you start from 4-D transience theory and by introducing various types of defects, so either line defects or surface defects, you can produce different types of integrable systems, namely integrable lattice models if you put some line defects in the 4DH and Sein's theory, and if you put And if you put service defects, as I'll explain in more detail, you get two-dimensional integrable field theories. So I've written here the integrable structure of these different theories. So for lattice models, you get this quadratic Lax algebra, which quantizes to this RLL relation. For integrable field theories, you get this famous Maillé non-ultra-local Poisson bracket, or if S is zero, you just get this ultra-local bracket. So all the theories which you are familiar with. Theories which you are familiar with, which fit in this framework, can be obtained in principle from 4D trans theory. And then there's more recent development about how to obtain finite dimensional integrable systems with this linear Lax algebra. And so to get this, what you should start with is not 4D trans-Simons theory, but a one-dimensional lower gauge theory called 3D BF theory, which I'll talk about in detail in this talk. And so by introducing line defects in this theory, you can Defects in this theory, you can produce a whole plethora of finite-dimensional integrable systems. And I'll build a very general class of such models related to finite Goda models. Okay, and please interrupt me at any point if there is any questions. Something's not clear. So let me just start by giving you a very broad overview of the relationship between 4D channel Simon's theory and integrable field theory. So this will not be the main subject of my talk, but I'll sort of tell you the big picture in. Sort of tell you the big picture in this diagram. So if you start from 4D transmission theory, you can put it on, let's say, cylinder cross CP1, or you can also put on R2 cross CP1. So the idea is that this red manifold, R2, or the cylinder R cross S1, will be the underlying world sheet of your signal model of your field theory that you're going to produce downstairs in two dimensions. And the extra CP1, the extra copy of CP1, essentially plays the roles of the spectral parameter. So the idea is that you So, the idea is that you want to build a two-dimensional integrable field theory. Integrability essentially means that there's some hidden algebraic structure related to affine-Casmodi algebras, some spectral parameter present. And so you can lift that integrability to a 4D gauge theory, which is 4D churn-simons theory. So the way to go from 4D Chan-Simons theory back down to 2D integrable field theories is you should fix the gauge and impose certain boundary conditions at various surface defects. Boundary conditions at various surface defects. So I'll give more details about this later. And then there's another approach to producing a broad variety of integrable field theories, which is to it's a more algebraic perspective on the construction of integrable field theories, which starts from the notion of aff-angued models. So this was something which was first realized by Feyden-Frenkel in 2007 on specific examples and then further elaborated for much more general field theories. So the idea is you start from an afango demo, which is a good amount. You start from an affine Goda model, which is a Goda model, as I'll explain in a few slides, built out of an affine-Katzmudi algebra. And then what you do is you choose a realization or representation of the affine-Katzmudi algebra at each site of the Godard model to build a specific integrable field theory. So this passage from 4D Churn-Simons down to 2D integrable field theories can be factored through affine Godin models in the sense that if you first pass to the Hamiltonian formalism from 4D Chen-Simons, which is an intrinsically Lagrangian framework, Lagrangian framework, and then you gauge fix in the way that I'll describe, which you can do on this side. What you end up with is affine Goda models. And then, if you further fix a choice of realization, which amounts to doing the same thing as choosing boundary conditions at the defects, this brings you down to a specific integrable field theory. Okay, so what I want to talk about is a much simpler version of this whole story, which allows you to build very general finite dimensional integrable systems. Two finite-dimensional integrable systems, and the idea is to start not with 4D transients theory but with what's called 3D BF theory. Okay, and what I'll do in this talk is present how to extract from 3D BF theory a very general class of models known as Godin models, more precisely the Godin models in some particular realization. So, and when I say finite dimensional integrable system, what I have in mind here is really linear Poisson-Lax algebras. Poisson or Lax algebras like this. Okay, and the Godin model is such a model with a linear algebra structure. Okay, so the plan of my talk is basically this picture. So I want to first start by recalling what is the Godin model. And then I'll present a very general realization of it using quadjoint orbits to build a specific integrable system. And then I'll explain how to build that. And then I'll explain how to build that integrable system starting from 3D BF theory by introducing certain line defects. Okay. So let me start with the Godard model. So the Godard model is some dynamical system built out of a general semi-simple complex Lie algebra. So I fix some Lie algebra G. And then I fix some dual basis elements, IA downstairs and IA upstairs, which are dual with respect to some fixed chosen symmetric bilinear form on the Lie algebra G. Bilinear form on the layer algebra gene. So the other data I need is to fix a set of complex numbers, Z i, Z1 up to Zn. So these you should think of just as points on CP1. And to each of these points, I attach some dynamical variables, which are essentially copies of the Lie algebra, but attached to each of these points. So in other words, to each point Zi, I attach a copy IA with basis IAI at the site ZI. So I have Z i. So I have n copies of the Lie algebra which form a direct sum of this Lie algebra, n-fold copy. And I label my generators of each copy by this extra superscript, which is this one to n. Okay, and then what I can do, because these are Lie algebra elements, I can package them into single generators which are Lie algebra valued. So in other words, I tensor with some auxiliary copy of the Lie algebra. My generator My generators in this direct sum of n copies. And what I get out of this is Lie algebra-valued dynamical variables. So it's just the dynamical variables of this Goda model that package together in some matrix, which is this auxiliary factor. Okay. So now I can describe the integrable structure. So you start from the cat's moon, the Lie brackets of the Lieutenant. Lie brackets of the Lie algebra G at each site. So you have a separate copy of the Lie algebra at each site, which gives me this Lie bracket on the direct sum, which is just a direct n commuting copies of the same Lie algebra. So if I take site i and j different, I get zero. And if I take the same site, I get the Lie bracket at that site. And I can package these together into a Poisson bracket for this Lie algebra valued element, the algebra value dynamical variable. Element the algebra value dynamical variable, which are these constant Kerala Poisson brackets. So, again, for different sites, I get zero, and for the same site, I get the Poisson bracket of this current at different, well, J1 and J2, I get this Casimir. So, this is the split Casimir, so IA tensor IA, and commutated with the Lie algebra element. So, another way to Lie algebra element. So another way to write this is J A, oh sorry, IA I B is F A B C I C, where everything is at site I. Okay, so out of these Liegebreak valued elements, I can build the Lax matrix of the Godin model, which is just this formal rational function, which combines all these Liegebreva valued currents as the residues. And this Poisson brackets, the cost one kilo of Poisson brackets for the direct sum of n copies. For the direct sum of n copies of the algebra, I can package together into the Poisson brackets for the Lax matrix. So the Lax algebra for the Lax matrix at Z and at W gives me this specific R matrix, Casimir over W minus Z, commutated with the sum of the two Lax matrices. Okay. So what's the advantage of writing the Poisson structure of the model in this Lax form? It gives you In this Lax form, well, it gives you a machinery for building a large number of integrals of motion. So, in particular, if I take invariant polynomials of the Lie algebra and I evaluate these polynomials on the Lax matrix, then by virtue of this Poisson bracket being a commutator, I get that the Poisson bracket of two invariant polynomials of the Lax matrix Poisson commute. Okay, and by invariant, I mean adjoint invariant, so it's invariant under the adjoint action. So, to fix a Hamiltonian, you just choose a specific value of W. So, fix a complex number W, and fix an invariant polynomial P. And this defines for you a specific Hamiltonian, which is, because I've taken polynomials of these Lax matrices, which are linear in the currents, which are basically encoding all these linear observables in the direct sum of n copies of the algebra. When I take a polynomial of those, I get an element of the symmetric algebra. I get an element of the symmetric algebra on this direct sum of n copies. So, this is really the algebra of observables of the Godin model, and the Hamiltonian is one of these observables. I get that all these quantities. Yeah. Hello? Is there a question? It's fine here. No question. Please continue. No question, please continue. Okay, sorry, yeah. Okay, so um, so I was saying that the virtue of this in um commutativity relation is that all these objects here are integrals of motion because they commute with the Hamiltonian, which is one of these quantities built out of an invariant polynomial. So you get for free a large number of integrals of motion built out of this Lax algebra. Okay, so now that I fixed the Hamiltonian, I can describe the equations of motion. So, namely, I just take the Poisson bracket of any observable with this Hamiltonian, and I get the time evolution of this observable. And what's nice is that the time evolution of the Lax matrix itself is given by this Lax equation. So, all the equations of motion of the linear observables are encoded in this Lax equation, where the matrix M here appearing is given in terms of the choice. Is given in terms of the chosen polynomial p, which encodes the Hamiltonian in this particular way. So, this formula will be useful to remember later because I'll reproduce this from the 3D BF perspective. And if this notation is a bit abstract, you can think more concretely in terms of GLN. So if I fix my invariant polynomial to be the trace of the nth power of the element, then this element m here is just the n minus first power of the Lax matrix divided by Z minus W. Z minus W. Okay. But more abstractly, this P prime is essentially a linear map on G. So I can think of P prime itself as a Lie algebra element. And it's divided here by Z minus W. So this is the Lie bracket in G in the auxiliary factor. Okay. So now I want to tell you about a specific realization. So I'm going to realize the So, I'm going to realize the abstract Godin model in terms of variables on some concrete phase space, which will be some product of co-adjoint orbits. So, what I do is I fix some Lie algebra elements u1 up to UN, and I build from those the co-adjoint orbits. So, because I'm identifying the finite dimensional Lie algebra with its u, I can think of these as adjoint orbits. So, these fixed elements are conjugated by. These fixed elements are conjugated by some elements, general elements of the group HI, and their orbits are denoted by ui hat. Okay, and so this co-adjoint orbit for each i is a symplectic manifold. The product of it is a symplectic manifold, where the Poisson bracket is given nicely by this corresponding Kirlov-Poisson bracket. So the ui hat with uj hat is again the commutator of the split Casimir with ui hat. And they commute if i is not equal to j. So this I is not equal to G. So at this point, you notice that this is really exactly the same as the Poisson bracket relation for the generators of the Godin model. In other words, these residues of the Lax matrix satisfy this Poisson bracket relation. So I can literally take the points on the co-adjoint orbit as a representation or realization of the abstract Katsmudi dynamical variables. So more precisely, what I can do is I can build a realization of the Goda model. Realization of the Godin model or its algebra of observables into functions on the co-adjoint orbits. So exactly what I'm doing is I'm realizing these abstract generators IA at each site I in terms of these coordinates on the co-adjoint orbit UI hat. Okay, so this gives me a concrete realization of the Godin model, namely, I can take its Lax matrix abstractly and realize it. Its Lax matrix abstractly and realize it using this representation. So I apply the representation to the Lax matrix, I get this sum of rational functions where now the residues are these concrete coordinates on the co-adjoint orbit or products of co-adjoint orbits. By construction, this Lax matrix still satisfies the same algebra because it's just a representation of the previous Lax matrix. So the algebra is still satisfied. And then the Lax equation. Satisfied. And then the Lax equation are again just a representation of the abstract Godin evolution equation, which was this Lax equation. So these are really the three key equations which you should try to keep in mind, which will reappear in a few slides in the context of 3D BF3. So the point is to try to reproduce this from 3D BF3, which is just some auxiliary gauge theory, which has a priori nothing to do with the Goda model. Okay, any questions? Okay, any questions so far? Okay. So now let me move on to this the core of the talk, which is explaining how to obtain this integrable structure or this integrable model from 3DBF theory. So let me describe 3DBF theory. So the data is essentially the same as what we needed to build the Goda model. So I need some semi-simple Lie group or Lie algebra. Or Lie algebra. I need an invariant pairing on this Lie algebra. And then the field content of the 3D BF theory is a connection with three components, AT, AZ, AZ bar. So this is just a field on, or a one-form on R cross CP1. And the important thing to keep in mind is that this is at the moment just a smooth one form. So the dependence of all these components on T, Z, and Z by is completely smooth. There's no meromorphicity in. Meromorphicity in any of these components. And then another more special element which I need is this B operator, which is a smooth G-valued one-zero form. So I use the complex structure on CP1 to sort of describe these one-zero forms, which are forms which are only along the DZ direction. So first, this B has no DT component and it has only a DZ component, no DZ bar. Okay, but again, this is pure. Okay, but again, this is purely a smooth function, nothing holomorphic yet. Okay, so these are the fields, and the action of the theory is, as the name suggests, BF. The action is just B paired with F, which is the curvature of the connection A. So I integrate this over the manifold R cross CP1, and this gives me the action of 3dBF3. So there's an immediate obvious gauge invariance because B. Invariance because B is only has a leg along the DZ component. So that means that if I have any DZ component in the field A, namely this component here, it will immediately drop out from the action because it's going to be wedged with the B field. So I should say that implicit here in this notation, there's a wedge product in the Lie algebra, in the form part, and the pairing is in the Lie algebra part. Okay, so these are Lie algebra valued forms. So I pair them in the Lie algebra part and I wait. Pair them in the Lyangeva part and I wedge them in the form part. So, because of the implicit wedge here, any dz component in the curvature drops out, so therefore, I can just ignore any dz component in the field A. In other words, you can say that there's this obvious gauge invariance, which means you can shift your gauge fields by any component of dz, and it will stay the same action. So, this allows me to just fix the az bar component to zero for free. I can just ignore the dz component. So, this is my field content now. So, this is my field content now. I've ignored the AZ component, and I just have AT and AZ bar for the A field and a BZ component for the B field. Okay, so there's a more interesting gauge invariance, which is the following. So under this gauge invariance, by some general group-valued field G, the connection A transforms as a connection. So, in particular, both of its components transform in this way. And if I And if I do have a z-dependence in G, I would generate a new AZ component, but I know I can just ignore it because it drops out from the action. Or in other words, you can just gauge it away again by this gauge invariance. So from now on I just completely ignore any AZ component. And even though this might have some Z dependence, any Z component generated, I can just kill by this other gauge invariance. So this is the way the gauge field transforms, which implies that the curvature transforms by conjugation. Transforms by conjugation, and I impose also that the gauge field or that the field B transforms by conjugation. So, what this means is that because it's paired with the field strength in the action, by adjoint invariance of the pairing, I get that this is invariant. So, the conjugation of B cancels the conjugation of the field strength. So, this action is indeed gauge invariant under this transformation. Okay, so we have a gauge theory. So now let me discuss the equations of motion. And this is the key part where we start to see potential connections with integrability. So if I work out the equations of motion for B, that's trivial. I just get the field strength FA equal to zero. Okay, so the equation of motion for B is just that the zero is a zero curvature equation for A. Again, there's just a T and a Z bar component. And then the equations of motion for A are you. And then the equations of motion for A are easy to work out. You get these equations. So, the key one I want to focus on here is this one, which looks remarkably like a Lax equation. So, if I interpret Bz as the Lax matrix L and A or minus AT as the matrix M, then this is exactly of the form of a Lax equation. So, although the similarity is quite striking, it's actually far from being a Lax connection or Lax equation because the point is. Equation because the point is that neither of these two fields are actually meromorphic in Z. So they're completely smoothly depending on Z. Okay, so what we want to do now is sort of try to work some Meromorphicity into the fields A, A, Z and A T in such a way as to turn this equation into an honest Lax equation. Okay, and so that the key will be to use the gauge invariance to move to a specific gauge where we can ensure that these are actually meromorphic. Okay, so Okay, so let me talk about this gauge fixing procedure. So, this is where integrability will come out. So, let's go back to these equations that I ignored. So, I call these bulk equations because, well, let me come back to this later. So, these equations, you can see that if I manage to set az bar equal to zero, because the right-hand side of both of these equations only involves az bar, this will completely disappear. So I get the right-hand side's equal to zero. Right-hand side is equal to zero, and this will tell me that AT is holomorphic in Z and BZ is holomorphic in Z because they have no Z bar dependence. So the idea is to try to move to a gauge where AZ bar equal to zero. And you can do this because this is gauge theory and AZ bar is a valid choice of gauge. Okay, so this is the key idea to impose a gauge fixing condition that Az bar is equal to zero. And by doing so, the right-hand side of the first two equations is set to zero. And this tells us immediately that A is equal to zero. And this tells us immediately that A is dynamically, these equations are solved by saying that AT is holomorphic and DT is holomorphic. Okay. So the issue here is that we've gone too far. We've made them holomorphic as opposed to meromorphic. So in particular, because I'm working on CP1, this would mean AT and BZ are both constant, which is a bit boring. So I need some extra structure to ensure that they're not just holomorphic, but actually meromorphic. So this is the first issue. This is the first issue. Can you still see my screen? Okay, so okay. So, the first issue I mentioned is that these are actually holomorphic, which is too strong. We want them to be meromorphic. So, they don't. them to be meromorphic so they don't have any poles in C at the moment and the other main issue is that this L and M should be related to each other. In other words, you should be able to build M out of L. And at the moment, these are just two completely independent fields. They have nothing to do with each other. So they're unrelated. So these are the two really issues with these L and M. And both of these issues will be fixed by introducing some perturbation to the action. So some defects along specific lines. So let me tell you about. Me tell you about how this works. So, I want to introduce line defects. So, the purpose again of these two line defects will be to correct these two problems. I'm going to make A and B both meromorphic by introducing line defects, and they will also become related to each other. So, the two line defects I introduce are just, I priority pulled out of the hat, but these are the two extra terms I add to the action. So, I start with my BF action and I introduce two extra terms, which are local. Two extra terms, which are localized along some lines located at specific points in CP1. So these n line defects here are called type A defects because they depend only on the gauge field A. So they couple some new fields H, which are living on the line. So on one single copy of the line, which is located at Zi or Zj. And they're group values. And I couple them to the gauge field A in this way. Field A in this way. And here you can start to see the data of the Godin model appearing. So I'm introducing here a fixed element of the Lie algebra, which allows me to write this term for the defect. So I couple this Lie algebra valued element to this fixed Lie algebra element uj, which will turn out to be the point in the coherent orbit as before. Okay, so these are all end effects at the Z i's, which will be the location of the Godard model, the location of the sites of the Godard model. Of the site of the Goda model. And then at some other location w, I introduce another line defect, which I call a type B defect because it only depends on the field B. And to describe it, I just introduce some polynomial and I evaluate the polynomial at B. And this is integrated along the Line's effect at W. Okay. So the first thing to ask is: is this still a gauge theory? Do we still have gauge invariant? So it's relatively easy to make this term gauge invariant. We just have to choose. Make this term gauge invariant, we just have to choose a polynomial which is adjoint invariant because then the conjugation of b by the parameter g will drop out. Okay, so I choose my polynomial p to be an adjoint invariant polynomial. This makes the last term a gauge invariant by this transformation property of the p field. And then to make the second term or the first defect term gauge invariant, I just have to ensure that the field H here. To ensure that the field H here, which is living on the defect, transforms accordingly so that it cancels the gauge variation of the connection dt plus at. So, in particular, I just choose it to transform by left action of the gauge transformation parameter restricted to the point zj. And this ensures that this combination here is invariant, so therefore this collection of defects is gauge invariant as well. Okay, so I have now again an honest gauge theory, and so the question. Gauge theory. And so the question is: what are its equations of motion? And can I, what happens when I move to the gauge az bar equal to zero? So the equations of motion get corrections from the two defect terms. So I had this color coding defects at W is in purple and defect at the ZJs is in orange. So I get these corrections, which correspond to these two types of defects. So the equation of motion for B is corrected by the type B defect. Corrected by the type B defect, and equation of motion for A is corrected by the type A defect. But the point is now, again, by moving to this specific gauge Az bar equal to zero, I can get rid of these two terms and be left only with these terms, which are localized at Z equals W and Z equals Zj. Okay, so moving to this gauge, the point is that solving these two bulk equations, so I call these now bulk equations. So I call these now bulk equations because they depend on, they tell you about the Z dependence or Z bar dependence of the fields, which is, if you like, the direction of the bulk. So there's the defect direction, which is the T coordinates, and then there's a bulk direction, which is the ZZ bar. So these are called the bulk equation because they tell you about the dependence on the fields in the bulk direction. And so after fixing the gauge AZ bar equal to zero, the bulk equations of motion just tell you that AT has poles. tell you that A T has poles at has a pole at W with this residue and Bz has a has poles at the ZJ's with these residues so this is by virtue of this relation dz bar of one over Z is delta of Z up to a factor so in particular now this last equation it really is just the Lax equation because Bz now is an honest meromorphic function namely this linear combination of this rational function with these residues and With these residues, and the matrix M is, as promised, a function of the matrix L because it's built out of the polynomial of B of Z, but B was set to the Lax matrix. So M is related in this way to the Lax matrix. Okay, so we get this, the last equation which we haven't solved is really the honest Lax equation for the Godard model. Okay. So To completely close the connection with Godin models, I really need to produce also the remaining ingredient, which is the Poisson bracket of the Lax matrix with itself. So I need to show that the B field has a Poisson bracket with itself, which is of the Lax form. So far, I just talked about the dynamics and reproduce these formulae for the Lax matrix, Lax matrix and M matrix, but I want to show that L has the correct Poisson structure. Um, Poisson structure. So before moving to the Hamiltonian formalism to do that, what I can do is actually just do this gauge fixing and solving the equations of motion at the level of the action to get an action principle for this Lax equation. Okay, so these are the equations of motion I haven't solved. What I want is an action principle for this remaining equation of motion. Okay, and what I can do then is just start from the 3D BF action and do what I did before, which is impose this gauge. Before, which is impose this gauge and partially solve the equations of motion by substituting the solutions to the bulk equations of motion. So, in other words, I just ignore AZ-bar dependence. I just get rid of it in here. And whenever I see BZ, I replace it by this solution. And whenever I see AT, I replace it by this solution. So what I get out of this, plugging all this into the action, I get a first-order action for the remaining degrees of freedom, which is just these defect fields HI. These defect fields HI and the lags matrix, which is built out of these. Okay, so it's an action for these fields living on the defects. So it's a 1D action because it's just integrals along dt. I've dropped out all the zz bar dependents. And you might recognize this as just p dq. So this is like p and this is dq. Right, these are the dynamical variables and this is their. Dynamical variables, and this is their time derivatives. And this I'll show in a second is really like the conjugate momentum, but it's been frozen to this special value in the co-adjoint orbit. So these are like the frozen conjugate momentum. So this is PDQ minus the Hamiltonian. Okay. And you can check very easily that if you vary these equations of motion with respect to the HI, you reproduce exactly this Lax equation. So this is really the equations, the action principle for the Lax equation. Action principle for the Lax equation. And I'll refer you to tomorrow's talk by Anup, where he'll consider some multi-form version of this action and relate this to the Godamo in the multi-form language. Okay. So now for the remainder of my talk, let me talk about the Hamiltonian formalism. So now what's left to do is to show you that the Lax algebra, which involves this R matrix, so cross-sum brackets of Lax with Lax is the R matrix. Lax with lax is the R matrix commutator with L plus L. This lax algebra should fall out from constructing the Hamiltonian formalism for the 3D BF theory and imposing all these gauge fixing conditions and so on. So let me just move to the Hamiltonian formalism to show this. So I essentially just introduce twice as many fields. I introduce conjugate momentum for all the dynamical variables. So again, here I'm already ignoring any AZ. Ignoring any AZ field. I just ignore it because it's not part of the action. And the conjugate field to the group-valued element H here is a Lie algebra valued element. So you can think of this as these two fields here parametrizing the cotangent bundle for the Lie group G. So H parametrizes the base, and then the fiber is parametrized by this Lie algebra valued element X. So computing these conjugate momentum, you immediately find These conjugate momentum, you immediately find. So, by varying the action with respect to the time derivatives of these canonical fields, you find that there are some constraints in the Hamiltonian formalism. So, for example, the action doesn't depend on any time derivative of AT. So therefore, the conjugate momentum has to be zero. And you get some other constraints which just fall out from the computing the conjugate momentum. And you immediately find that some of them are second class. So if you're not familiar with Second class. So, if you're not familiar with this Dirac formalism, this will be a bit abstract, but I just want to give you sort of the idea, which is how this R matrix algebra comes out quite elegantly from the 3D BF theory, which has nothing to do with R matrices or anything. This will just fall out of the Hamiltonian analysis. So, if this is unfamiliar to you, just don't pay too much attention to the details. But the point is, if you're familiar with these. But the point is, if you're familiar with these Hamiltonian formalism, if you have a pair of second-class constraints, that means that their Poisson bracket is an invertible object. And so what you can do is immediately set them to zero. You can just impose them strongly to zero by introducing what's called the Dirac bracket. So this is a modification of the Poisson bracket, which allows you to set these constraints to zero strongly. So in other words, it doesn't matter whether you set them to zero before or after computing Poisson brackets. Computing Poisson brackets, it gives you the same thing. And the reason this works is because the Poisson brackets corrected by two extra terms, which involve here the inverse of this Poisson bracket between the two second class constraints. And the role of these two terms is precisely to ensure that if I plug in one of the constraints here, so if suppose I say g is equal to p, then here I'll get the Poisson bracket of C with P, which Of C with P, which is essentially this kernel of the identity operator, which is then contracted with its inverse. So I'll just get F with P. All of this boils down to F with P. And then here, P with P is zero. And so this second line disappears. So I get F with P. And then in the first line, I get F with P. So F with P minus F with P would be zero. So the direct brackets of anything with P is immediately zero by construction. Okay, so that means I can just. Okay, so that means I can just impose these constraints strongly, provided I replace every Poisson bracket with a direct bracket. But as it turns out, this direct bracket is the same as before for every other field. So in other words, for these guys, I get zero. For the field PZ and CZ, I get zero. But for any other field, the Poisson bracket is the same thing as the direct bracket. So I'll just keep denoting it by a Poisson bracket without the star notation. So the next thing to consider is this. The next thing to consider is this constraint here. So, this is more complicated, and I'll be very brief. Essentially, it's both first-class and second-class. So, the first class part is extracted by projecting onto the centralizer of this element UI. But the point is that there are first-class parts and second-class parts. You can fix the first-class parts by choosing any gauge fixing condition you like, and then by passing to the corresponding direct bracket, you can. Passing to the corresponding direct bracket, you can show that regardless of what gauge fixing condition you choose, you'll always end up with this Poisson bracket on the reduced phase space. So imposing these constraints strongly can be done by again moving to a Dirac bracket, which turns out to be exactly just the cost on Kirilov bracket for the fields UI head. Okay, on this quadrant orbit. So notice that here, as I said in Hamiltonian formalism, the momentum Said in the Hamiltonian formalism, the momentum had been frozen to these values minus ui, which are specific points on the cohesion orbits. Okay, and what's left is just these coordinates on the cohesion orbits and their Poisson bracket, or rather the Dirac bracket, is given by this cross-on-Kirilov bracket. So there's only one constraint remaining, which is this pi t. So in the Hamiltonian formalism, you really want to ensure that the constraints are preserved on the time evolution. So if I write down On the time evolution. So, if I write down what the Hamiltonian is in terms of the remaining degrees of freedom after fixing all these other second-class constraints to zero, this is my Hamiltonian. And so, if I compute the Poisson brackets of the Hamiltonian with pi t to get the time evolution of pi t, I see that I get a non-trivial term from this first piece here. So I get this mu hat is equal to zero. So, mu hat is this particular combination. So, in other words, in order to ensure that the primary constraint pi t is preserved on the time evolution, Pi t is preserved under time evolution, I need to introduce a new constraint, which is a secondary constraint. But it turns out that the procedure stops here. So, if you ask, how does this vary under time evolution? Well, it turns out that the variation of this under time evolution is just going to give you back nothing new because you get back essentially the original constraint. So, imposing this equal to zero ensures that this time evolution of this constraint is also preserved. So, it's also zero. And this is by virtue of the fact that this new And this is by virtue of the fact that this new constraint is first class. So its Poisson bracket with itself is proportional to itself. Okay. So these first class constraints in the Hamiltonian formalism, they generate gauge symmetries. And this precisely generates the gauge symmetry of the gauge field A and the gauge transformation of B by conjugation. So the gauge transformations I showed you in the beginning in terms of the Lagrangian formalism, they are generated as through As through the Poisson bracket with this secondary, with this second class, the first class constraint. Okay. So, Poisson bracket with this constraint is the gauge transformation. And what I'm going to do to fix that gauge transformation is I'm going to impose the same condition I used in the Lagrangian formalism, which is to set a z bar equal to zero. And so, what you find is, in particular, the gauge transformation of a z bar with respect to mu hat, there's an az bar. Spectrum you had. There's an AZ bar piece which drops out, and then the only term left is this piece, which turns out to be invertible. And the inverse of this Poisson bracket is exactly the R matrix. So it's a Casimir divided by the difference of spectral parameters. So this is exactly where the R matrix will appear in the Hamiltonian formalism through BF3. So my goal is to construct a Dirac bracket, which allows me to impose this gauge transformation and the gauge transformation. Fix this gauge transformation and the gauge fixing condition strongly. So I want to set both of these to zero strongly. So the formula for the direct bracket is just the Poisson bracket shifted by these two correction terms, which involve the inverse of the Poisson brackets of mu with A. And so you see the appearance of this R matrix here. And what's remarkable is that if you compute this direct bracket for the B field, then what you find is that the Dirac bracket of the B field with itself is just the Lax algebra. field with itself is just the Lax algebra. Okay, so remember that the B field was in the Lagrangian formalism what was identified with the Lax matrix and we see here that indeed the B field has a Poisson bracket with itself which is exactly the Lax algebra or more precisely the Dirac bracket which is needed to impose all the constraints to zero. So now that these constraints are strongly set to zero because I'm working with the Dirac bracket and we can ask what do these conditions say? So recall mu hat is this condition. So recall mu hat is this condition here. So setting it to zero, first of all, because I set az bar equal to zero, this term disappears here. And then what I'm left with is that dz bar of bz is equal to this sum of direct delta functions, which is precisely saying as before that the b field is a rational function with these residues. And the Hamiltonian, if we go back to the expression for the Hamiltonian. Back to the expression for the Hamiltonian. Well, I've set mu hat to zero, so this term disappears, and I'm just left with this term. So this becomes the Hamiltonian on the reduced phase space. So the dynamics of the reduced 3DBF3 after fixing all the gauge invariance and all the secondary constraints, the second class constraints, is this boss on brackets on the current joint orbit with this Hamiltonian generating the dynamics, which is precisely the Godin model, because this is the Lax matrix. Because this is the Lax matrix of the Guitar model. And what's nice is in this language, you can very easily see why adjoint invariant polynomials of the Lax matrix with itself Poisson commute. So before I impose the constraint strongly to zero, I'm working with Poisson brackets. So it's obvious here why taking any polynomial P of B and any polynomial Q of B, with if I take this Poisson brackets, I obviously. If I take this Poisson bracket, I obviously get zero because B commutes with itself. So I probably did mention this, but B has no Poisson brackets with itself. So that's why this is just automatically zero. Its Poisson bracket is non-zero with its conjugate momentum only, which I think I called pi z. So however, if I now choose adjoint invariant polynomials, what that means is that the Poisson bracket with the gauge transformation is zero because the gauge transformation generates conjugation. Transformation generates conjugation of the field B. That's the transformation property it generates on the field B. But if the polynomial P is adjoint-invariant, this is an invariant, so therefore it Poisson commutes with the gauge transformation. So by choosing adjoint-invariant polynomials, this Poisson bracket with the mu hat constraint is zero. And if you go back to this formula for the Dirac bracket, that means that this term will disappear. If I put u and v both equal to p of b and q of b, this term will disappear. Of b this time will disappear because p of b commutes with mu hat, and this time will disappear because q of b commutes with mu hat. So, therefore, the direct bracket is equal to the possum bracket, but we saw that was zero. So, therefore, the direct bracket is immediately zero. So, this is another way of seeing that with respect to this Poisson bracket, invariant polynomies of the Lax matrix are in involution. Okay. So, let me conclude. Let me conclude. I think I have three minutes, so let me quickly conclude. So, what I want to say is that all of this story, in fact, nicely generalizes to field theories. So, I've talked about only finite dimensional systems, but everything works very nicely, applies to field theories, or rather affair and Goda models. And the point here is what you'd have to do is not start with 3D VF theory, but 4D trans. An example of this is, which is very closely related to the example I looked at above, is starting from 4D Chen-Simons action, which is just a 3D Chen-Simons form wedged with an extra holomorphic one form. Or it's meromorphic, it has positive infinity, but it's holomorphic on the plane. So DZ wedged, this Trans Simons three form is a four form which I can integrate over R2 cross CP1. So this is exactly the same transients form we saw yesterday in the talk by João. The talk by Joa Martens. And what I do is to get an interesting model out of this, I need to couple the gauge field to some defects, which are localized now not on lines, but on surfaces. So I choose a specific set of points AM and BN on the CP1, and I introduce line defects, or sorry, surface defects, which are along the whole of R2. So localize at points on CP1 and along all of R2. And on these defects, And on these defects, I have some fields and psi n living. So they're really living on R2. They're fields from R2 to G. And these are just constant elements. It's a bit like the points in the co-joint orbits in the finite dimensional case. So these are very reminiscent of the type A defects I had before. And indeed, if I impose a gauge fixing condition az bar equal to zero, which also applies in this field theory case. Also applies in this field theory case, and I solve the bulk equations of motion to reduce down to a two-dimensional theory. What I get is exactly the Zakharov-Mikhailov action. So these fields, which I introduced as defects fields, they turn out to be the field content of the two-dimensional theory, which is the Zakharov-Mikhailov action, which if you're familiar with, you'll recognize. So, one thing I want to point out is that in this action, there's this very nice appearance of This is a very nice appearance of the R matrix. So the R matrix is part of the potential term in the Zakharov-Michaela function, and you'll see more of this in Vincent Caudrélé's talk tomorrow, where he'll talk about a multi-form version of this action. So what's nice in this 3D BF theory, or here 4D Chan-Simon story, is that the action which involves this R matrix comes out purely from Lagrangian considerations of a gauge theory, which has nothing. An of a gauge theory which has nothing knows nothing about the R matrix, but this R matrix appears through the construction in the resulting 2D field theory. Okay. And then you can also do the same story in the Hamiltonian followers, and you could essentially construct the Hamiltonian version of 4DH and Simons and find that the Lax matrix of the Zakharov-Mikailov model satisfies the expected Poisson structure. Let me not say much about this. This generalizes really to a whole This generalizes really to a whole variety of integrable field theories. There's this whole zoo of 2D integrable field theories, most of which have been constructed in recent years by virtue of these new machineries, namely 4D Chen-Simons theory and the algebraic analog of affine Goda models. So you have more general versions of 4D Chen-Simons where you have some meromorphic one-form replacing the DZ, and you can add some defects which are more technical. But the point is these 4D Chen Simons. Because these 4D transience theory with T effects produce the whole variety of 2D integrable field theories, which you're familiar with. In particular, I think all known 2D integrable signal models are produced in this way. So finally, what I hope I've convinced you of is that 3D BF theory and in the field theory case, 4D Chen Simon's theory is really like a universal machinery for building integrable systems or integrable field theory. Systems or integrable field theories. So it's some universal framework underlying integrability of many known integrable systems. So the point is you start with your bulk theory and then you couple it. So this is what describes the integrable structure. In particular, the R bracket for the B field was shown only using the bulk structure. There was no need for the defects. What the defects do is they provide you with a realization of all these abstract generators of the 3D BF3 or 4D transit. 3D BF theory or 4D trans theory, in terms of concrete fields in one or two dimensions. And this way you get specific integrable systems or specific 2D integrable field theories. So it would be very nice to understand. So I haven't talked much about Lagrangian multiforms, but I think most of this should be related to Lagrangian multiforms. The point is that 3D BF theory and 4D transigence theory, they just produce one integrable system out of. System out in the whole hierarchy. So there should be a whole integrable hierarchy to which these integrable field theories belong. And the problem is that 4D transients theory, as it stands, doesn't build the hierarchy. So what would be nice is to have a version of 4D transients theory or 3D BF theory, which knows about the integrable hierarchy. In other words, which would produce not just the action itself, but the Lagrangian multi-form for the whole hierarchy of integrable systems or integrable field theories. And then another And then another very important question, which I won't touch on, is just how this formalism of 3DBF theory and 4D trans theory is useful for quantization. So, this is a very big open question and not much is known at the moment, but I think the 3DBF story is a very nice toy model where such questions could be answered because we know a lot about the quantization of finite Goda models, and we know very little about quantization of field theories, especially those which come from 4-D transformation. Especially those which come from Volditran Simon's theories with non-ultralocal Poisson structures. Okay, so let me stop here. Thank you.
