So here we will talk about how to give it to work on faster solutions to the automatic quantum equation without any thanks a lot for the invitation. Is that a 45-minute talk? 45 minutes. Okay. Plus questions. Oh, plus questions. Thank you. So yeah, it's my pleasure to be here to be able to give this talk. This is indeed my first in-person conference talk since Conference talk since the pandemic started. So it's very nice to be here. And it's very nice to see everyone here in person as well. Looking forward to all the interesting talks and all the introductions. So thanks a lot. And if you can't hear me, please ask me to speak up. But I'm going to talk today about the I'm uh going to talk today about the uh non-negativity of a global classical solution to relativistic Pulsemark equation without angular cutoff. Um this is Joan Berg with Jin Woo Chang. I'm a posttech who's uh in the audience. And um this is a combination of several papers but it's really a talk about this paper that's uh basically finished. I mean final stamp of approval on the paper. Final stamp of approval. So, something that I want to emphasize ahead of time is that my experience studying the special relativistic Pulseman equation started when I was a PhD student, but a theme of this, my experience has been many, many things that are sort of essentially trivial to Essentially, it's trivial to do in the Newtonian non-relativistic situation become sometimes extremely difficult or at least initially almost impossible to understand in the relativistic situation. And then there are often difficulties that are not considered to be sort of PE difficulties that a PE artist would think of as something. Think of as something interesting thing to discover. But so if you want to study this equation, you have to be comfortable with struggling with algebraic problems and other difficulties that you may not be used to when doing PDE. Okay, so this is supposed to move forward. Oh, that's how it works. Okay, so the relativistic Boltzmann equation is up here. is up here. So it's dtf plus p over p0 dotted with gradient of f is equal to q of f and f and x is in a domain. P is in R3, P is the momentum and P0 is the energy. So the time goes forward. Everyone knows that's probability that's in. Any question? No, I was wondering if we should get the chair out of the way so you can stand freely. So um yeah P is the P0 is the energy and uh P is the momentum and we sometimes write P mu as P0 comp P and Q is a local and DNX collision operator which is non-local in the Q and the angular variable. And V theta is this molar velocity thing here that I won't punish you by Um that I won't punish you by reading out loud. And sigma is the collision operator. Um and then uh quantities in the collision operator are these opposed collisional momentum, which are this is sort of the analog of the what is often called the sigma representation in Newtonian kinetic theory. So p prime is p plus p over 2 plus g over 2 times omega plus minus. minus one where C is just this quantity P0 plus Q0 over S and then you have P plus Q times P plus Q dot omega over P plus Q squared and Q prime is similar and P0 and Q0 are the energies and this scattering angle is this funny looking quantity here cosine theta is 1 minus 2 G P P prime squared over G P Q squared and G is this thing that we G is this thing that we call the relative momentum. It's a Lorentz invariant quantity. And so then it's a square root of P0 or Q0 minus P dot Q minus 1. And this is kind of the analog of the Euclidean distance between B and V star in the Newtonian case. Instead of being sort of linearly invariant, this is now Verenz invariant. And it's not trivial to see that this cosine theta is actually. Cosine theta is actually a well-defined angle. But it is. And this is a calculation that was done in Pelassi's textbook on kinetic theory. And then S is rare plus 4. It's also relativistic invariant, Lorentz invariant quantity. And here's our hypothesis on the non-Gotoff collision kernel. So sigma is G. Got off collision kernels. Sigma is g is a function of g and theta, where phi is a function of g alone, and sigma zero is a function of the angle alone, and these are both non-negative. And phi is a power law times a constant, so it's g to the rho, where rho is constant. And sigma zero is not locally integrable, so sigma zero behaves like theta to the minus two minus gamma. And the range of parameters is taken to be. And the range of parameters is taken to be gamma between 0 and 2, and theta and 0, pi over 2. And we allow that this constant rho is between 2 and minus 3 over 2 minus gamma. And we call rho plus gamma greater than 0 the hard potentials, and rho plus gamma negative are the soft potentials. And this full set of physical assumptions on the inclusive kernel were proposed by two physicists from Poland, Djudinsky. Physicists from Poland, Ludinski and Plio Czechskaya, in 1998, in the CMP paper that they go. And this collision column makes a relative Old Mark equation an analogical fractional diffusion equation. Yes. The analog of the hard sphere kernel is contained there or not contained and not interesting or why is it not? Yes, it's contained here. Okay. It would be um so there is no relativistic hard sphere. Relativistic hard sphere because having a hard sphere implies instantaneous communication and that would violate relativity. But you can think of a hard ball. And so the analog just in terms of the kernel would be rho equals one and sigma zero equals a constant. Is a constant. But yeah, that's not written. Sigma zero is a constant is not written here, just like for Newtonian non-Kudo-Boltzmann, you wouldn't see that this would converge to a constant unless you wrote down the inverse power law case. Also, the inverse power law potential is not consistent with special relativity because it implies instantaneous communication and its own. And it's unfortunately like sort of a big open problem, as far as I know, in physics to define carefully relativistic particle dynamics. There's an old paper by Feynman where he uses Maxwell's equations to define particle dynamics backwards in times in a relativistic, relativistically analog, relativistically invariant way, using Maxwell's equations. Using Maxwell's equations, but those dynamics are not known, it's not known how to do them in a well-defined way. So there are problems, big problems. But there is a relativistic Boltzmann equation, and this is it. And okay, so here are some examples of relativistic kernels from the physics literature. These are, so these are. So, these are not derived from the inverse parallel potential because, as I said, you can't do that in a way that's consistent with special relativity. But these are derived using Feynman diagram techniques, and these derivations are often found in not in statistical physics textbooks. So, the inverse parallel potential is found in every first. Every first-year graduate student's statistical physics textbook, and you can see that Maxwell's calculation of the Boltzmann kernel in those textbooks like on page one and something like that. But these kinds of kernels are derived in sort of quantum electrodynamics type textbooks, and they are derived using Feynman diagram techniques. And these are approximations of Approximations of some kind of infinite series that doesn't converge, but they say that it makes sense to write this down as an approximation. So this, I just wrote down two, there are other ones. This one is really sort of the analog of the Rutherford cross-section in the 20 Boltzmann theory. So it's not really relevant for the delta-vistic Boltzmann equations. Delta-visive Polishman equations would be more what you see for the Landau equation, but it is a non-Kodoff kernel, so I show it here. And then this one is called Israel particles, and so B can be a non-Kodoff angular function that you can use in others or short-range interactions. So short-range interactions are one of them is the hardball case that you asked about. Case that you asked about, and there's component scattering. Okay, so the relativistic Maxwellian equilibrium is what I call this a Jebnar solution. And it maximizes the entropy subject to the constraints of mass, momentum, and energy, as in the classical theory. And you have all these constants, Boltzmann's constants, T is the temperature. K2 is a Bessel function that makes this the L1 integral. This, the L1 integral of this equal to 1. And it's written here if you're interested. And so you have the speed of light, C voltmets constant t. And then if you want to normalize all the constants, you just write e to the minus p0 over 4 pi. And this has L1 norm equal to 1. That's why you put the 4 pi there. And so the difference between Newtonian, the Newtonian equilibrium and the relativistic one is that. And the relativistic one is that you have this e to the minus p0 here, which makes it decay slower. Because in the Newtonian case, it would be e to the minus b squared. And sometimes that hurts you, even though it's still exponential decay. Okay, so here's, it looks like a long list, but it's actually a short, incomplete list of relativistic Polkwom results. So there's this initial 1967. Initial 1967 result by Bischelier on local opposiness for bounded cross-section, and then there's these series of papers by Duzhinski and Nikhil Chiniska. The first two are 1988-89. Did he tell two solutions for the linearized equation? And then Glassie and Strauss in 93 and 95 proved smooth solutions on the torus, linear equilibrium. And then in 95, they proved the whole space case for cutoff hard potentials. And then in 2009. And then in 2010, I proved low resistance and stability for the soft potentials. And I did, I proved a Newtonian limit as the speed of light goes to infinity the same year. And with Jared Speck, in 2011, we studied the Hilbert expansion. And in 2012, with Yang Wo, we studied, we proved the global resistance near equilibrium of the last Maxwell-Boltzmann equation. And with Posthop TSU in 2012, Tia Zhu in 2012 proved the uh global existence in the equilibrium for the soft potentials. And um Alan Rendell and uh Lee in 2013 studied the spatially homogeneous case for Harbour potentials and Minkowski and the general relativistic Robinson-Walker space-time. So it's also an interesting problem to study the general general relativistic Boltzmann equation special relativity. Special activity. But that's sort of widely open. And then Rentoine and Yu in 2017 proved global existence and stretched exponential decay for the soft potentials. And Wang 2018 studied the problem with initial smallness in L1 vector L infinity. And Nishimura extended the result to L1. Extended the result to L1 to the L1 local case. And Bijang and Yun studied global opposedness for quantum statistics. I believe this is in the spatially homogeneous case. And this paper I'll talk about today with Jen Wu Zhang, in 2012 we finally were able to prove global war coefficients without angular cutoff, in a spatially dependent case near equilibrium. So I say finally because we worked on this for a long time. And as I was said at the beginning, a lot of when we started working on this, we encountered a lot of very unexpected difficulties that I'll tell you about. It can be frustrating. Okay, so the Newtonian-Boltzmann equation derived by Boltzmann in 1872 is up here: dtf plus v dot gravitates f is equal to qff and q equal to QFF and Q is the non-local quadratic collision operator that's local in T and X and the preposed collisional velocities are these things here, the sigma representation. So V prime is V plus V star over 2 plus V minus V star over 2 times sigma. And V prime star is the same thing with minus sign. So when I started, I said this to someone yesterday on the Banff airport here, but when I started studying Here. But when I started studying the Boltzmann equation as a graduate student and I saw these things, I thought they were like the most complicated expressions I'd ever seen. It was very intimidating. And then when I saw the relativistic analogs, I felt like it's a waste of time to study this equation. But you can make some sense of them if you're willing to stare at them for long enough. At them for long enough and think about it. So, one, I don't, there's so many really nice results nowadays on the Newtonian Boltzmann equation without angular cutoff that I'm basically going to mention none of them so that I can have time to talk about my results. But I am going to mention the cancellation lemma, which is, to me, at least sort of one of the foundational estimates for the non-local functional. Estimates for the non-local fractional diffusion of Boltzmann equations. So, in this 2000 ARMA paper by Alexander David Leclerc and you remember, this was not the main result of the paper. It was just a lemma, and it was really just a change of variable. But it was this and analogues of it are sort of the main way that people characterize the diffusion for the Non-cutoff Boltzmann equation in the Newtonian case. Even though this shows that there's no diffusion because there's a convolution here, there's if you the change of variable that proves this is used to characterize the diffusion. So this integral here over dv and d sigma is equal, can be shown by a change variable to be F convolution S, where S is C three times the Euclidean distance of C, C three. Existence of z, c3 is some constant. And this holds for a very general class of functions and it's based on the change of variables from v prime to v, d prime to v with just the Jacobian determinant dv over dv star is cosine theta over 2 squared, which is greater than 1 over 8 over the relevant theta from 0 to pi. And this is a big part of the foundation of rest and expanding a lot about fractional diffusion and Polson equation. Okay. Um okay. So excuse me. So the cancellation lemma in general can be thought of in this way. So if you consider the distance u of theta v prime plus 1 minus theta v for theta between 0 and 1, then the change of variable u to v has this Jacobian determinant and it's greater than 0 always. Greater than zero, always because you have a theta over two theta cubed here. And since cosine theta is greater than or equal to zero. Yeah, and I said this a few times already. So the change of variable, at least to me, has served as the foundation for most estimates with fractional diffusion. And so the biggest problem that we encountered in my study with Fiji Wujang was we can, eventually we were able to, we found it hard to believe for a long time. We found it hard to believe for a long time, but eventually we were able to prove in a special relativistic situation that this analogous change of variables is generally not even true, not one fine. And so at first we did a numerical study on our own that we found inconclusive because a little bad because it wasn't rigorous enough for us because we were not numerical people. Not numerical people. We had to run the computer for a long time to get a few large Jacobians. And then we found an undergraduate at UPenn who was very good at coding and approximation. And he helped us to, we already had a code, but he helped us to use sort of a descent method and to. And to use our code, but I think he was able to optimize it in Python instead of in MATLAB. And we put it in a cluster at UPenn and we found, like, and he used SageMath to go from getting, like, eight digits of zeros to two hundred digits of zeros, 'cause he was able to do well. Zeros because he was able to do and he was able to find like millions of zeros of this Jacobian in or something like that. So it was went from spending weeks to find. And then we started. And then we started to believe it. But this, the way, so the first thing I'll say is that if you can write down a relativistic Karloman representation, which kind of looks like this. So this is the delta representation of the relativistic Boltzmann kernel with an arbitrary function g, and then you can simplify it down to this. And you can simplify it down to this kind of representation. This is the Carl Lorenz representation. GS sufficient decay, and E is a two-dimensional hypersurface, and it's represented by this Lorentz inner product, which I haven't told you what it is. I hope you don't mind. And so instead of, in the Newtonian case, this would be over a sphere, but in the relativistic cases, it's kind of hyperboloid. And you have this measure here. And you have this measure here, which is the hypersurface that you're integrating over. And you have this quantum g bar, which measures distance from P and P prime. This is the relativistic colour representation. And now I'll tell you our proof that the cancellation limit is false. So if you integrate over d sigma and d omega, and you have the relativistic kernel, and you use JFQ minus JFQ. use Jfq minus JFQ prime and the relativistic Maxwellian you recall is e to the minus P0 over 4π. So this is a very smooth function. It's a Schwartz function. It has rapid decay. Then you can using the relativistic Karlov representation decompose it into these two terms zeta 1b and zeta 2b and if you merely assume sigma equals a constant then it's very easy to see that zeta 1b is finite. Zeta 1b is finite and zeta 2b is infinite, and you therefore conclude that the cancellation lemma for the multi-stakeholder equation is false, and the statement is independent of the coordinates q and q prime that you use, and so you can't use this. And to me, that was very depressing, but it's a fact. So you use mathematics, you can't argue it. Okay. Okay, so anyway, we can move on and we consider the time evolution of perturbation. So f is equal to j plus square root of j, lowercase f, and then lowercase f evolves according to the relativistic Polesman equation dtf plus p or p0 without the gradient of f plus the linear operator, nonlinear operator. And the nonlinear operator is a function of q, as I wrote here. And the linear operator then can be written as a function of the nonlinear operator. Can be written as a function of the non-linear operator. And going through this quickly. And then this is our sort of global opposedness nearby equilibrium with our angular cutoff theorem. So if you have at least two derivatives in the spatial variable and we do the angular singularities between 0 and 1, then if your initial data is in Hn and T3, cross R3, Cross R3, and for any fixed polynomial L satisfies conservation laws, then there's an eta small enough such that if your initial data is small and there exists a unique global solution to the delta-sing plus one equation, that satisfies, that's in the glut spaces. And this solution has plus time decay to zero, which means the solution converges to equilibrium. And an open question that we didn't answer in this work. Answer in this work because it was already super long and we hadn't worked it out completely yet. Was the non-negativity of the solution? So that's an important question, so we want to finish that also, not to know whether or not the solution is not negative. So that's sort of the topic of my talk. And so here's our result for the non-negativity. So fix an integer n greater than good 2, let f be Incode 2, let f be j plus square root of j with the solution to the Boltzmann equation of the Non-Coffee cutoff hypothesis with initial condition in the same good space Hn L2 that is sufficiently small. Oh, this is a slightly less regular space, but that's okay. And such a solution exists locally in time by the theorem, rather than the second theorem. Suppose that initially F0 equals J plus square root of J. Lowercase F0 is now negative. zero is non-negative on a torus, then the solution is non-negative over the time that people exist. And so we have a local Maposinus theorem. For any sufficient small m greater than zero, there exists a time m0, t of m t zero of m0 greater than zero such that for m1 greater than zero, if the initial data is less than m1, then there exists a unique solution to the relative Boltzmann equation such that the energy norm is beneficial. Uh such that the energy norm is bounded by zero, where this is the energy norm. Um and I haven't told you what the uh dissipation norm is, but it's basically like an standard isotropic uh fractional diffusion mark with a polynomial weight. Well, if anyone has any questions, just to stop and ask. I said, Hey, is that the maximal time? So the time where you The maximal time? So, the time where it remains non-negative is the same as the lower time. Oh, okay. So, you can so for there's a local existence theorem and then there's a then the solution up here is non-negative on any invent any interval in which the solution you have an existence like this. So we don't have to truncate the time resistance anymore than in the local. Anymore than in the local local test theorem. And we can also extend this globally if the solution, so if we have this previous, so this local solution can be continued forever under the assumptions of the global existence theorem. So we have the non-negativity globally in time for the solutions. Globally, in time for the solutions to the global existence here. Would it be fair to say that in any situation where a solution exists, you can guarantee it's positive? Or is that more than what you're saying? In any situation where you have local well-posedness in this sense, in the sense of the theorem below, then you have non-negativity as long as that solution exists. Okay. Do you need sufficiently small also, or do you need sufficient? Do you need sufficiently small also, or do you need sufficiently small? We need sufficiently small for the local what was. We don't uh um I don't believe we use sufficiently small for the non-negativity. Is that right? Do you agree with me? For the proof of non-negativity, we don't need the smallness, but in order to say that the solution actually seems like we Yeah, that's what I thought, too. Yeah, so we don't use this. It says it's sufficiently small up here, but I could simplify this to say under the conditions in which this theorem holds, so as long as we only use the existence part to prove the non-exact, we don't use additional small. Yes? What's the difference between the local wall portals and the global wall portals you had before? I am a little confused, like what makes you look for local solutions. This is a different space. This is a weaker space. Okay, okay. So this is Hn X and L2 in the momentum variable P. And previously we were talking about um Hn in X and P. Okay, okay, so yeah. So maybe I don't know if you'll have this. So maybe we'll show purpose. So you don't have global poses? Yes? We don't have yeah we don't have global poses in this space. We use the some assumptions and some Sobo of type embeddings in the other in the proof of global well posters that we uh required us to use HN in both P and X. Do you have the smallness? Do you have the smoothing or the smoothingness? Okay, so that's one of those issues. No, so we have this small smoothing effect, but that's one of those issues that is a lot less trivial than it seems. And the reason so the reason is I have to go back. Well I have to go back, but the reason is uh this um these things here. So um in the so as far as I know this 2012 paper with Yang Guo and myself is the only paper on the relativistic Boltzmann equation that studies the relativistic collision. Relativistic collision kernel with momentum regularity. And the reason for that is that when you take momentum derivatives of these expressions or the other variables that are widely used that I haven't showed you, then you have problems that come up. You can see if you take a p derivative of p prime or q prime and you apply the chain rule, you get The chain rule, you get terms showing up. And you can't just translate those away because you have this as zeta and you have this g here that are nonlinear. And so in these variables, you can do a Galilean change of coordinates and take as many v derivatives. And take as many v derivatives as you want of the collision operator and put all the derivatives on f and g, and nothing comes out when the chain rule doesn't give you anything. But in these variables, if you take derivatives of p, the chain rule gives you um very ugly expressions that are also um can have singularities in them because you have this uh univector here. Have this unit vector here. And so you need to overcome that difficulty in order to prove smoothing effects. And the only paper that has done anything in that direction that I'm aware of is this paper, because we required momentum derivatives to study this system because of the Maxwell term when you have a term when you have a Lorenz force dot p term that you know about. And so we needed Peter's to study that. And so that would give you a big headache if you wanted to prove smoothing effects and is one of those difficulties that is something that you don't expect and something that might not be a Might not be something you normally consider to be a PB difficulty that you would have to overcome in order to prove the smoother events. It would be an sort of algebraic change of variable type difficulty. Yes. The cancellation lemma fails, but do you expect that some kind of entropy dissipation-like phenomenon could occur? Do you know anything positive or negative about that? Yeah, so there is a positive quantity and. And there is a way to study the cancellation using the relativistic Karloman representation. And without that, we wouldn't have been able to write any of these papers. But the cancellation limit itself fails. And so the quick way to understand that is that the The cancellation lemma is a statement in the v and sigma integral only. And this is a change of variable that's true if you don't also integrate against v star. And in the relativistic case, we can do something like a change of variable. like a change of variable that's different that understands the that measures the cancellation but you have to also integrate over v star otherwise the change of the change variable that we use is not quantified so so no we don't have um yeah and i was just um talking with some Talking with some collaborators who wanted to work on the relativistic pulse migration, and they wanted to use momentum regularity to solve a problem. And I gave them a strategy to do that. And they said, um okay, I tried it, but uh this step that you told me to do doesn't um Told me to do doesn't, um give me some extremely complicated thing and I don't know how to deal with it. And I said, Yeah, it does give you an extremely complicated thing, and I don't know how to deal with it. But I believe it's uh a good strategy. And this and I said, Okay, well, let's uh try an easier problem for you. Um so yeah, so I don't see mouse. Uh-huh. For the proofs of both non-negativity and liquid oppositiveness, we consider the solution to the Boltzmann equation as a limit of approximate solutions. And we use this approximation, dtf1 plus 1 plus pf1. dt fm plus 1 plus p hat gradient fm plus 1 is equal to q fn fn plus 1. And we start the iteration at the relativistic Maxwellian and we take the initial data to be the standard initial data we choose as non-negative. And the construction of the sequence of approximate solutions is slightly different from what we did before. And so we need a proof of local existence again. And I said this already, but I want to emphasize. I said this already, but I want to emphasize that a lot of computations that are trivial in the Newtonian case become very serious, challenging algebraic and conceptual difficulties as well. And okay, so for the proof of non-negativity, we fix any lambda and we take a sufficiently average kappa such that lambda over kappa is greater than t, where t is the time and distance, and we define n for n greater than 0, hn, is j kappa 10 minus 1. J kappa to the minus 1, it's just like 1 over j kappa times fn, and j kappa is e to the minus lambda minus kappa t, p0, and this is some kind of a delayed leap. And then we get a sequence of approximate solutions, Hn that satisfies this equation. And this equation is nice because it introduces a damping term that depends on kappa, and so And so it's kappa p0 h n plus 1, and then you have the same equation. You do have these growing exponential weights everywhere, but that's okay. And then gamma kappa is this quantity that depends on time. As you see here, j kappa is minus 1, q, j kappa f, and j kappa h. And I want to point out that we use the maximum principle approach to prove the non-negativity that it was. That was in this AMUXY paper from 2010, Alexander Monomo and Yakart. And I'll tell you about that. So when time did I start? So we'll start later. Okay, good. And we consider the convex function beta of s is one half s minus squared, where s minus is the minimum of s is zero, and this is also. zero and this is also equivalently one half s times s minus and our goal will be to prove that beta of hn plus one minus equals zero under the following induction hypothesis so we suppose there exists a lambda such that for all n we have the supremum over n of either lambda p0 or fn is less than constant m where m is independent of n in our space l v and l two and we also suppose that fn And we also suppose that fn is greater or equal to 0. So we'll do induction and we'll suppose fn is greater than 0. And then we'll prove that fn plus 1 is greater than 0. And we obtain, we use an algebraic weight in x, phi, and you take the derivatives, and you get that the time derivative of beta hn plus 1 times phi to the minus 2 integrated is beta hn plus 1. H1 plus 1, 5 minus 2, and then you have the gamma k term times h n plus 1 minus 5 minus 2, upper bound. And you also have these other terms. So dx dpq, the kernel j sub kappa, hn plus 1 minus phi minus 2 times h n prime, hn plus 1 p prime, h n plus 1 p plus the beta a times. p plus f beta a ten plus 0.5. And then we write the upper bound as a1 plus a2 plus the last term there. And then, so now you'll see these non-negative terms that I mentioned to you here, non-positive, but if you put them on the other side, it would be non-negative. So A1 is B1 plus B2. We do this decomposition. And B1 is And V1 is you write Hn plus 1 Phi and Hn plus 1P prime minus Hn plus 1P, and we'll use this to form our non-negative term. And then for V2, we subtract JKQ prime and JKQ, and then you get what's left over, which is Hn plus 1, P, Hn plus 1, P prime. And then so for P1, we can split it into three terms in this way. Three terms in this way, we sort of add and subtract some stuff, and then we get minus one-half after we do a change of variables. All this stuff up here times hm plus 1 phi p prime minus h n plus 1 p squared. And so this gives you the non-positive term. And then you have this 1 minus that thing. And you have hn plus 1 phi squared, and you have hnq up there. Quick there. And so this term has cancellation in it that AIDS U, and then the last term also has cancellation in it. And it also has these Hn plus 1 terms in it, Hn plus 1P and Hn plus 1P prime. And so, and we split into V1A, V1E, and V1C. And V1A is non-positive. This is the fractional diffusion term. And this kernel is always pointwise non-negative. always pointwise non-negative. And then therefore B1B, the second term, is non-positive because hn plus 1 squared is non-negative and hn is by assumption non-negative. So the second term is non-negative and then it remains to study the third term. And so our goal is to prove the following inequalities. So everything up here is proven except for the Everything up here is proven except for the A2. And then we want to prove this kind of an estimate for B1C. And then we want this estimate for B2, that B2 is less than these norms. And then these are sort of momentum weighted norms. Or any small epsilon. Okay. And then once we get those estimates, oops, forgive the misspelling. Forgive the misspelling. Then the previous inequalities lead us to obtain that the time derivative of the integral of beta hn plus 1 plus kappa over 2 p0 beta hn plus 1 phi is less than or equal to the constant beta h n plus 1 phi to the minus 2. And so we had to use a little bit of kappa here to control some stuff on the right hand side using some interpolation. And then this constant gets larger, but that's okay. It gets larger, but that's okay. It depends on some delta that's small, which makes the constant large. And then by the Grammar inequality, you sort of throw away the middle term, and we get that the integral of beta hm plus 1 times phi minus 2 is less than or equal to 0, since beta hm plus 1, 0 is 0. And thus, beta hn plus 1 is 0, which implies that hm plus 1 is non-negative, which is what we're going to do. Negative, which is what we wanted to prove. So that's the outline of the proof. Okay, yeah. And key approaches to prove this are to derive the Kalam and dual representation for V1. And I told you about that earlier. And you obtain the following equivalent central momentum representation. And you get some big, ugly thing like this, with this phi quantity in here that has cancellation. Quantity in here that has cancellation in it, and then you have this quantity here which has cancellation. And you sum this representation with the original representation. And then we use dyadic decomposition of the region near the angular singularity. G bar is approximately zero, or both b1 and b2. V1 and V2. And then we prove a lemma like this that says that for the sequence of approximating solutions, we have a uniform bound that's independent of n and then we can take a limit in a strong enough space as long as we have a strong point-wise limit, which we do because of uniform boundary compactness. So Do I stop here or I got the bell so I don't know? I think still showing time. Okay. Okay, let me okay, I guess I'll stop. Okay, I guess I'll stop. Thank you. Thank you so much for the wonderful talk. I have a question about the global openness. You said when you come to overcome this, you did not have a normal exchange. So we don't have any idea like when you are constructing across many switches, you can Yeah, because it's always in L2 base space so you always have the so okay, so that's a good question and so oh I want the previous slide. So I didn't mention it, but when you is it even on the slides? Oh, yeah. On the slides. Oh. Yeah, it's right here. Okay, so I didn't mention it, but we always, in all the papers, we work at the level of, for the existence, local or global, we work at the level of lowercase little f. And lowercase little f is never non-negative, no matter what. And so we always need coercivity without non-negativity, without using non-negativity. Using non-negative figures. And the way you get that is you have an estimate like this. And this is an L2-based fractional diffusion space. This is differentiation of order rho and momentum weight of order rho plus gamma over 2. And then this is just a standard fractional diffusion space. And so you have coercivity in an L2 based sense for any function, whether it's For any constraint, whether it's non-negative or not. Thank you. Yes. I have a very basic question concerning the actual equation. In fact, I have two questions. So can one really say that the relativistic Boltzmann is a generalization of the Newtonian Boltzmann in the sense that when you make simplifying assumptions, you have the Newtonian Boltzmann? Yes, so I did that. So I did that. So in this paper, I took a global Newtonian limit as c goes to infinity from the relativistic Boltzmann equation to the Newtonian Boltzmann equation. And you can, so I did near vacuum, but you can do the limit holds as long as you have a solution, you can do it. Anytime. Okay, I understand. And the second question I have is: in the relativistic Holtzman, can one see, I mean, I have a hard time understanding the collision term, but can I see that the fast-moving particles are treated like specially so that I mean I guess that's where the name comes from, right? That the fast-moving particles are treated very differently from how they are treated in the Newtonian polymer. Yeah, I mean, Yeah, I mean I hardly see anything uh in the query terminal but can you cannot see it there? Yes, so um you see it here basically so um and you see it I don't know what I wrote it, but okay, so you have the energy and momentum conservation laws So these are the energy, the standard energy and momentum conservation laws in the relativistic case. And they are both linear. Well, they're both first order. The energy conservation law is not linear, but it's first order. And in the And in the Newtonian case, it's the energy conservation law second. And this set shows you that the collisions occur instead of on a sphere, they occur on an ellipse that has eccentricity depending on the values of P and Q. And so things can get very wild in terms of how the particles collide. Particles collide, and you see that sort of in the cancellation that comes up. And even though this becomes standard fractional diffusion operator, which is not true in the Newtonian case, then the collisions themselves become a lot more complicated. So you see the post-collisional momentum are Are cause a lot of problems, and I think that's where you're seeing the relativistic effects. Thank you for the question. Yes? Is there something like entropy or renormalized solutions for the equation? There is entropy. There is a entropy. And you use the entropy minimization to obtain the To obtain the equilibrium. And there are causality. And I definitely should have mentioned it. But Dudinsky and Yikilajrinska in 91 proved the global existence of renormalized solutions for the relativistic Olton equation with, I believe it was with the kernel sigma equals one. And so there are And so there are re-normalized, and they used causality to prove that, which I didn't don't think you have or needed to use in the case. So yeah, there are renormalized solutions, but they were constructed in 91, two years after they did Bernal Leon's paper, and not much on them after that, in the relativistic case. Of course in the Newtonian case, like so many papers, but I didn't So many papers, right? Because in this case, there's like two papers. And what about weak coupling limit? Is there a special relativity analog of that? Something like a Landau equation that you can derive from? Yes, there is a Landau equation and I wrote a paper about that with Maya and it's not It's not in the physics literature derived as a sort of recoupling limit. You probably can do that, but there's no work on it that I'm aware of. But it's derived in a different way. And it's derived sort of from physical principles, even though it's weird, because Landau kind of derived the kind of derive the Landau equation from the Boltzmann equation by doing a Taylor expansion of the kernel and taking the pole and just sort of setting the Coulomb logarithm to one. Then in the relativistic case, the derivation is not done that way. It was sort of derived independently of the relative visibles. Relativistic Boltzmann equation. So the relativistic Landau equation was derived in Russia sort of after the Landau equation, and I don't think people in the West were so aware of that research for a long time. The relativism of Boltzmann equation, if I'm not mistaken, was derived in the West maybe after the Lando equation was derived. But it would be interesting to study some kind of recap in the break now, right?
