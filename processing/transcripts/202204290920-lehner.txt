       I think as species, the linear stability and stability are the same. We have to remember that it's not necessarily the case that the linearized problem solution is the same as a linearized solution to the food problem. So an example would be as you stir the coffee in your cup. It's obviously not unstable, but it can really be linearly unstable in that the full non-linearities. Non-linearities induce potential turbulence for long wavelengths in your cup. And that would not be captured with a linear analysis unless you know enough of the system to build the linear perturbation schema in the right way. Okay, so let me go back to this question as to whether the aftermath of a binary block hole collision can be just described. Collision can be just described by first-order linear mode. And we know already from kind of 20 years ago that that's not necessarily the case. A long time ago, people working in the closed limit approximation coming or joining forces between people doing numerical activity with those doing perturbative analysis. And this goes back to work by Pullin, Glaser, Nicasio, and Price, together with science. Together with Seidel and collaborators, show that in the head-on collision of black holes, of course, here there is an arbitrary parameter which is the initial kinetic energy of these objects as they are shot against each other. The opposite, the black holes against would merge, and you study or they studied what the aftermath description of the gravitational waves was and what you could see or what they could see in this, that if you did a linear perturbation. Linear perturbations, or beyond linear perturbations, including first and second order results for the gravitational waves, you got a much better fit to the full numeric. And you can barely see this thin line, but there is obvious a mismatch between the first order and the full numeric. And the first plus second order was a lot closer. Another work that was led by Joseph Slotschauer and people working with Jeff Winniker and other. With Jeff Winnicore and others at Pitt a long time ago, was also part of that work was to ask in the scattering problem. You just sent the pulse of gravitational wave and asked the question, to what extent the gravitational waves that are kind of scattered off that curvature are linear as you increase the size of the gravitational perturbation when they get go. And the outcome or the bottom line of these works was that for sufficiently strong amplitudes of perturbation, Sufficiently strong amplitudes of perturbations, the gravitational waves cease to behave linearly. You had not only a departure in amplitude, you also have the departure in the mode content of the solution, just simply because the source square and terms that contain derivatives and non-linearities led to the population of further modes, even though your initial perturbation was a clean mode given by some. Mode given by same given quadrupolar perturbation. So, very more recently, and of course, motivated strongly by gravitational wave observations, people have retaken this work. So, Elena Giorgi at Princeton, together with collaborators Franz Pertorius, Nick Lutrell and company, have been looking at the second-order perturbation calculations of, say, a black hole, a curve black hole. Say a black hole, a curved black hole that is perturbed. And what this is pretty much very clean message that non-linear interactions of the source given by the first mode that is now finds its way to the second order perturbation on a source that comes square begins to populate or excite other modes. For instance, the m equals zero and m equals four mode, having introduced a perturbation that was L2. Having introduced a perturbation that was L2M2, further modes show up, and the relative strength is small, but it's definitely non-zero, it's there. Of course, the caveat is that this is a standalone analysis. They have an initial black hole, an initial pulse, sorry, a black hole is there, an initial pull is sent, and then the question that is asked is to what degree seeds for second modes can feed off that energy and grow. This is not. This is not the outcome of a merger of quasi-circular merger that seeds its perturbations. Nevertheless, the basic mechanisms are robust. You have a wave that has its energy, its energy in a perturbative schema, finds its wave sourcing further higher order perturbations, and those will play a role. Another piece of evidence. Piece of evidence. Go ahead. Is there a question? Can you hear me? Verily. Can you try again, Badry? Yes, if you go back to the slide. Sure. Now I can hear you better. So I think anybody would agree that the mechanism is the box, so I'm not sure if nobody can doubt that the way it's presented here. But isn't the question really of the quantitative thing, which is the technical? Quantitative things you tend to provide a stoop. So if I would say that is small enough, then that's fine. We can forget about it. I will try and make up what I think your question was, Padre, because I got, I think, 50% of it. You're saying everyone will agree that the mechanism is robust, but the question would be how big it is and where it can make an impact. Is that your question? Yes. Sure, absolutely. Here for the Here, for this case, I mean, if you look at their work, they're putting a very small seed and there is a like 1% effect. The question, so at some point, we would like to do or we were going to have much more sensitive detectors. And we would, it would be very important to know in full what to expect. Uh, just to make it to the stakes are very high. Very high. Someone is going to try and conclude: we have evidence of beyond generative departures if you haven't put all the physics, if you don't have control over all the physics. So that's one thing. So in the future, we're going to have to be very, very careful with this. In the current, so it might be very small. And this is something I'll get to towards the end, just maybe as a potential way. But two objects are coming together. I mean, were in some sense perturbing the final black hole. Sense perturbing the final black hole in order one, we have a very, very distorted object. So I think there would turn it into if it is true that this effect is so, so small, we need to have very good reasons to support that. Because from the get-go, it's very surprising. But maybe I'll make a connection with that in the end. And I think some of the reasons would probably be very natural for this, but I'll get. 40s, but I'll try and get that. That's another even crazier thought that I will bring in in just a few minutes. Is that good? Yes, thanks. Okay. So another one is what we can ask, what is this mode doing? We have, we're colliding black holes, we're generating lots of gravitational waves. What are they doing? What is their potential impact? And so the potential impact, so a long time ago, we're starting, well, a decade ago, we're starting with Alex Wookel, Rob Myers. Time with Alex Mookel, Rob Myers, and Fanny Kirker, a student at that time. What would be the effect of this? This was asymptotically anti-decider. And the reason we went there because there are ADS-CFT applications, but it also gave us a way to control everything, control the full space-time. We had the boundary of anti-deceder, we could feed in some perturbation, which was a trigger mode, and we could ask the question. And we could ask the question: if we make this perturbation arbitrarily sharp or arbitrarily slow, whether there was a universal behavior in the system. And of course, the answer is very rich in between, but in the extremes, it's very simple. In the very, very, in the arbitrarily low perturbation, this black hole grows with the energy that is accreting, and a pure mode stays pure all the way through. So the black hole, I mean, just So, the black hole, I mean, just as we would have expected from adiabatic considerations, continuously adjusts to this perturbation in a very, very gradual and consistent manner that make the dynamics be in lockstep with the mode content of that perturbation. At the very other end, for arbitrary fast, we found that there was a universal response of the system. But the question is, where are we? But the question is: where are we? We're definitely not in that arbitrarily fast. These objects are merging with some given time scale associated to them. The gravitational waves have some given wavelength. But are we in the adiabatic regime? Can we assume that the black hole adjusts itself in so much as to say if we have a dominant L2M2 mode, we're going to just stay in the L2M2 mode, there wouldn't be further modes generated. And so this is something we. And so, this is something we retook with Laura Bernard, Pablo Bosch, Stephen Green, and We List. And we just asked what would be the role of any propagation, any occitation that part of it is accreted. And there is a long paper that I can give you the reference so we can discuss more. But first, we started this again in anti-deceder, but then we use the robust conclusions that we got there to make generic statements because the effect. Generic statements because the effect is completely obvious. So, initially, suppose you have a black hole that has some mass and some spin, and you ask the question, what happens if I put a pure mode there? Some of the energy of that mode, of that pure mode, falls into the black hole, changes the mass and spin of the black hole ever so slightly. Now, this mode is no longer pure. It's a collection of infinite modes in that new space-time. And this keeps happening as. And this keeps happening as long as the energy of this black hole is still doing something interesting, still changing things. And if you ask how long does it take in the banning the black hole collisions, well, it takes a sufficiently long, but not too crazily long, time that you can tell that you're neither in the universal regime for arbitrary fast, nor in the idiopathic regime. And as a result, you begin to populate. And as a result, you begin to populate other modes. And this is a secular effect because it keeps happening as long as the mass of a black hole and the speed of the black hole keep changing. So you can do just a mode excitation calculation and you're going to find out that even though the effect will scale like the cube of your perturbation, it gets integrated out for a sufficiently long time that could be sufficiently relevant to be comparable to the second-order effects that we just discussed. That we just discussed. But in the ADS case, Louis, you're putting the boundary condition on the sky. And so radiation which is going out is coming back and coming back and so on. So that doesn't happen in the symptotically flat case, right? So did you take that into account? Yeah, good point. Thanks, Arbei. Absolutely. Yeah, so the radiation that goes out comes back, but that comes at much later, much later time. So unfortunately, So, unfortunately, this plot here at the bottom got cut. But if you ask what is the time scale of the pulse that you put in initially that is sufficiently, its energy is sufficiently close to the black hole, it's during the time that that pulse falls in that you have this effect there. Of course, then later on you have more, but already that kind of repopulation or the redistribution of your pure mode into many modes already happened. Remotes already happen. Okay, thank you. Yeah, thanks for that. So, again, the caveat this for convenience was in EDS, but the mechanism is clear, it's sufficiently robust, and then we could use this analysis using computations of excitation coefficients to predict what would be the case in asymptotic flat space. And that bottom picture is a prediction of what it would happen in the asymptotic flat space, in the asymptotic flat regime. In the asymptotic phylogeny. The last one, which is in some sense the most controversial because of what's coming, but in other sense the most natural because of the type of computation, I don't think we can argue about this, is the following. Well, so far, every time we have a perturbation, we assume it's a source that, and then we work really hard to recast that so that at the end of the day, every calculation is kind of a time-independent background given by Kerr. Given by Kerr with a source that gets augmented as higher and higher orders take place as a source. But another way of thinking, and this is how I was, why I was saying at the beginning that one can rethink of the perturbation in a different way, and this is what we're going to do. So imagine you have, again, a pulse in a given space-time. Take it as being curved, if you want. Now ask, what is that pulse doing? What is that pulse doing? Well, that pulse is a dynamical addition to the space-time. It will change the metric ever so slightly, but it will change it and will endow it, endow the resulting metric with a time dependence. So take that seriously. So think of the way a mode will behave. Given a given perturbation, it will be the wave operator. Imagine I'm going to just Wave operator. Imagine I'm going to ask for a test field on that. But now, this is a test field that is a higher order of propagation in a space-time that is given by the background that was curved plus the effect of my initial mode that is time-dependent. So, this is what this operator here is trying to kind of illustrate. So, then you can assume that that's going to be small, but its effects is going to show up in the operator in the Show up in the operator in the derivative operator that is going to be governing the behavior of this test field that you put in. And then you can go through and realize that depending on the characteristics or the structure of these test modes and what, if you want, their natural frequency of oscillation would be in the absence of the initial mode that perturbs or in the time-independent curve background. Time-independent care background. There is now because you have a time-dependent operator associated to the principal part of the system, you're going to have a parametric instability that will feed energy or take it off your main mode and give it into this new mode, into some specific modes of propagation. These modes will grow for a very short time, depending on what your main mode. Well, your main mode, exponentially fast, they will grow exponentially due to taking energy away from the main mode. And of course, after a while, they begin to decay. But these modes are new modes. They fed off of your initial perturbation and they grow. And if you go through the math and what the conditions are for this parametric instability, it gives you some condition here that says, well, depending on the initial amplitude, this is the initial amplitude of perturbed remote. Initial amplitude of perturbing modes and the decay rate of those modes and the natural frequency of oscillation of your main mode and your kind of new mode, your test mode. If something is larger than zero, then it's going to grow. But if you then use your, I mean, a theory that you know maybe a little bit more with respect to non-linear behavior, and you can identify the amplitude of perturbation, say, as a velocity. Of your perturbation, say as a velocity, your decay rate, as a viscosity, etc. Once you change those and put the most natural quantities that you can draw from aerodynamics, this condition that you derive is nothing but the Reynolds number from fluids. So our statement is the gravity itself can have a phenomenon very much akin to turbulence, and it will have this non-linear interaction. And it will have these nonlinear interactions that take energy away from some mode and put it in some very specific mode. Of course, we're talking about decaying turbulence because you're not continuously exciting the system, but this is another non-linear effect, truly non-linear effect that will move energy from one end to the other one and will make things much more interesting. So, from my point of view, there are compelling indications that general activity in the early ring down is not linearly stable. There are many Table. There are many identified mechanisms for further modes to be either created or induced to grow through different mechanisms. The relevant time scales of the main mode we're thinking, this main mode that gets generated by the two black holes that are coming together in their last orbit before they merge, is sufficiently long with respect to the growth or the Growth or the approach to equilibrium of, well, sorry, sufficiently short, respect to the approach to equilibrium of the final black hole, that one cannot presume that quadria adiabatic statements will help. In fact, this calculation of mode excitation through accretion shows that. And so I think there is, while I have absolutely no qualms, things No qualms thinking that I can put as many overtones as I need to have my feet be the best possible. My worry is about interpretation. So I don't want to be enamored or so taken back by this ability to fit quite well the system to go on to the next step to say this implies. Onto the next step to say this implies the system is behaving very linearly. I think that's a toll order, which has tremendous implications, that puts a very high bar for everyone trying to have a strong claim to that effect to argue why none of these mechanisms that I described are at play in any significant way. So, the questions on this that one can kind of think to stay awake at night, and some of these do keep me awake at night, is, well, first is, are we forcing a wage issue? And everything I just said makes absolutely, I mean, it's a mute point. And that are we just arguing for the sake of arguing? And I don't think so, because at the end of the day, there will be a very strong consequence to having to be convinced that one is actually seeing the true overture. Seen the true overtones of the space-time, and the space-time is truly behaving as if it were a linear perturbation to a curved black hole. I think this wedge issue is probably coming from a very strong desire to have a very clean prescription, relying on the analysis regime and obscuring things along the way. And this goes back to the statement of Ulam. I think we keep thinking linearly because we have been trained. We have many, many years or decades of training. Years or decades of training in the linear box, maybe we should go back to the non-linear box and try and learn more on that corner before we come back. After all, we also know many solutions. Well, we know the quasi-modes are in basis first, and we also know solutions that are not well described. They're not described at all, like quasi-normal modes. We have Roman-Stroman solution, we have work with solutions, we have tails, etc. Tails, etc. So that alone should be enough cost for pausing. I would be, and this goes back to Battery's question: it may be, who knows, that for the right special initial conditions, perhaps like those that are set by quasi-circular mergers, one is more in tune for a cleaner quasi-normal mode description. After all, we showed at the very beginning of the talk this old result by Glazer and All results by Glazer and collaborators, where they were hitting that was a head-on collision, where you actually saw a very clearly discernible difference between just using first-order perturbations or first plus second-order perturbations. That was not a quasi-circular encounter. So who knows? I think this is this there is potential issues to explore in a sharper manner there. Of course, at the end, can we? Can we could we ever hope to sharply establish when a linear analysis makes sense with respect to interpretation, i.e., beyond fitting? There is certainly much writing on it. And I think this it begs at the end of the day, it will require a very sharp statement or very sharp conditions to be satisfied before that can be said. Another thing that I also keeps me worried at night is that, well, are they Where a dial is says, well, are we just asking, in some sense, too much from these quasterial modes? And this is where it goes back to this spectral instability. We have seen that very tiny deformations have a very strong impact. Of course, maybe the fundamental mode is fine, but all the others get shoved around. And the other thing that worries me is: well, is this something that we have to worry on the numerical authority front? Worry on the numerical attribute front, and actually, I was chatting with a student of Post Oko Fabi Abbey about a month ago in New York about this. I mean, after all, we are testing where many of the tools we have is to work with pagan models. We have to remember that we're using numerical simulations, and a numerical simulation never has the right potential, has an approximation to the potential. So, that also, I'm not sure I'm that worried about it, but it's nagging in the back of my head to not have. To not have the answer is, no, no, we are fine. And I'm not sure we have today a very sharp statement as to that statement. So anyway, so I think I'm going to stop here. I hope, I mean, Jose will tell me if I was sufficiently provocative. Of course, some of the things I said, maybe I said it with a bit too strong a statement, but I'm happy. I'm okay to do this. I think the stakes are sufficiently high that those of ours. Those of us that are not convinced that the most that we have the right to just think that there is a linear behavior afterwards should keep loud until that issue is settled. Thank you. Right. So thank you very much, Luis, for this talk. So for this additionally provocative talk, Jose. Any questions from the audience? Maybe you were not provocative enough. I would like to sort of just say a couple of things if possible, if people don't have any questions. So I'm on the same wavelength as you are, but as you also said then, right, this initial data are something special. And so, of course, in full non-linear general relativity. Of course, in full non-linear general relativity, many, many things can happen, or even in this, as you said, just linearized waves on a time-dependent background, many things can happen that are not taken into account. But I mean, perhaps there is something special about this initial data. And that, I think, is kind of the, to me, that is a real question up here. However, I mean, there are two things. The first point I want to make is that, I mean, if in fact one had some insight about the amplitude. Some insight about the amplitudes that we need for the causal normal modes in order to get the fit to the exact waveform. In other words, amplitudes as a function of the progenitor parameters. Then I think it would become much more serious. Until then, with seven parameters, it doesn't seem to be too serious. And I mean, I grew up in Chicago as a graduate student, and we had this statement of Fermi, namely, you give me. Me, namely, you give me no parameter, I will get you a spherical elephant. You give me three parameters, I will make its elephant with its right shape, and you give me seven parameters, then I can make it stay bigger. So, I think that there is a little bit of that. I mean, I'm being a little bit too strong here, but there is a little bit of that. So, if we are understanding of the coefficients of those amplitudes, my view with these fittings will change. It doesn't mean that there is nothing natural happening. It doesn't mean that there is nothing non-trivial happening, but not so much non-trivial is happening. Would you agree with that? Yeah, I agree. I mean, if we have a very sharp statement, this is part of what I was saying, we need sharp statements. And so any sharp statements that we can have, I mean, or sharp things to hunt, then will allow us to then have a sharp answer. Until then, I think we're talking a lot. And then I worry that we're not going to be able to settle this. It will still be, oh, it seems to work. It will still be, oh, it seems to work and whatever. The other thing I'm very puzzled about, and this is something I discussed in the past, but I don't know how to, and this given the audience, how I'm taking the opportunity to maybe bring that back. And this could be an energy, but so in the past, I've been toying with the idea using this fluid-gravity correspondence, that there is a connection with some of the things we know from fluid dynamics. And in fluid dynamics, if we Fluid dynamics, if we were doing fluid dynamics in two plus one dimensions, there is another quantity that is quasi-conserved there that limits the amount of energy that can go to shorter wavelengths. It actually mainly goes to longer wavelengths. In that corner is something called entropy. What I wonder if there is something like that that we have yet to kind of dig out from the structure of generativity that may have an impact, that I don't know. Have an impact that I don't know, but the fluid gravity correspondent is sufficiently compelling, and we have it in very strong footing in the case of ADS. Of course, you're going to go back, and I do go back, saying, oh, but that's ADS. But from the PDE point of view, ADS only adds a little lambda GAB in the right-hand side of the equation. So it's not doing anything to the PDE. And there, the analogy or the strong link is 2 plus 1 hydrodynamics with 3 plus 1 gravity. With three plus one gravity. So it could be that some quantity is lurking. And I've been searching on and off. I don't have a bright idea, but I'm very curious as to that. So it may be that there is some structure yet to be unearthed from the theory. I just want to tell you that I'm going to try to provide a sharp criterion. So you will be excited. And I think that my belief is that that criterion will show that linear. Is that that criteria will show that linear regime is not valid yet? Okay, good. Thank you. Looking forward to it. Any other questions? So, thanks, Britain, for being sufficiently provocative. Thanks a lot. So, I would like to ask you, please, your understanding of the current status of Their understanding of the current status of the closed limit approximation. Hold on, I got to the understanding of the current status of, and then I lost you. The closed limit approximation. With the insight of the knowledge today, I mean, you have commented that the second-level perturbations really improve the first perturbations, but you have I understood that you have commented on that as an evidence of the need of non-linear terms. So this is okay, but is there anything more with the things you have learned recently? These modes projecting on different modes because of the evolution of the magma. Does it provide any Any insight on the original closed limit approximation? Or is this for you something like an intermediate step that we can forget? Oh, great question. I think I have a very rambling type of answer to that. So, in some sense, so let me go back to the closed limit. The closed limit approximation kind of hit some walls as to how to go and include. To how to go and incorporate Kerinit and the second order, and people are retaking that. So, there was some amount of effort went in, and then some partial results came out, but then it kind of went dormant. And I think people are retaking it now. And this work by Elena, France, and collaborators aims to eventually go there. Then there is very puzzling and very interesting work of people in amplitudes, right? Where they're just doing scattering experiments and then using that to kind of. And then using that to kind of populate further and further information on the behavior of the system prior to merger, but you could imagine that percolating later on into some closed limit approximation. But you're asking more of our work. So our work, we haven't. So in our work, we're thinking, and there is a long term, there's a longer term plan. I think this is what you're going after. So our work basically says, look, the Work basically says, look, the background is going to be changing dynamically. Because it's changing dynamically, you have to work with it. And perhaps you could imagine retooling a closed limit approximation by now, there are many ways you could go about it. So one is people are using a quasi-normal mode description, let's say, with as many overtones. But you can imagine now using a two-time scale expansion where now the coefficients of each of those modes is a function. Those modes is a function of a slower parameter, which is a time scale for the growth of your black hole, not the time scale of your perturbations. Unfortunately, there is not a very clean separation of scales. They are in the same ballpark, but you could imagine that and then slowly, gradually change the amplitude of those modes. I can see something like that happening. At a very practical level, people are beginning to do that. So I heard or I saw some discussions. Or I saw some description by Alessandro Bonano, where they were actually monitoring the ratio of some of these coefficients with respect to the amount of energy that is falling and how, if you extract at different times, where these coefficients have some evolution and you can see that they are changing. So, going back to your question. Oh, I'll say one more thing. And the other thing, I will go back to my first observation. These modes are conveniently, this overtone. Are conveniently, these overtones, are conveniently such that their frequencies are all about the same. It's the time scales that are of the K that are different. So they are particularly nasty in that they allow you to do the job you want earlier on and to be essentially irrelevant later on. I think that's also saying, going back to where you're going, that so I made a distinction of perturbation schemes. One is to say I have always a fixed background and I just have Always a fixed background, and I just have higher and higher order perturbations that come from specific sources. The R end is to say I have a background that is slowly time-varying, and I have to live with the consequence of that. The fact that these modes are not so different in oscillations is telling you that somehow this other way of doing the traditional way of doing the perturbations is not so off because, well, the space-time is a bit rigid. Space-time is a bit rigid with respect to the oscillation, but it's not that rigid with respect to the decay rate. So there might be a way in between. I haven't thought along these lines, but I can see a research program in this direction, in one of these directions. Do I have a chance to make a short remark? You have to really get close to the microphone because otherwise we really don't hear anything. Do we have time to make a short comment? We have time to leave a short comment? I'm asking Juan. Go ahead, go ahead. Okay, thank you. So my comment is that this assessment about the being in a linear regime or not, as far as I understand, is very much based in a model analysis, a mode analysis. And mode analysis. So, you are, this is something that we have learned. Our intuitions come from self-adjoint problems, in which we have completeness and we can make the we can project modes and everything is very clean. So, the spectral theory there tells you that the spectrum controls everything. But my comment goes and is akin to this hydrodynamics perspective that you are bringing along. Along when people do hydrodynamics, and if the evolution is not, I mean, if it's precipitative, the physical generator is not self-adjoint, then it's not clear that a mode analysis is going to capture the linear regime. I'm not talking about the non-linear. Already in the linear regime, it's not clear that the spectrum The spectrum is going to capture anything but the late dynamics. So, the spectrum will still control the late dynamics, so the late rebound, but what people learn in hydrodynamics is that the initial, even if you have a completely linear system, but if this is dissipative, the early dynamics are not necessarily captured by the spectrum. And this is what people call the non-modal analysis. So, you really have to take into account the full ring function, the full resolvent. And this goes, this is another application of these several spectrum tools. So, the bottom line would be that I think it would be interesting in this discussion of linear or non-linear, to take into account that the very tool that we are using, this mode analysis, would not be adapted to our particular problem if the Our particular problem, if the dissipative effects to the horizon and gradient to infinity actually are playing a fundamental role. So we could have to incorporate also this kind of tools from hydrodynamics in which they employ this full resolvent analysis, so to speak. Which is a comment that somehow is consistent with your emphasis. Emphasis on the role of hydrodynamics, for example, of estrophy. Thank you, Jose. That's interesting. And I should learn more about what you just said. Any other comments or questions? Well, if not, then thanks, Luisa, again very much for your provocative talk. Provocative talk. And then, so I think we can move on to the next talk by Jose Luis and Badry. So if you can get ready.
