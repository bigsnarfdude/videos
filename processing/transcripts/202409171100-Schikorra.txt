All right. I skip over some slides for time reasons, but so my topology will be very, very simple. So just so we are on the same page, I kind of made some pictures. So I essentially will just talk about the degree. Okay. So just so we're on the same page. So take, that's the pointer. Assume you have, let it be one dimensional, difficult enough for me. One-dimensional difficult enough for me. Um, one sphere to the one sphere, a map. I draw it kind of outside of the one sphere so that we kind of see where it goes, right? The degree simply you go to one point and you count how many times this curve goes through this is Ada Lovelace, so through that person, and you count it with direction. So, plus one if it goes from left to right, say, and minus one if it goes from right to left. That's the degree. The degree in high dimensions, you do this with Jacobian, the sign of the Jacobian, kind of the same thing. And this is a topological invariant. Okay. And in this picture, you see plus one, plus one, plus one, minus one is two. So the degree here is two. Okay. That's a homotopy invariant. Any continuous change, you cannot change the degree, right? Unless you go through the origin and And that's where I want to minimize. So I want to talk about again maps. The domain will, sorry, the domain will be mostly the sphere. Let's say the sphere of dimension N. And the target, most of the time, will also be a sphere, but for now, let's pretend I can do anything general. So let it be a target M. Okay. And this, this, this bracket just says, let you say, wind around the target five times. This is the alpha. Target five times. This is the alpha, okay. And I want to minimize this energy. And now, um, well, this is uh pretty simple in a bunch of cases. So if the exponent here is larger than the domain dimension, so if p is larger than n, right, then we have subolev embedding, and so we have control of the continuous models of continuity. So minimizers just exist by minimizing direct method. Not so interesting, maybe. If, on the other hand, we have this exponent is strictly less than the dimension of the domain, so strictly less than n in this example, well, you can just rescale. It's kind of advantageous to go through the target space if you want to wind around five times in a very tiny domain, just by scaling. And so you can see that the minimal energy for such a thing is always zero. And that minimum is not attained, right? Because the energy equal to zero would be a constant map. To zero would be a constant map. So minimizers don't exist if p is less than n, unless you're in the trivial homotopy class. And they trivially exist if p is larger than n. So both of those cases are not really of what we want to look at. So kind of the cool case, the case where you have to work is the case p equals n. So where you're in BMO, but you're not continuous. Okay. And things get interesting because you have to take into account bubbling. Bubbling will appear. You can force it to appear. Can force it to appear, and it sometimes also appears without forcing it. So, just to illustrate the point, so assume we have a minimizer. We're looking for minimizers, but for a second, let's assume we have one. And now we take essentially a map from the sphere to the sphere that zooms or scales everything towards the North Pole. So, what we do is we take stereographic projection, we scale and we invert the stereographic projection. It's just moving everything, say, to the north. It's just moving everything, say, to the North Pole, right? And now the point is: if P equals N, this energy doesn't see that change at all, right? So you had the minimizer, and now we compose with some scaling towards the North Pole. And this new map, UK, still has exactly the same energy. And so now, if you do this like more and more, you scale more and more towards the North Pole, you see that in the weak limit, you converge to a constant. In the strong limit, of course, not. In the strong limit, of course, not right. And so you see that we have created something which is bubbling in the limit, and this is a minimizing sequence, right? So if we in this case p equals n, the conformal case, essentially you cannot use the direct method, just brute force, because you could have actually a minimizer just sillily, in a silly way, rescaled. Okay? So minimizers may or may not exist, but it's not just the direct method that gives you the minimizer. That gives you the minimizer. Okay? And so, to my knowledge, essentially, still the best thing that we have is the Sachs-Uhlenbeck theory. Okay, this is like the result from the 80s. And then, of course, this is the case W12 and then someoneic maps. And you can extend this in a bunch of directions. I mentioned a few, but certainly not everybody. And here's essentially the summary of what I would call the Sachs-Unbeck theory. We do not have necessarily many. We do not have necessarily minimizers in all homotopy classes, so all windings, but we know that the set of degrees where the minimizer exists must generate the whole homotopy group. So for example, it could be, I just write some numbers because I will refer to it later, it could be that minimizers exist at degree five and minus two, right? And if you add five and minus two and certain multiples together, you get the whole natural numbers. The whole natural numbers, and it could be that this is the only cases where minimizes exist because five minus two is a generator for the integers. Um, and so what the Sachs-Uhenbeck theory tells us is that the set where minimizes exist, right, the topology where minimizes exists, generates the whole topology. But that's the information we get. Okay, and moreover, we have an energy identity. If it happens that you are in a class, If it happens that you are in a class, so say you want to wind around seven times, and seven is neither five or minus two, so you may not have a minimizer. If that happens, what you can show is that the minimum energy must be the sum of minimum energies of other guys. And these other guys are these generators. Okay, essentially, all these, the only way that this can go wrong somehow, if you have no minimizers, is that these bubbles create the minimizing sequence. Minimizing sequence. That's somehow what this energy identity tells us. Okay, those are essentially more or less all we can say in this generality about minimizes of such functions. Okay. And this is not just like an analytical problem, right? That we cannot prove more, but you have explicit examples, right? So if this p equals 2, oh no, wait, this. P equals 2, oh no, wait, this p equals 2, right? Then you can compute things, you have conformal maps, and then you can really get counter examples of classes where minimizers do not exist. Okay, so this is kind of the best one can know. And now one could try to do the same thing, and one can try the same thing, exactly the same thing, replacing this Dirichlet energy W one p, well we had W one n here, right, with the fraction norm. Why not? Right with the fraction norm. Why not? Okay, now this norm will look like this: double integral as n as n. Now we have that we want the number of derivatives times the number of the exponent equals to n. So what we have down here is 2n. This is same embedding, right? This w1n if s equals 1. So you can do exactly the same theory for minimizers of this sort of energy, which happens to also be conformally invariant. Kind of in the same way. I'm not going to talk about this too much. So you have the same statement. You find a generating set where minimizers exist. Everywhere else, minimizers may not exist. We don't really know. And we have an energy identity. If a minimizer happens to not exist, say at degree three, right, you can, you know that there must be other homotopy groups where the minimizer is attained and the energies sum up. Sum up okay, so exactly the same picture. Okay, but now the point is that if we look at this energy, right, we have this exponent n over s, and that's the only s dependence. So we can wiggle the s. We have a continuum of energies. They're all conformally invariant. We can all, for each of them, we can do this sort of energy decomposition and try to find minimizers. So the question that I was curious about is how Was curious about is how do these sort of results well, how stable are there when we wiggle the S? Okay, so, right, what can we say if we wiggle the S? We have no continuum of energy, so maybe something is continuous or not continuous. We cannot really say so much, but we'll see. Um, so one of the questions, right, would be fix the topology, say degree five, assume that for Degree five. Assume that for a given s we know that the degree five minimizes the tain. Does this somehow propagate to the neighborhood? Is this an open condition? The answer is, I don't know. Simpler, right? It looks trivial, but it was quite complicated, at least the way we proved it. Is this dependency on S continuous just for the minimum energy? Right? This sounds trivial because this energy here is, of course, continuous in S. Here is, of course, continuous in S, right? But again, this is a minimizing essentially in the weak topology. So, at least to me, this is not super clear. And I will talk about the proof, how this dependency in S is continuous. Okay, this is where we can say a little bit. So again, it's just the minimum values of an energy in a topology class independency of S is that continuous. And of course, since we have always these generating sets, can we somehow make them stable? them stable right that when we wiggle the s we have the same set okay and so um well this is i hope it's correct more or less what we know okay so first if we are in two dimensions conformal maps are very rich so we have minimize exists for any degree essentially you take meromorphic maps they are related to the area and you kind of explicitly compute they minimize the area and so you get for every degree The area, and so you get for every degree there exists a minimizer from s2 to s2 from sn to sn when n is larger than 3. This is not true anymore because conformal maps are not so rich, right? We have few of them. Minimizers must be conformal, which is something you can show. And then essentially, you see that the only minimas that exist are degree one, minus one, and zero. Right? Okay. Now it gets more fun if you change like the dimensions of the two maps, right? Like the dimensions of the two maps, right? So, for example, if you go from S3 to S2, or this hop link, I guess you can do this for all S4 and minus ones to S, whatever. You can show, for example, that there are infinitely many homotopy classes where the minimizes is attained. Okay, you don't know where, but you know there are infinitely many. Or, well, this result, this is what we were going to use. If you're in this L2 regime, right, so this is W one half two, you have. W one half two, you have the Fourier transform, right? And that's very helpful. So you may be able to compute something explicitly. And indeed, from S1 to S1, minimize are attained for any degree, and we know exactly the energy. Yeah? Yes, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Right, right. Yeah, exactly. Right, right. So, the point is here that we have a power law and it's not linear, right? Yeah, it's sub-linear, yes. Yeah. So, what I want to illustrate with this slide is essentially there's a bunch of different situations, right? And it's not so, you cannot always assume all the degrees are attained or not. It really depends somehow on the energy. So, it's not so clear to me what really to expect. The only thing that we What, what really to expect. The only thing that we, I guess, would expect is degree one is always attained. But even that we cannot prove. But what we have is also something, right? So these are, okay, this is essentially that you estimate the Hoffman variant. These are explicit computations. There's also something a bit more wiggly. This is due to Mironesco and collaborators. You can kind of say that the degree one minimizer exists. The degree one minimizer exists close to one half, but only upwards. So at s equals one half, you can compute it. You have the Fourier transform because you have an L2 energy. And then you can use essentially the Sobolev embedding to show that you kind of show that minimas exist in this energy a little bit higher than s equals one half. That's, I think, kind of the optimum. So that would be a natural conjecture, in my opinion, right? Degree one always exists. I cannot see how this is wrong. Always exist. I cannot see how this is wrong, but I cannot prove anything. Okay. Okay. So essentially, at the end of the day, the main result that we have is if we look at maps between S and between two spheres, then this energy is continuous. And that implies some things. Okay? So again, it looks, you know, when we first started, I thought this is completely trivial, right? Is completely trivial, right? The dependency on S is here, right? But again, there's this infimum over like a class which is not that nicely metrizable. So one-sided continuity is trivial. So you have something like, you know, you take a smooth approximation and then you compare the minimizes from S to T. So you have like semi-continuity that's absolutely trivial, but the full continuity, I think, is not trivial. But the full continuity, I think, is not trivial. And we have issues with the embedding theorem. And the proof, I will not go too much into the technicalities, but it's a very annoying and very technical regularity theorem that for some reason, I mean, was the only way to get this continuity. But let's first discuss a little bit what this implies, right? The easy consequences. So, first, we have this result by Mironesco in 1D, right? Mironescu in 1D, right? We can wiggle the S upwards, and then the degree one minimizer does exist for a small amount of time. Now, with continuity, you get immediately and the Sachs-Ulmbeck theory, you can also wiggle downwards. Still, you cannot really talk about how big the delta is, but you know you can wiggle downwards. I mean, you can compute the delta, but it's kind of useless. And the proof is really just this energy identity. Assume we had a level S. We are at a level S where the minimizer is not attained, right? Then we have this energy identity. Then the minimizer at level one must be decomposable. That energy must be the sum of a bunch of other guys. But now everything is continuous in S, and we have control over the models of continuity. So what we can do is, well, we wiggle from S to one half, and we wiggle this expression here from S to one half that costs us an epsilon. But now for one half, we have. But now for one half, we have explicit numbers. We know what number this is, and we know what number that is, because that is what Mironescu computed, right? And so this is the result. So there is a computation, right? You can, I mean, this is not trivial, right? But it's computed, it's done. So we know that this here is essentially 4 pi squared, and this is larger than 4 pi squared. Contradiction, done, right? So once you have continuity, you get immediately something like this, that you can wiggle in either direction in this. Direction in this existence of degree one minimizes, or more generally, the minimal energy class non-trivial. Okay, you get the same results for sort of stability. This is kind of, it's exactly the same proof in principle. So you kind of can say that for each S, you find a small neighborhood and the kind of stable generating set where minimizers are attained. It's kind of the same principle. It's kind of the same principle. I don't want to go too much into details. It uses heavily this energy identity. And essentially, it says whenever you have any t in this around s where you don't have a minimizer, you wiggle. Then you get a lot of expansions, which has to repeat at some point, and that gives you a contradiction. So it's kind of the same argument as before. It follows from continuity. Once we have the models of continuity of this hash T under control of the minimal energy, this is an immediate consequence. Energy, this is an immediate consequence of success win back. So let me skip this a little bit about this. So, well, the only thing we have, and so the only thing that I can talk about the proof is really this sort of statement. So again, we take maps of homotopy groups into spheres. This will be very important. We actually use the regularity theory of not minimizers, but of critical. Of critical points, because that's the only thing that worked. And so we need to work between spheres because everything else would be a p-harmonic map, and we don't know regularity for them. Okay, so the proof idea is pretty much simple, right? So assume we have this minimizer at some level S, okay, that let's call it U. So that's the minimizer in this Ws N over S energy. The point is that we can show higher. The point is that we can show higher regularity. It's a minimizer. Minimizers are smooth, so some sort of higher regularity is kind of expected. But the point is, we get globally control of the Sobolev norm, right? And I use this Sobolev norm that is still scaling invariant. And this is extremely important because otherwise the statement would be wrong. I will talk about this a little bit more in a second. So if I get a Sobolev class, a higher Sobolev, so I have a regularity theory for these minimizers. Really, for these minimizers, well, then I just use the stability of the norm and I get the models of continuity out of it. And well, once I have this, I essentially do two one-sided arguments about minimizing less than minimizing. Since I have this models of continuity under control, it just depends on this energy, and the energy depends on the topology. So essentially, I get that we have, well, both directions. Well, both directions, right? We just look at the minimizing sequence here, we compare to the minimizing sequence of t, and we get this one-sided inequality, but we never cared whether t is less than s, so we can flip t and s. We have the two-sided inequality. In principle, this works if you have the existence of minimizers, then we just take that minimizer and we do this inequality. If we don't have the minimizer, we use again the energy identity to get exactly the same result. Okay? Okay, so the main point is this regularity theory. We need kind of higher regularity than to just have this model of continuity under control. That's the main point. Okay, so it is known that minimizers are holder continuous. It's a minimizer, right? It's a minimizer. It's not super great. It's a critical case for minimizers. So you hold a continuity is Kachopoli estimate, right? Continuities Cachiopoli estimate, right? This is kind of an easy thing, but the point is the user regularity results that you would write are like epsilon regularity. Assume that the norm is small in a small ball, then your hurdle continues in half the ball with some explicit estimate. It's always epsilon regularity theory. And now, this here cannot be a global result. You cannot hope that the minimizer of the Ws n over s energy is globally C alpha. Res energy is globally C alpha with an estimate. Why? Because you can bubble. You take the minimizer, you parametrize it stupidly, you scale it up to the North Pole, the models of continuity blows up. So you cannot have a uniform bound of the holder continuous exponent in terms of this energy, if it's just a generic minimizer. And I cannot control the parametrization of this minimizer. So everything which is like epsilon regularity theory is useless. Regularity theory is useless for me because what I really cannot control is on what sets is this initial norm, which I know is finite, but on what norms is this, on what balls is this guy small. This depends on the parameterization. I have no control over the parametrization because there could be many points where topology comes in. So absolute regularity doesn't work, or at least I don't know how. So, well, we cannot really take the minimizing argument. Cannot really take the minimizing argument into account because there would always be a local comparison argument under the assumption that you don't change the topology. If you don't want to change the topology, you need this sort of argument. So we actually prove a weaker result. We don't prove holder continuity. We just prove this Sobolev inequality, right? So we show that if we have a minimizer or critical point, then this higher Sobolev norm is bounded by the lower Sobolev norm. Okay? Okay, and this is scaling invariant. Both sides are scaling invariant, so this is in principle at least credible. I hope. You can do your bubbling, whatever you want, both sides don't care. Okay? So this is at least something which one can try to prove, and we can prove it into spheres. Again, we kind of use critical theory, so we cannot do it into general manifolds. And I have no idea. And I have no idea how to use this minimizing property, which is kind of ridiculous, right? We are having a minimizer and we're using way less information, but it's the only way I can do it. So what's the principal observation? The principal observation comes from the harmonic map theory. So classical, let's go to W12 again. Classical harmonic maps from the sphere into the sphere, okay, solve this equation. Laplace U equals. Solve this equation. Now plus u equals u grad u squared. Now, this is a bit of a complicated equation because we are in W12, so this right-hand side is in L1, right? So we don't have Cartoon Sigmund theory. But in the 1990s, right, there's this observation by Eller and Charta, I guess, that essentially shows, and then there's this Kaufman-Oldman-SMS result, right, that shows with a trick that you can decompose this into a diff curl, and that diff curl is then in the hardest. And that diff curl is then in the Hardy space. It's not only in L1. And the point of the Hardy space is we have Caldon-Sygmund theory, and for L1, we have only this weak Calderon-Sigmund theory. So observation, I mean, that's big result, right? Is this right-hand side is actually in the Hardy space. And then what you get, you get Kalon-Sigmund. So you get that the second derivative of U in the L1 norm is bounded by this guy in the Hardy space. That's Kalon-Sigmund. And this guy in terms is bounded by the Hardy. And this guy, in terms, is bounded by the Hardy space norm of this guy, which happens to be gradient U in the L2 power 3 norm. And now the observation is this is scaling invariant. This is the W21 norm, and this is the W12 norm. Both guys in two dimensions are scaling invariant, right? So this is a uniform estimate. And so the idea was to adapt this to the fractional case. And it gets a bit messy, but that's the point. It's doable, right? That's the point. It's doable, right? This sort of observation. Okay. I will not, what time? Zero. Okay, okay. You're in luck, so we don't have to talk about this, right? This is annoyingly technical, right? So you write down the Euler-Grange equation, then you have to kind of find something which is a gradient. And this is like pure harmonic analysis that you kind of put in Ries potentials and you see things. And you see things get a little bit unpleasant. But the upshot is that you find a notion of the gradient and then you can start to project the gradient in different directions. And either there's a tangential behavior of this sort of gradient or use the Eulagrange equation that you see there's a compensation effect in the regularity of this gradient. Okay, that's essentially all I'm going to say. You get the gradient is in a better space, and that implies that the solution was in a better space. Was in the better space, and everything is scaling invariant, and everything is global, nothing depends on some epsilon on some small set. Okay, so um, this is just a summary. So, once we have this, we have the high regularity, then relatively simple, we get the continuity. Once we have continuity, we get a bunch of like smaller results about the stability of these energies. Okay, and with that, I shall end and. That I shall end and well, maybe let me do this. So, what is probably doable is going s to one. Might need a little bit of work. We didn't really try yet. S going to zero would be a funny thing to look at because I don't even know where the norm really goes to. General manifolds, I don't know what to do, right? Because we use the criticality and we don't know p-harmonic maps in the local case, the regularity. All right, I stop here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
