That place, what are you going to push me? What is your reaction to using these questions? Please go. Okay, thanks a lot for organizing this kind invitation, but unfortunately, I'm not able to attend this workshop physically because of restock problem. But I really want to give this presentation in person, hopefully. So, this pulled in the push-me-pull you reaction diffusion equation is a joint work with Chris Henderson and Alania Redjik. And the linergic. What we consider is to study the long-term behavior of solutions to reaction diffusion equations along the line with generic assumptions on a monostable type F here. One can show existence of traveling wave solutions such as this ODE with boundary conditions. And a classical direction to study is to show the convergence of solutions. Convergence of solutions of this Cauchy problem to a fixed traveling wave. And describing what this moving frame should be is the difficulty part. The goal of our project here is to identify a precise moving frame M of T depending on the algebraic structure of F. And then, in what case this convergence can be shown. There's two general categories to Two general categories to describe the nature of spreading. One is called the POT, which means that the propagation is dominated by the area which is far ahead of the front. And on the other hand, the pushed spreading means that the propagation is dominated by the bulk region where this U is away from one and zero. Here I make this table to This table to more quantitatively describe what happens and what differences are. So, here for the pull case, the front location indeed will have a logarithmic delay with a constant 3 half in the front. And its corresponding traveling wave will have a linear turn in front of the exponential. While for the push the case, this minimal This minimal speed C is non-linearly determined and you don't have this logarithmic delay. And the traveling wave of symptotics here doesn't have the linear part, it's purely exponential. However, this being studied a while, but up to our knowledge, people don't really talk about what happens in the boundary case. Here we name it as push-me-poil case. This push-me-poil case to describe why this is kind of subtle. So, for this boundary case, you can show this traveling wave of symptotics like push the case is purely exponential. However, in terms of this front location dispersion, this minimum speed agree with the put case, but here this logarithmic delay is constant and become one half instead of three halves. Paths. For different nonlinearities, for example, fisher cavity type, which satisfy the previous assumption on F, but in addition, it has this inequality for all u's. Then this minimal speed is described as 2 square root f prime of zero, and the propagation is pulled. This vision KPV type non-linearity has been extensively studied by both. Restudied by both analysts and the probabilists. However, if F is just monostable but doesn't lie in this fischer KVT type, this is possible to have a phase transition from cold to pushed region happen. For example, this fissure genetic model introduced first by Hadler and Ross has this phenomenon. Here, when this chi increases and Chi increases and beyond one, then this propagation falls into the pushed region, and this C star is nonlinearly determined by chi value. Such phase transition can also happen in advection reaction diffusion equations, such as Berger's facial QBP equation or chemotaxis spatial QBP equation, etc. And previous works Previous work study models that have both pulled and pushed the propagations. So let me make a non-complete list here. So you can find numerous physical biological models have such a phase transition phenomenon and also written nicely by those applied mathematicians. And this inside dynamic. And this inside dynamics paper gives some L2 energy based description and distinguish the push the front from the pulled. And more interestingly, is to try to understand this asymptotics of the front location. And then there's a nice paper by Leach and Niedemann. They basically extensively use this matched asymptote expansion technique. matched a symptom to expansion techniques to describe what happens for a group of models. And in the past two years, every SHIO, they wrote several papers to study this pulled and pushed cases using spectral approach. However, this approach doesn't really cover the boundary case. And the last year, a paper by Giletti, he able to construct a very nice He is able to construct very nice sub- and super solutions to bound the location of the level set. However, at least what we know for the push-me-puyu case, where he call fast decay case, this bound still have epsilon off in the logarithmic delay. And last year we wrote a paper on in the context of Burgess Fisher KBP. Burgess Fisher KBP, and we're able to give a full picture of the convergence. So, in this model, this critical case happens when beta is two. Below this is pulled, beyond this is pushed. So, in this paper, our contribution is we study this Cauchy behavior, the Cauchy problem behavior for this group of nonlinearities. Nonlinearities. The only variable changes here is chi, and the a function is genetic, satisfying smooth enough, which is increasing convex. And for this type of nonlinearities, you actually can find a threshold number chi FKPP so that less than this value. Less than this value, this nonlinearity lies in the usual Fisher-KPP type. While between FKPP and the chi FKPP and the chi equal to one, we call this type of nonlinearity as semi-fisher KPP because it's not fisher KPP anymore, but it's a propagation still pulled and the minimal speed C star still. are still satisfied to square root f prime of zero. And then when chi is bigger than one, this nonlinearity then will give you a push the branch of propagation. And so for this family of nonlinearity, we able to give this following main theorem. Given a step function u0, we can show the convergence where when f is Where when f is of semi-fkbp type, this m of t is like 2t minus 3 half log t, and when f is of push-medical type, this m of t will be 2t minus 1 half log t. Before going into the details of the proof, let me first introduce this interesting quantity we name it as shape-defect function. Many papers prove the convergence using steepness comparison between the solution and the fixed traveling wave. So here, this steepness comparison basically means that if your initial data start steeper than the traveling wave, then it will always be steeper than the traveling wave along the whole time. So, we introduce a new function called w to quantify this argument. Here, eta c function doesn't have explicit expression, but it somehow describes the traveling wave profiles by satisfying this equality. And virtually, in the face plane, it kind of describes the stiffness. It kind of describes the stiffness and the slope of the traveling wave in this way. So, all the traveling wave trajectory from one to zero will be bounded between L1 and L2. Here, this eta C star is this orange curve, but we don't really know what it actually looks like. We just know the bounds for it. However, this is already nice enough. We can write down a parabolic. We can write down a parabolic equation for W and use maximum principle. We can show that if the initial data is non-negative, then it stays non-negative for all time. This means the steepness ordering is preserved. On the other hand, we can also introduce this energy to measure the distance between the solution and the nearest traveling wave. By simple algebraic computer. By simple algebraic computation, one can show that this energy actually is monotonically decreasing. And this is indeed a new variational formulation that not only cover push-type reaction diffusion equations, like many other variational formulations did, but also here it can be used for the pull-type reaction diffusion equations. equations and we can okay we can also give a bunch of properties of this eta c even though we don't know really what it look exactly looks like so this nonlinearity we consider here can be rewritten into this form for to this form for all chi's but when chi is exactly But when chi is exactly one, we actually can have explicit description about this about this eta function, which is u minus a of u. So now let me give the main idea about the proof. So let alpha to be a divided by u. And in the moving frame x minus 2t we introduce this weighted. We introduce this weighted HopeCo transform. It doesn't seem that natural to do this for RDEs. However, just magically you can able to derive this equation in one. And this G quantity here, after computation, is quite complicated. It's non-local. It's of the integral form. However, using However, using the positivity of the shape defect function as well as the traveling wave profile bounds, as this picture shows, then indeed we can get that this G quantity on the right-hand side is non-positive, which means we actually linearize the problem to be an approximately heated equation. And this weighted Hope Cole transform was first introduced. Transform was first introduced when we studied this Burgess-Fischer-KBP equation, where you can also see that this transformation also tell us why this criticality happens. So here, this Berger's equation's criticality again happens when beta is 2. So I will go to more details in the next page. With this transition, With this transformation, we linearize the problem, and then the remaining is essentially a care for modification of the paper by Hamel, Nolan, Rocko-Jeffree-Ridgik when they study the convergence for the Fischer-KBP equation. So here, when chi is strictly less than one, you can see the data, the data for V. The data for v when chi is strictly less than one on the far left-hand side will be exponentially small. So, in this case, we are able to construct upper and lower barriers for the v quantity on the far right side. So, after the self-similar change of variables and apply functional based analysis, we can consider, we can have the convergence to. Can have the convergence to principal eigenfunctions for this problem. But this problem we study is a half problem with approximate directory boundary condition because the far left-hand side is approximately close to zero. And with that convergence happens in the tail part, then we can trace back to the Balka region and take and construct a super solution for the Solution for the difference function s here to get a stabilization in the local area. However, when chi is exactly one, this approximate boundary condition will change. So this on the far left-hand side, this v quantity indeed should approach to be a constant. Then this approximate boundary condition will changes to be. Boundary condition will change to be normal. That is why, when you go into the self-similar variable, study the principal eigenfunctions, it implies that the constant in front of log t will change to be one half instead of three halves. So this transformation indeed tells us why these critical values should be one. But how do we know this approach to be a constant in certain frame while we know it should be one half log t, right? So indeed, we should first obtain the front location for the data, which equivalently means we require us to bound the shift mu t for this value for a figure. Value for a fixed level set. So it means that we should get lower the upper bounds for equation three. And with this big O of one precision obtained, then we can improve this to little O of one by using the techniques like here. So essentially, now the problem boils down to Boils down to get to the result in equation three. For the upper bound of mu t here, we look at this exponential moment, and we able to show that this quantity here, I of t, is bounded below by square root of t. And this boundedness, actually, we borrowed the estimate from Jalen. Borrow the estimate from Gelati's paper to show this. And then, with this lower bound, then we can also use some upper bound estimate for the shape default function to get contradiction arguments, then show this upper bound for mu t. For the lower bound, it's trickier, but there's a very interesting observation I would like to share. For the shape defect function, we know w is always stay positive. And then for the critical case, we can actually write down this eta function so we know this inequality satisfies for all locations. And this implies that we can transform this reaction diffusion equations into this react we call reactive conservation law. Active conservation law in equation four. This relationship between these two equations tells us that the reaction, sorry, the reaction diffusion equation solution is subsolution for the solution to the reaction reactive conservation law. Therefore, if we can determine the lower bound for the front location of URCL, then we can get the lower bound for the solution. For the solution to the reaction diffusion equation in the critical case. Now, the problem boils down to determine the lower bound for the front location of the reactive conservation law solutions. We take this following trick. We look at this u-hat quantity and multiply with e to the x to give this new function ptx. And for this ptx, And for this PTX, we can actually derive this inhomogeneous conservation law. And if we can show that this P decays like one over square root T, then we are done. Because here in μT, it looks But because this lies in the level set, which is some constant, so we have and tells that mu t is bounded below by one half log t. So essentially, showing this tangent decay bounds for p, then we are done. However, this is highly non-trivial because it's Because it's both kind of spatially inhomogeneous. However, we already developed techniques when we studied the Berger spatially PDP equation. So this essentially just a generalization for that. The proof itself is quite long and complicated, but let me just list the key steps we used in the proof. So first, we based on the relative entropy idea, we idea, we able to construct supersolution rho, and then take this ratio function phi for that is p divided by rho, we can derive a dissertation irreparable for it. For the Burgess facial KBP equation, let me describe this supersolution rho here. For the Burgess facial KBP, it's like one minus u. But of course, for general case, the expression is more complicated. And then with And then, with that, next we need to do some modification for the initial data because we consider, for example, step function, which is actually not really stay in this weighted L2 space. So modification is needed, but this modification is available. And also by choosing good enough A, we can show this PA is close to P everywhere. And with that development, And with that developed, then we can derive a weighted Nash type inequality, and then we're able to show this L2 abundance here. And then the last step is we bootstrap this L2 decay to this L infinity decay for P. And then that wraps up the whole proof. So this is what else to mention in this paper. Mentioned in this paper. So, not only for the analysis proof, we also give a probabilist interpretation for this non-fisher-KBP type nonlinearities, which we name as a volting model. However, still, this probabilistic model, we cannot really identify why chi equals y is critical. This still remains to be an open problem. Problem. And another interesting thing I want to mention is for this companion reactive conservation law, we also tried out the weighted Hofko transform for it. However, now the right-hand side has this form. Again, as before, we want to get negativity on the right-hand side, but then this requires alpha to be concave. So in this case, the only positive. So in this case, the only possibility is let alpha u to be u, which means only Berger's facial QEP can satisfy this. However, we can still bound this shape defect function for the reactant conservation law. So still this right-hand side can be nicely controlled. So that's what I want to talk about for this work. And thank you a lot. Thanks a lot for listening. Thanks a lot for listening, and I'm happy to take any questions. Thank you. Any questions? Do you think that this meeting can be divided? We deploy other non-linearities and this A of you types. I mean, sorry. Yes. Can you... It's very specific to this kind of nonlinearity, so you think that the strategy, the general strategy of considering this defect. This defect function can be applied also for other non-linearities. Okay, so first, I think this nonlinearity already covers a good enough range of non-linearities because this A of U is quite generic. Generic? Yeah, so the only thing like changes here is the chi, but A of U, you Here is the chi, but A of U, you have certain freedom to choose. It's convex and convex, increasing, and have boundary condition like totally. But the same type of results you expect to hold for general monostable? Okay, so at least this model covers this fiscal. This fisher genetic model. Right. And also, it can, you can also take A of U to be U to some power and maybe some other polynomials. But beyond that, I don't know. Yeah, I mean, at least this paper just covers to this stage, but maybe we can. To this stage, but maybe we can do more extension in the future. Just a sub-question to Ruca's question: the colour hot transformation that you have used, you use it for other equations, maybe it doesn't give you what you want. The function you obtain is not one sign, but that broader applicability. Sorry, so it's kind of spotty. The signal is quite spotty. I'm asking about on this slide, hope transformation, whether you can use it for other types of non-linearities, whether it gives anything useful. So, okay, so for this Hofko transformation, that's why we require this A to be convex. A to be convex. Yeah, so yeah, here the assumption on the A is quite related to when we apply the Hope Coal transform. Because the essential part is we need to make sure the right-hand side is controllable. They cannot be just like generic, can be anything like, okay, so first thing, when you apply this Hofko quote, the right-hand side is very complicated. It has maybe five, six turns of the intro growth form, et cetera. integral form etc so without this without this positivity of the shape defa function and this troubling wave profile bounds i don't think there's any hope to really control the g nicely unless you like uh okay like last page like what chris did he get some very nice control of this w function then yeah okay either you need to make Yeah, okay. Either you need to make sure the sign is correct or it's sufficiently small. Great. Any other questions? I have one question. What is the article entropy proof? The entropy proof? So does this speech equation our relative interview? Sorry, I don't really hear anything. What is the reactive entropy function? The entropy function. So, okay, the essential relative entropy idea comes from a paper, I think, from Peter Constantine. A very small note from so it's it's it's essentially like you compare two functions, take this ratio, and then and then you can derive this some dissipation inequality. Well, in his paper, it's not really super solution, but just a solution for this equation. Here we consider supersolution. But it's just a slight difference. Thank you. All right, so let's thank the speaker again.
