So today I'm going to talk about smooth protein surfaces, so real functional smooth protein surfaces. So I will first explain the general concept and the kind of problem that we try to study. And then the second half, I will explain how we can construct some smooth protein surfaces with infinitely many real forms. So starting from geometry of some cooler issues. Of some commercial history surfaces of product type. So, already there, there's a picture of Kumar surface of product type. So, let me start with real formulas. So, let V be a variety over C, and then a variety W over R is called a real form. Of these is so the scalar extension from R to a C of W is isomorphic at the variety of a C to a V. And assume that Assume that is quite polyf then five elementary argument of the Gala descent. So this the set of a real form set of the modulo atomogen over R. This is The R. This is this can be identified as the set of a real structure on the V modulo some isomorphism. So by real structure, I mean anti-automotive evolution. Module isomorphism in here. And here, anti-polymotic means that this is so automotive of D, but commute with the conjugate over a CC. So, this is conjugation for sending D. So it's quite okay. And so, here I can also think that it If two such two anti-homotic evolutions mean that they are isomorphic so my definition is that they are equal after a concentration by over E. Okay, so the object here, I also call them a real software. Okay, and uh now so assume that um So assume that it has a real form, or assume that it has a real function, I. Then we have a third identification between the set of real forms, the modulo isomorphism. This we can identify with some Galaxomodia of Of R so the condition in the group of V over T and here this is my notation for the Genoa actual Galois group of arson, which is just these notes to be and the action of this group on. And the action of this book on the automotive booty is just you take F changing to the composition of the conjugate of F by the real structure. So here, put a minus one or nothing the same since this is an evolution. Okay, so yeah, so I will not recall. So I will not recall the definition of the Gala group, but I'll just say that so Gawa, an element inside here is some one possible and the cosycle condition just comes from the this evolution condition and then this equivalence defines the for boundary condition and yeah so let me just say that Yeah, but let me just say that if the group action is two-zero, yeah, so suppose that we have one or two action on the group a which is 60. Then the this group formal just The step of involution, modular conjugation, so mainly the conjugation type of involvement. Okay, so let me so first example. So, for instance, if we look at the 4G design, so the step of R for real form of vertical design up to isobol 10 is just so real vertically design also real. Also, real points without points. So, here is defined by the equation what is square plus y square plus z square point for the room. So inside x y z are the homogeneous coordinates of P two. And if we look at the higher dimension of a positive plate. higher dimensional hypothesis plate r f um so n dimension also we see that uh this is um and also um so the symmetric power of things also are real form but uh this um actually the number of such real forms is uh depends on the heritage Is depends on the parity of n. So when n is even, then actually those will form our isomorphic. And if n is all, then yeah, then these two real varieties are not isomorphic over R half. Over the octa, so one way to see that in one-dimensional projective space only has one real zone is that every involution has a fixed point. This can be seen as defined as a consequence of so for instance the shift. Of so, for instance, the shift a fixed point field. And if you have a fixed point by an anti-polymotic evolution, then necessarily your real form has a real point. But any several variety with a real point is necessarily isomorphic over R through for predictive space. Okay, so now let me talk about finding this. Okay, so we saw that here we have a one-to-one correspondence between the set of real forms and some clinical formula G. But the coefficient here is the whole automotive group of V. So what can we say about if we replace the whole? We replace the whole automotive group by its discrete part. So, this the following statement when the identity component is linear, it was used to late and I'm a rofer. Yeah, and then we complete this so without the assumption that the identity component is linear, which is the following. Assume that V is coordinative. Assume V is coordinative over C with the real form. Then Then the finalness of H1 of the Galois width coefficient in the discrete part of the automotive visit. This implies the finalness of the real form of Yeah, so uh for instance if um this is the final variety then then uh pi zero of automotive group is finite. So as long as this model is finite the whole H1 is also finite. So this implies that for funnel variety For funnel varieties, every funnel variety has only finitely function. So we see that. So, riddle forms have something to do with the automotive group of the variety. So, a natural question would be, are there any correlations between the size of the auto-booting genes and the number of real forms? And say, for instance, finding it for Okay, for instance, we have the following naive, but yes. K3 only have finally mainly conjecturally so what is the following question is not if but still unknown so for instance we can ask whether so these three parts called automotive Count automotive group is non-finally generated. Whether, for instance, this is equivalent to the property that the number of real points here, infinite. So, so far, there is no known example of these with non-finally generated discrete automotive groups. Treat automotive group, but at the same time, having only finitely many real forms. So let me try some names. So already the existence of smooth projective varieties with no finally generated dispute automation. Finally, generated this with automatic groups. This wasn't known until only recently, so I think 2017 the first examples satisfying this property. So the automorphism group is discrete and non-finally generated. And for the same example, Examples to also that it has they have infinite many forms and then later on so the self example is fixed and later on there are some sort of construction used for maintaining open loads so their examples are in a certain Uh their examples are in a substitute, and then uh there have been also a substitute and works by uh okay so uh for the moment we still don't know how to answer this question but uh in some sense um we can um provide uh an answer to this question To this question. So, maybe if you have a variety of E with infinitely many real forms, then necessarily automotive groups needs to be quite complicated. So, this is we prove that suppose that's the number of locomotions of units like infinite. Infinite. Then, first of all, the discrete part of the automotive group of V necessarily contains a non-obedient frequency. And secondly, so yeah, so this kind of statement already printed in Pinted in the same book by Lik PRF, even though Caramore, but saying that if you take a rational political form inside the net form of a B. Phone of the V. Then look at the orbit of this form. So this never covers the ankle form. So this is another way to express that the automotive group input is quite Group inputting is a quite complicated. Okay, so oh, yeah, so if you assume, if you believe Kong conjecture is true, then Kong conjecture implies that every smooth colour variety has only finitely many low points. Yeah, so let me just, yeah, as you say, so So, current conjecture inside this problem. Yeah, a lot of monitoring. Yes, yes, I will know it's alternative, yes. So Let me explain briefly how the first one is cool. So we can look at the representation of the automotion group. The cohomology of it. Yeah, so we look at images of rule. So by cheat antalasis, we know that the image of raw is either virtually solvable or it contains a normal BDN of pre-proof. So assume that this is a virtually solvable. Virtually the mobile then, okay, so then also plus the property that this is finite by 33. So, and then elementary properties of group homology imply that actually H1 is positioned in either V. This is also finite. Yeah, so yeah, so if Yeah, so if we have infinite many real phones, then necessarily this is infinite. So this is now virtually solvable, so contains normal fees. And Apple QA, the Python also contains normal billion things. Yeah, so let me comment, make a further comment on one. Okay, so one so also implies that there are bias previous point works with gino and also with destiny. So yeah, if I0 contains enough If I0 contains low-income free group, then the auto-commission group necessarily contains some positive type of thing elements. Okay, so what does this imply? So assume that S is a smooth political surface, then Then one fail is S has an automorphism equivariant vibration in its curve. Okay, so um So, this is because as long as we have such a vibration, then necessarily every automotive has zero entropy. So, this is the case. Yeah, and also, yeah, one also fails obviously when the automorphism group is finite. Yeah, or if this three part is. If this three part is finite. Yeah, so this is the case, for instance, when the surface has non-vanishing D1 and also with color dimension largely inputs to one. And two fails to impact that conjunctions doesn't hold for such varieties. So yeah, if the surface very Yeah, if the surface verifies the volume conjecture, so for instance, it is minimal with zero tolerance. So the confrontation for these surfaces were proven misseverable. So in the case of gateway surface, proven by surface and non-missile. Uh non-income and uh how much okay so um so at the conference of the two properties With some additional analysis on the case of variety variational to obedience to basis, we do the following, which also already the statement already appeared in the book of Dicky Ahib Idenberg. The paramorphic complete argument and also some more unifying ways to prove this. So assume that the number of milk forms of smooth ordinary surface S is infinite or Surface then S is necessarily a non-minimal so non-minimal in the sense that it contains some minus one curves and moreover it is birational to either E2 K3 surface or any other surface. So previously, Ling, Odizo, and Yu construct examples of rational sensitivity and also grow out of. So, blowout of a case surface at one point having infinitely many real functions and so for surface is parallel to every type of surface. So we also construct examples with taking many of those very distributed processes S and some point E in S with that. So the number of real points of the blow up of S at E is one. What kind of yeah, I will explain the construction now. Yeah, so these are some general statements and concepts. And before moving on to consumption, do you have any questions? Okay, so now let me explain how we construct. How we construct okay, let me recall what we need to construct. Okay, so we see that number of real phones can be identified with the state the first. Uh, the first gamma cohomology of G-width coefficient in the automotive group. Yeah, what we want to prove is that this H1 is the infinite. So, in order to achieve this, we need to do the solving. So, we need an implement surface such that So, for instance, the catalog group acts trivially on the automotive group of it. So, namely, every automobilism on it are real. Yes, and for since the download action is figured, H1 is just conjugate classes of evolutions in the automotive group. So we need to construct, we need to find a real circuit and also. And also, one real point such that the blow-up of SFT has been conjugating aspects of Of evolutions. Okay, so every case surface is proportional to one portion of case free surface. So that starts with K3 surface. So the K3 surface that we start with will be some tumor type. The commercial type, a commercial entity surface of product type. So that P and F be two very general real entity surfaces. Yeah, so real, one way to say E is real means that for all the two important points of E. The two potential points of E defined over R. We let X be the Kumar case resulting associated with the product L. And so first of all, we noticed that for this Kumo case is the Galois action on the automotive. And the automotive group of X is 0. Yeah, so here is OY. So let's be the real structure on X induced by the real structure on EMS. Then, um, so this is Kuma K3, and yeah, so these are the image of the two total points of E and F times F and E respectively. And then here, the 16 lines here. Here are the additional divisors of the equivalent resolution of the quotient of C times F by the evolution. So this evolution fixes the twenty-four The 24 P1 here and these 24 P1 generate the whole P car Yeah, so it follows that so for every so for any automotive of X so G profile is equal to the conjugation of G by the real structure. Of G by the real structure so as the automotion of the guitar matter. And then also by construction, the real structure also preserves the colours between. Columbus between two points. So, this is inside that. The same thing also holds. So, 4x of D also equals to 4x by B as an automoistance as automovision on the transitional notice of X. And since the representation of the The representation of the automotion loop on H2 of a KC surface is fatal. This implies that necessarily these so these two holomorphic automotive are equal. Okay, so this shows that every automorphism on the FUMO case tree is real. So now let's look at  Okay, so let's construct some evolution first on the tumor of systems. So we consider this divisor, so this one. So yeah, so this will be a bypass of HP1. So this divisor then is called it P1. So if you look at the system Linear system of OT1, this defines Jacobian vibration of X. So if you have Jacobian vibration, then the zero section, for instance, this minus one twelve is the zero section, so I'll call it. We will let pi in the evolution define pipeline. File square is identity, and now we consider. Okay, so this is one information that you can use. So for infinitely many evolution, we conjugate this evolution with translations of other of another Jacobian population. Jacobian vibration, then this time the Jacobian vibration is defined by this divisor. This is the same as two more cases. And this time the cycle of HP1 is choosing this one. And also section and we consider another section or the Section for this sigma point. So this divisor is denoted by these two. This again defines the vibration. And we let F the translation by lead remote sequence require finding. And then we let psi n be the conjugate of psi by so some powers of f. So this is again an involved. An evolution of X So, if we look at this curve, so I will call it So, I will call it in two. So we look at F2D4, then F acts on the irreducible component of D2 by specific permutation of all the four. So X to the four will so every So every irreducible component of E2 is stable under F to the 4. So if we respect to E2, then if we fix define coordinate of V1, so here, 1, 0, 1, infinity, then in local coordinate, this is multiplication. Multiplication by some real number R. And under the assumption that the starting elliptic curves are very general, we can show that this R is considered limbo. Okay, and also and also by simple computation, we can Computation: We can also see that if we look at the restriction of psi n to e2, then this is this thing x to one over r to the n minus x. So this implies that psi n is different from psi m for every M for every n different index. Yeah, and also since psi is the involution with respect to this sigma, and since F to the four leaves invariant these components of D2. So it follows that if we look at the restriction of nut zero section sigma, this is the identity. So I will use this notation that psi n is in the inertial of. Inertial of Fixing the curve. Okay, so these are the infinitely many evolution that we considered. And so we can show that. So we can show that if we consider this collection of the incolution, then this is regarded as element inside the subgroup. So the inertia group of X sigma modulo conjugation this is infinite. Okay, so here is an explanation why we can show that this collection forms this infinitely many conjugation classes inside the inner shape roof. So first of all, we show that there is this unique irreducible It will use for a simple curve, which is fixed by the evolution size and having a positive genus, sorry, having a genus larger than positive. So recall that psi is the evolution. defined using the first Jacobian vibration with respect to this zero section. And for every so you take any automation which commutes with pi then this is Then necessarily sigma is also sigma is stable under this gamma and so since so since m square is 2g minus 2 and minus two and by uh by this is uh freely positive so it means that uh every centralizer of size fix the class of uh sigma which is a beacon neighbor so this implies that the centralizer of psi is finite They're all finite. So then, yeah, how can we conclude that there are infinite many, the psi n from infinite many are conjugate classes? So let's assume that two of them are conjugate to each other. Assume we have Assume we have psi n is equal to some conjugation of psi n. Okay, so with h in the inertial group. Now then to replace the definition of psi n and psi m in terms of f and psi. of f n psi, we obtain that f to the four n composed with psi composed with f to the minus four n. This is inside the centralizer of then so by a similar computation there is this we can find a fine for the name z on the zero section sigma here. zero section sigma here such that the restriction of f to the 4n to sigma the angular disapply coordinate this sends z to r to the n times z so this implies that if we look at the reflection of this thing um yeah so so this is it This page. So, if you look at the restriction of this crystallizer of psi to sigma, this sends V to R to the n minus M times V. And since the Liber is finite. So this implies that the set the scalar layer for L and integer uses also This is also finite. I mean, such as psi n, the congregant with pi n is finite. So it implies lemma goes through the property that r is transcendental. So in particular, So, in particular, R is not root of unity. Okay, so now everything is on the K3 surface, but we want every curve surface more precisely, and then we want after blow-up of every curve surface. So that's So that's let me explain which surface we eventually we want to descend this evolution on the emergency surface and by construction we then want to leave this evolution on the blow up of such emergency surface with the well chosen other well chosen I will show them for points. Yeah. You need to show that so what we showed is that inside this group, inside this group, these evolutions form including maybe a conjugate curve. Then we need to prove that we can find a point on A point on sigma such that once you go out at this point, we have equality between the list. If we can find such a point, then yeah, then we show that these two are infinite limits your property. Yeah, and okay, so Munka. Okay, so we have everything. Okay, so we keep the same button. I'll point to maybe something. So now let me draw C1 cos T1. So which is C modulo plus minus 1 times F module plus minus 1. And then, okay, so what I write is the product of image of 2000 points with image of E and E. So we that this point P0, P1, P2, P3. So by degree embedding, we can embed P1 plus P1 as the quadratic hyperprotein inside. You see, and then we can so here is the parameter so that this point T0 to E3 tends to the spender coordinate of E3. Then Mukai shows Much show of the cremon evolution on PC. So cremona evolution means elephant evolution of the form of lit form. And here ATCB are real, so things we can choose. NDCB can be real, things are starting elicit curves are real, and the imagining also can be chosen real. So there is this terminal evolution. Many for how from first of all, bit evolution preserves the quadratic and also the indeterminacy locals are exactly the are exactly the four points p0 p1 p 2 p 3 and once we blow up um q at these four points it becomes an automobile and click on the blue up Of Q along at least four points. Second property is that power exchange E and F time. And third property is that HAL leads to an anti-sympathetic evolution on the tree. So, what happened? No big point. So we let X the every surface obtained by portion by this evolution calculus. And we show all these evolutions that we construct from the PC. That we construct from the paper surface design to inclusion on this. And moreover, since they fix the zero section sigma, the descent of this evolution also fix the image of sigma inside. So maybe This element is inside the inertial of X fixing the image of the zero section. Image of the zero section is marked. Okay, so finally blue up. Okay, so which point we choose? We choose the real point P on the image of that zero section. And moreover, we choose one such that is very general. And in particular, we want two things. A, so we want, so since there is only countably many irreducible curves inside S with negative self-intersection, so we can always choose P such that the following point. Such that the following forms. So whenever C is an irreducible curve inside F, which is not equal to the image of the zero section sigma and with negative self-intersection, then necessarily. It's not inside the intersection of I of sigma with P. So namely I of sigma is the only irrucible curve with negative intersection which passes through. Now so let me take a few more minutes to conclude. Include that. So, another thing we want is that we can achieve that. So, since S is in a weaker surface, so for the Morrison group of S is countable, so we can always choose T such that the following property T is satisfied. But for any automorphism, Of F. Such that it preserves the image of the zero direction. If it moreover preserves fixed g, then this implies that g fixes the whole pie of sigma. Of sigma then the inertial 16 high of sigma. And with that, it still has the draw of edge at this peak. Okay, so we conclude as follows. Ultimately, the automotive group that we are interested in is That we are interested in is the automotive group of S tilde. And this is so this is a blowout of S at C. This is the same thing as so the subgroup of automation group of S 16 C. Then clearly it's so since C is inside pi of C mass is an Is an automorphism space pointwise the pi of sigma is also fixed and actually by our choice of these so which satisfies the particular l and d we actually have equality of view and then so here we can list so So we can list the element here to our future. And so what we show is that. descend to the error surfaces and since inside there they form infinitely many conjugated classes so aforesaid they also form infinitely many conjugated classes in the model so this shows that this kind of This shows that this concludes the proof that a field that has internally many forms. So I'll stop here, and thank you very much for your attention.
