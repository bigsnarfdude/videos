And she's going to give us a talk about the dissipative measure value solutions for the Euler-Poisson equations. Please? Thank you very much for the introduction. So the work I'm going to present today is a common work with various people and my idea was such a nice accent to put the photos of To put the photos of my co-authors. But then I realized that all of them concerning this work are among participants of our meeting. So instead of inserting the photos, I decided I can edit our group photo and edit a little. Add a little bit to include hustle also. So, thank you for adding me. You're welcome. So, most of the of my concern today will be directed to the common work with Hose, with Tomek Denbiets, and with Piot. But I will also I will also make some small excursions to the common works with Eduard Varaisel, with Emil Teman, and with André Kham. And also I will make some connections to some works of Thanos that were influenced also the works and discussions with Thanos influenced our some of the results in this topic. In this topic. So, and I would also like to appreciate a lot the idea of Mira for putting my lecture as the last one, because so much has been said about measure-value solutions, young measures, relative energy inequality, weak-strong, or measure-value-strong uniqueness. That I'm ready with the background, so I don't need an introduction. So I'm sorry to those who had to omit some talks before I will skip this part, but what I want to tell you that this will not be the typical way of the weak strong. Of the weak, strong uniqueness result. Well, it's slightly different. I don't know whether it's surprising or not, but different. And finally, also about Euler system with non-local terms. Lots has been said, mostly with alignment terms. In the topic of collective dynamics, I will concentrate. Collective dynamics, I will concentrate more on Euler-Poisson system, but that's in fact an example. An analog result also can hold if we add some alignment terms. But for presentation, Ms. Euler Poisson will be just easier. So just the essential things about Young measures, what I will put on one slide. I will put on one slide. Well, the question is whether EANC measures can describe concentration effect. Of course, in case of the systems where we don't have sufficient a priori estimates, we cannot exclude them. So that's why these concentration measures appear again and again. And again, and just to say clearly what we mean by that. So, first, maybe if we have some family of functions, then such a classical facts like fundamental theorem and Young measures provides us existence of such a weakly measurable mapping. And with help of that, we can prescribe the limit of the composition of some non-linear function. Composition of some non-linear function and the sequence. And this we done with such a duality pair. This is duality between space of measure and C0 functions. The continuous function of infinity. Okay, so good. That's one thing. But on the other hand, when we have a function and we know about boundedness in L1, then we can claim with such basic arguments. Basic arguments like Bana Hadauvlo that there exists a weak star limit in the space of measures. So is the concentration measure and in what follows I will always use the notation M with here an index to indicate from what what term, what function it is coming from. Remote function it is coming from. This is this difference between the limit in the space of measures and in fact this biting limit, so this oscillatory part. Okay, in such a remark, if we already know that this is weakly pre-compact in L1, then we don't have this concentration much. Okay, so that's That I wanted to make sure that you will remember from other talks. And the important thing is that we will also need to somehow compare such a concentration measures. What is behind is, of course, for the result of which strong uniqueness, we need the result on relative energy. Result on relative energy inequality. So, trying to show that such an inequality holds, then we need to somehow estimate appropriate terms. And once the concentration measure is present there, then also we will need somehow to compare it. So, important thing is that once we know the relation between functions, Relation between functions, then the same is true for corresponding concentration measures. So that's maybe I will not really use it because I'm not going to show you any proof, but to have in mind that this is the fact that it's important behind it. So maybe very shortly, because measure value solutions were somehow Measure value solutions were somehow appreciated more with the result first for incompressible Euler system about which strong uniqueness or measure by strong uniqueness of Branier de Lais and Sacaritis for Euler system. And this was these measure value solutions were in such a setting of Diperna-Maida measures. I don't want to go into detail. I don't want to go into details, but anyway, with the help of the relative energy inequality, we could get that measured by the solutions as a direct delta function concentrated in the solution U. Okay, and after that, many results of such type for different systems were appearing. Maybe I would like to mention not to go into details, I will be very case I will be very imprecise here to the case of system of conservation laws. So let's think about such a general system and also some of the result appears in the paper I mentioned before, but with the additional assumption, but without concentration measures. And also in one of the papers of Thanos Of tunnels where the concentration measure appears in the entropy inequality. What I shortly want to mention here, the result here with Piot and André for such a general hyperbolic system. And maybe let me first refer to the system of the tunnels considered. Of the panels considered also in this form. So, again, I underline, I'm not putting most of the assumptions, but I just want to underline the relations between the flux functions, the flux under time derivative and the flux under divergence, and the entropy function. The functions from the equations have to be Equations have to be controlled in this way by the entropy functions. And this panels did for such a general system and was very well tailored for such an example like polyconvex elastodynamics. However, this condition is not satisfied like we look into fluid dynamics like for compressible Euler equations. So we worked in a similar spirit, but with only requiring the bands. Okay, so this is not a universal result. It does not work, for example, for For example, for Euler-Poisson system. And the problem lies here with this assumption that we don't have here in the momentum term, we don't have here the pressure term, so we will not be able to control some of the terms by the entropy network. Okay, so let me now. Okay, so let let me let me now um concentrate till till the end of the talk on this Euler-Woisson system. Okay, so so so here we have such a kernel I consider it such a Newtonian kernel. So the first the first thing that that we want We want, which is very useful that this term can be written in such a format, which I would probably not discover myself to make these computations, but I know it from tunnels. So, in fact, what we further consider is the system not in. Is the system not in the form of this one, but with this term having this divergence form? Okay, and well, the definition of measure-value solutions, don't try maybe to read it in detail, in particular, also not because it's not fully correct. What I discovered today, shortly before the talk, but I didn't want to mess up and Myself and change it because I wrote the definition for the system in this first one. And it should be in the second one. But anyway, what is crucial? Everywhere where these bars appear, so it will always be the sum of this oscillatory part coming from the Young measure and this concentration. Concentration, concentration part. So, when speaking about the solution, we think about such a vector-valued Young measure and concentration measures related with the non-linearities that may appear. It's not important at all to remember this definition. I will tell you in a moment what is important. What is important. However, the measure value solution, we also want from this it satisfies some energy inequality. So we formulate an analog of the energy inequality, but in the measure value setting, and still always these bars are in the same meaning that on the previous slide. So such a measure value solution is admissible if it satisfies the following. Satisfies the following energy in the correct. Okay, so first couple of remarks: what is important to underline. The concentration measure surely may appear also in the density, which is not not, we are not so used to it when we think about systems with pressure. And this is because the And this is because the the pressure is not not here and we don't have uh we couldn't we have no way to provide better integrability of the pressure. And also, if we look at the at the energy inequality, then the term here it may also produce concentration, we may also have concentrations produced here. Okay, so so the way we proceed is let's proceed is let's say usual way for when aiming for such a result. We define the relative energy. It has the following form. Again, the bars are the sums of oscillation and concentration parts. We show that such inequalities is satisfied and then we work on this remainder term. And this remainder term we want to We want to estimate with the integral of the relative energy and then to conclude, to be able to conclude with Gronwald inequality argument. Okay, good. So once you use this Gronwald and once you have this information that this relative energy is equal to zero, then okay, it is the last. Okay, it is the last step is obvious, then you would not even you would not even write it that the dirac measure are is a are well the young measure is dirac measures concentrated in the strong solution and concentration measure vanish. So one could say so. One could say so obviously that the details may be omitted. And this is, in fact, we were in spring visiting Jose in London for a couple of days making lots of estimates and computations on the blackboard. So once we got this relative energy zero, we said goodbye to Hose. Goodbye to Hose and went to the airport. But here starts what is interesting in my talk, that we don't have these conclusions because we had an idea that at the airport, let's write it down in detail and it appeared. Well, no, we cannot show this. We cannot show this. So we got the measure values strong uniqueness result, but it is different, not like the common one. So like looking at the parts of the energy inequality, so this has to be zero. So from here, we can conclude that the Young measure here is a tensor product of the Dirac measure concentrated in here in the strong solution. The strong solution gradient of phi and concentration measure vanishes. And then, with that knowledge, we go to the this kinetic part of the second part of the relative energy, which is here, and conclude that this is from non-negative this concentration measure is zero. But if we are away from vacuum, so we can estimate this discur from below. This curve from below, then we can say that this Young measure, this from here, is a tensor product of Dirac measure concentrated at U and some Young measure coming from the density. And on the vacuum, we can say, okay, from the density, it's From the density, it's zero, so here we get this direct delta function, but here there's still some young measure because we are losing some information. So we just don't come to this information of the product of appropriate direct measures. It's not like in case of weak solutions that you could from the equation. Solutions that you could from the equation, from the Poisson equation, we could pull out this information from information on phi, information on raw. Okay, you work it out later. You work it out that from Poisson equation that the strong solution is rho, but bar. Bar is this oscillatory part and And concentration measure. And then you look at different terms and using the equation, you are able to show different relations, but with bars here again. And that's why this result. uh that's why this this this result is is is different because you get the result however without without showing uh that all measures young measures are are direct measures and that all concentration measures vanish okay so thank you very much for your attention
