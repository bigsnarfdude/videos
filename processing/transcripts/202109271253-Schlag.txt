The title of his talk is Isometric Stability for the Sign Golden Tank and Odd Perturbations. Well, please. Thank you very much. Thank you to the organizers for inviting me to this very nice meeting. I will speak on matters closely related to Fabio's talk, but let me introduce the exact setting. So we have scalar fields. Setting so we have scalar fields from one plus one dimensional Minkowski space into the reals, and w is your potential energy, which you can think of as, for example, a double well, but doesn't need to be a double well. The equation of motion is the Euler-Lagrange equation, so you get essentially a Klein-Gordon type equation with conserved energy E phi. It's very well known and And ideally, the goal is to understand the long-time dynamics of all solutions of finite energy. That is an extremely difficult problem, it seems, because you can have all these kinks and anti-kinks and so on, but let me move more slowly. Here is the picture of the Phi 4 model. W Phi has a well at Phi minus and Phi plus for the Phi. plus for the phi 4 model which is perhaps the most famous of this type phi minus is negative one phi plus is plus one these are non-degenerate minima which is important the sign-gordon model has infinitely many wells potential wells it's one minus cosine phi and in classical mechanics that's exactly the physical pendulum with the well-known phase point With the well-known phase portrait. Now, finite energy solutions have to converge to one of these potential wells. That's evident from the integral. You can have the trivial solutions, which are these stable vacuum solutions. They sit in the basis of the wells. The kinks connect the wells, and they are solutions of this second order ODE. If you write down for the If you write down for the Saint-Gordon model the second or the E, then X plays the role of time, and it is the law of motion of the pendulum, the physical pendulum. The face portrait here is the one of phi 4, so the nice double well I had on the previous slide. And the kinks are the red trajectories. Those are the heteroclinic orbits connecting the unstable equilibria at minus one and plus one. One and plus one. And here is the picture of a kink. It's tangent of x over root two. In the sign-Gordon model, you have infinitely many of these heteroclinic orbits, and you pick the one that connects zero to two pi. That would correspond in Seingordon to the unstable equilibrium. It's the motion of the pendulum, the position of the pendulum on top. And then in infinite time, you And then in infinite time you do this, and in negative infinite time you approach that unstable equilibrium. The symmetries of the problem are translation invariants and Lorentz transforms. As Fabio mentioned, the kings are examples of what one calls topological solitons, and they are the main players in this very difficult problem of soliton resolution. It seems out of reach for these one-dimensional. Seems out of reach for these one-dimensional problems. But I do want to mention, I should have written this on the slide. In the summer, we've seen some amazing progress by Gendersch, Jacek Schendersch and Anne Vallori. Gendersch is in Paris, Anne Vallori at MIT. They solve the solid resolution conjecture completely in the setting that Jochen Kriege described this morning at nine o'clock in Ben. In Ben. So you take an equivariant critical wave map, just like he had, and then Genders and Laurie can completely classify the evolution in any equivariance class and for any energy. So this is a global large data result without any restrictions on either geometry or topology. The only restriction is that they have to be equivariant. So there's the Variant. So there's the action of rotation symmetry commutes with the wavelength. So, what you would want the analog here in these classical field theories is to say that, and the picture is slightly misleading because this shows localized solitons. The kinks are precisely non-local. Nevertheless, there is a formal analog of this picture for the kink. You want to show that. For the king, he wants to show that everything decouples into a superposition of these moving kings plus radiation. That's this blue, this stuff here is supposed to be radiation. The first question one has to answer in this towards such a goal is what is the asymptotic stability of such an object? Of such an object, such a king. So if you perturb the king, you would want to show that it evolves as a boosted king, so that's a Lorentz transformed object, plus an evolution of possible discrete modes, exactly those that appeared in Fabio's talk. These are the eigenvalues of the linearized operator, which do not come from symmetry. So these are the gaps. Not come from symmetry, so these are the gap ones plus the radiation. And one way to turn off the Lorentz invariance and the translation that goes with it is to make a symmetry assumption. For example, the kink is odd, so if you use odd perturbations, the kink cannot move. On the spectral level, this means that your perturbation is perpendicular to the ground state of the linearized operator because the ground state comes from the translation symmetry. comes from the translational symmetry. It is the infinitesimal translational symmetry. And so exactly as in Fabio's talk, in some sense, it's not exactly like it, but you have such a Klein-Gordon equation with a potential. Potential comes from the kink, and then you have a coefficient times u squared plus Coefficient times u squared plus beta zero is a constant coefficient u cubed. You can add variable coefficient u cubed, et cetera. And in contrast to the 3D model, the 1D model has long range effects. And I try to explain what this means here. You can, if you take the cubic nonlinearity and you decide. linearity and u decays like one over root t which is the decay of one-dimensional free linear clangordon decays like one over root t in fabio's case the free decay would be one over t to the three halves which is integrable at infinity not only is one over root t not integrable at infinity but if you square it you're logarithmically divergent that's the one of a t factor that is exactly Factor. That is exactly the critical decay. Anything faster is short range. And so by now, there is a remarkable body of work. I will cite the literature in the next few slides. And it is based on initial work by Hayashi and Noamkin. And one approach would be to use L infinity decay. L infinity decay on the profile, this is or L infinity bounds rather on the profile. The profile appeared in Fabius. It's when you use the inverse of the linear evolution applied to the nonlinear solution. So you want to control that in L infinity. And then there are energy methods, vector fields, precisely the vector fields of which Fabio said correctly that you run into trouble when you add a potential. It's difficult. Difficult because what do you do if that Z field here, which is the generator of the Lorentz transforms, hits a potential or hits a factor, an alpha of x, a local coefficient on the right-hand side. If it hits that, you will get t times the derivative of the factor. And that t is incredibly difficult to work with. So you use normal forms to get rid of the quadratic terms, et cetera, et cetera. Of the quadratic terms, etc., etc. So, in addition to these difficulties, in 1D, in the 1D physical models, you encounter something quite remarkable, that not only can you have these eigenvalues, these gap egg values, but you can run into threshold resonances. Threshold resonances, the threshold means the edge of the continuous spectrum. Edge of the continuous spectrum. And in this 1D case, what is a threshold resonance? It just means that you have a zero energy solution, which is L infinity, but not L2. So if it were L2, zero would be an eigenvalue, but we precisely exclude that. And you will see in a later slide what the effect of such an object is. It's not just an inconvenience. Let me just say that there is this. Me just say that there is this common principle in the Schrodinger community. It is called Howland's razor. And Howland's razor says that you cannot detect the resonance on the level of the Hilbert space. It's impossible to see on the level of L2. You can only see it on the level of L P when P is not 2. For example, in a point-wise L P L Q L Q D K estimate, or you can see it in a Strichertz estimate. It in a Strichert's estimate because it destroys better decay properties of the evolution. The way to think, why is it called a resonance? Because if you take V equals zero, notice something remarkable, of course, the second derivative of a constant, it vanishes. So the way to think about that is if you do have a V, then at minus infinity and take V to be compactly supported, then at minus infinity. Support it then at minus infinity, you have a fundamental system, it is spanned by the constant one and x, and you have the same at plus infinity. Your solutions are minus phi double prime equals zero. That space is the linear span of one and x. So a resonance means if you come with one from the left and with a suitable constant from the right, they will match up in such a way that you get a C2 solution of. That you get a C2 solution of this equation. Okay? In other words, your continuous and the first derivative matches, these two conditions. And generically, this will not happen. You can adjust so that you're continuous, but then you will do this. You will have a kink, a different kind of kink. The first derivatives will be discontinuous. So generically, this happens, but for special potentials, they will match up perfectly. And you can, there is no general theory that. And you can, there is no general theory that says when this happens, you have to check on a case-by-case basis. Since my time is limited, I will not speak about positive gap eigenvalues because Fabio spent a long, his entire talk was dealing with this type of phenomenon and other issues, of course, the PDE issues that he described. So he mentioned Fermi-Golden rules and the coupling between the discrete mode, which doesn't decay on the linear level, and through On the linear level, and through resonances, you couple it to the continuous spectrum via the Sopher-Weinstein theory. Now, let me just go a little bit through the literature fast. So, there is the old result from the 80s on orbital stability of kinks by a Lapunov functional asymptotic stability of kinks for modified double wells, so not 5-4, which is wide open at the moment, but if you The moment, but if you completely flatten the wells, if you make, if you look at the Taylor expansion around the wells, the minima, and all coefficients vanish up to the 14th order, then Komich Kopilova showed asymptotic stability. So if you make the wells extremely flat, for the experts, the reason is simply that then all terms in the Duhamel expansion will be localized with nice. Will be localized with nicely decaying exponentially decaying coefficients up to the 14th order, where you can do some fairly brutal estimates because of the high decay of the 14th order. Asymptotic stability of kings, but only local in space. If you look at the space-time diagram, Kovalchik Matelmunis, in famous work, they looked at a cylinder about the t-axis. Of course, the characteristics all leave that cylinder, but Characteristics all leave that cylinder, but within that cylinder, they were able to show that you have asymptotic stability in energy space. In reality, they used an exponential weight, I think, or they just did say locally on an interval. Yes, their theorem is locally on an interval. And all of this is a very active field, so you can see that with Fanden Bosch, the same team expanded this theory greatly. This theory greatly. Multi-kink, so kink-anti-king pairs, and their characterization was obtained by Jendrush Laurie, whom I just mentioned, with a complete, amazing soliton resolution for equivariant wave maps. With Kovarczik, they were able to construct kink and take pairs and characterize them. Kong Chen at the University of Toronto with Liu and Liu remarkably applied inverse scattering. Remarkably applied inverse scattering theory for a complete multi-soliton asymptotic description of solutions to sine-Gordon. So in some sense, that's also a resolution of soliton, a solution to soliton resolution by inverse scattering because sine-gordon is completely integrable. However, phi4 is not completely integrable and therefore there has been this push to use To use other methods, do not rely on inverse scattering. And 20 years ago, Delore started with a study of Klein-Gordon with no potential on the left, with constant coefficients on the right. And the reason that this is so difficult is exactly that in 1D, you have these slow decay of long-range effects. And he was able to show that for small use of vacuum. So, vacuum perturbations of the vacuum, you have one of a root T decay and much more, much finer information on the asymptotic behavior, including logarithms in the phase, e to the i log time times the profile. Then, other authors added more complicated terms and removed the constancy assumptions on the coefficients because in sine-goordinate. Because in sine-Gordon and phi 4, you don't have constant coefficients. That is why. Surprisingly, the work of Lindlat, Lehman, and Soffer from last year only showed that a completely new phenomenon can arise. And you saw a form of it in Fabio's talk. When you consider a local quadratic term, one might think naively that a local term should be better than the non-local. Term should be better than the non-local. That's completely wrong. In fact, it introduces an instability mechanism, which you can see from this integral. So the integral comes by plugging in the asymptotics of the free problem into the quadratic nonlinearity. It produces this alpha x e to the 2i t over t. Put it in the Duhamel formula and look at the phase independence of S. If you take an S derivative, you get An s-derivative, you get 2 minus Japanese psi equals 0. 2 equals root of 1 plus psi squared, and 2 is the root of 4. So psi squared has to be 3, which means that psi is plus minus root 3. Those are the two unique directions. In Fabio's talk, you get an entire light cone. He had an analogous condition in 3D. That was his. That was his bad term. And what happens is: what does this resonance destroy? It destroys the one over root T linear decay. If the Fourier transform, if you want to, this is some, well the analogy is very bad that I'm about to make. So Fabio had a Fermi golden rule, which meant the non-vanishing of a Fourier transform of some expression. Transform of some expression in some very weak analogy. Here, if the Fourier transform does not vanish, then you have a resonance phenomenon and you have a log t slowdown as compared to the linear decay. And the picture in T and X looks like this. You have the two rays where the slowdown occurs. And very near it, there is, we understand now. We understand now, it wasn't in the original paper, very near it. You still will have, of course, remnants of that. If, on the other hand, that Fourier transform does vanish, then you can remove this quadratic local nonlinearity via normal forms. Another work that appeared last year was in finite time for this incredibly famous Phyforgi. Famous Phi Four problem, which is not completely interpretable. So Delore and Massmouthi showed up to times, this is not precise here, epsilon minus four. Actually, it was epsilon minus four plus a little bit. So think of epsilon minus 3.999. You can get as close as four as you want, but not to four. Then they were able to prove what one might expect, similar to the formulas in Fabio's talk. So you have the discrete mode. Talk. So you have the discrete mode, it decays via non-linear coupling, and then you have the free field decays at some rate too. Jermaine and Fabio Poseteri, Pierre-Jama, Fabio Poseteri, all names we've heard today, of course Fabio just spoke, they have a general theory for a Klein-Gordon with a potential on the left and this localized quadratic or for. Localized quadratic, or for that matter, non-localized quadratic. So they allow general coefficients alpha, either they tend to zero or just constants. The constant case is if you have different constants at the ends, it's more challenging, of course. And with I joined this whole enterprise, so with Lindplatt Leumann and Avi Soffer, we took the phenomenon that Lindplatt Lee, The phenomenon that Lindblad, Leuman, and Soffer had discovered, namely this surprising slowdown along the rates, the rays plus minus root three over two. If you have a local coefficient in front of the quadratic nonlinearity, we revisited this for a potential on the left. And now you run into the exact same issue with the distorted Fourier transform that I don't have to explain anymore because Fabio. I don't have to explain anymore because Fabio did it. If the distorted Fourier transform of the coefficient times phi squared at the bad, at the time resonant frequencies, that's what this is. In the language of space-time resonances, this is a time resonance. You cannot integrate by parts in time. You would be dividing by zero. So this happens if and only if that does not vanish. And amazingly, And amazingly, this physical Sein-Gordon problem, for it, this does vanish. So it is better behaved, as you will see in a moment. What drives the analysis in my paper with Lindblatt, Leumen and Sopher is this estimate that I put down there. And it is an expression of effect I mentioned before, what the resonance actually destroys. So what detail So, what d tilde, Japanese d tilde, is exactly like Fabio had it, one root one plus h, the Schrodinger operator, the one is the mass term in Klein Gordon. And so you have this free evolution, albeit localized to small frequencies. H is a Schrödinger operator with a threshold at zero. You project onto the continuous spectrum, and if you subtract the free The free decay, which is exactly asymptotic to e to the i pi over 4 e to the i t root t, times the projection onto the resonance function phi. Now, for the purists, you might think resonance function, you cannot project on it because it's not in L2 true. But if what first of all, what does phi tensor phi g mean? It means phi multiplied by the integral of phi times g. Okay, this is Okay, this is a tensorial notation for the projection. That is okay because g is not just in L1, it's better than L1. So you can make sense of this perfectly. And if you subtract this contribution, which gives you the free type decay, then you end up with better local decay. You end up, you're better by one power of time. Okay? So, in particular, if you have no resonance, this produces. This projection onto the resonance disappears, and you have, you can just remove it. Phi tens of phi is zero. And then it tells you that the local decay without a resonance is better. It is automatically one over t to the three-half. And that is a perfect manifestation of why the generic case, in the sense of no zero energy resonance, is better behaved. Is better behavior. And to prove this, you can't use the distorted Fourier transform because, in the presence of a resonance at zero, which everybody had to exclude for that reason, I suppose, the distorted Fourier transform has a discontinuity at zero. Whereas in the non-resonant, in the generic case, the distorted Fourier transient one dimension vanishes at zero. It vanishes because it is proportional to the, at zero, it's proportional. Proportional to the at zero is proportional to the transmission coefficient at zero, which vanishes. Now, analysis of long range effects due to the constant cubic term, albeit with a potential. So there is the work of Germain Hani and Walsh. We have heard Ampierre and Hani's names mentioned today already. These names mentioned today already in Colossor. Delore and Masmoudi remove the potential by applications of the wave operators, which Fabi also mentioned. They're the intertwining operators that conjugate the free, so zero potential case with the potential case. All of these aforementioned works, so the Shemahani Wall, Shema Puseteri, Uset, Jem Pusatari, etc. Et cetera, including De Luama Smoothi, they exclude zero energy resonances. Everybody excludes them. And how do you do this? How do Deluama Smoothie do this? Because in Phi IV, you do have a zero energy resonance, as you have in St. Gordon. Well, what helps you for Phi IV is that the ground state is even, the internal mode, like in Fabio's case, is odd, and therefore the resonance function is even. And therefore, the resonance function is even because they all have to be perpendicular. Of course, you can reach perpendicularity without the strong symmetry, but it happens because the potential is symmetric. So you have even, odd, even. And if your initial perturbation is odd, which makes sure the kink doesn't move, it stays stationary, then you're automatically perpendicular to the threshold resonance function. That is why the Lohmas Moody are able to kill the resonance function. However, for Singora, function. However, for sign-gordon the ground state is odd, even sorry, and the resonance function is odd. Even ground state, odd resonance. If you make odd perturbations, you are in the space of the resonance. You cannot kill it. But with Nionas Luhrmann, we proved the following theorem in the presence of the resonance. We showed that if you perturb the kink by a sufficiently smooth, sufficiently small small small small small small A sufficiently smooth, sufficiently decaying small perturbation, then you remain close to the kink in the uniform sense and you decay like one of a root T. And moreover, we have a much more precise statement, including a description of the phase with a logarithmic factor, but it is less explicit than saying the t to the minus epsilon to the minus four works, sorry, the long but finite time result of the lower muscle. Finite time result of the lower mass moving. There is a reason that I will get to in a moment. So, as I say here, sign-gordon linearized operator does have an odd threshold resonance. And so we make odd perturbations, which I hope I said, but it's written odd. Otherwise, the king starts to move. That's a whole different project. We haven't started that yet. So you make odd perturbations, and therefore, you have to confront this resonance. And so, for example, Resonance. And so, for example, the distorted Fourier transit, we immediately have a problem because it's discontinuous at zero energy, etc. However, surprisingly, we kill the potential. We don't worry about the potential because we remove it by some trickery. And that trickery is from the forbidden section of the library, like in Harry Potter's. In Harry Potter. It's called the supersymmetric factorization. It's an amazing thing that, of course, we haven't discovered and it's been used before. However, nobody seems to have used it in this setting in the dynamic context. However, with Krieger, with Joachim, who gave the first talk, and Miao, as Jochim explained, we used this in the context of equivariant wave mass. So there we did. Wave mass. So there we did use supersymmetry dynamically. And the first people who did this, to my knowledge, are Krieger and Mia, okay, in the wavemax, the covariant wavemax. So here you get a very special potential. Otherwise, this wouldn't really work. This is a Persian-Teller potential. And it factors for good reason into dd star. The reason being that the ground state of minus Laplace, minus two such squared x plus. plus minus 2 such squared x plus 1 is an explicit function. It is either such or such squared, I forget. I should remember, I forget. Set squared, in fact. No, such, such. And it happens to be the unique up to non-constant multiples, first order differential operator that annihilates the ground state of this Persian telepotential of the Persian Taylor potential of the minus two set squared plus one potential is this d. d is del x minus tangi x. It's unique up to non-constant multiples. And then of course, because the operator is non-negative, it should have the form dd star. And indeed, you check that it is dd star. So there is no miracle there, but the miracle has more to do with d star d. If you reverse these, the order and you already find this trick. Already find this trick appearing in the famous paper of Dave Trubovich from the 70s, in section 6, or wherever they do this, they reverse the order in a spectral context. Then the potential drops out and you have this free potential, the free operator. So here is what we then do. We take our linearized sign-gordon PDE, which is still written on the top of the slide. We apply D star on the left and the right. left and the right we apply d star then you obtain the the pde written below where d star now hits the right hand side so you introduce a new dependent variable which is w equal to d star u and and it solves a better it has a better left hand side and a worse right hand side the right hand side is more complicated so this is what's written here w is t u and of course you have to go back to you and there is a Back to you. And there is a very good reason. It's almost obvious that you just do this by integration, of course, and you have this beautiful integral operator with exponentially localized kernel. And everything can be done in a completely explicit algebraic fashion. So you obtain this new PDE, it has quadratic cubic terms, and you now have to deal with this non-local operator, but albeit exponentially. But albeit exponentially decaying kernel. So you have a nicer left-hand side and a more complicated non-local right-hand side. Now, never mind what's written here with i tilde dxw. That's how you can rephrase the, and that's actually extremely important that you do this, that you integrate by parts in this inversion operator I. So you isolate the correct shape of all these coefficients. The correct shape of all these coefficients, alpha one, alpha two, alpha three, it turns out that alpha one is the worst. It could potentially lead to the logarithmic slowdown, which was discovered, you know, by Lindblad, Lehrmann, and Sopher. And that would be a disaster. It would destroy the theorem. However, the alpha one, it would possibly destroy the theorem. That's a tongue-in-cheek comment I just made. I take it back, but possibly, who knows? but possibly who knows and alpha one is completely explicit it's three such squared tan three such cubed ten squared you ask mathematically for example to compute the fourier transform if you're crazy you do it yourself and you get this formula and you see that root three is a zero of the fourier transform plus minus root three because mathematically it will give you a factor of three minus psi squared vanishes and Vanishes. And because of this vanishing, you can then do a normal form. That is this 2 minus Japanese psi to the minus 1. So what looks like a time resonance is in fact not a time resonance. You can integrate by parts by dividing by 2 minus Japanese psi. And this is still a Schwartz function because alpha 1 hat vanishes where the denominator vanishes. And you pass to the And you pass to the new variable which consists of v plus bvv. So that's how you do the normal form. And then you're left with a cubic nonlinearity. Okay, you face long-range effects. You face the logarithmic factor in the phase. I can't really go into details, but we do manage to follow the blueprint, which I suppose goes. Which I suppose goes back to a Yashinovian, but has to be refined and had to be refined many times over. And we have slow growth of L2 norms, including the hardest one, which involves the boost of Lorentz transforms, Lorentz boosts, and then the L infinity bounds on the profile, which involves stationary phase. Now, how am I doing on time? How am I doing on time? You're already over time. So, my last slide is simply. Of course, we've been thinking about Phi 4. It's extremely difficult. We shall see. There are other possible approaches based on the supersymmetry in the dynamical constant. For example, cubic focusing Klein-Gordon equations with a local solid. Okay, thank you very much. Solution. Okay, thank you very much. Yeah. Thank you, Way, for the very nice talk, very extremely interesting talk. Any questions? Any remarks? Yeah, let me start one. I found that this, all this is, so you talk about the summary results for the general potential, right? For the bi-state. By stable potential. Now, but for this, but in your proofs, it's very important you have all this explicit formulas, right? For the alpha and the beta and this. I will be wondering how general is your result for the bi-stable potential. If you change it to another bi-stable potential, Were your results true? Well, that's a very good question. You see, we have limited experience with when this works and when it doesn't work. It seems to be very special and yet not restricted to the completely integral. But it is, I completely agree with you. The algebraic aspects are miraculous. Are miraculous. Yeah. And we rely heavily on them. However, in Phi 4, you will see the same kind of things. You have the same explicit expressions, but much more complicated. You rely on the same... We saw this, that you have similar phenomena with the exception of maybe two enormously important differences, which destroy a naive attempt to generalize. A naive attempt to generalize this 254. The first one is what Fabio mentioned: that you have an internal mode you have to couple to the continuous spectrum and so on. The second one is that you cannot do what's written here in red. You cannot divide by, you do have a time resonance. You can't divide by 2 minus Japanese psi. Because if you compute the alpha 1 for phi 4, it doesn't vanish. Or phi 4, it doesn't vanish at plus minus root 3. Unless there is some miracle that we're overlooking, some transformation, whatever, some different way to organize, you don't have this vanishing. And yet everything continues to be explicit. All right? So the true scope, to answer your question, is the true scope of this method yet needs to be explored, but it is not a general. But it is not a general theory like apply a wave operator and then the potential goes away. And that was very important for us. We felt that we were staying much closer to the problem, the actual problem. And it seemed to us to be a mistake to try and apply general methods. Suppose we were to use the distorted Fourier transform for the linearized Sein-Gordon. Then I bet you that you would want to use the known explicit shape of the Fourier transform. Explicit shape of the Fourier basis. If you don't rely on that, I'm suspicious that you could remove the supersymmetry. You just pretend that it's some general, if you just rely on general facts about the distorted Fourier transform, I doubt that you will succeed so easily. However, you will have to use anyway. So, one place that you could never avoid is this here. You would have to go back. Here, you would have to go back here and use the distorted Fourier transform for the partial Taylor potential and check that the distorted Fourier transform of alpha phi cubed at plus minus root three is zero. And you can do that. This had been known. Lehmann knew about this from his previous work. And De Loerma Smoody have to rely. So, what do they at some point they have? They have to do a calculation, but as I just said, in 5.4, it this fails. If you check this in 5.4, it will fail. Okay? Yeah, very interesting. Very, very intriguing. Any more questions, remarks from the audience? Yeah, it seems no. And so let me thank all the speakers in the second session of this morning and all the speakers in the morning for the very interesting talk. And I hope to see you tomorrow at nine o'clock.
