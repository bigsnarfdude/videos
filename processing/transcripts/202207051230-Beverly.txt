Have a captive audience with your skill set. And what I want to do with this talk is really just share a lot of the challenges that I've had as a fire researcher trying to solve some problems that I haven't been able to solve. Some of them we sort of solved a little bit. And maybe as you're listening to these issues, it's going to tweak something. You're going to think of a methodology or an approach that might be suitable for these problems and this kind of data. And then we can talk lots more about it. So I'm an assistant professor at the University of Alberta. At the University of Alberta. I was a former research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service, a federal government that does fire research. Prior to that, when I was a student, I worked as a wildland firefighter. I was an initial attack crew leader in Ontario. I did that for six years and I've got the smoke damage lungs to prove it. So I have some experience on the ground with wildfire. Did fight fire in the US and Montana and Oregon and out here in Alberta or in Alberta, in the Yukon, never made it to VC as a firefighter. To VC as a firefighter. But I've been in this part of the world on the ground with fire, but also I've been doing research for quite a few years. Let's see if we're. There we go. And this is a study I did quite a while ago when I worked at the Canadian Forest Service. And Paul, you may remember this because in 2009, I went to Toronto to present this to the ICLR. And I had just wrapped up a study on wildfire evacuations in Canada. And this was documenting for the first time the free. Documenting for the first time the frequency and locations of these evacuations across the country nationally. We went back to 1980 and then the study wrapped up in 2007. It was published a couple years later, not until 2011. But yeah, I was presenting on this, you know, and it's not that long ago. Well, maybe for some of you students, that seems like a long time ago. But for those of us who have been working for many, you know, it's 12 years ago or so that this was published. And at the time, what I was saying. Time, what I was saying strikes in really a stark contrast to what we are dealing with today. So, at the time, over those 30 plus years of data, well, almost 30 years of data, we had 547 documented evacuation events in the country. A grand total over going back to 1980, less than 500 houses had been destroyed by wildfire. Just over 200,000 people had been directly impacted with the vaccine. Had been directly impacted with evacuations at that point, and so the median number per year-you know, a few thousand Canadians were being impacted directly by wildfire. The median number of homes lost, too. And these were fires that, for the most part, were causing these evacuations or fires that were coming in close proximity to the communities within three kilometers. And a small percentage actually were caused by smoke. And smoke can cut off access, transportation. And so, you sometimes have to evacuate because of smoke or because vulnerable populations in that entire. Vulnerable populations. In that entire time period, I was only able to find one documented direct civilian fatality from a wildfire in Canada. So, the story I was saying, you know, back in 2009, I was talking to the ICLR and reporting on the results of this study was that, you know, the fires are not having a huge impact on Canadians. You can see they're distributed right across the country. In maritime provinces, it happens all over BC, up north, of course. Course, but they're rare events for the most part. And if you compare that to, say, regular house fires in urban areas, I've seen different statistics on this. Paul, you probably know, but one of them I heard was about there's about 24,000 house fires in Canada every year, right? So you got to keep those numbers into perspective. But what I was saying at the time is that, well, you know, these are, you know, they're a problem that can cause issues. And we had had Kelowna at this point. Kelowna at this point. And that was what prompted actually this study: in the aftermath of Kelowna, somebody started asking, well, how often does this happen? But still, at the end of the day, you're like, okay, well, we've got a fair bit of data and this is the story. Well, since then, if you look at the data for 2011 to 2018, which is what the Canadian Forest Service, after I left, they maintained this database, not quite probably consistent with the data that I put together, but nonetheless, there is a time series that they have online. Is a time series that they have online, and you can look. And it's, you know, in the last eight years, there were more people evacuated than in those previous 31 years. And so, you know, you can't, it's difficult to reconcile. I mean, as a person who deals with data, as the years have gone by, I've said, well, you know, it's only been four years, it's only been five years, or, you know, it seems like things have changed, but is that enough data for me to tell if I look at the whole time series? I'm still looking at, you know, this core data. Core data. So, have these major impacts, these major fires, these major fire seasons that have happened in this recent last 10 years or so, is that part of a trend? Is that the realization of climate change impacts that have been predicted? It certainly seems consistent with those predictions. Or are these just freak outliers? Right? And we should be asking that question. Of course, most people don't, and most people in the fire community, most fire researchers don't, because it's better to just keep talking. Because it's better to just keep talking the narrative, the sky is falling, and this is, you know, it's, and we've got the data. And look, there was Fort McMurray and 90,000 people were evacuated. But on the day Fort McMurray burned, it could have been a community the size of Lytton. And I might not be here. We might be having this workshop right now if you hadn't had that event. And when you look at some of the characteristics of these events, one of the key things is the extreme winds that were recorded. And to give you an idea of what And to give you an idea of what 72 kilometer an hour winds are, if you've got, say, 70, 63 to 74 kilometer an hour winds, that's when lawn furniture and garbage cans start to fly. And if you get up to 75 kilometer an hour winds, that's where you start to get damage to the exterior of structures. And if you've got 100 kilometer an hour winds like the slave lake fire in 2011, that can uproot entire trees. So this is not a typical situation when you have those kinds of Situation when you have those kinds of extreme winds. And certainly for Slave Lake, Fort McMurray, and Litlinis is well documented of these really extreme winds drove things. And, you know, and depending on the sizes of the communities, whether it's 1,000 or 90,000 or 7,000 people, you've got numbers of evacuees and corresponding damages to homes. And these are some of the, you can find different statistics on what the damages were, but these are just the insured damages that are referenced in various places that I've found. So you get a feel for the So, you get a feel for, yeah, these can be extremely damaging events, but they're not happening every day, right? They're happening every sort of four to eight years, it seems. And where are they happening? Well, this is the question, right? Could you have predicted any of these events? And in any community, no matter what you do, if there's flammable vegetation and you have 100 kilometer an hour winds and a fire ignition, is there much that you can do to prevent what's going to play out? To prevent what's going to play out? I mean, these are tough questions to reconcile. Instead, like a lot of the conversation, a lot of the narrative is just feeding this idea that, you know, we're on this trajectory and we've got to do something about it. And the specifics of the data often get overlooked. On the days that those fires happened, this is what the fire weather index looked like. So Neil talked about that we have a danger rating system. This is basically an indicator of how dry the fuels are and the potential for fire behavior. It's based solely on weather, so it's not taking into account what the On weather, so it's not taking into account what the fuels are, but it's saying based on the weather station observations, things were extreme in large regions of the country on the days that those fires happened, right? And so if you look at Slave Lake in 2011, Slave Lake, you know, these are human-caused fires, so is Lytton. Those ignitions could have happened in other places and you would have gotten the same result, right? So there's this extremely stochastic. This extremely stochastic process of there being a condition like this, and it could happen anywhere. You just happen to get ignition in the right place at the right time, oriented in the right place in terms of the wind direction and in terms of the receptor, the community, and you get these events. But it could just as easily have not been Fort McMurray that day. It could have been another community, Sawan Hills, and that would have been 3,000 people, a lot fewer homes lost, a lot fewer. Lost a lot fewer insurable damages. And there's nothing about those communities that are causing this. The fire does not care how big the community is. These communities are all located in fire-prone areas, right? Fires have always happened there. This isn't a new phenomenon that we're getting fires around Slave Lake or Fort McMurray or Kelowna. There's nothing about the communities themselves or their characteristics that are driving this. The fire process is just doing its thing, and it may or may not hit. And it may or may not hit a location where you can get these extreme financial losses. But in every one of these cases, it could have been a community of 100 people or not at all. Right? So just keep in mind just how random that entire situation is. Okay. What it is in sort of my understanding of the risk literature is it's what's called the perfect storm. So the fuels have to be available. And so that's that map that shows the big blob. That's that map that shows the big blob of red that tells us the fuels are available. You can think of moisture as sort of a container that encapsulates the fuels and takes them and takes them away so they're not available anymore. It's like if you had propane gas or something housed in a tank, it's not available to burn, right? You open the tank, it's now it's available. That's what moisture does with fuels. The fuels are there, they don't go away. Moisture changes day to day and it makes them available. So these events happen when the fuels are available, but they're brought. When the fuels are available, but they're broadly available over huge areas, right? And then you need an ignition. And we can look at patterns of ignitions, like lightning tends to happen in certain parts of the landscape and people tend to start fires in certain parts of the landscape. And you can look at those patterns. But even if you have high concentrations of ignitions, all I need is one. I don't need a high-density ignition area to get one of those perfect storms. And then I have to have the fuel and the The fuel and the receptor, the structure, the asset, or the value that I care about, oriented in the right direction with the wind blowing and the ignition in the right place, right? So, move that ignition to the other side of the house and you don't have a problem, right? And move the fuels to the other side of the house and keep the ignition there and you don't have a problem. So, this is this perfect storm, right? It's when you've got this confluence of many factors. None of them are particularly devastating on their own, but you put them all together and you end up with, you know. Together, and you end up with the devastating home losses and financial impacts. And it's also been characterized as a gray swan. So you've probably heard of Caleb's Black Swan. So the Grey Swan, though, is this idea that there's these known events. We know this can happen. We just don't know the likelihood that it's going to happen. And we can specify the outcome. If the house burns down, how much is the house worth? That's going to be the impact, presumably. There could be other indirect impacts that I can't quantify as easily. Direct impacts that I can't quantify as easily. But if the structure burns, I could say, well, that's worth a certain amount of money or insured for a certain amount of money. But I can't specify the probabilities of this happening. I can't. And if anybody's telling you that you can, just wait at the end of the presentation and you'll understand why you can't. So when you've got this incomplete knowledge, that traditional risk construct of likelihood times impact doesn't work, right? So that construct out of engineering is. So, that construct of engineering is great if you can do lots of experiments and really characterize what those probabilities are. And the example I always give is if you have a piece of building material and you go subject it to some load and then it snaps. And you can do that experiment over and over and over again and say, you know, I test this many logs and I do these tests and it's always the same, you know, 99.7% of the time it can bear the load. And then that's going to be my likelihood of it failing. And then if I know what that means structurally as an impact, that's a great way. As an impact, that's a great way to have you know, it's pretty confidence about the probability and whatnot. We cannot do that with these processes, right? I cannot assign probabilities with any degree of confidence. This is such a random process, right? Anyone who says that you can assign probabilities, there's issues. Now, there's also some nuances about the fuels themselves. So I said, well, you got to have fuel and the fuel's got to be there, but the actual characteristics of the fuel, not all vegetation is highly flammable. Vegetation is highly flammable. It's not all the same, it's different. So, you've heard mention, you know, grass or, you know, high-density conifer areas, deciduous stands on the end, you know, aspen stands are generally considered not flammable and they can burn in the spring if it's really dry on the ground, but the fire is not going to get into the crowns. And it's that crown fire process that rains embers down and ignites structures and causes a fire to move into a community. So, you really care about those crown fires and the fuels that can support crown fire. Fires and the fuels that can support crown fires. And we actually understand the science around this pretty good. And it's we've got great equations for estimating all this entire process. And all you need to know is the amount of fuel on the surface, because that's where the fire is going to start. And if it's burning intense enough, it can then transition up to the crown. And now it's got access to all that extra fuel in the crowns. And the amount and compactness of the fuels in the crowns, whether they're separated or thinned out in the stand, if you separate those crowns, it's harder for the fire to, it does this sort of end. To it, does this sort of endothermic, exothermic chain reaction where it's preheating and then it's igniting, then it's preheating and it's igniting, and that happens faster and easier if the fuels are close together, right? So, the structural properties of the fuels tell us how hot it's going to burn under a given set of conditions. So, when do these disasters happen? Well, the weather's pretty homogeneous. It's going to be hot, dry, and windy, and it's going to have been hot, dry, and windy for a while, a couple weeks probably, right? So, it's always the same. You don't have to worry about the weather. The weather is homogeneous. It's going to be extreme. It's going to be extreme. It's going to be one of those big red blobs. That's when communities burn, right? So, what's changing things is the fuel, the structure of the fuels. And that's why we do five smart fuel treatments is to go and separate the crown from the ground, that crown base height. If you can separate it, makes it harder from the fire to jump from the surface to the crowns. And you space out the trees and you thin them out to break up that compactness of the crown fuels. Easy enough, right? The problem is we don't really have. Enough, right? The problem is we don't really have these measurements for most forests because nobody's going to go out there and measure all the forests. And so, you know, we use these to standard types. Well, there's black spruce and there's lodgebowl pine and there's Douglas fir, Ponarosa pine, and there's aspen. And we know that some of these are a problem in terms of they are a hazard. They're a potential source of harm and others are not, right? And from those fuel types, we can calculate actual intensities using predictive equations. Predictive equations. And so we know also the threshold where once a fire reaches a certain intensity, fire suppression is going to fail. And it's actually pretty low threshold. So this top row here, you can have ground crews putting those fires out. It gets over 2,000 kilowatts per meter. You're going to need air support. And very quickly, that's going to fail at about 4,000 kilowatts per meter. And once you get up to these high-intensity crown fires, we don't stop those fires. You can do some. Stop those fires. You can do some indirect attack by igniting locations in front of a fire and trying to sort of pull it and direct it with another fire effectively, or burning out the fuels. So, there's some things you can do, but for the most part, you're exceeding that sort of your overwhelming suppression once you get into these high-intensity fires. All right, so that's a lot of background. I want to set the context. And so, now I want to talk about some of the models and analysis that's been done to try to characterize where we can expect fires across the landscape. We can expect fires across the landscape in a strategic way. So, even though I just told you, it's not possible to predict which community is going to burn next. It's very likely that in the next four to eight years, we're going to have a community heavily impacted by fire in Canada. I can't tell you where it's going to be, right? You might say, well, it's probably going to be in Alberta or BC because that's where the other ones were. Maybe it's possible in Eastern Canada. So take a dart and throw it at a map, right? That doesn't stop people from trying to understand. Doesn't stop people from trying to understand. Well, where can we expect fires? Because we want to do mitigation, because that's the thing to do. We're going to get ahead of it. We're not just going to respond. We're going to do mitigation. We're going to thin the forest. We're going to design the landscape so it's not flammable. We need to know where fires, where we can expect fires. And there's these variable factors that I've been mentioning. So there's that fuel moisture. It's changing day to day and over short time periods. Wind speed and direction that's going to drive that rate of spread and the direction of the fire. Those ignition agents, lightning people. I mean, I don't know what. I mean, I don't know what those agents are. I don't know where that's happening day to day. I can look at the past, but the past also happened under a different landscape and under a different climate. So I'm looking at past data, trying to make it fit today's context, or if it's a projection of the future into the future. There's just a whole lot of variability within a fire season on this side. But then on the other side, there's things that we know that are pretty stable, right? And so I know where the fuels are. I know where those conifer fuels are. I know where that black spruce is. Fuels are. I know where that black spruce is. I know where that large pole pine is. I can map it. I know where the values are. I know where the houses are. I know where the communities are. I also understand operational capabilities. I can know those things with a fair degree of confidence. So there's these two sides. And early work was about incorporated just, you know, a little bit of the left side, mostly the right side. So threat rating came about in sort of the late 90s, and this was actually worked on in BC by Brad Hawks and Judy Beck. Judy Beck. And so they said, well, just you just have this grid of static overlays, and you'll characterize it in terms of the things you know, like ignition patterns, fire behavior. That's just using those equations applied to those fuel types under extreme situation and saying, well, there's my potential fire behavior, that intensity. And then I know where my values are. And I know suppression capabilities, things like how long it's going to take me to respond to the fire or the availability of water or what else. It would just stack these things up. And then you'll get this overall rating of threat. And that's going to tell you where to focus your mitigation. And that's going to tell you where to focus your mitigation efforts or response or whatever. The main problem with that approach is that each of those pixels that you characterize are effectively detached from their surroundings. You're characterizing them based on what's in the pixel. And so if you had a point on an island and a point on the mainland, they have the same characteristics. They end up with the same level of threats, even though we know the fire can't get to the island. And this is actually a national park in Alberta. National Park in Alberta, Elk Island National Park, and there's all the spruce on these islands because nothing, no fire can't get to these islands. And so there's these remnant like spruce that's very different from the surrounding aspen landscape. So we see that all the time. So there was this detached spatial analysis that was problematic. And the solution was, well, we'll just spread fires. So we'll go to simulation modeling instead of these independent assessments and we'll start growing fires and we'll use the equation. Growing fires, and we'll use the equations. And Niels 20, I actually put these slides together before your presentation, but we both point out these underlying empirical data that are used to do these calculations of spread. And in the case of, this is C2, this is the black spruce you showed lodgepole pine. But you're talking about in one case, 13 observations for the fuel consumption measurements and 48 observations of fires. And just to put that in context, there has been thousands. That in context, there have been thousands of fires in this fuel type in Alberta alone in the years since 1992 when this report came out. But they're using this little data set of 48 fires. You can see the curve goes way beyond the data, which is always a concern. And the same thing on the bottom, like that Neil was pointing out is that for a given kind of indicator of rate of spread, there for the initial spread index, you see that, yeah, it can. Actually, see that, yeah, it could vary by 50% your estimate, right? So these models are imperfect and they're limited, but still, it was seen as better than those static overlays where you just give a pixel a rating and then stack it up. And then there's a lot of subjectivity into how you weight things. So this was the solution. And it just happened to come around when we had all this computational power to do this with computer modeling in a very sophisticated way. And I used to show this graph like when I was using these. To show this graph, like when I was using these models back in 2005, 2004. I said, Well, you know, you're bringing that spatial context back to the cell by growing lots of fires and doing simulations. And so it's a Monte Carlo simulation process, right? So it's that independent realization of the next year. It's not simulating into the future. It's just like, well, what's going to happen? And so you grow these fires using these imperfect models, and then you wipe it clear, and you do it again. And you're just re-simulating the same outcome. Same outcome, and then you stack them together, and then you just look at the number of times of a given pixel burned in relation to the number of iterations, and that's your burn probability. Right? So, it seemed like a wonderful approach. And I started using this, and this study was started, yeah, 2004. The report came out in 2007 as Vanderhoof area. And we were looking at changing the fuels to reflect mountain pine beetle and then changing the weather in the model to reflect climate change scenarios. And so, we had pre-mountain pine beetle and then. Had pre-mountain pine beetle, and then in the top right, that was in the red stage mountain pine beetle, and then in the gray stage, and then in the gray stage with climate change. And so, we were trying to explore the same questions that people are trying to explore today with modeling. What happens when I change the weather, rerun the simulations, and what happens? And in my experience working with this model, though, it just became apparent that there's just a lot of guesswork in making the model work right and how. And making the model work right, and how you use the weather, and how you parameterize and calibrate the model. And I discovered you couldn't really replicate your maps. So, even if you did two versions that were identical in terms of all the inputs, you ended up with slightly different, in fact, they could be different by as much as 30%. So, if you're running scenarios, and is it because you change the weather that it's different? Is it because you change the fuels, or is it just because the model doesn't work very well? And just to be clear, this is one of the And just to be clear, this is one of the most popular approaches in North America for estimating fire risk. And I'm talking about a model used here in Canada. It was developed by the federal government. I didn't develop it. I just used it. There's a similar one in the US. It has all the same issues. So this is the dominant paradigm ideology around how to estimate risk, and you can't replicate these maps. And the way they started to fix that is that they just fixed the ignitions. So the ignitions aren't really stochastic from when they run these scenarios. When they run these scenarios, they hold the ignitions constant and then allows them to hone in on, well, then it's the weather or it's the fuels that cause the change. But the problem is, if you redid the study, you might get a different answer. But they don't tell you that. And it's just become the well-entrenched approach to doing things. Just ignore that. So I started asking, of course, does it work? And it just so happens that in the second area where I did the modeling and published it in 2009, a couple years later, one of the communities in that study area burned Slave Lake. Burned slave lake. And if you look at the burn probability map for this region using the Monte Carlo simulations that integrates everything, ignition patterns and weather and vegetation. There's nothing about this map that would make you think that Slave Lake should be a priority for anything. I would be worried about Swan Hills. But Swan Hills hasn't experienced the fire. Slave Lake did. And, you know, and it's not surprising, right? Because this is the reality. Because this is the reality, the reality realization. Whereas to make this map, I ran 25,000 independent realizations of what could happen. So there's nothing, why would you expect what's going to happen next year or in the next 10 years to reflect a pattern that took 25,000 runs to figure out, right? It doesn't make any sense, but that's what we're using to make decisions. And yeah, this actually had 125,000 simulated fires. Yeah, so this I Yeah, so this, I, you know, I was concerned about this, started talking about it. When you looked at where the fires happened in the years that followed that study, you could see that there's the burned areas were distributed across all of the burn probability values. And actually, there was more burned area in the very low burn probability than in the extreme. So I started talking about this actually in 2016 at the Wildland Fire Canada conference. Neil was using the model operationally. So he looked at his maps and we did a study. His maps. And we did a study that was published a couple of years ago where we looked at all four study areas, my original one, and then four that Neil did. And two of our study areas included two of those big disaster events, Slave Lake and Fort McMurray. And those are the burn probability maps estimated before those fires. There's nothing about those maps that would have raised any red flags of concern, right? And this is using the probabilistic approach and the most sophisticated modeling and the most sophisticated understanding of. Modeling and the most sophisticated understanding of the most technologically advanced way we could possibly do it. So, this caused me to rethink a lot of what I was doing around these assessments. And I went back to this other approach that I had used at the community scale, which is just to look at transmission distances of where fire can transmit to. And instead of spreading fires from every possible direction and, you know, 125,000 different simulations of fires, I just said, well, I'm just going to stand at this location and look out around me. So it's just a moving window. So just look out around me. Window, they'll just look out around me and say, Does there fuels there that are capable of transmitting fire to me? I don't have to grow fires to get that spatial context, right? It's not as interesting, though. And researchers don't like doing things in simplistic ways. And I had one fire to test that out on. And so this was the pre-fire slave lake estimates of those exposure areas where embers could reach. And then the red, in the red is the, this is the shadow is where the fire actually burned in, and the red is where the structures that were. Burned in, and the red is where the structures that were lost, and so it was not bad, but that was one data point. So, we decided to run it across the whole landscape, but you have to do it a little more coarse when you do it that way. So, if you just take a fuel grid and you say, well, you know, here I care about that particular pixel there, the white one. Now, there's 80 pixels around me if I'm using the provincial fuel grid. I'm just going to classify which ones can transmit fire to me and which ones can't. So, it's binary. And then I just calculate exposure as the sum of the pixels that. The sum of the pixels that are hazardous that can transmit to me divided by the total number. It's just a really simple moving window. You can calculate it in minutes, and it requires very little expertise compared to a burn probability map that usually takes a year or more to do. And even for a small area, it's probably going to cost around $100,000. And then we subjected this to the same test as the burn probability modeling, overlaid fires. And sure enough, most of the area burn happens in the high exposure areas. Happens in the high exposure areas. And this is a deterministic univariate assessment that ignores weather, ignition patterns, and everything. And yet it outperforms the really complex model. Right. So, and this is work that Neil, Liz Chapman, and I published last year. And of course, in the review process, everybody wanted to make it more complicated and said, well, why don't, you know, you're not taking into account the nearness of the pixels. So certainly close by hazardous fuels. So, certainly, close by hazardous fuels must be more concerning than far away. So, why don't you weight those close by pixels heavier? So, we tried that. Why don't you weight it according to the crown fuel load, the characteristics of those fuels that we were talking about? Yeah, we tried that. Why don't you weight it by head fire intensity? Okay, we'll try that. Why don't you rate it by rate of spread? None of those improve the production of just a simple, it's hazardous, or it's not. None of them did. And they also said, Well, why don't you change the window that you're looking at? Change the window that you're looking at because we picked 500 meters because there's been some studies that have shown what most embers fall within 500 meters. And I mean, you're going to see variations. Embers can go two kilometers, embers can go even further, but most of them are going to fall within 500 meters. And we tried a thousand meters, but no, the 500 meters worked best. So just let this sink in for a second, right? So years and years of research, almost two decades of research. The burn probability modeling is the dominant paradigm in the US. It has been a In the U.S., it has been aggressively promoted by the federal government here in Canada as well as the federal government in the US. Both birth probability models used in the U.S. and in Canada were developed by government agencies and researchers. And agencies in Canada and in the U.S. have been told to use it to make decisions about where to prioritize mitigations or where to focus other efforts to protect communities. And the model has never been validated, and the minimal validation that we did shows it doesn't work. That we did shows it doesn't work. But I could take one variable, fuel, and I can calculate very easily in a couple of hours these exposure metrics, and they do work, right? So obviously, a lot of people didn't like what we had to say. Now, what this is, it might be an understatement. Because there's a lot of people that made their whole careers and continue to make their careers out of burn probability modeling. And a lot of people don't like the idea. Modeling. And a lot of people don't like the idea that you can't estimate these probabilities with any certainty. And that's what I've been saying. But when go back to my original slides, you can't. These are those gray swans, right? You cannot estimate where this is going to happen. Now, if you're using these models just to get a feel for shifts that are happening in the system more or less, that's probably fine. But if you want that local specificity that we heard in Francis' talk, if you want to be able to bring it down. Talk. If you want to be able to bring it down to a place where decisions are actually happening, you have no confidence in those probabilities. There's too much uncertainty. So we have to start thinking about how we're managing this problem, accepting that we don't have any certainty about when and where this is going to happen. Now, you can combine weather with this stuff. I've decoupled the assessment from weather, but I can take the daily weather, the fine fuel moisture code that tells me how easily the fuels are going to ignite. I can overlay it on my static exposure assessment. My static exposure assessment that's good for the next year. And I can see that today, right, I have places that are exposed and dry, and I can focus on those places. So there's a way to connect it to weather, but it's almost going back to the threat assessment approach of breaking things apart, which people don't like. The next stuff that we're doing is to characterize the patterns of exposure around communities. So I have a PhD student originally funded actually by the ICLR when she was doing her master's and now she's doing her PhD. And we're looking at the And now she's doing her PhD. And we're looking at the patterns of exposure around communities. And so here's two examples: Lake Louise and Whiteport. And what we're looking here is an even simplified version of the exposure saying, well, we know most fires happen in places where there's at least 60% exposure. And those are those places. And you have, what you see is that these patterns start to show the channels by which fire can flow into a community. And if you're in Lake Louise, it can come from everywhere. So think about what you're gonna do here. Think about what you're going to do here because you're not going to treat the whole forest around Lake Louise. And fire ignitions aren't that likely here, but if it happens, it's going to be really, really bad. And there's lots of communities just like this. So AR has done some analysis to kind of group the communities into different types based on the amount of exposure and how it's configured. Is it patchy? Is it limited to one direction like White Court? Well, White Court, the mitigation you're going to do is going to be different because you can go and focus on that one pathway and maybe even eliminate. Pathway and maybe even eliminate the risk, and it might be well worth the investment. Whereas, I don't know if it makes sense to do that in a place like Lake Louise. Maybe you need to focus on how you're going to get people out and also accepting that sometimes we're going to have fires and sometimes communities are going to burn. And every year in Canada, 24,000 homes in urban areas are going to burn, right? Fires happen and some of it, you know, we can't. My house could burn down. I could upgrade the wiring. I could invest in, and it's an old house, it's 1950s. Some of the An old house, it's 1950s. Some of the wiring is original. I could do it, but I have insurance and I know it's possible. And you have to weigh those things. In some places, maybe it's just insurance and you accept it can happen. In other places, there could be mitigations that are quite effective. Anyway, I've just thrown a lot at you and I'm already five minutes over my time allotment, so I apologize. But if there's not time for questions, then okay, there's time for questions. Awesome. And otherwise, if And otherwise, if we run out of time, we can always catch up later this week because I'd love to talk more about this stuff.
