And to make other people I don't need in paper or in screen before. Okay, this is a joint work with Philippe Perlin Gon Bruce. I'm very sorry Philip couldn't be here. I'm not here. Philippe, hi. I'm sorry that he's not here because if you know why we're being together. Isn't that why we together? Well, this is like the generalization of our work of CSM cycles of matrix. And the idea of the talk is to recall what CSM cycles of matrix are or some properties. are some properties. Define what tropical manifolds are, define what CSM cycles of tropical manifolds, and some theorems, as correspondence theorem, adjunction formula and the third tropical formula. If you have any questions, I'm trying to be slow, but if you have any questions, please tell me. Well, this is the fourth day and now we are used to. The notation of m will be in the all of the talk will be a Lucus matrix of rank d plus 1, even rank set 0, 1, 0 to n. And we're going to consider the Berman sign M. Berman, if you want to. It's a rational sum in our M of pure dimension G and if we put Put weight one in all of the two-dimensional spaces. We're going to have a tropical fan, just as Tomi introduces, thank you very much for the introduction of tropical fans. And in fact, Alex proved that this is a condition, and if and only if we have a degree one tropical With one tropical cycle, it is amatroid, if and only if it is a metropolis. Then we have this matrix and we have this fun, that is the matrix with weights one. And what CSM cycles are are like the skeleton of this fan with some weights, but instead of That instead of giving only one fund to the metric, we're going to give it the plus one. Okay? And we're going to equates on each of these spaces and so to all of them are tropical plants. Okay. This for example one, and then this will be the support of the Gurnon Fund. Of the Bernoulli fan. The one spectrum will be the support of the CSM1 class, and the vertex will be the CSM0 with given weights. And we first showed that these weights can be calculated by products of vector invariance, but in fact we're going to see today that these weights do not depend on only depend on the support. only depend on the support. We can forget about the matrix and know which weights to put only watching at the support. There are geometric weights, not matroid weights. We know that some of these cycles are realizable by hydrogen arrangements and these CSM cycles will give us information Will give us information about the CSN classes of the complement of the hyperplane arrangement inside of the wonderful compactification. Give us a lot of information about this geometric object. Well, this is one of the informatical information we can The take from the CSM cycle. And there are others, for example, in Federico's talk, he talked about the degree of the coefficients of the reduced current polynomial are exactly the degrees of these facts. And this was used by Artila and Haman Hughes to prove the logicality of the sequence of these coefficients. Coefficients. Okay, then let's prove that these weights do not depend on, only depends on the support. And we have this proposition that I have two matrices cycles in two different spaces and I have an affine invertible function between them, then the CS. Then the CSM cycles also go from one to the other. I mean, they have both the same weights in all the phases. Okay, and we're going to define now the ways using the shifts that are given in tropical homology. And we have this F. And we have this F P of sigma, where sigma is a pure dimensional or hydro fan in general. And we're going to see the dimension of this object will be the main product to have this width. We have to we need to make conventions for dimensional zero. Dimensional zero, and we have this lemma that if we have a polyhedral fan and the vector spaces Fp of sigma are invariants of the support, and it means that if we have two original fans in real vector spaces, we have We have a function from one to the other, a linear map, a final map, then the dimensions of these spaces are exactly the same. F p? Yeah. Okay, then we can build this polynomial that is in lambda, that is the alternative sum of fi sigma, lambda to the power of t minus i. And in fact, this is exactly the reduced ahafthical polynomial. And then the weights The weights are for CSM0 here is evaluating this polynomial in one. And we only use, if we see the equation, we only use the support of the thumb. We never speak about the matrix. And we can recover a similar recipe for the other phases. Here we need the Here we need the notion of the star. If I have another face that is not the vertex, I'm going to take the span by all the faces that contains tau and the weight will be again have this polynomial, but now in this fun star of sigma. Of sigma, and this polynomial will be this is equal to lambda minus 1 to the k minus 1. And then the weight in this column, in the CSMK cycle m will be the polynomial in star of sigma divided by lambda minus 1 to the power k minus 1 evaluated in lambda equal to what? That looks like a generalization of the A generalization of the recipe just give it in the previous slide. And again, this formula doesn't speak about the matrix, only on the support. Well, this recipe worked for Matroido. Thanks. But what happens if I have another tropical fan? I can use the same recipe, and we have a problem because it doesn't produce tropical fans always. I'm going to give an example that will be better if I have a chop chop there. Thank you. Okay, well let's consider this polytheum is 000 100 010 like because we the dot is um one one zero and zero zero one and if you take the normal fun The normal fan, for the two old fan, to this polyton will have five rays and eight dimensional faces. And if we see the one skeleton, it will be something like this. And if you use the recipe, all the weights will be one and And it is not balanced. It will be not balanced. In fact, to be balanced, we can use perto-an and technique to put weights in the faces of a fan. And in fan, we need here to put two in order to have something balance. And they have, we have a technique defined by Bertrand and Dijan to make this kind of scale. This kind of skeleton balance in some particular cases, but we don't have a general technique. This is not in the case of transient or metropolitan plants. It's an open question. How to generalize the seed weights for a general tropical site. Tropical sound. Okay, well I Okay, well I see it already. So why is there a problem? Because of the dimension in this case the problem is the dimension of P of in the in the in the cone of this vertical face because of the Face because of the dimension will be given value of the polynomial will be one and it doesn't reflect that you have a square of volume two. I mean if we have a polytop of maximal dimension and you take the normal fan and you put the weights are given by the volumes of the phases, you're going to have something. Of the phases, you're going to have something that is well known, but in general, if you have a condiment bigger than one, we're not sure, for example, if well, later we'll see how to put waste in not fun tropical varieties, but general manifolds. And obviously, if you take this and you take the recession fund, you have You take the rotation fun, you have something with weights in all the phases that is balanced. But we don't know if you take two different tropical manifolds with the same rotation fun, you will have always found the same weight. Is it true? I think so, but I don't know. But I don't know. But we felt many things for many years and wasn't, they were wrong. Yes. You could flip back to show us the recipe again. Yeah, sure. This is the first one for dimension zero. Depends on the dimension of the disk. And for CFM0, you have to evaluate in lambda. have to evaluate in lambda equal to one and for the general case you have to take this polynomial but in the star of the space you want to assign a weight divide by this factor and evaluating lambda equal to one you show us who correct the definition of fi again sure Maybe just a so I think that this also follows from my Monkari hope formula because just the self-intersection of the diagonal with itself. I think this is much simpler. Yeah, I mean this is just maybe these F i's are tools to the greater pieces of the Orlock-Solomon algebra. That's the we get the beta invariance, but Beta invariance, but I put them on that. The difference is what Lucy is bringing out, these FPs are defined for any phase of any fan, regardless of whether it's a Matroid fan or not. Regardless, if you take like a fine fan structure. And they're dual to the greater pieces of the reduced electronic? This one is the reduced electron. But so a suggestion for these weights in general would be to always take the Would be to always take the star and take the self-intersection of its diagonal in a product. If your theorem holds for things, I don't mean that. What's that? If your theorem still holds for things, I don't make sure. No, I mean, I'm just maker. Suggestion. Okay. I don't know if... I don't think this would be the same. You have a half an hour to we're ready to go. I don't know. We we're ready to have fun and then you got in the just one time. We have for this afternoon questions and answers. Yeah, it's okay now. I mean I'm not going to use it. That's just for show that we have this formula for that depends only on the support. Okay. Okay. So I have one uh silly question, I guess. Silly question, I guess. Why is one root with multiplicity game lines? The formula is easier. Yeah, we can explain it after. I'm lucky to have Causor here. Okay, I know. I know. And let's move to define tropical manifolds. And the whole idea is that there are a tropical variety of manifold if it's locally like a matroidophan. And when I mean locally, it means that there are a fan. An affan function that can we have an atlas from neighborhoods of this tropical space to matroidal plants. Then is there some sort of correspondence principle where you can say that the tropical Gern Schwartz-McPherson is comatorial shadow of the classical Gern Schwartz-McPherson? Are you in a direct correspondence there? Or is there why? Like, if I didn't know anything, why would I believe that the thing you're calling? Why would you call it a CSM class? Like, it's related to the classical one. No, you have a slide. Yeah, they are. We've heard the theorem that says that these are shadows of CSM classes. Yeah. Like the case of electronic. In the case of realisable the realisable matroidal funds, this so the answer is yes. Yeah, so you can go back again and make sure it's early. Okay, I'm happy to have questions because we're going to give a talk and everybody's like, Okay, then we're going to have this discussion. Okay, then we're going to have this definition. A dimensional tropical manifold is an observed tropical space with an atlas, a finite atlas from neighborhoods of the tropical manifold to neighborhoods of the both metroid sands. And this map. And these maps are homeomorphism and they well, this is I'm extended into fine maps because our work is considering tropical manifolds compact, but in this talk I'm I'm going to take it almost every time all the time. That's what I'm saying. It's the it's like when It's the is like when when you compa compactify your manifold, you need to have uh something for the boundary. Okay, and we have extension and as I say the whole idea is that for every phase of our tropical manifold, if we take the star, it looks like it is the support of the star. It is the support of a Berman fan on some matrix. Okay, then I make this picture. And the whole idea is, for example, this one doesn't have the direction of a matroidal fan, but we can make just a fine Liberian function to take it to a matroidal fan. Okay? And we're going to have finitely. We're going to have finitely many neighborhoods of our space. And then let's take each one of you take your favorite non-singular tropical variety minus tropical hypersurfaces and this definition has to match. For example, a tropical hyper Hyper tropical hypersurface is dual to an omnimodular subdivision of a polytap and then will locally be like the microphones. Okay, the first observation is that this tropical manifold. That this tropical manifold has weight one in all the top-dimensional phases. And if we want to define a tropical sub-manifold in a tropical manifold, we need that this atlas can be extended, well, restricted to the sub-manifold is totally worth the same affine. There exists an affine function that takes the function that takes the neighborhood of the manifold and the submanifold to two pans then it's not only to be a manifold containing a manifold we need more for example we have this example from Bugallian show the red lines are a cubic curve lines are a cubic curve in a plane, a non-singular cubic curve, and then by itself is going to be a manifold, a tropical manifold, but as subset of the plane it is not, because I cannot take this plane in into itself in order to have these red lines. These red lines in a metroidal fan. It is a manifold, but it's not a sub-manifold of the plane. Okay, then as expected, if we have these neighborhoods that are like maturable funds, I mean you you can change the other. This becomes a manifold. So man. No. No. So this is an example of something that is not asomato. It is a manifold and not automatic. Proposal function. It's very weird. No, but is it because the there's nothing uh because uh no, because we you can I mean as as uh As as a as a fan, the red fan, you you can take it to the when I'm saying subdivide that it's then this becomes a part of the scalar function. Yeah, one of the minds. You cannot make them three one in the same coordinates, but the plane and the red curve. And we'll see a little bit later the same example with the Example with the argument formula, we're going to see that if we use this formula to give weights on the vertex, as a tropical manifold, the red cone will be, the CSM0 will be of weight minus one. And if we take this theorem that we'll be seeing later, and And if this was a sub-manifold and you calculate with this adjunction formula, the weight of the vertex, you will find minus 3. Okay, but. QA session. Okay. Okay. Then as I expected, if we are in our tropical manifold, if we have this neighborhood that behaves or can be sent back to send back to matroidal funds, then we can make the same powers, the same weights in the in all the in all the faces. Take each neighborhood to a matrical tan and we're going to recover the weights in this pan in all the phases. Then this will be the definition of Jones MacPherson's type of atropical microphone. Type of a tropical manifold. We have to, for example, in viral language, we're going to patchwork them. For example, if we have these manifolds, we define the degree of the CSM as the sum of the weights we put on the vertices. And since we have finitely many. Since we have finitely many vertices, this will be an integer. And then we can make a correspondence theorem that if you have a family over a country disc that can be tropicalized and the tropicalization is this tropical manifold, then we can take We can take a generic fiber, Xt, equal to one of the elements of the family. And if it's a nice family and we can tropicalize it, and the tropicalization is a manifold, then it happens... Then we have this theorem that on the probe uses the result of sterile, cats, steppatone, and cats and pain. And where we prove that. and where we prove that the the Euler characteristic of each member of this family will be exactly the degree of the zero CSM cycle. Then we can recover the in the case of tropical manifold we can if we have a family that correlates That relates in a tropical manifold. It means that all the elements are non-singular, and then we can recover the other characteristic using only exactly the degree of the CSM0 of X. And this extends the where you were asking, Eric, about the other characteristic if the CSM cycles recover the geometry of Judge field of where they come from. Okay, you have a question? Amen? So why is it just a total value that it took by speeches? On the more general version of the topic. Why is it also a total colour? Yeah, and it's transferred to the orbits of the torque variety. For example, I have this example. We have these two tropical manifolds and they live in the same Same variety, we'll say, and then we know that the sum of the weight will be minus one and minus one and minus Okay, then we have this other God I'm al I'm always super fast. I'm always super fast. I think I have a okay. Then this is a generalization of a result from Shaw, of Christaw, that generalized for higher dimension the result of lines in surfaces. Then if we have a tropical manifold of dimension D, Of dimension D, and we have a sub-manifold of codimension 1, then we can recover the G minus 1 CSM cycle of the solve manifold using intersection product of the P minus 1 CSM cycle of X minus SM cycle of X minus W intersection product with W. And again to prove these results, to prove this, we use results of Francois Row and Joe Smacker, smoker. Okay, for example, this is a tropical manifold, and if you use this formula, here we want to see, we have W is the red tropical line and X is the plane, and if you use this formula, you're going to find minus 1 in each one of the vertices. Okay, you can recover because we were looking at T minus one, D minus two, or D is equal to two TSM cycles, and then you can compute easily the intersection of the one skeleton of the plane minus the red curve. The red curve intersected with the red curve. And again, this was the example. If I make exactly the same recipe, I'm going to find that the vertice of the red curve will have weight three. And we know that in a triplet like this, we only we always find minus one and not minus two. Then this this proves that. But they proved that it thought of so much. And the last theorem I want to talk about is tropical neutral formula that also generalize a result from Christoph and this is for tropical sort of things. Tropical surfaces are manifolds and locally unimodal, truncated phase structure are just technical definition that we need to extend this quiz theorem of more general curves or surfaces, but also Surfaces, moreover. And we have that the Euler characteristics of the compact tropical surface can be given by the degree of CSM0 of X and the self-intersection of CSM1 of X divided by half. Then we have a recipe of find the Euler calibration of X. Of X, that is a surface in terms of the vertices and the one skeleton and the weights. Okay, and I'm always super fast. We continue. You have questions there.
