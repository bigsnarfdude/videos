Okay, I would like to start by thanking the organizers for this nice workshop and also for the opportunity presenting my work. The history I'm going to talk a little bit today is based on this paper in collaboration with Shudashato Brama and Mi Faruk, and also on early results with Keshav and Radutatar. And this vlog actually came from trying to generalize uh what Keshav presented, not only for the cytometric but a FRW metric, like But an FRW metric, like a general four-dimensional FRW space-time if I skip out to A. I'm gonna skip. Okay, so this is the outline, I think I'll skip for the sake of time. I'm gonna start by revisiting pretty standard supergraph in the coherence that prevents any solutions for any any compactification solution for maximum symmetric space-times with positive curvature. Times with positive curvature. So this is the prototype one, is one of the main novel theorems by Moda Senunis, 2001. They assumed a second derivative theory for gravity, so just Ariston cubit action. You can add scalars and peak forms, but those should have positive proper kinetic term. So in particular, there are no ghosts. The scalar potential is non-positive. The internal space. The internal space in which they did the compatification should be time-independent, and the external space is a maximally symmetric space. So, it can be ADS, the Citer, or Minkowski. And also, Bengal's a finite lower-dimensional Newton's constant. So, in this talk, I'm going to use capital D for the high-dimensional dimension of the unifold, and small D, the lower-dimensional external photon focus on. So, if you want to keep in mind, the So if you want to keep in mind t, I'm going to take t equals to 4, but I'll I'll leave t as general as possible. Okay, with those assumptions, it's possible to show that the curvature, the rich scale of the d-dimensional metric, the small d-dimensional metric, is not positive. And this was also extended after including sources like DP Brains and Opi Plains by Keshoff and collaborators in 2014. And I'm going to just revisit how you can get this result from those assumptions. Result from those assumptions. So, oops. Yeah. So, I start with the metric with some working factor. This metric here is the metric for the external space-time with metric eta, the maximum space-time. G hat mm is the metric of the internal compact time-independent manifold. And I can manipulate Eisen's equations to get this equation here, where the mu new indices. Where the new new indices are only in the external directions, and the trace appearing in H-matron tensor here is the full trace of the NHMOTI tensor, including the whole method, the whole indices. And of course, this omega is the warping factor. So if I contract this equation with eta, I get this other equation here, this scale equation. And there is a pretty standard trick. I can multiply the whole equation by this. The whole equation by this fact over here, you know, get a total derivative on the internal space equals to something. And it was shown, given the assumptions I showed in the previous slide, that this whole term is actually positive. Okay, so I have Laplacian internal manifold of the British scalar with the external metric plus something positive. If I integrate the resulting equation, the internal manifold, since it's compact and this is a total derivative, Is compact and this is a total derivative, I'll get zero on the left-hand side, and then I'll get r times something which is proportional to the ratio between the Newton's constant, the high dimension, the lower dimensional, plus something that's positive. So this tells me that R is negative or zero, cannot be positive. This is the basic way of saying how the assumptions that I showed before prevent compatification down to four-dimensional decisions. Down to four-dimensional the city space to accelerate in cosmologies. Okay, but the questions I'm going to tackle today is how to generalize these results. And this will help us understand what happens if we drop some of those assumptions. For instance, you have seen that in order to see that those conditions imply non-positive external coverture, we quite need some computations, right? So it would be nice to have a principle, physical. So it would be nice to have a principle, a physical principle, in trying to see that that's not possible already in 10 dimensions, already in the high-dimensional theory. Oops. And a hint that this is possible, that this principle exists, is the fact that the assumptions that I showed before, they are sufficient to give the fact that the high-dimensional energy condition implies the lower dimensional energy condition. Lower dimensional H Mod. So, in particular, given that assumption, since this is true, I know I cannot violate the lower-dimensional strong energy condition. This SCC stands for strong energy condition. So, this tells me already, without doing any calculation, because the computations before were done for the C tape. Now, if I can go back to the computation and try to compute what happens if I have a F or W. I have a FRW space-time instead of a maximum symmetrical space-time. And what I find is that since the strong energy condition cannot be violated, then I cannot get accelerated expansion. And relaxing those assumptions, for instance, tells us some new results. For instance, for time-dependent time manifolds, as the ones used by Kishov, the strong energy condition can be violated. And it was found in this paper by Russian Tau. And it was found in this paper by Russian Thousand, then the Neulinich condition is also violated. And curiously, doing the analysis that we did with Keshav, the New English condition appeared as a condition for controlled perturbative expansion for the existence of this hierarchy that Keshav was talking about when I'm doing the same computations in a FRW metric in the type 2p approach. Okay, so I'm gonna base the principle that I'm hitting at using energy conditions. So it's better to have a slide just summarizing them, just to refresh your memory. I'm gonna work with these four energy conditions, the strong, new, weak, and dominant. The strong states that a congruence of time-like vectors, time-like congruence, has no negative. No negative divergence. And this is basically tells you that gravity cannot make time-like particles to recede from each other. The new energy condition is essentially the same state, but both for new congruences. The weakened energy condition also includes the fact that the energy density measured by local observers is always positive. And the dominant explanation tells me also that it includes the weak. It includes the weak, but there is also this flux condition here. By the way, this G is the full Weissen tensor, R is the rich tensor. I'm using geometric niche conditions instead of the ones state in terms of the menu. Yeah, so for the dominance, I have this extra condition here on top of the week, which is telling me that the flux of energy measured by any observer locally is causal. Okay, so there's no causality violations. The the Ricci and the Einstein, so you're assuming a certain year of gravity, right? Because then the relation between Ricci and the Hisman temperance? Yeah, I'm gonna assume Eisengravity as well, yes. But I can work with the geometric, for instance. In all Timenus that I have, if I'm not working on fear of Eisengravity, I can put the corrections to the other side and call it the T Menu multiplication. That may not be bigger than zero. There would be something, so something. Um okay, it it's a little bit tautological then to to say, wait, what is the energy condition? Well, I'm just this is the energy condition I'm going to use in the age of magical ones. But I understand the question. It's a nice question. Okay. So the question that I'm trying to answer is actually finding the requirements for the high dimensional initial condition to imply the lower dimensional one. The lower dimensional one. Why is this useful? I'm going to show to you that the classical field content and source content of supergravity with some assumptions, they all satisfy the high-dimensional conditions in high dimension. For any metric, I'm going to do for any metric, it doesn't matter the background. So if I find the requirements for the high-dimensional condition to apply the lower dimensional one, then I cannot violate the lower initiative. Then I cannot violate the low-dimensional initial conditions, and I cannot get certain backgrounds, for instance, the sitter or ox-related solutions. And to do that, I'm gonna start with high-dimensional nonsense for the metric. It's much more general than the ones I showed before because it includes external dependence in the internal metric on their coordinates X and also the matrix. And also the metrics, the metric of the external space here, it can be any metric. I don't require it to be a maximum symmetric space-time. And another important assumption is that the internal volume of the internal space is x-independent. So I'm going to pose this condition as well, the equations to follow. Okay, so just from that answer, I can compute the components of the rigid tensor. They are in terms of G, which includes the word. G, which includes a warping factor of omega, that we showed before. And then I can impose, start from the strong NH condition, for instance, in high dimensional, and using those computations to explore what they imply for the lower-dimensional theory after working with a constraint tangent bundle, in which I only put the components. In which I I only put the components of the high-dimensional uh vector fields to hide into the small denomination directions. Okay? So that's what I got just from the equations above. And this quantity is positive as long because it's just the contraction of two vectors in the antenna space and the antenna metric is Riemannian. And I can get rid of this two. And I can get rid of this term after integration in the entanglement for the same trick as done before. And I essentially get this equation at the end. And this is precisely the strong energy condition now for the metric G tilde. So I just assume the metric I showed before, intended space constant, and for any metric, I'm showing to you that the high-dimensional strong energy condition imposed. So I call this kind of relation between the high-dimensional low-dimensional energy conditions and edge condition inherent text. So please elaborate on that. So you say that that first term that you want to show is positive plus positive things is positive is your starting point. So how do you learn that first term is possible? You know, if I if I have three things that are adding up to something positive and two of them are positive, how do I know that the last thing is positive? Yeah, I can get rid of this one by integration, as before, multiplication and integrations. So this one doesn't matter much. Why doesn't it matter much? You see, the metric G here doesn't depend on the internal space or the internal direction. So if I multiply by things that depend in the direction and integrate in the internal space, I just get the get a constant, right? It doesn't. It's a positive constant, so I. You know, it's a positive constant, so it's okay. The same is true for the new Enish condition. This one is simpler because since this is a new like, sorry, a new vector field, some terms cancel because they contra give zero. So we've got simply this term now, and again away I should disclaimer here, I ma I also should work away from singularities in the internal space, otherwise this term can explode. Space, otherwise, this term can explode. So again, because the six-dimensional manifold or the capital D minus the small d dimensional manifold is Riemannian, this is positive and again that get the new Enish condition now in our dimensions. What about the week? Well, for the week, you can start with the equations, do some manipulations, and the best we could do is to write the contraction of the vector field time-like. Of the vector field, time-like vector field with the Excel tensor of the low-dimensional metric in this way. So I find this inequality, where this T is the T menu, has interpretation of the T menu for the mode-like fields of the co-qualification. And this T omega is includes contributions from the internal reach metric, sorry, the reach scale for the internal metric, and factors of the warping. And factors of the warping, I mean, derivatives of the warping factor that can be written this way. So, in order for me to have weak energy condition inheritance, I also need those stimulus to satisfy the weak energy condition. So, for instance, this one is straightly, for instance, if I consider stabilized mode light, the stabilized constants, so this is automatically zero, and I get only the contribution for the last turn. For the last ten, again, if I assume the theory of Laplacian in the internal meaningful internal meaning flows for rich flat compactifications, I get this to be positive and the weakening conditions also satisfy the low-dimensional theory. For the dominant, it includes the weak plus the flux condition, so the weak are discussed. Already discussed. So, what we want to show is that the t's that I showed before, they are causal vectors. I mean, this the contraction of the t's that I defined before are causal vectors. For the t omega, this is trivial because it is proportional to the metric, and so you can show that this is true. But for the th, for the model engine contensor, it is standard as a condition. As long as the th satisfies the flux condition, you get. The flux condition, you get dominant energy condition inheritance as well. So the conclusion at this point is that a constant term of volume is a sufficient condition for the new and strong energy conditions. And to get the weak energy condition inherent tense, we need this combination here, these two inherent tensors, to satisfy the WC. And this is the case when you have, for instance, stabilized mood-like fields and enriched flat compact. In rich, flat compactifications. And since this T omega is necessarily causal, to get the dominant energy condition inheritance, I need TH to satisfy the domination condition. That's conclude the first part that I want to discuss. Now, for the few minutes that I had, I just want to explain to you how it's possible to show that then the matter content, the field content with local sources. The field content with local sources of supergravity at classical level, they satisfy the initial conditions, high-dimensional initial conditions for any metric. So, background-dependent computation. For scale fields, it was discussed, for instance, in this paper, summarizes what we know about energy conditions for scale fields, so we don't bother too much, but I'm going to state the results here. For a non-negative potential, the non-initial condition is satisfied, but the strong can be violated. But a strong can be violated when v is different from zero. And when v is non-positive, the strong respected, but the dominant might be violated when v is negative. And that's the case, for instance, that you get in the model synonymous noble theorem. And moreover, for p equals to one, so one vector fields, all the initial conditions are also satisfied. This was proved here. And in the following, it's better to focus on the And in the following it's better to focus on the dominant and the strong because the forgen in general the dominant implies the weak and the strong implies the the new. Okay, so I have this action, it's the form of action that I have, supergravity, scalar field, p-form fields, couplings with sources, and kinetic terms for the sources. Okay, I'm gonna focus on the p-forms. Are you still assuming that the fields are nowhere singular? Fields are nowhere singular? Sorry? One of the assumptions previously had been that the fields can be nowhere singular. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to assume physical configurations, what I call physical configurations, yes. And even with the presence of sources, because things couldn't be rich with the sources. You see, the the okay, so the coupling with the sources is I want to compute energy maintenance source in check-in conditions. The coupling of sources is topological. The copy of sources is topological. So the sources here that are only going to introduce topological constraints in my theory, like the type of cancellation condition that I'm going to study afterwards. So this is included in the analysis of OP planes. When I discuss OP planes, I'm going to talk about this case. Oops, I keep going back because this is up and down instead of platform, right? Sorry. Uh okay, so for P forms P larger than one, this is a T V new. This is a TV new used to compute. And I wanted to know, I want to check if this strong energy condition is satisfied. I need to compute this contraction here. And you have shown in our paper that this can be written in this way, which is one effect to be positive, when p is smaller than t minus two. Okay, so if p is larger than t minus two, then it might be valid, right? But actually, you know, p equals to d minus two is the condition to have self-duality. Condition to have self-duality. So I can always, if p is larger than 2, I can always use point pipe duality to write the action again in terms of the small rank p4. So a strong edge condition is satisfied. The same is true for the donut. You can check in the paper. And I'm doing a computation for any metric, not specifying the metric. Now for local. Now for local sources, let's start with P-brains. I can have the general, you know, the word for the P-brain, the VI action essentially. So H is the induced metric. F includes the gauge fields on the brain plus the pullback of space-time field equals to perform uh on the brain. I can compute the T minu is written in terms of this uh this matrix G, where G is this combination which appears in D B I. Is this combination which appears in DBI? And more than that, I can write as an integral of this coverly T A B tensor, and this is nothing but the energy momentum tensor as seen in the word volume theory. So if I average the actions back to the brain metric, I get the stimuli. It's a pullback. Yeah, you can see it. Actually, that's not true. That's not true. It's not a pullback. It's not a pullback. We can show that. But the pullback is. Control that. But the pullback is useful when you, for instance, because to show NH conditions, I'm going to need to contract this T menu with space-time vectors. Because I need to do the contraction to check the image condition. And when I do that, what I get here, those factors, they're going to transform the space-time vector into word volume vectors. So what these expressions show to you is that the energy condition on the space-time is related. On the space-time is related to Danish condition on the brain. But on the brain, what I have? I have scalar fields, I have p-forms, and have shown already that those satisfy the initial conditions. So you can check in the paper the more details about it. What it happens, that the peak brains cannot violate the energy conditions. And one thing I want to call attention is that this depends on the sign of the tension here. And the brains uh have a positive tension. Positive tension. That's not true for opi planes, they can have negative tension. So there would be volume, a wood volume theory can have tacklings. What happens is that opi planes are not dynamic objects, more like fixed planes. There is no degrees of freedom in this action, for instance. You cannot wear respect to the to the to the the age. They're more like manifestation of the background or influx the the background structure that you get after the for the influen project, right? The orientable project, right? So, but however, because they can couple with the Pform fields, their source for the Pform field as well, I should include this action in my supergravity action when dealing with OP planes. This is what I was talking about, right? The coupling of the OP planes with the P-form fields when you the singular side. So, if I have a configuration, of course, this is also true for the p-brains, they are also coupled with, they are also source for the p-forms. But if I have a configuration with p-brains and op-planes, then the equations of motion of the p-form fields, they're going to impose these conditions. Essentially, the charge cancellation condition or type of constellation condition. And what I'm doing here is the following. Is the following. I have checked that opio paint might violate the Danish conditions in general because of the sign of the detention. But I'm asking, okay, but in the real world, if I have like, not in real world, but in the world in which the equations of motion are satisfied, so if I graph the equations of motion are satisfied, I also need to take into account the whole configurations, not only the OP planes, because I need to look at the equations of motion, including the one related to the peak points. So I'm going to show to you that this equation actually. I'm going to show to you that this equation actually constrains the configuration that we can have. And such configurations might be such that the energy conditions are not violated, although individual they will be planned violated. And I'm going to focus on parallel configurations. So I'm going to consider a system having a number of DP brains, OP, OP minus planes, and the anti-versions of those, the OP and OP minus. The OP plus and OP minus are just OP planes with opposite orientation. So the charge consistent condition gives me that because we use this relation between the OP plane charge, charge density, and the deprived charge density. So I can use this condition to rewrite the sum of the tensions in this form. And so the sum of the tension, which determines Detention, which determines if the initial conditions are violated or satisfied, can be written this way. And if I pose to be positive, that's what I need for the initial condition to be satisfied, I get this relation only in terms of the number of OP plus planes and OP minus planes. So the number of DP planes satisfy this condition in the parallel configuration involving number of dprains and OP planes. And opi planes, in order for the energy conditions to be satisfied. So, for supersymmetric parallel configurations, the brains they have the same orientation, both the planes and the brains have the same orientation, so they don't have this OP minus. And moreover, the number of DP brains related to the number of OP plus weights. So, that's the case, for instance, in type 1 string 10 dimensions. And so, the sum of the tension is zero in this case, for instance. In this case, for instance, and all the initial conditions are satisfied. So the conclusion is that generically for any background metric, the field content of supergraph satisfy all the initial conditions. I also assume D larger than 2. Sorry, I forgot to say that. DP planes individually satisfy the initial conditions. OP planes might violate them. But if you look at the physical configurations that satisfy the Physical configurations that satisfy the equations of motion, it might be that the whole system they do not validate. For instance, this is the case for parallel-sized configurations, because in this case, all the energy conditions are satisfied. These are the high-dimensional conditions. So, if you're working supergravity in a configuration that do satisfy the initial condition, and you try to construct a four-dimensional space-time with the metric answers that I wrote before, you should stop. Don't do the computation because it's impossible. Don't do the computation because it's impossible. So, the computation is very difficult. You're never going to find that because there is an inheritance between the inch conditions. If you have two orthogonal O planes, you still need two orthogonal D brains to cancel the charges. So, again, your conclusion should hold up. Yeah, yeah. Parallel between D brains and low brains. Even if they are working on the same thing, Yeah, so I think I don't have any time more, so I'd like just thank you. Thanks for the talk in the question. So your last conclusion, is it still true that you're assuming that the gradient of the volume is zero? Um yes. And and and also you're still also assuming the s the configurations are non-singular positions of the sources. Angular positions of the sources. Just to check something. So, when you say the last thing you're talking about, this one here? No, in your conclusion one, one of your assumptions was that the internal volume cost. Yeah, these conclusions only hold if I have a tort internal volume constant, yes. But I'm asking, is that assumption still true for your conclusion two? No. Conclusion two is completely general for any metric. Take-dimensional metric, but then. But the assumption of the stuff being the fields not being. The fields not being singular is true for both of them. Yes, yeah. Because that's a strong assumption. The Coulomb solution would be forbidden by that, right? It's currently generic that the massless fields coupled to a source are kind of widely singular where the source is. So given that they could size them with some little LC fill box or something, then you could pick up surface terms, but you have to ask what the surface terms do. Very strong condition of the sources to have. Well, you see, I have shown that there is in here in terms of damage conditions, right? And damage conditions are local quantities, right? So in some point it might be they are violated, but there also might be points in which they are not violated. So no, no, some points, some isolated points, in which the edge conditions are violated, but far away from those points they are updated. Far away from those points, they are data based. I'm just not worried about the conditions being violent, I'm just worried about what the field is just being singular is, and you can't say what's going on. So that's what I would expect to happen if I have a localized source. Like the global source or the potentials that are regional, and so it sounds to me like you've excluded those kind of solutions, singular where the sources are. I I excluded those regions, those points. I didn't exclude the the solution far away from the points. But did you keep in your arguments when you're doing animals and stuff like that, did you keep When you're doing intervals and stuff like that, do you keep the contribution of the if you're tooling it means you put a little volume around it so you're you've got a boundary there, right? So, are you keeping the surface trends for those boundaries if you're arguing? Oh, no, no. See, I think that's an important thing to think about. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, my intuition is that as far as you are, if you are far away from that, what I'm saying. If you are far away from that, what I'm saying is that the energy conditions, the inner qualities that I showed before, they should have axis here, right? Three-dimensional axis. There is space-time dependent. So they might be violated to individual points, but far away from those points is fine. So I then need to integrate to use the inequality. It's a terminal these higher-dimensional supergravities that if I had a maximum symmetric four-dimensional thing, which should have been included in your story, that you can directly relate the curvature of that maximum asymmetric space in the four-dimensional. The maximum dimension space in the four dimensions to the sum of the singularities, everything drops out except for the singularity contributions near the sources. So that makes it sound like that's being driven by the sources almost in the way. That sounds like that should also then be important to you. I think we checked in 2014. If you put an oriented folder and if you include the sources, it doesn't change the result. Once you're sure that there's a statement that says that there's some overall delta radiance at the sources, and that completely gives me a lot of. Maybe we can postpone the discussion for a few words. Okay, our next speaker is Kuklixi. Just to remind you, there are two discussion sessions, one tomorrow and one on Thursday. So please come up with some questions that we could discuss.
