The last session of the session of this workshop with predicate notes is going to talk about the NLS with slowly decaying and low decaying in SALA. So please, Reddit. Thank you for the introduction. And I guess so this is the last talk and I guess on behalf of all the other participants I can say that it has been a very nice workshop. It has been a very nice workshop with very interesting talks. I would like to thank the organizers for organizing this workshop. And I mean, just this bench center itself is also very nice and pleasurable with all of this spectacular natural. So it was really a... So I personally had a very nice time. We'll try to repeat. Very good. Okay, so I hope that I can also Also, give you an interesting talk. And yeah, so I want to speak about the non-linear Schrodinger equation with slow decaying and non-decaying initial data. And this is partially based on joint work with Perkot's non-linearity. So the equation I'm going to look at is the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, which probably all of you know, so it's one of the most classical dispersive equations. Dispersive equations. And so the linear part of the equation is IUT plus Laplacian of U. And I consider a power nonlinearity with some coupling constant kappa here. And so I want to treat the initial value problem for this equation where the initial data lies in some function space x. And so depending on what Depending on what this coupling constant does, so it's either one or minus one because you can just scale it away otherwise. So, in the minus one case, it's the focusing nonlinear Schw√∂ding equation, and in the plus one case, it's the defocusing equation. And so, since this is one of the classical equations, for these personal equations, classical models, there's also a lot of theory on it. And, well, And well I think the first attempts to treat this equation were in sober left spaces on the real line and maybe also already in the periodic case. You can also treat it in weighted sober left spaces on the real line and usually so what you do is you derive certain Strischart's estimates and then using these Strischard estimates you can solve the fixed point equation and then So of the fixed point equation and then what's somehow a very complicated problem with actually not so many results is what happens for this equation when the initial data has very few decay or even no decay and no prescribed asymptotics at infinity. And so what I mean is that here for example for periodic inertial data we don't have Periodic initial data, we don't have decay, but we have prescribed asymptotics. And just to give you two examples, even in the one-dimensional case, in the completely integrable cubic case, there's no global in-time theory for these two initial data, right? So here we have a function which is almost periodic. So we take cosine of x plus cosine of sparrow dot 2x. And the other example is that we Is that we take u0 to be a sum over a n phi of x minus n, where phi is some, say, a bound function or something, and the a n are just infinity coefficients of unit signs. Right? And so if we look at these functions, so this is cosine x plus cosine of square root of 2x, you can see that, well, I mean, there is some somehow regular behavior, but Somehow regular behavior, but if you go with x further and further to infinity, there's no asymptotics, right? And the problem is here that so this because of the square root of 2 here, right? So if this were rational, you could just take some torus and treat it. And so the other example here I just took a gaussian as this file. You can see that basically it's so Yeah, basically it's. So if almost all of the a n were to be 1, say, then this would be a periodic function at infinity. But if the a n are chaotic or something, then you can see that some of the bumps are just negative or half size, and so there's also no asymptotics. And right. So why are we looking at this kind of problem? Looking at this kind of problem, well, personally, I do this because I just like it for the mathematical challenge, but there's also a physical meaning behind it, namely, as you may know, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation also models the transmission of signals in nonlinear fiber optics, and where in the setting space and time are reversed. So, if we look So, if we look back at this example, one can describe such a bump here as like an in. So, if this is the initial datum, this means that at the position zero of the class fiber cable, this is the signal that comes in. So, each of these could be interpreted as a one signal. And then maybe we don't have negative signals, but we have a signal that does not come. So, this is a zero. And the question of like global behavior then is a question. Behavior, then it's a question of how long that cable may be. And so, what's the problem with these kinds of initial data? Well, the problem is mainly that we don't have well-defined conserved quantities, even in the completely integrable case. Because even if they are conserved quantities, they will all be infinite. So, we cannot really use them to get to. So, we cannot really use them to get good bounds on the solution. And what we want to do is to find spaces x, to treat this kind of initial data, to get a well positive theory in these spaces, and even possibly get global well-positions. Right, and just to remind you what I mean by well poses, I mean existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on the initial data. Right, so this is the setting. And maybe the first Setting. And maybe the first thing when you look at this kind of initial data that you may think of is maybe we can just treat the problem in L infinity or something. But this is not possible because there is a phenomenon called dispersive blow-up, which was investigated by Bona and Su in 2010 and Bona Ponsis and Spaba in 2014. Right? And this is easily described and it holds already for the linear part of the equation. Already for the linear part of the equation. So if we have a solution of the linear equation with initial data f, then we can just write down the solution of this equation in terms of this oscillatory temperature. So if we now take a certain point in space-time, one quarter zero, and we consider this special kind of initial data, namely x to the minus n, e to the minus i. minus n e to the minus ix squared, we see that this kills the oscillatory kernel here and we just get an integral that is infinite. So the strong oscillations here, even if we have decay, strong oscillation can still lead to L infinity blow up of the linear equation itself. So what we have to do is if we want at least a solution at L infinity, with some continuity in L infinity, we have to rule out We have to rule out these strong oscillations. Okay. Maybe some related results. So there's also a very famous case of the Kohst-Pitaevsky equation, which means that we consider a non-linear Schrodinger equation where the asymptotic, the absolute value at infinity should converge to one. In this case, there are local well-post results by Sitkov, for example, in LS. By Sitkov, for example, in L infinity intersected with a space where derivatives are in a Soberlev space. I mean, the two examples that I showed you in the beginning, they are not in the space here, right? Because there's a prescribed asymptotic energy. And there you even get global wellposes because you have a certain energy that is coercive and that can control the bomb. There are other examples of related results. Of related results by Tadahiro, where he considers the algebraic nonlinearities, and he shows that if u0 is almost periodic with L1 coefficients, then you get a local solution. And he also proves a global result in the case of limit periodic initial data, which means that you have rational Fourier coefficients, but only if you have a certain very fast approximation property. And I mean this this does not it's not enough to consider both of these samples and then very recently by Dodson, Soffner and Spencer there were two papers for the one-dimensional case also again with algebraic nonlinearity where they show several results. So on the one hand they show that local solutions exist if U0 is real analytic on some strip. They show that you get a local solution They show that you get a local solution in L infinity if your initial data is in W2 infinity. They show that you even get a global solution under a bit more regularity assumption, but only for regularized nonlinearity by some convolution. And in the defocusing case also. And I think the most interesting of these results is the last one where they show that there's a global solution in L4 and L. Solution in L4n plus 2, so the Lebesgue space, if u0 is also in the space, but you also have to assume 2n plus 2 derivatives belong in the same Lebesgue space. And again, we need a default, so not 3. But one of the things you can see here is that this is, in some sense, not really well poses, right? Because we start with more regularity and we lose regularity here. And so this is one of the things that So this is one of the things that I want to talk later about. And okay, and this is not an exhaustive list. There may be more results that I just don't know. I mean, the literature is quite big on the numbers. So the first thing I want to talk about then is the truth problem for the nonlinear Schmitting equation, which means that we consider as a space of initial data a Of initial data, some space of periodic and non-periodic solar f functions. And this is somehow a setting which is intermediate between periodic and non-periodic, meaning that you can hope to use techniques from both settings. And in particular, if you think back at the second example from the beginning, it corresponds exactly to the case where almost all of the AM are one. And why is this called a tooth problem? Well, basically, you can think of like Where basically you can think of like teeth, and you knock out some of the teeth here, but only finitely many, and you still want to know if you can solve this problem, Chloe. Or even clone. Right. Okay, so locally, this is no problem. This has been shown by Chaitanya Sundar, Mark Krunsmann, and Patakos in 2019. So, in the one-dimensional case, also there are some high-dimensional. So, there are some higher-dimensional results. Basically, you can just use Strichard's estimates. So, in the setting where the localized part is in L2 and the periodic part is in H1 half plus. This means that we can always bound the periodic part in L infinity and Strichard's estimates just go through if we assume some prediction on the aircraft. I mean, for higher regularity, this is not such a big problem. This is not such a big problem, at least at the default. Well, yeah, I mean, for local well posters in the case. There's one global well post result which is in L2 for the localized part, but it's only in the quadratic nonlinearity. In this case, it's more easy, and we can see it. And so what And so, what Peer and I showed last year was that also for the defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation with arbitrary high power nonlinearity, we get a global solution if we start in the energy space H1R for the localized part and the periodic part has to be a bit regular so it has to be it has to have more has to have more than three half the Has to have more than three half derivatives in the cubic case, otherwise, it has to have more than five half derivatives, and there's some restriction between S2 and P because of the smoothness of the C. Okay. So how do you show this cameras? So as usual when you work in the sum space, you split all your functions and the function u is the sum and we split it into a part. Is the sum, and we split it into a part v which is localized and a part w which is periodic. Now, if u solves a nonlinear Schw√∂ding equation, we can just go to infinity and see that v has to vanish, which means that w itself, so the periodic part also has to solve the same equation. This means that v has to solve a different nonlinear Schrodinger equation with initial data in H1, and this is the aesthetic. In H1, and this is the setting that we have to treat. Okay, for the global periodic solution, there's a lot of theory, and we can just assume that we have a global solution. And it also satisfies uniform and time bounds for all times bigger than zero. And as I mentioned already, a local solution also exists for this localized problem. So we have. Localized problem, so we have to see how we get global well posters. And how do you get global well posters? Well, you need some kind of conservation or growth bond on some controlling norm, right? And so what's the matter here? The problem is that already the mass itself, so the integral over v squared for the part for v is not conserved, right? We have a right-hand side that is non-recorded. We have a right-hand side that is non-vanishing. And if we count linearities of V, so homogeneity in V, we see, for example, if P is 3, then the right-hand side will have a highest order term, which is cubic. Meaning that you cannot just do Krohlwal directly, right? And this is somehow the easier case for P equals 2, you cannot just do Krollwai argument directly. Which is also why, for example, for K dB, the problem is. Kbd, the problem itself is trivial and you also get global solutions in k d right and now the solution to this problem is to also use the time-dependent Hamiltonian of the difference equations. And if you have a look at it, you see that it looks very related to the energy of the Hamiltonian of the non-perturbed equation, but the But the cubic case, this is a power nonlinearity 4. This part has a lot more correction terms in there. And it's time dependent because the function w, the periodic part, is time dependent. And now you look at Hamiltonian theory books and you see that what you know about the time derivative of the Hamiltonian, if it's explicitly time dependent, is that you can calculate it. Can calculate it at the solution curve by just taking the time derivative inside of the integral basis. Which means that we only have to differentiate all the terms here. And the nice thing is that this derivative term itself does not have to be here. It does not carry a time derivative. And this is very nice because also this Hamiltonian here is coercive, right? So it looks a lot like the energy and basically it is like an energy. Energy and basically it is like an energy up to some lower order terms that depend on the periodic solution. So we can just find a constant that depends on this, an infinity norm of the periodic part, such that we can add this constant times the mass to the Hamiltonian, and it becomes coercive against the energy. And this already tells us that we can estimate the time derivative of the mass directly against the mass. Of the mass directly against this sky. So, if we want to close the argument, the Holtwood argument, we have to calculate and estimate the time derivative of h. And this we can do directly. So, with the notation that this bracket bilinear form here is the real part of the usual L2 scalar product, you can write down the time derivative of h like this. This is just a certain example. This is just a certain expression. In particular, we see that if we just assume enough regularity on w, so in the case where the initial value has more than five half derivatives, this time derivative here is just L infinity. Then you can just do a holder and bot maybe and directly get an estimate on this time derivative. The cubic case one can do a bit more. Do a bit more, and this is done by plugging in the time evolution equation for W. There, the worst part coming is the two derivatives here. We can shift one of the derivatives onto the V, and then we see that basically the worst term is something like L two scalar product of Wx with Vx V squared. There you can just push Schwartz once. Can just do Cauchy-Schwarz once and see that and estimate it by the energy, and which means that using Kuhnweil on this quantity here is enough to control the energy. And okay, so this was the first part. For the second part, I want to talk about modulation spaces. What are modulation spaces? Modulation spaces are basically like Besoff spaces, but you take a uniform decomposition of the Fourier side. So the modulation space norm MSPQ is defined as an LQ sum weighted by K to the S of box K operator U apply in the L P norm and the box K operator is just a Fourier multiplier operator. The Fourier multiplier operator, where the Fourier multiplier comes from a smooth partition of unity on the Fourier. Okay. And so just as the Besoff spaces, these spaces satisfy certain inclusions and properties. So one of the properties is that both indices are just two. You recover the usual Sobolev spaces on the line. You have certain inclusions coming from. Inclusions coming from the inclusions of some spaces into one another. This is the index Q. For the index P, you use Bernstein's inequality. We can also trade regularity for this Q index here as for the Besoff spaces. And one of the things you see then, for example, if we consider S to be 0 and we look at the space M21, this is somehow, so this space actually also embeds. So this space actually also embeds into L infinity or C0 bounded intersected with L2. This is kind of like a replacement space for H1 half. But it's not the same, right? So on the scale of Sobolev spaces, it lies somewhere between H1 half plus and L2. And you also get bilinear bounds. In fact, and here the bilinear bounds maybe first, the p-index is like H√∂lder's index. The P index is like Hoelder's inequality and the Q index is like Young's inequality because we have to do convolution for result. And in general non-algebraic nonlinearities are very hard to deal with, so this result only covers algebraic nonlinearities. So from this Young condition here, you can see that in the case q equals 1, we recover a Banner algebra in this modulation spaces. Modulation spaces, and if S is big enough, then this impulse. Okay, why am I talking about modulation spaces? The reason is basically this property. So Ben-Gi, Christianik, Ogodju and Rogers in 2007 showed that the Schrodinger operator is a bounded operator on modulation spaces. And the constant grows with time t, like t to the one-half in one dimension. In higher dimensions, it's like dimension over two. And the point is. And the point is that if we just consider the Banach algebra modulation spaces, we get local well-positions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with algebraic nonlinearities for free in these spaces, right? Because you can just write down the integral equation, you estimate the linear part by this inequality, and the non-linear part then just by the Banach algebra inequalities. And this is pretty nice. And since we also, there's also an And since we also there's also another inclusion here, namely that if you are in a in a Lebesgue space with two derivatives, so in the Sobolev space W2P, then you are also in the modulation space mp1. This means that the two examples from the beginning, they lie in the modulation space m infinity one. So if phi is smooth enough here. And this tells us that basically we get a well-posed theory. Basically, we get a well-posed theory, like in the space, so that we start in the space and we do not leave the space. This we get for free, right? And we will also restrict to the case q equals 1 in the last minutes because it's easier to do. So, the question is now: can we also maybe get global rollposis of nonlinear Schrodinger equations in modulation spaces MP1 possible? Spaces MP1, possibly even in M infinity. And so this is a result that I was able to prove: namely, that P equals infinity is not included, but we can go as high as we want with our P, and we have to assume that we have one derivative being also in this modulation space, then we get also a global solution of the problem. Right? But I have to assume. Right? But I have to assume the defocusing and the one-dimensional cubic NLS, but actually it also holds for algebraic NLS if we just take one more derivative. And as a consequence, what we see is that if we take initial data which has any kind of polynomial decay, right, such that some derivatives also have polynomial decay, we immediately get global well-process of the Lambda-Nasch Ring equation. Okay. And the idea is to argue, as in the paper that I spoke about, of Glotson, Software, and Spencer, but with the advantage that the number of derivatives stays bounded as p goes to infinity. And this is basically just due to the fact that we are using here the modulation spaces as the initial value, right? Because in Sobolev spaces, you lose derivatives when you have to bound the Schrodinger property. Okay, so how do we do this? So, how do we do this? Well, basically, we look again at the fixed. So, first of all, we want to find a controlling norm. The controlling norm in this case is just the L infinity in time M infinity 1 norm of the solution, just from the fixed point equation, which means that any uniform in time bound of this norm here implies global work processes. And we also, I mean, I mean, I didn't say that, but we also have. Say that, but we also have a blow-up alternative. Now, the point is that since H1 just embeds into M21, which embeds into M infinity 1, the bound on the energy suffices again. So basically, what we want to do now is argue, as in the proof that I showed you before for the tooth problem, also for modulation spaces. So let's take as an example u0 in M61. New zero in M611, which is basically like L6, but with a bit more regularity. We get a local solution from local theory, there is no problem. And since we solve a fixed point equation perturbatively, what we also get is a series expansion of the solution in terms of homogeneity 2n plus 1, depending on the initial data. On the initial data. And you can also just write. So this really comes from the Banner-Fixed point theorem. You just put the solution into itself all the time. And what you see is that the first order term here is just the linear evolution. The third order term involves this trilinear in U0 and it can be written like this. Well, major can. And the idea is now that if is now that if u0 is like an L6, is in an L6-based space, you can just subtract the first term of the Picker iteration and see that all the other terms will be at least three homogeneous, meaning that they will be in an L2-based symbol space. Not so dev space, but in this modulation space. Okay, and now I will not go into big details here, but I just want to say. Big details here, but I just want to say that you can then again write down the difference equation for that guy here and argue via Kohnberg. And in the more general case, what you do is you just say, okay, you are in some modulation space m4n plus 2, 1 with one derivative. So you consider V being the solution U minus finitely many Picker iterates and you subtract exactly as many. And you subtract exactly as many such that you are in an L2-based space. You write down the difference nonlinear Schrodinger equation that you get. You can explicitly calculate what this difference term is. And then basically you do the same idea, you do the same trick. You look at the Hamiltonian of this difference equation. You calculate and you estimate the time derivative of h, and you see that because H and you see that because you subtracted exactly enough quicker iterates, you can also get some and then as before you can conclude via one by maybe just one word where the one derivative here comes from. It's basically just like in the tooth problem where one has to shift one derivative from the periodic part onto the localized part. You can do the same here, but one derivative has to remain. So, um, is there any question or comment to Reddit? I have one, but you which I call it. I first apologize because I'm not an expert, so it might be that I'm saying nonsense. So Same nonsenses. So, in the fourth problem, you say that you are considering the deformative case, right? For the closes itself. Exactly. But at the very beginning, you were saying that there are conserved quantities, but these are not useful because usually they are not bounded. And my rough idea is that the difference between focusing and de focusing when you consider global webpositiveness is that Your global welfareness is that you can bound from below with the energy somehow, and the conserved quantities help you. So, since in this case you don't have this conserved quantity, I was thinking that maybe the two problems, I mean, promoting and the theory, were kind of at the same level of difficulty. So, the problem is that the Croat argument we need the The Krolwald argument, we need the plus sign in order to estimate the higher origin height. So the terms with higher origin right. Right. So, I mean already here you have already in the derivative of the mass you have like a cubicle. And I mean Krohlwa does not work when you have like a power 2 on the right hand side. Or you need the plus sign here in order to get rid of Here, in order to get rid of that bad terms. I mean, it's true that somehow we are even in a subcritical range, right? So, actually focusing and defocusing. Well, there are some distinction. Yes. The modulation space that you hide in, does it capture? Does it capture the oscillations in space? Yes, yes, it does capture the oscillations. So, for example, the example of the dispersive blow-up is not in the modulation space. If you are in L infinity, you need that two derivatives are also in L infinity in order to be in M infinity one. If you only have one derivative in L infinity, that's not enough, for example. Infinity, that's not enough, for example. And in your construction, are you basically saying, like, really, the linear theory is carrying this oscillation term? Because whenever you subtract, you get something better, right? Yes, yes. Well, yeah. Is it safe to say that? Maybe, I don't, well, it's not so clear to me. Well, it's not so clear to me. So, somehow the reason why we have to subtract all these terms is because we want to look at the energy which is L2 based, right? So, one of the examples you gave, like, the linear flow, I mean, doesn't decay, it keeps the oscillations and that doesn't decay, right? One of the examples you gave at the beginning, by so and And uh yeah I mean locally you can solve the equations anyhow both right and and this this dispersive blow-up phenomenon is really a blow-up that happens in finite time. So I'm I think also I mean also the linear term does not blow blow up in finite time, but it's not uh well it's not clear if it blows up in finite time. I have a question, maybe it's a nice one. Have you thought about the extension of this problem to other domains like cylinders? I have to say we did not really think about that. The future, I mean maybe it would be an interesting problem. maybe would be an interesting problem is I mean so so I mean modulation spaces on the torus are just like Fourier elliptic spaces. There are some results on that as well. And then question comment on here. What about best of spaces? Is it why? Well the the Schrodinger propagator is not bounded in bes of spaces. The reason why it's bounded on modulation spaces is really because you have this you know size decomposition on the Fourier side. And I mean you look at the proof why it's bounded you you need like a yeah you need that the the size of the the decomposition does not grow. Any other question or comment? Or comment? Well, if not with a print again.
