For inviting me here. It's always a pleasure to be such an interesting workshop here in Bath, of course. So, as the title announces, I will speak about the moment problem in the same general setting that Sama introduced this morning, but they did consider the truncated version of it. So, we don't prescribe any more the full sequence of moments, so we don't want to represent the functional definite on the full algebra, but only on a part of it, on a linear subspace. Part of it, on a linear subspace of it. And this is these, the results I will present. I mean, part of the results that I will present are contained in a joint work with Raul Kurto, Mediga Semi, and Salmo Urman. And I think it's the first time I present this work, and they are all present in person in the room. So I'm really happy with you. So let me immediately start by putting ourselves on the same page and so on. Ourself on the same page, and so recalling what is the classical truncated K-model problem. So, we are in the classical multi-dimensional notation here, and we are given a finite sequence, multi-sequence of reals. And this multi-sequence is indexed by this Jn, set of all the D-tuple of non-negative integers whose components sum up to a number smaller or equal than n. So we fix also k. So we fix also K, subset closed subset over T, and we ask if we can find a non-negative Radon measure that is supported inside K whose alpha moment is exactly the alpha entry of this moment. So what we want to do, we want to assign, prescribe a fixed bunch of moments and actually all moments up to order n exactly because of the shape of this Jn here. And now when such a measure exists, it's called a decay-replacement. A measure exists is called a decay-representing measure for M. And I mean, just to connect to the full moment problem, I mean, what does it mean to have the full moment problem? It means just to take prescribe all moments. So, instead of Jn, we take n0 to the power t. So, all the possible detapolumbone negative integers. So, we want to prescribe all sequence of moments. But I will consider this truncated distance. So, this is the classic setting in which the moment problem has been stated in the truncated. As we stated in the truncated case. And now I want to stress a bit the fact that in this classical statement here, we are prescribing all moments up to order n, all of them, starting from the zero moment going up to order n. For instance, if you take dimension 2, what is j2? If you represent the monomial corresponding to the alpha in j2, they are disposed along this triangle here. So these are, if you do the moments of those, you will get. Do the moments of those, you will get the prescribed sequence, right? So we have a triangular problem in the sense that you see we are up to order two, we have all the monomials up to order two. No one is missing. But of course, this is a bit restrictive because we may want to consider also situations like this, for instance. This is called the rectangular truncated moment problem, because you see, we are always in dimension two, for instance. We are always in dimension 2 for simplicity. We take exactly the moments corresponding to the monomial disposite in this rectangle here. So we don't have any more all moments up to order 2, we just have a bunch of them. This rectangle that truncated moment problem was considered, for example, by Mihai Putiner in the 90s already. But we could consider also other situations, like for example a sparse shape of the monomial diagram. So we have staircase, those are called sparse coordinates. Are called sparse connected because all the moments are connected to one along some path, like stairs in the lattice here. And so you see, you prescribe this bunch of moments and you have another kind of truncated moment problem. This was considered especially in the setting of optimization, for example, by Monique Loran and Bernard Muran in the 2010, I believe. But we could consider also other situations that, as far Also, other situations that, as far as we know, were never considered before, like for instance, in for instance, in one dimension here, you prescribe infinitely many moments. So you don't bound the degree in both variables, but just in one, in the y, you have a bounded degree, and instead here you let the degree go. This, for example, could happen, I don't know, when you have some, for example, in signal processing, you manage to In signal processing, you manage to measure in one direction only a bunch of moments because of some limitation of your instrument, I don't know, and in the other instance, you are able to even know what the distribution is, right? So you can prescribe all moments. So also considering such a kind of truncated moment problem makes a lot of sense. So we actually need a slightly more general formulation, but this is easy to be achieved because we can replace our Jn with the general J subset of our Subset of our non-negative tappence of non-negative integers, finite or possibly also infinite. Just we don't want to prescribe the full n-zerit. Okay, but we want also to go to infinite dimensions, as Salmo was presenting this morning. And what we want to do to go before telling you this, I want to tell you that this is also known in the literature. Of course, there is a lot of work on this, and actually, the truncated moment problem when you start with a J that is not necessarily. With a j that is not necessarily the triangle one in dimension two, is called the B truncated k-moment problem. This terminology was introduced by Chi Vangni in 2014 and this B stands for the linear span of the monomials given by your gene. So just to say that this is a terminology, I mean a moment problem that has been already considered. But as I told you, I want to go to infinite dimensions because this statement Because this statement is strongly finite-dimensional in the sense that k is a subset over D, so we are considering monomials in D variables, but we would like also to consider measures supported on infinite-dimensional spaces. So, to go to infinite dimensions, and so to consider also algebras that are not necessarily finitely generated, they are not necessarily the algebra of polynomials in decarical, so we want to replace the algebra. Replace the algebra of polynomials with any other unit of commutative real algebra, it's very helpful to do this step, to look at the functional reformulation that was also explained by Salma this morning, but let us re-look at it in the truncated setting. So we take the B given by the span, linear span of the x alpha, and we consider the functional defined on b, so linear subspace of r of x in the classic. R of x in the classical d-dimensional case, so you easily understand that to go more general, I will take just the linear subspace of K, any unit or commutative algebra. And now the moment problem corresponds exactly to find the measure that represents L as an integer. So now the translation in the general setting is pretty easy because we just replace R of X with the unit of commutative real algebra A. And of course, we need And of course, we need to look at R D in a more general sense to be able to find out where our measures will be supported so that we can also have infinite dimensional settings. So we look at R D like the space of all homomorphisms, real algebra homomorphisms from the algebra of polynomials to R. And what is the natural object to replace with is exactly the character space of A. So the space of all algebra homomorphism. And now what And now, what we need to do, we need to understand who we are integrating. So, here we add polynomials that are integrable because they are continuous functions with respect to the usual product topology of the Euclidean one. So, when I look at polynomial as function, I put a hat, and you all know already from this morning, so that this integral now becomes the integral of the character space of this p hat, and in the general setting this hat is nothing. Setting this X is nothing but the Gelfand transform. So, what we do have is that we are asking that L of B is represented as an integral in the sense that we are integrating the Gelfand transforms on X of A. Clearly, what does it mean to integrate? We do need a sigma algebra, and to construct the sigma algebra, we need a topology. So, on Rd, we had the usual topology that makes all polynomials. Topology that makes all polynomials continuous, so we will take the weakest topology making continuous all the integral functions so that we can integrate simply this. So we do have our general statement also in the truncated case. So you see the difference with this morning is just that the function is defined only on B and not on the full A. Okay, so we wanted to look for solubility criteria for this kind of movement. So what we did, of course, in the classic We did, of course, in the classical settings, even if Salma said this morning is not so beautiful, we do have the Ritz-Avilan theorem that establishes the duality between the solutions to the model problem, to the K-Monum problem, and the non-negativity on the set, I call it the pos of Rx, so the cone of all non-negative polynomials in R of X, okay, non-negative, okay. And this beautiful duality is somehow the building block of all. Is somehow the building block of all the results that then, as some explained this morning, went to sum of squares, so to conditions that are more easy to check. But really, this is the base, like if you don't have this, you cannot go on. And in fact, also in the truncated classical settings, when k is compact, so you see here we are truncated because we are starting with the function of defined on polynomials up to a certain order n. When k is compact, Chakalov could Is compact, Shakalov could prove the exact analog also for the truncated case. So, really, when it's compact, the analog works also in the truncated case. When K is not compact, of course, there are problems because the analog doesn't work so easily anymore, so the exact analog fails. And Gurto and Fiakov in 2008 could prove what is the right analog. So, I mean, the price to pay to have the normal. I mean, the price to pay to have the non-compactness of the support is that if you are defined up to a certain order, even or odd, you have to have a linear extension of your functional that preserves positivity. And the extension has to go up to two degree higher, I mean one degree if you are odd, two degree if you're starting from the even one. So you see that compact and non-compact are in nature different, and so we expect this also to happen in infinite. Also, to happen in infinite dimensions. And of course, our aim was to find an analog, like the first beginning of analyzing this kind of truncated moment problem, was to find an analogue of the Ritz-Avin theorem also in the B-truncated k-movement problem. And what does it mean, the corn of non-negative polynomials here, the corresponding is exactly this cos BK, that is the set of all the elements of the linear subspace where your functional is defined, such that the Defined such that the B hat is non-negative on K, the Gelfand transform is non-negative. When this happens, when L is non-negative on this pulse, I call it K positive. In the talk I will use this sometimes to shorten the notation. Okay, so what we tried first, we tried to see the compact case. And we could show in this article that I mentioned to you before, that what you need to do if K is compact in this general setting, that they Fact in this general setting, that the k-positivity is equivalent to the existence of a representing measure if there exists an element of the domain of the functional such that the Gelfand transform is strictly positive. This is the unique thing, unique assumption that you need to show that the analog of the read subinoc. And this result is actually coming out from a combination of two results. So the first one is So, the first one is a solution to the betruncated moment problem in case of a semi-normal algebra. So, an algebra with a sub-multiplicative sign. If you have this, then we could find out that having a representative measure, that this condition here, you see it's just a bound on the linear functional, is equivalent to get a representative measure on the Gelfand spectrum that I define it here, so the set of all the Finite year, so the set of all the alpha that are raw continuous, the so-called Gelfand spectrum, intersected the non-negativity set of KS. So the set of all characters that are non-negative on S. S here is a quadratic module that I defined here, the first one. So misclosed under addition and under multiplication by squares of the algebra. And this special seminar here is given. Seminorm here is given, you see, by the infimum of rho of g plus h. I mean, these are technical questions, just keep in mind that when there is a semi-norm, so when it's a semi-normate algebra, so a seminorm that is some multiplicative, you need just one condition to get the representing measure, and you can perfectly identify the sample. Combining this with a classical result, a Shoquer lemma, that allows to extend the linear function, we could actually find exactly a Find exactly our result. How we did this, so we started from L and we used the Q to extend it to the algebra of continuous functions of K. K is compact, so these are continuous bounded functions, right? And then you have a semi-normate algebra by taking just the supreme norm, okay? And so we could extend it thanks to the Shoke lemma, and then we could use our result that when you plug in exactly the supreme norm and Exactly, the supremum norm and S to be the sum of squares gives you exactly the K. So it turns out to be just the K representing essential. Now, if we come back, just to do a sanity check, let's come back to the finite dimensions. And what happens in finite dimensions is the following, that here, if you have in the classical truncated case, the one is always present inside it. And you see that the one makes the job of the Q, right? The job of the Q, right? Because it's always strictly positive. So whenever there is the 1 in your B, you are safe. And so we get back Chakalov theorem. And you can easily see that we get the rectangular truncated moment problem because the one considered by Putiner, so we retrieved the results by Putin are here because the one is inside, right? So you find easily your Q, Q. The same you can do here when you have a sparse path. Do here when you have a sparse spot connected to one. So, whenever you have such kind of Bs that were considering by Monique Loran and Bernard Moren in 2009, you also get the results as a special case because the one is inside. And what about the sparse hybrid situation that I told you was not considered before? Well, also here, the fact that you are infinite in one dimension doesn't influence you at all. Influence you at all because, anyway, you have the one, so just what you need is to find such a Q, and you are already in this SEK, right? Okay, then what about infinite dimensionals? As I told you, we were interested also in solving infinite-dimensional instances of the truncated gay-movement problem. And this is because there are some problems in statistical mechanics, called, for example, realizability problem, where you can reduce your Where you can reduce yourself to, I mean, I don't have much time to tell you all the details, but you can reduce yourself to a trotated moment problem for measures supported on subset of signed Radon measures. So what is the hardest thing to prove here is to find that a subset of Radon measures can be embedded in a character space of an algebra. And which algebra we were going to consider? Well, we took m of x, the space of all the. M of x for the space of all sine and radon measures supported in x. So x is just Auschwitz locally compact. And we took the vague topology. The vague topology is the smallest topology that makes all the integrals of continuous functions with compact support on x continuous. Okay, how to find an algebra now? Well, we constructed an algebra in an almost natural way because what we do, well, we consider our monomials. We consider our monomials, this will be a monomial of order n, just by integrating. So, the coefficient of this monomial will be a function with compact support in n variables, and we consider the integral with respect to the product measure. So, this will be the corresponding of x to the power n. And now, what is the algebra? The algebra is the algebra of all polynomials in the variable mu, that now is a measure. So, you That now is a measure. So you can look at them if you want as polynomials in one variable, where the variable is a measure and the coefficients are functions. So you see, it's an algebra of, I mean, you can verify that this is an algebra with the natural product of those monomials. And this is topologically embedded in the character space of P. This takes a proof, of course, but this can show to be true. And now we do have that any case. We do have that any k closed inside m can be embedded as a closed subset of the character space, and so our results can be applied. So whenever you have a functional on those special polynomials in measured variables up to order n, then we do have that there exists a representing measure for n, just up to because the one is inside those polynomials. And this could retrieve in particular some results that were proven by Results that were proven by Tobias Kuna, Joe Lebovitz, and Eugene Spears that work in statistical physics from a more mathematical point of view for compact subset of this set here that is called point configuration space. And if you look at it, it is the sum of Dirac measure and sequences that are either finite or infinite without accumulation points. And those are representing exactly, for example, the positions of particles. For example, the positions of particles when you look at the fluid. So you can have the configuration of these particles will be one element here. All the possible configurations are represented by this space. So what happens in the non-compact case? So let me spend just my remaining time about the non-compact case. The situation is more complicated. So first of all, here, what we need to do when we Here, what we need to do when we have a non-compact closet subset is to consider a Q that we need to consider a Q that you see as more complicated properties than before. So, we need to assume that the Q doesn't belong to B, that is again a That is again strictly, I mean, strictly positive or greater or equal than 1. We took this just for convenience in the proof. The 1 has to be inside the linear span of B when you put inside also the Q and the BQ has to generate A. Also, this Q has to be chosen in a way that this Gelfand transform is able to bound all the Gelfand transforms of the elements in B. Of the elements in B. So you see, there are more assumptions needed. And of course, you understand that this comes out from the fact that you don't have any more decompactness. So, in a certain sense, you are weaker, right? So, you need to impose more. And then you see here exactly the analogue that we had in the Kultu-Fjakov theorem in the non-compact case. So, you need to ask an extension, but an extension to what? To the linears, to the BQ, so to the linear span of B adjoint Q. So, the proof goes more or less. So, the proof goes more or less in the same spirit of the one of the compact case. What happens is that from this extension, we extend the functional to a subspace of the algebra continuous bounded function Ok and then we can extend this function using this four conditions in a way that is positive on the compactification of k so you are back Of case. So you are back in the compact case. You use the previous result and you get a representing measure that now represents your extension, so represents also L, but the support is in the compactification. So actually those conditions play an even more important role when it comes to the support, because you need to localize exactly inside K. So the hardest part of the proof to say is really to show that the support is contained in K and so it's zero in. And so it's zero in the rest of the compactification. But let's go to see what this gives in finite dimensions. So when we are in the finite dimensional case, so here we have polynomials up to degree 2n plus i, I mean i can be 0 or 1, you easily see that there are two conditions of these four that are trivially satisfied, right? The 1 is always inside, so condition 2 is gone, and also the b. And also the B always generates the full space of polynomials, right? So two and three are trivially always satisfied in the finite region case. But what about the one and the four? Well, of course if you are given, I mean this is a pretty easy lemma to be shown, if you are given a polynomial up to a certain degree, a subset of polynomials up to a certain degree, then you can always find one of larger degree. Of larger degree, one or two degree larger, depends if k is auto or even, such that p is greater or equal to one globally. And also, this bounds all the polynomials that were in p because they were up to order k. So, you understand that this is not too hard to be proven. And this automatically tell us which queue we have to pick. We have to pick exactly the one coming. Of course, it depends on the order. We have the explicit construction, it's free of computation. Is free of computation. So we really can get back the Gurto and Fyrkov theorem, but notice we have a slight improvement, right? Because in the Gurtu and Fyrkov theorem you had to find an extension, k positive, to the full algebra of polynomials of one or two degree higher. But here you not need to extend so much. You need just to put inside one polynomial. So you need to do the linear span of B adjoint one. Of B adjoint one polyrhomia. So it's a slight improvement, of course, but the extension that you need to look for is a smaller extension. And with the same technique, of course, you can find a P that satisfies also the rectangular, because they are a bunch of polynomials of a certain degree. It doesn't matter if they are all of them up to degree n or in a rectangular shape or in a sparse-connected shape. But for the hybrid situation, we don't Situation, we don't get it because, in the hybrid situation, we have the non-compactness. So, in the direction in which you are unbounded, in the degree, of course, you don't have any more the compactness that helps you, right? So, the only thing that we managed to show is that if you have a kind of cylindrical situation, so if your K can be splitted in two components, so that in the you see here in the first D components, the degree can go. First, the D components of the degree can go up to infinity, but here in the Y's, you are bounded in the degree. And so, if your K can be splitted in a way that where you are unbounded in the degree, you are compact, and you are non-compact in the rest, where you are bounded in the degree, you see that you have a balance, and you can manage anyway to satisfy that fourth condition, that is the main problem, the one that you bound, also the one that are unbounded in the degree. Unbounded in the degree. So we could somehow apply, combine the two results to get also in this non-compact situation that has some compactness here, so some cylindrical situation. And then, always in the infinite-dimensional settings, I mean in these applications that I mentioned to you in statistical mechanics, it happens that sometimes you want. You want, you have some constraints in the physical settings that force you to be in a compact subset of this n of x of the configuration spaces, and some other times you don't know. So you are happy just to have a measure supported on the full point configuration space. You don't know what is exactly, but you are happy to know that there exists one, right? But the problem is that now n of x is non-compact. So we wish to apply our theorem for the non-compact case. Theorem for the non-compact case, and this, I have to say, was not so easy to be done because you may think, well, what's the problem? Just take again A equal to P and then, for example, just for simplicity now, let's take polynomials up to degree 2. Then, okay, you have, I'm distinguishing the case x compact and x non-compact, but I mean, this is because here we have also another infinite dimensional level, right? Because you have measures. Right? Because you have measures on x, so x can also be compact and non-compact, but n of x remains non-compact in both cases. So you may think that this works. So I take a q of third degree, this will bound on the polynomial simply 2, but there is one condition that doesn't hold anymore, that the b q doesn't anymore generate to the full algebra. And of course, you understand why this happens, because we are not anymore in the classical setting. Anymore in the classical setting. The coefficients are not real numbers. So when you multiply a function in two variables with the function in three variables, of course this is a function with compact support in five variables, but you don't get all of them. They are dense, right? So you don't get just the multiplication of all of them. So to resolve this problem, what we did, well, we said while we have necessarily to take IP, we can choose another algebra. And the algebra we chose is a smaller one. Is a smaller one. So it's the algebra generated by this set here. So we take, you see, all polynomials up to degree 2, so that the b is inside it. And we also take here, f3 now is just a real number, times the characteristic function supported on x. x is compact, so you understand that this is a function with compact support, continuous, beautiful. So we take just a lit this little piece more and we take the algebra general. We take the algebra general. And now, if we take Q to be this one here, so you see here we are Q eta. Remember, eta is a measure and this is a continuous function, it's a free variable now, then the VQ generates the delay exactly because VQ is nothing but the R that we chose. So doing this clever choice, what happens is that you can exactly find the extension that you want, the linear extension. Of course, combined with the possibility. Of course, combined with the positivity is always you have to ask. And these retrieves were results by Kuna-Lekowitz and Speer of 2011 that they could show this result, but with completely different methods using Daniel's theory of integration. And so somehow, I mean, we were comforted that we could get back also in the non-compact case from our result this. And the same trick you use when you have X non-compact. When X is non-compact, you When x is non-compact, you just need to modify a bit because, of course, you cannot take anymore the characteristic function, because it's not anymore with compact support. But if you take a gamma here that is just C0, so vanishing at infinity, then you will get again the same work. And this allows you to get also in the non-compact case very sad. So I finish here, and just what I want to mention is that we know that this is. To mention is that we know that this is just a first step because we do know that the Reich Savin theorem, as Samoa was underlying, is not explicit, right? Those conditions are not really explicit. So, we wish that we can do this for squares in these infinite-dimensional settings, for quadratic models, and get more concrete conditions. But of course, the first step was to prove analog. And another question that is open, and we really hope to manage to approach. To manage to approach to is so far, I didn't put any topology on A or on B. So, what if we put some topology? Does this somehow help to simplify this condition? This for assumption that we have, for example, in the non-compact case? This is really an unexplored world. So, I stop here, and sorry to go one minute or two. Are there any quick questions? Just one quick question. So the shape of K does not matter, right? So was it a sphere, was it a solid ball? Yeah, so for the Ritzavillant theorem, no, it doesn't matter. Just compactness and no compactness. But I suppose that, like, in the finite-dimensional case, the shape will really, the geometry will c will play a role in the final dimension. So by the case. And so on. Okay, we signed up for the next talk by Vadim Kaimanovich on colored random walls. Yeah, can we maybe leave the Yeah, can we maybe lift the screen? And now the recording type of thing. Okay, thank you very much. So the title of my talk is Coward Random Walk, but actually what happened is that I had to submit the title, I think, about three months ago. I think about three months ago, and just have to properly imagine what he will be talking about in such a distant future. And I will mention Coward random walks. However, Coward will not be the only tool on my panel. So I will talk about more general tools. More general tools arising in relation to the theory of random walls and in their applications to self-similar groups. So let me begin from the very beginning, from the symmetric group. So let's take a finite set and then we can look at the At the resulting symmetry group, at the group of permutations of this finite set. And it is convenient to represent this group in algebraic way, namely instead abstract permutations to consider the resulting permutation matrices. So for instance, something like this. Something like this. So this is the matrix which represents the permutation which does what it sends 1 to 2. That's this one. Then it sends 2 to 3 and then back 3 to 1. So it represents this cycle, 1, 2, 3. Okay, now one additional ingredient will be a group. Will be a group. And by adding this group, I can now consider what I will, for simplicity, call the group of generalized promotions. Or, more formal name will be the permutational reef product. It will simply be the group of matrices like these ones, like permutation matrices. So there is only one non-zero element in each row and each column. However, these non-zero elements now are no longer necessarily Are no longer necessarily ones, but they will be elements of my group. So these will be matrices, let's say, if the cardinality of X is still free. So these will be matrices like this. So G1, G two, G three. So in other words, And then I can still multiply these matrices in the usual way, precisely because underlying ones are permutation matrices, so that I don't have to do any sums when doing this multiplication. So in other words, it means that additionally I assign two errors in my permutation, transitions in my permutation. Transitions in micromutation, I assign labels which are group elements. So I guess that's a reef product of the group? That's permutational reef product. It would have been a reef product if X itself were a group, but now X is a homogeneous space of the permutation group. Okay, and now I'm ready to. Now I'm ready to talk about self-similarity, so let me quote an early description. Well, that's the earliest I could find, but I'm sure that one can find something more ancient, let's say, in Greek philosophers. So, naturalists observe a flea, a smaller fleas that Have smaller fleas that on him prey, And these have smaller still to bite them, And so proceed at infinitum. So that's Jonathan Swift from 1733, shortly before he developed science of madness. And I'm sorry for the biased language he used by. Used by employing the generic masculine, he. Nowadays, he would have said he or she, of course. Okay, so now how shall I formalize all this? So x is still a finite set. Now I can see that that's what was already described by Valodia. Described by Valodia, so I will repeat it once again. So I consider this set of all words, all finite words, including the empty one, which has a natural structure of a rooted tree. And then what happens if I have an What happens if I have an automorphism of this rooted tree? Then, of course, it preserves the root, because it's distinguished. And then also it preserves each of the levels of the tree. So, in particular, it preserves the first level, and therefore it acts by a permutation. So, one should think, in the language of Swift, one should think about the elements of X as those.
