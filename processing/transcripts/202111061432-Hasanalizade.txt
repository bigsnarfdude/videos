Work with Chang Li Shen and NJ Wong. One of the main directions of investigation in the theory of the Riemann zeta function is the study of zeros of zeta s. In this talk, we shall discuss the problem of counting zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the behavior of the argument of zeta s on the Zeta S on the vertical line real part of s equals half. We begin by recalling the definition of the Riemann zeta function. The Riemann zeta function is defined by the following relation, which has an analytic continuation to the whole complex plane with only a simple pole at s equals 1. We know that delta s has trivial zeros at s equals minus 2, minus 4, minus 6, and so forth, and non-trivial zeros. So forth, and non-trivial zeros in the so-called critical strip, real part of S between zero and one. The Riemann hypothesis states that the non-trivial zeros of zeta s lie on the so-called critical line real part of s equals half. It's widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in pure mathematics. Although this famous hypothesis is Although this famous hypothesis has not been proved or disproved, Plott and Trujan verified numerically that the Riemann hypothesis is true up to 3 times 10 to the power 12. So the next figure is from the book Equivalence of the Riemann Hypothesis by Kevin Burhan. It includes some of the contours for the absolute value of Zeta S. Absolute value of zeta is. We see the first three zeros on the critical line surrounded by closet curves. So the ordinate of the first non-trivial zero is about 14.13 and the imaginary parts of the second and third zeros are about 21.02 and 25.01 respectively. Respectively. For a positive t, which differs from the imaginary part of any zero of zeta s, we denote by n t the number of zeros rho in the rectangle real part of s between zero and one and imaginary part positive and less than or equal t. The study of NT has a long history. An asymptotic formula had been announced by Formula had been announced by Riemann without proof in 1859 in his famous pass-breaking nine-pages article. And this asymptotic formula had been proved by von Mann Gold, first with an error term of size big O log squared. In a later paper in 1905, Mangold was able to diminish the Diminish the error term in his formula, and he obtained the following evaluation. So now we have the error term of size pig O log t. 13 years later, Becklund improved Mangrod's result by proving the following formula. So we have improved error term here. And if If we write the difference between NT and the main term in the asymptotic formula in the following way, the first table summarizing the progress that has been made. As you might have noticed from this table, Rosser improved Backlund's result, but since he followed mainly Backlund's argument, he got on Backlund's argument, he got only improvement only in the constant term and in the range of team. Before stating our main results, we shall note that explicit bounds for NT are of great interest, both as a purely function theoretic property of Zeta S and because they are crucial for estimating sums over zeros. sums over zeros and all best known bounds for prime counting functions such as pi of x and psi of x rely on them so we proved the following general result for n team with explicit bounds on with explicit dependence on the given bounds on of z on both one line On both one line and half line. Mainly, let C1, C2, and K1, K3 be non-negative constants and K2 between 0 and half, T0, T1 greater or equal E, such that we have the following bounds for zeta on one line and half line. And let T0 be fixed. Then for any T greater or equal T0, we have the following. The following estimate. Here C1 and C2, C3 are explicitly computable constants depending on C1, C2, K1, K2, K3, T0, T1, and capital T0 and some additional parameters. Note that Patel in 2020 showed that for T greater or equal 3, we have the following upper bound for. Upper bound for zeta on one line, and here we in 2016 to show it that for t greater or equal three, we have the following bound for zeta on half line. So the next table shows some admissible values for C1, C2, C3 with various choices of parameters. As a consequence, we obtained the following. We obtained the following explicit estimate for Nt. For N greater or equal E, we have that the absolute value of the difference between NT and the main term is less than or equal to this expression. Note that this constant is the smallest that can be obtained by our argument and computation and the values of C2 and C3 can be made. And C3 can be made small at the expense of larger C1. Another important function in conjunction with NT is ST. So we define ST as follows. So if T is not the ordinate of a zero, S t is defined as follows. Where delta L argument zeta s indicates a continuous variation in the argument of zeta s as s moves. As S moves along the following paths from 2, where the argument is defined to be 0, to 2 plus IT and then to half plus IT. We have the following theorem concerning ST on the following theorem concerning the argument of Z along the critical line. So in the notation and assumption, So, in the notation and assumption of theorem 1, for any t greater or equal to 0, we have absolute value of st is less than this expression, where again c1, c2, and c3 are some constants, explicitly computable constants with dependence on some additional parameters. We have the following counterpart for Counterpart for ST, we have an explicit estimate for ST. So for any t greater or equal E, we have for various choices of parameters, we obtained the following explicit estimate for ST. So one of the important directions of investigation for ST is the growth, the study of the growth of this function. The correct order of the growth of this function remains unknown. Function remains unknown at present, but we have some results. For example, Montgomery showed that assuming the Riemann hypothesis, ST, he proved the following omega result. And some in 1986 unconditionally proved the following omega estimate. So these omega estimates show that ST is a strongly oscillating function changing. Oscillating function changing sign infinitely often. And Kagnaro, Chandi, and Nilanovich in 2013 showed that under the Riemann hypothesis, absolute value of ST is less than this expression, where the little O1 was shown to be of size big O log log log T over log log T. Platinum Trojan showed in 2005. Show it in 2015 showed that for t greater or equal E, we have the following explicit estimate for S T. But unfortunately, there is a mistake in the paper as pointed out by Bennett et al. The largest observed for ST is about 3.3455. For T, approximately 7.5 For T approximately 7.75 times 10 to the power 27, a strong estimate for S T up to a certain height can be confirmed using the database of non-trivial zeros. So nowadays we have due to plot, we have that absolute value of t is less than or equal 2.5167 for t in this range. Now let me show you how to get the main term in the asymptotic formula for NT and how to get a crude bound for ST. The assertion of the next theorem is called the Riemann-Von-Mangold formula. So we have NT for NT, we have the following asymptotic formula. So this part is main term. Main term, it's very predictable and roughly linear. And this part ST, and it, as I said, it has oscillations. And for ST, we have that ST is of the size big O log T. The proof presented here is due to a backlund. So nowadays is actually a classic. Nowadays, it's actually a classic proof. So let D be the rectangle. Well, suppose that t is greater than 3, and let d be the rectangle with the vertices 2 plus it, minus 1 plus it, minus 1 minus it, and 2 minus it in that order. So the completed Riemann data function is defined by the following formula, where gamma z is the gamma function. Z is the gamma function. So Ïˆ is an entire function, and the complex zeros of zeta s are identical in position and multiplicity with those of xi. And the function psi has two times nt zeros in the interior of d and none on the boundary of nt. The cautious are. n t. By the Cauchy's argument principle, we have that n t equals 1 over 4 pi times imaginary part of the following integral of the logarithmic derivative of psi along d. So with eta in this form, we may write the logarithmic derivative of psi as follows. So it's obvious that imaginary but straightforward calculations Straightforward calculations, one can check that imaginary part of the integral of this term, 1 over s plus 1 over s minus 1, is 4 times pi. Now, since eta s satisfied the following functional equation, and eta sigma plus minus it are conjugates, we have that imaginary part of the logarithmic derivative. The logarithmic derivative of the integral of the logarithmic derivative around d is actually four times imaginary part of the logarithmic derivative along the broken line from two to two plus it and then to half plus it. Now we may write an imaginary part of the integral integral of the logarithmic derivative of eta along this broken line in the following way. So since imaginary part of the integral of the logarithmic derivative of gamma fact gamma function equals imaginary part of logarithm of gamma. Well actually we have also minus imaginary part of A minus imaginary part of logarithm gamma at one, but since it's zero, we have only this. And using the following, the so-called Steeling formula, well, as s tends to infinity, and this formula is uniform in any angle absolute value of argument s less than y. So it follows that for imaginary part of the The integral of the logarithmic derivative, we have this, and this gives us actually the main term. So by the previous formulas, like by 2, 1, 2, 2, and 2, 3. So if we gather all that formulas, we may write NT in the following way. So this gives us the main term and these error terms. Now note that this part is Now, note that this part is actually ST in view of these equalities. Since we may write this in the following way, since this is the derivative of argument of zeta s, so we can write this as logarithm of logarithm of zeta s, and we may write logarithm of zeta s as logarithm of absolute well of zeta s min plus. Zeta s plus I times argument of Zeta S. And since we take imaginary part, only this part left. So we can, this is S t. Now the question, how to bound S t? Well, for that, the main idea of Becklund's method is to count the number of zeros of real part of that sigma. Zeta sigma plus it on the line segment half plus it to two plus it. And for that, we recall the following corollary of the Janssen formula. So let R be positive and F is a holomorphic in the disk centered at S0 with radius R. And suppose that it has at least N zeros. 10 zeros in the smaller disk with radius r. Well, multiple zeros counted according to their order of multiplicity. And if we assume that f does not vanish at s0, then we have the following inequality, where m is the maximum of the absolute value of s on the boundary of disk, like on this circle. So by taking Lagrange. So, by taking logarithms of both sides, we can get an estimate for the number of zeros in this disk. We also need the following estimate for Zeta S. Well, not the best one, but it's enough to get a cool down for S team. So, if delta is a fixed number between zero and one, then in this region, sigma this region, sigma greater or equal delta, and t greater or equal one, we have the following explicit estimate for absolute value of zeta s. Now let n be the number of zeros of real part of zeta sigma plus it, between 2 plus it and half plus it. Now these zeros divide the interval into n plus 1 sub-intervals. An argument of that s And argument of Z cannot change more than pi in each sub-interval. So we have pi times st, which is imaginary part of logarithmic derivative of zeta along L, is less than or equal n plus one times pi. Now we apply the Karolof-Jansen's formula to the function, to this function, to this observation. function to this function, to this auxiliary function, and to the two disks. So s minus two. So we have two concentric circles and with outer radius seven over four and inner radius three over two. And note that F at sigma is actually a real part of zeta sigma plus Rt. And F at two is a real part of Zeta 2. part of that is 2 plus it it's greater than half so if the this condition condition that f doesn't vanish at the center of circle is satisfied and since t is greater than 3 we suppose that t is greater than 3 so our function is also regular so we may apply apply this lemma so if we use in addition the estimate for zeta s with fixed delta With fixed delta, so in this case, it's enough to take, for example, quarter, we get this inequality. And again, just taking logarithms, we arrive at the following estimate for n. So for t weighted than 11 million. So st absolute value of st is less than eight times log t. Now, this is very crude bound. Is very crude bound and how to improve this? So Beckland used a clever observation nowadays called Beckland's trick. So for any delta between zero and half plus eta, where eta is a fixed number between zero and half, if we let argument plus delta let argument plus zeta s denote the change of argument zeta s as sigma varies from half plus half plus delta and argument minus zeta s the change in argument of z as sigma varies from half to half minus delta then backward was able to show that for t greater than one we have that some of these argument changes doesn't exceed Doesn't exceed 8 over t. And using these facts, was able to show that there are at least n minus 2 zeros of real part of zeta s on this line segment. And so we have at least two times two n minus two zeros of real parts of zeta s for sigma between for sigma in this range. Sigma in this range, on this line sigma, minus eta, one plus eta. So using this clever observation by Klutwik, he was able to get his specific explicit estimates for NT and ST. Now, Ross Ser, he used as an auxiliary function, he considered this one. So instead of just Zeta S plus IT, we have Zeta S plus IT. we have z s plus it raised to the power n, where n is from some specific later we can take n as from specific sequence. And he also applied Becklund's tweak. Since he followed closely Becklund's argument, as I mentioned previously, he got only improvement on the C3 or constant term and only on the range. Trigerm, he used as an auxiliary function. He used as an auxiliary function, he used this one. So we also have these additional factors. And he also had his general version of Backlund Sweak. In addition, he used the following sub-convexity bounds. He used the following estimate for zeta on one line. But unfortunately, these bounds are no longer valid because they Longer valid because they are based on Chan and Graham's estimates. Also, as pointed out by Bennett et al., there is an error in Trajan's result since the ranges of parameters involved in his proof were not verified properly. So, what was our approach? So, we used the same auxiliary function as Trojan. So, we used We used this function, but we used our version, well, our version of backlones tweak with better choices of parameters. In addition, we used subconvex bounds for data together with the fragment Lindelof principle. So we used the version Trajan's version. Trigon's version of Fragment-Landel's principle and the functional equation. So we obtained a sharper estimate for Zeta S in the critical sweep. And based on the ideas of Bennett et al., we refined the bound for Z on half plane real part of S less than zero by bounding zeta over this half plane, real part of S less than minus half. Than minus half, and also we use correct bounds for Zeta S on the both half line and one line due to Hiari and Patel. So yeah, and just want to mention that our paper has been accepted and it's available on JNT online. So, yeah, I think that. Yeah, I think that do I have? Oh, I think that that's enough. So I can just stop here. So, not being out of time. Thank you very much. Any questions? Or any questions for activism in this room? How about online participants?
