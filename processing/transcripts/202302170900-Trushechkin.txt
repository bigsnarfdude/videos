Such an interesting conference where speakers in person and online are in some harmony. I think it's quite difficult to organize a conference where both types of participation are in some harmony. And we online participants do not feel very good participating here. So, thank you very much. Here, so thank you very much. Now, let's start the talk. In this talk, I shall consider mainly one exactly solvable model of open quantum dynamics, model of a pure decoherence. I uh shall say mm literally two words about another exactly solvable model, a spin boson model under rotating wave approximation and zero temperature baths. Approximation and zero temperature bath. This talk is based on very recent and very, how to say, current results, not completely, not finished. So probably this talk will contain more open questions than some final results or some final theory. So I thought it would be better to tell about my current. Tell about my current research and thoughts, then to tell about some older results. Okay, I will be interested here in two issues. The first one is long-time Markovianity. So we know that the description of Markovian systems is relatively simple. There are various concepts of Markovianity, many concepts due to talk by Angel Drivas, for example, and other speakers. In this talk, I shall mainly adopt the notion of semi-group. So if the dynamics is governed by a semi-group, then I shall speak that it is Markovian. Generalization to other kinds of Markovianity, for example, quantum regression theory. For example, quantum regression theorem are also possible. The researcher, as I said, is current, is in progress. So if we have a description of dynamics as a semi-group, it's rather simple, but the general non-Markovian dynamics is complicated, complicated for description and for tomography of processes. But the question is, probably under certain conditions, Probably under certain conditions, the non-Markovian dynamics tends to the Markovian one for long times at arbitrary system bath coupling constants. I schematically draw such a picture, so schematic dependence of density matrix of the system from time. So initially we have some complicated non-Markovian dynamics, and after some time, on large time, After some time, on large times, we have approximately exponential relaxation governed by a semi-group. In exactly solvable models, under certain conditions, we can find such a behavior. So it may be useful for process description and process tomography. So if we can use the complicated non-Markovian descriptions just on a bounded restriction. A bounded restricted time interval and then switch to a simpler Markovian description. But of course, the general question is it would be good if it is a general phenomenon. And the second issue is Markovian embedding. A popular approach to non-Markovian dynamics is to embed it into the Markovian one. Markovian one. Let's see on the left side of the picture, you have a system which interacts in a non-Markovian way with the environment. And some approaches move in such a way. Let's consider some extended system as prime, maybe it's a part of the environment. Such that the system and the extended part of the system interact in a non-Markovian manner, but the enlarged system interacts with the rest of the reservoir in a Markovian manner. So we increase the dimensionality of the system. But such a large system interacts in a Markovian manner. A reaction coordinate method presented by Nicola Antos. Nikola Anto Strikac is exactly about this to distinguish some effective reservoir degrees of freedom which interact in a Markovian manner with the rest of the reservoir. Also, pseudo-mode method is also about this. Also, some empiric models of effective environment. So, when we construct some kind of effective environment. Kind of effective environment using the observable data. There is a huge number of works about the effective environment. Let me mention just one of the speakers of the conference, Sergei Filipov, and his former student, Ilya Luchnikov. But the crucial question is, is such embedding always possible? And we will see that the answer, unfortunately, is no. Such models which can be embedded into market. Can be embedded into Markovian ones is only a restricted class of models. Generally, such embedding is not possible. So, non-Markovian dynamics is richer than such class of models. And also, in the same point in the same issue, it's interesting to discuss limitations of quantum master equation approach for weak coupling limit, for well-known weak coupling limit. Okay, let's start with the decoherence. Let's start with the decoherence model: system plus bus plus interaction. A system is just a two-level system, a qubit. Sigma Z is the Pauli matrix. Bus consists of a number of harmonic oscillators. Now, let's assume that the number is finite. Then we go to the inter-thermodynamic limit. Eter-thermodynamic limit n goes to infinity. One can start directly from a continuum of oscillators, but in some cases it's important to start directly from the continuum or number of oscillators. But here it's okay for me to start firstly in order to avoid some difficulties with the start from the finite number and then pass to the thermodynamic limit and the direction in a linear and direction. In linear interaction with respect to the ladder operators and sigma z interaction with the system. So, and we consider initial state, some arbitrary initial state of the system and thermal state of the bath. Since the Hamiltonian commutes with sigma z, this model is exactly solvable. All popu uh the populations of both energy levels are constant. Energy levels are constant and only decoherence takes place. And one can show that we will work on the interaction picture. It's a very well-known result that coherence of diagonal element of the density matrix behaves like this. There is an exponent of the function gamma from T, and the function gamma is related to this coefficients. Is related to this coefficients g k's here, or it can be expressed via spectral spectral density. Spectral density in such a way, spectral density is a sum of delta functions. And now, after we traced out the path, let's assume that the number of modes Of modes tends to infinity, and we assume that J spectral density converges to a continuous and integrable on a half-line function. Let me denote such J times cotangens, hyperbolic cotangens, by effective spectral density as a common notation. Um common notation. And then physically, we expect full decoherence so that of diagonal elements tends to zero as time goes to infinity. But for mathematically, we see that it's not always the case. If a ratio of the effective spectral density and omega squared is integrable, then cosine is a rapidly oscillating function as time. Rapidly oscillating function as time goes to infinity, and we obtain that this gamma function tends to a constant, not to infinity, and so the of diagonal elements tends to also to a non-zero constant. It's from one side, this is a known result. From the other side, I think it's not widely known, so it's instructive to recall it. And general analysis of the existence of the conditions under which full decoherence occurs, and if it occurs, that. occurs and if it occurs that what is what is the rate of the full decoherence is required such questions are were analyzed by robert alitsky and by marko merkley and co-workers in these uh papers but probably not in so details like in the following theorem so uh theorem uh part one um Part one. We assume that the spectral density is an integrable on half-line and continuously differentiable in a vicinity of zero. In some vicinity of zero. Then everything depends on the behavior of the spectral density in the vicinity of zero. If it is behaves like the power greater than two, so highly super ohmic spectral density, then there is. ohmic spectral density, then there is no full decoherence, only partial decoherence where we have already analyzed this case. Then if the spectral density is omic, behaves linearly with respect to omega, then we obtain exponential decoherence where the exponent is related to the value. Is related to the value of the effective spectral density at zero, and also there is a power law term, and the power is related to the derivative of the spectral density, effective spectral density in zero. Then, if it is exactly the spectral density behaves like the second power of omega, then there is still full decoherence. There is still full decoherence, so that the boundary case between partial decoherence here, the power is greater than two, and here power is one. If power is two, then there is full decoherence, but only power law, but only according to the power law, without the exponential term, because the value of effective j is at zero, is zero. If we do J, if we consider more general dependence to the power one plus delta, where delta is from minor plus one. So this includes both sub ohmic case and slightly super ohmic case. Then the decoherence is sub-exponential for superohmic case. So if the power of omega is greater than one and super exponential. Than one and super exponential, so faster than exponential for the sub ohmic case. For example, if there is a square root of omega here. So, this is a picture. Probably the theorem is complicated for the first reading. So, this is a schematic picture. J from omega behaves like omega to the power of alpha if the power from zero to one through omega. To one su omic case, then the decoherence behaves like this, for example, square root of omega, then the decoherence is super exponential. If it is omic, then the decoherence is exponential. If it is the powers from zero, from one to two, then the decoherence is sub-exponential. If exactly two, it's according to the power law. And if the power is greater than two, then If the power is greater than two, then there is no full coherence, only partial coherence. So, as far as I understand, as far as I know, I've never seen such a theorem. Please tell me if it is a known result. So, the model is, of course, very well known, but I've never seen a theorem with such details. Let me skip the proof. Let me skip examples as well. Okay, neither examples are good. So let's consider exponential spectral density. In such exponential ohmic spectral density, we obtain such a decoherence exponential term and power law term. Let's consider Drude de Lorenz spectral density. Then there is no derivative is equal to zero, and we obtain purely exponential behavior. Exponential behavior. So if omega large, omega large is a characteristic frequency of the bus. If omega large is large, so this means that the reservoir is fast, Markovian limit, then this difference is negligible. So the power law term is smaller, can be neglected. But if omega is not large, then this difference is essential. An interesting observation that An interesting observation that on large times, just two parameters: the effective spectral density at zero and its derivative at zero, define the whole dynamics of decoherence for an arbitrary coupling constant. So on large times, just two parameters define the large time behavior of the not other details of the spectral density for arbitrary large, for arbitrary coupling system path coupling constant. It's instructive here to discuss the applicability of the weak coupling limit. In the weak coupling limit, so if the interaction Hamiltonian is scaled by the infinitesimal parameter lambda, then in this limit, as we know from the well known Davies theory, only the value of the effective spectral density at zero matters. At zero matters. The derivative does not matter. If the value of the effective spectral density is zero, then according to the weak coupling limit, there is no decoherence at all. And if it's positive, then the decoherence is exponential. No power terms arise in the weak coupling limit. The most interesting case is when the original spectral density. Original spectral density behaves like the second power of omega. Then the effective spectral density at zero is zero, but the derivative is positive. The Markovian approximation predicts the preservation of coherences. However, exact dynamics gives full decoherence, so opposite cases, preservation of coherences, no decoherence at all in the Markovian approximation, and full decoherence. Approximation and full decoherence. So, according to the power law, slow, slow, but full decoherence in the exact dynamics. That's interesting. Let's consider the Davis theory and the resonance theory. The assertion of the Davis theorem can be formulated in this particular case as follows. Particular case as follows. In this particular case, only the off-diagonal elements evolve. So it can be formulated as follows. The absolute value of the difference between the exact dynamics and the approximate dynamics according to the quantum dynamic semigroup tends to zero under the Bogalubov-Van Hoof rescaling, lambda to the power of minus two rescaling. Of minus two rescaling. And this result is certainly true because the decoherence, this is a formula, but roughly speaking, decoherence according to the exact model takes place on larger time scales. And so on this time scale, there is certainly no decoherence, and the result of the Davis theorem is true. Sorry. But there is a But there is a known improvement of the Davis result. Such a formula where the difference between the exact and approximate dynamics is small for all times from zero to infinity. But the resonance theory says that this is true only under the additional condition called the Fermi-Golden rule condition, which means here I sum. Here, I cite a paper by Marko. Roughly speaking, it means that the dynamics contains a single characteristic time scale, lambda to the power of minus two. And our system violates this condition because the decoherence takes place on a larger time scale. And so this is a good example, good illustration that the Fermi-Golden rule condition. The Fermi-Golden rule condition in the resonance theory is very essential. So, this improvement with respect to the Davis theorem takes place under very essential additional condition, which I saw in some literature people forget about this condition. So, I would like to stress the importance of such a condition. And this is a nice example. And this is a nice example of where such condition is not satisfied. Also, what about Markovian embedding? If we somehow have embedded our system into the enlarged system whose behavior is governed by the GKLS equation, by a semi-group, then the relaxation is still exponential because GKSL equation, at least for Because GKSL equation, at least for a finite-dimensional system, is simply a system of linear differential equations with constant coefficients and its solutions are exponents. And so we always obtain exponential relaxation for all observables of our system. But as we saw for non-onic spectral densities, our relaxation, our decoherence is non-exponential, and this means Exponential, and this means that such a system, for example, if in our case where the spectral density behaves like the second power of omega for small omega, cannot be embedded into a Markovian, into an enlarged Markovian system. So I think it's also important to remember that not every uh non-Markovian system can be embedded into a Marko into into a Markovian one. Into a Markovian one. So some system can be embedded and some cannot. And such systems are not exotic, not just mathematics, because in superconducting qubits, the known fact that often decoherence takes place faster than exponential according to the exponent exponential from Exponential from T squared. This is caused by the so-called flicker noise, one over F noise. So highly sub ohmic spectral density. So such non-Markovian behavior, essentially non-Markovian, non-embeddable into Markovian one is not exotic, it's physical. Probably it will. Probably I have some thoughts about how to construct a proper perturbation theory to encompass such a case, because it's tricky. Even if the coupling, system-based coupling is very weak, the dynamics is still non-Markovan because of sub-ohmic spectral density. But nevertheless, I think there is a way to construct a perturbation theory. I can discuss it. And about then, about the exact About then, about the exact asymptotic semi-group property. We can write down the exact GKLS equation, or at least GKLS-like equation, where gamma from T is time-dependent. But if the spectral density is ohmic, let's return to the ohmic spectral density when the relaxed decoherence is exponential on large times. Then gamma from T tends to be constant from large times, and so we see the asymptotic. We see the asymptotic semigroup or Markovian property on large times for arbitrary, not for small, just for small, for arbitrary system path coupling constants. This is a known fact that in the weak coupling limit, the initial non-Markovian transient takes place. If we start from a product system bath state, there is always an initial non-Markovian transient. And weak coupling limit is characterized by. Weak coupling limit is characterized by the fact that its transient is infinitesimal in time and thus can be neglected. In the general case, at least in this particular model, it's not infinitesimal, it cannot be neglected, but nevertheless, after such a transient behavior, there is a Markovian dynamics. And of course, an important question is: how universal is such behavior? Is it true not only for such exactly solvable? Exactly solvable model, but for more general models, it would be very helpful if a long-time asymptotic Markovianity is somehow generic property under some conditions. So actually this work was inspired by this paper by David Lonigro and Dariusz Khruszzinski. They analyzed this model and showed that the Analyzed this model and showed that the dynamics is Markovian in the sense, in the sense of the semi-group, but also quantum regression theorem is also analyzed. If the spectral density is flat, which is considered to be non-physical, and the authors note that we point out while these choices of coupling, that spectral density may be considered unphysical, the corresponding results are indicative of what would be obtained in more realistic scenarios. We can expect a Scenarios, we can expect an exponential dephasing in the regime in which the spin-boson interaction is approximately flat in the energy regime of interest. Here, the spectral density, we show that spectral density can be considered to be approximately flat, not in the energy regime of interest, but actually on large times, on large times, where only the behavior of the spectral density in the vicinity of zero matters. Now, let me skip this: the inclusion of transition between. This is the inclusion of transition between energy levels, this so-called strong decoherence or ultra-strong coupling regime, from which the talk by Thomas Fay was devoted to such approximation and also my recent paper. And a pair of words about spin boson model at the rotating wave approximation. Of approximation and zero temperature of the bus. The crucial for the behavior of this model is the correlation, such correlation function. So sigma z, and here's a sigma minus and sigma plus transitions correlation function. In these papers by Lonigro, Khrushchev, and also Hasabi, also Markovianity, exact Markovianity. Exact Markovianity is analyzed under the condition of flat spectral density. And what about asymptotic Markovianity again? If the spectral density is not flat, but what about asymptotic Markovianity? Then this work is in progress. It's known that if the correlation function exponentially decreases, then the relaxation is asymptotically exponential because it can be embedded into a Markovian system using the Ypsilomode method. And if the correlation function decays according to the power law, then the relaxation is slower over the next potential. The corresponding counterexample was constructed by Alexander Tirityonkov. And also my preliminary result: that this is a general effect, not just for a single counter example, but generally, if G decays according to the power law, then the relaxation. According to the power law, then the relaxation is slower than exponential, and the model is not amendable into the Markovian model. So, conclusions, long-time Markovianity for the exactly solvable periodic coherence model in the case of the ohmic spectral density, and the essentially from the other side, essentially non-Markovian, non-embendable into the Markovian model of decoherence in the case of non-ohmic spectral density. Density. And the central open problem is the conditions for the, from one side, for the asymptotic long-time reality to simplify our analysis of non-Markovian open quantum systems and conditions for the possibility of embeddability, of embedding the dynamics into a Markovian one, also for for the possibility of a simplified um description, for more general of not not exactly solvable models. Not exactly solvable models. So, thank you for listening. I have questions to the audience first, let's say. Yes. Hi, Addon. This is Abda Virgo speaking. I am not sure if I understand your argument of why this embedding is not possible. Can you perhaps repeat it a little bit? Yes, the argument is as as follows. If in if you claim that your system can be obtained by a partial trace of an enlarged system which behaves whose dynamics is governed by the GKSL equation, then the relaxation should be exponential because GKSL equation as a system of differential equations with System of differential equations with constant coefficients has exponential solutions. Its solutions is a sum of exponents. But here, in this case, we obtain power law decoherence, no exponent. So I think that means that it's impossible to express such decoherence as a partial trace of Markovian dynamics in an enlarged system. In an enlarged system, this is an argument. And this is so independently of how is the coupling between the system and the non-Markovian part of the path? Yes, independently. Even if the coupling is very small, then the dynamics is not Markovian. And it cannot be embedded into Markovian one. That's another question. Maybe remark on this. It seems the meaning is infinite. I think the meaning is that infinite time. So finites. So for any finite time, come up with a finite idea. For finite, yes, maybe one can find an embedding for finite time. Yes, probably yes, but not for arbitrary long times. I agree. I have a complete question. So about the condition for whether it Whether it becomes for open at long times. The condition that we typically see derivations is just that the density matrix becomes independent of time. Sorry, Abruna, the sound is not very good. Could you please repeat? Can you hear me now if I yell a little? Did you hear me? Oh, no, it was an interruption. Let me also switch on my phone. Yes, please. Okay, so what I usually see as the condition for dynamics becoming Markovian at long time is just that there is a static state, since that the density matrix, the reduced density matrix, The reduced density matrix. It's independent of time. Are you saying there's a more general condition than that? So you say that the condition of long-time Markovianity is a steady state? Yeah. Steady state independent. I would say that the condition here, at least in this model, the coherence model condition is ohmic spectral density. There is There is steady state anyway, and steady state is well known of zero coherence, at least if we do not consider too highly super ohmic spectral density. There is always a steady state, and the condition actually condition for Markovian embedding is omic spectral density. Okay, so so this is a statement about the approach to status? Statement about the approach to states. Do we have a question from the online audience? Maybe if I could ask, this is Devira. Yes, yes. Hi, Dvira. Hi. Very nice talk. Yeah, I have a question indeed continuing this question about Markovian embedding. So as I understand indeed, the argument is about the evolution towards the equilibrium of steady state. But what are your thoughts? Of steady state. But what are your thoughts about the Markovian embedding if indeed one is only interested in the steady state? Could there be also conditions of when this embedding is not possible? So if you are interested only in the steady state, then I don't know the answer. Maybe if we need just the steady state and not the behavior of convergence or exponential or power law. Then I cannot answer to this question from my results. Yes. Okay. Yeah, thanks. So, just to point out, indeed, the study that Nick had presented on Monday, we precisely looked only at the steady state because we didn't look at the details that you looked, but we have had issues with dynamics. So that's why we also did this embedding, but only looked at steady state. Yes, yes, of course. I mentioned Nicolas, not because. Course, I mentioned Nicholas not because I want to say something against, but just because he uses the reaction coordinate method, which in general is used for dynamics as well. But Nicolas Toffias was just about the steady state. Yeah, exactly because we have had issues. Okay, thanks. Okay, thank you. So, maybe just the last question from Vassano, please. Okay, yes, thanks. Thank you for a very nice talk. Very interesting. I'm sorry, I also. Interesting. I'm sorry, I also come back to this issue of non-covariant embedding because of two reasons. The first is: okay, for sure, this fact that you only have an exponential decay assumes finite dimensionality on the side of the environment. In principle, one could go to infinite-dimensional environments. But apart from that, I really do not see why you infer from the fact that you have exponential decay when you. The fact that you have exponential decay when you enlarge the freedom, the fact that this is not compliant with the different behavior for the reduced system, because in the end you are averaging over some degrees of freedom. So it's, I mean, when you go to a Markovian embedding, it means that for the larger set, you expect exponential. But then when you you average, you trace over, why should that remain like that? So I don't see your argument. I don't see your argument. Now, I cannot point to a specific example in which it doesn't work, but I think in some sense, I second the other guys in having doubts about this fact. So, yes, about the first point, I also thought about the infinite number, infinite-dimensional S prime. You mentioned this possibility. Yes, not infinite-dimensional environment, but infinite-dimensional extended. Environment, but infinite-dimensional extended system. Yes, my argument about a system of linear differential equations breaks down if the S prime is infinite dimensional. So yes, if we allow for infinite dimensional S prime, then probably this case should be analyzed more. I'm not sure, but typically one embeds into a finite dimensional, even if even in the Even in the reaction coordinate method, one embeds into a harmonic oscillator, but then terminates it. But if you have truly infinite-dimensional, a harmonic oscillator with infinite number of levels, then yes, probably this case should be analyzed in more detail. And what about the next question? So if the di so your uh your second question was that uh we uh That we partially trace over the S prime degrees of freedom. And is it true that we still will have exponential relaxation for S? I think yes, because if S prime, the whole, the enlarged system, behaves according to the GKSL equation, let's consider finite dimensional as S prime, then every observable observable. Observable observable relaxes exponentially. Observables related to S, to our regional system, is a particular class of observables in the enlarged system. But every observable in the enlarged system relaxes exponentially. And so the particular class of observables, which have the form of some operator in S tensor product with identity operator in S prime, also behaves extremely. Also behaves exponentially. This is an argument. Okay, so thank you very much. I'm sorry, I have to interrupt because we have another talk for Laurie. So thank you very much. Thank you very much. Okay, so
