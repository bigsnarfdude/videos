Super delighted to be here. First time in band, hopefully not the last. I'm also, I guess as many of us are, probably at the peak level of exhaustion from the semester, so unfortunate about the timing, but I guess this couldn't be controlled. But nevertheless, very cool. I'm going to talk, so I should say, first, I'm scheduled, I think, on the CR day, I heard. So back to the formal stuff. So conformal stuff. So um I'm gonna try to f I try to I pick something that hopefully fits well with the audience and fits with a conformal and CR theme. So there's gonna be a bit of CR and a bit of conformal here on the screen. Conformal in CR and basically what I'm doing is something where the motivation is CR but it's much harder so I'm getting conformal. Okay. Um you can kind of see from uh from uh Yoshihiro's talk. Yoshihiyo's talk just before that it gets a lot more technical, right? This is work with Ashuntanandi, who was a graduate student, OSU Nandi, post-look at UCSD. And so this is a kind of project that I kind of left him to do. And we're trying to finish it up, so now I need to look at it and think about these things. So uh it's al it's also relatively down to earth, so it'll probably take some time, give you some motivation, and give a simple result. Give you some motivation and give a simple result. So I'm going to start off with background and motivation. So here I'll bring in some CR stuff and several complex variables. So boundary behavior and boundary geodes of geodesics is going to be related to boundary regularity in two different ways. You can ask about the boundary regularity of geodesics. Ask about the boundary regularity of geodesics, which is what I'll only get to in this talk. But you can also think of geodesics as a tool for boundary regularity, proving boundary regularity results. And that's where the direction this project is going in. So the kind of original example of this is Rector Monumental Paper of Pfefferman in 74. And I mean, Pfefferman's work in these years has no small amount of. In these years, this has no small amount of impact on this field. Where he proved long open conjecture that if you have omega 1 and omega 2, I don't write down one conditions, but smoothly bounded, strongly pseudo-convex domains in Cn. And you have capital F of biholomorphism between them. Between them, and this extends smoothly to the boundary. You get a CR dependomorphism between the boundaries. And that is smooth up to the boundary. No singularities, no CK behavior or anything. Everything's C infinity up to the boundary. The way they improved this was using geodesics. That's the connection here. And the big idea was: so the proof has two parts. So, one, you can put on both of these domains a metric. So, you need a metric. So you need a metric of FG physics. And the metric that he used was the Bergman metric. So if you put on here G, I'll just call it G omega 1, G omega 2. Sorry. Bergman metric. These are Kayla matrix whose Kayler potential is essentially the Bergman kernel along the diagonal. So Bergman kernel is the reproducing kernel for the L2 orthogonal projection from L2 complex function. Projection from L2 complex functions to L2 holomorphic functions. So this thing exists. It's a very horrible object to try to study. But it exists. And then you can make a metric from when you have strongly two convex domain, get a KL. And it's a complete metric. Okay. And he did this in two steps. So this metric is not a letter. This metric is not only, so it not only exists, but it's bi-holomorphic invariant. So, if you have a bi-holomorphic map F between these two domains, it must necessarily be an isomorphism. So, F star G omega 2 plus G omega 1. And hence, if I have a geodesic in this guy here, it's going to be mapped to a corresponding geodesic over here. And so, here's the idea for us. And so here's the idea for his boundary extension proof. Go very close to the boundary and shoot geodesics out that the complete control of the geodesics will take infinite time to reach the boundary. But you can prove that they hit a definite boundary point at infinite time. And moreover, that as you vary the angle of the initial direction, so you have a family of initial directions inside the unit tangent bundle at your point, right? As you vary the angle at the endpoint very smoothly in the boundary. The endpoint very smoothly in the boundary, then the same thing would happen over here, and this family of geodesics would get back to a corresponding family of geodesics over here. And then this is how you get your extension for freedoms. Follow the geodesics out to the function. So there are two parts involved in proving this. One is that you need to get a handle on this very abstract Bergman metric, and this is the horrendous part of Fefferman's paper, which is to say the Bergman metric, along with the Bergman metric. Bergman metric along with the Bergman kernel along the diagonal and showed that it looks like some function which is smooth out to the boundary divided by a defining function. And then I have Kango sitting right here, so if I write any numerical constants wrong, he can correct me. I guess this is Cn, I guess it's n plus 1. And then which one expected? Because if you look at the, you can't explicitly compute the Bergman kernel for the ball, and you know, it's just a constant. ball and you know it's just a constant over the usual defining function for the ball to this power and so you expect things to look like this because you can approximate strongly pseudo-convex things look more just like in conformal geometry like asymptotically hyperbolic things you look like hyperbolic space near infinity here you look like a ball near infinity so you expect things to work out similarly this is the basic idea you do some kind of approximation argument but you have to get rid of some error terms that come in along the way and this produces the long term Which is a famous thing. So, this is the first step of the argument. If you didn't have this, you'd be very happy, because when you go and make these metrics and study the geodesic equations, you can just turn them into flow equations, and everything's nice. But this log term makes things not so nice, but in a way that can still be overcome. So, what happens is that you have some kind of, in the equations, you have some kind of polyhomogeneity. Equations, you have some kind of polyhomogeneity, the geodesic equations as you go to the boundary. And what this means is that when you look at the geodesics in the boundary, you lose regularity if you think of them as embedded curves as you hit the boundary. But you still have this smooth dependence on the initial condition of the final point. Okay. So this was Fiferman's proof. It's, I think, very elegant. But it's by no means the simplest proof of this extension result. So there are many other papers written later. I think the first one was actually by Nirenberg, Webster, and Yang. And instead of using geodesics, they used kind of horribles and mapped them. But then later on, the several complex variables community started using a debar problem to understand this. And this became a very well-developed area. And so this is pushed on along. And so this is pushed on a long way in that direction. And these original techniques, geometric techniques, haven't really been used so much. But so I'm basically thinking of trying to revive them, right? And so what kind of problem do we have where this would be useful? So for that, let me give you another result. So these are, this is a binomorphism from one dimension, in the same dimension, sort of. So, this is equidimensional mapping. You can extend this result to proper mappings in equidimension. So, you're extending the boundary to the boundary in some weak sense, and then you send the boundary smoothly to the boundary. But then you can ask, what if I look at a proper mapping where I go up in dimension? And because this is a kind of huge subject, there are loads of results. I'm not going to talk in any extensive way, but I just want to tell you one fundamental result here. One fundamental result here, which kind of gets us interested in thinking about boundary regularity. So there's a very influential result of Korstnirich. It's supposed to also have a beautiful paper in 89, where, so a lot of interest when you go up in dimension is you're often in the map which maps between balls. That's already trying to understand what the maps between balls are is a ridiculously hard problem. Is a ridiculously hard problem, and there is huge literature on this. So suppose that I map from unit bowl in a complex space to unipole in a bigger complex space, and so I have a map F and it's proper holomorphic. Then Forseneri's proved that if F is C big N minus Big n minus little n plus 1 up to the boundary of the domain, then it follows that f is C infinity on the entire, on the closed wall. So if you have some finite amount of regularity at the boundary, then you in fact have smooth regularity up to the boundary. Um okay, but the you know this this number here, obviously it grows to make the dimension higher. There's no uniform number, which is no, it guarantees. I should mention maybe in this case he also proved that if then has to be rational. But I want to focus so the project that I'm working on. So the project that I'm working on focuses on this part because we want to generalize to maybe only having domains that have smooth boundary and so on, where you wouldn't expect to get some kind of strong result like this. Okay, so far, so this condition comes from, so the proof relies on classical method in CR geometry, which you won't hear about in this area very much, which is called Sigray varieties. And roughly speaking, And roughly speaking, you have say gray varieties that are up the boundary that extend inside here, and then they map over here, and then you use that to figure out how the map has to go up to the boundary over yo. But in order to do that, you're doing some kind of incidence geometry. I mean, that's one way to roughly think about it. And you need to prove that you can kind of, by extending off these varieties to the boundary. To the boundary. You need to map a whole bunch of varieties to figure out what would happen, say, if you went beyond the outside, you need to kind of view it as the intersection of a whole bunch of varieties, these segregated varieties. And you map these parts of them, and then you look at what happens over on the other side, and you need to actually get a point as an intersection. And then this is where this condition is coming in. Some kind of non-degenerate. There's an argument where you use the convexity of the geometry and differentiation, plus. And differentiation a bunch of times, you get a non-degenerate system, which tells you you get a point solution. And what I'm really trying to get at here is that there's not really any feasibility of trying to extend this to, say, things where you just have smooth boundary. And there's also no obvious way to drop this kind of condition kind of approaches that exist. So, and then, so. So, and then, so, what can we do? One suggestion is to try to go back to this kind of picture and bring in metrics and try to send geodesics from one thing to the other, trying to understand what's going on. I'm not proposing that I have that story all worked out, but in order to do that, you have to do these two steps that Befferman did, or some analog of them. You probably don't want to use the Bergman metric because when you're embedding something from a smaller dimension into a higher dimension, the Bergman metric is non-local and. The Berger metric is non-local, and it's going to be pretty hard to understand how it relates to the geometry of the thing you embed. But there are other metrics that you might try to use. For example, Kayla-Einstein or just some ad hoc metric. Okay, so that's some motivation. Some other comments about this. It's known that if you drop the regularity too low, so if you go down to continuous, you can actually come up with maps here that have dense image. Here they have dense image, so the bound on the boundaries, the boundary gets mapped to the entire boundary over here. And so you can't replace this by just nothing, unlike in the Pfeifferman result. So the question is, like, what is the threshold between where bad things can happen and where nice stuff happens, if there is a threshold? So question in the setting of that result, C1 or C2, or C3, I mean, at the moment, I'd be happy to get C10 or whatever implies. Or whatever implies C infinity. But you expect the answer to be something like this. There's another question in this area, which is whether there's a kind of analog of the Nash embedding, the C1 isometric embedding theorem. So that's completely open. And so you're so you're looking at the bath you're looking at that from the boundary of here to the boundary of here and you ask if there's some flexibility result when you have a lower regular response. When you have a low regular as well. But I'm not thinking about that right now, just this question. Okay. So for this, it makes sense to develop a general theory about the boundary regularity of geodesics and so on, and also to be flexible with the metrics that you use. And if you want to do that, okay, so Pfefferman's already given you a kind of pattern to follow. You can just take his paper and start trying to grind. His paper starts trying to grind it out, but it's quite messy. And so, what we did was kind of work in a conformal model case of whatever warm-up problem. Okay, so we have parallel. So, I was going to put real versus conflicts, but we should put conformal and CR, I guess, for this. And it's not quite the usual parallel. But what I'm interested in over here. What I'm interested in over here is omega, I don't necessarily want to just have bolts, but if you don't just have bolts, it gets more technical. And you might only get C infinity on an open dense set or something that happens. So I want to have omega strongly C we have x. I'll write psi, C d x. And on here, I want to take a defining function, which is maybe chosen in some way. Maybe chosen in some way as a tool for my problem. And then I wanted to make a Taylor metric from the defining function. Maybe I should have assigned that to the point. Okay, so I'm interested in this kind of metric and the boundary behavior of geodesics. And I'll link us to this thing over here. And over here, so these things are, I guess we have language for this, so these things are, over here you have this. So, these things are over here. He has this notion of asymptotically hyperbolic things. These things are asymptotically complex, hyperbolic. They're more special than that. Asymptotically complex, hyperbolic doesn't have to be even complex. But I'll put ACH and then I added E here. And over here, we could look at AH. But in this case, here, this question about The boundary irregularity of these things. So AH, you're going to have a rho as well, but this rho is going to be normalized. So you have a G, which is H over rho squared, and D rho normalized with respect to H is equal to 1 on the boundary. I call this X. Right? Whereas over here, I don't have any normalization. This here is actually already being understood. So, if you go back to Matteo's PhD thesis, where this is relevant because you understand the behavior of geodesics to understand the behavior of Laplacian, spectral theory, on asymptotically hyperbolic things, you'll find that he looked at Fiffermann's results and proved the analog of this thing already. So, you find what happens is that, I mean, these geodesic. Find what happens is that these geodesics are actually smooth embedded curves, they go up to the boundary nicely, and as you vary the angle, the endpoint varies smoothly. But we're interested in kind of setting up a very general, just having some kind of general background written down so that we can use it flexibly. And something interesting happens in the control case where if you look through Matzero's arguments, there's a roadlock if you try to drop this condition. Drop this condition. So over here, I don't necessarily want to assume any condition on the row. I'm not sure if this gives you the same kind of row block, but Beffermann's argument has some kind of normalization condition on the derivative of rho. It's more special than just being asymptotically hyperbolic. So it's asymptotically hyperbolic and asymptotically Einstein in a stronger sense. And so. And so, okay, so Ffeffermann's result was also sort of parallel to this above this line. And one question, so this is understood by Matteo. So one question is what if we drop this condition, the d rho boundary equals one. Equals one. So, question mark. So, we're looking at informally compact, I'll just write a CC, but not necessarily as in total. Okay. And here, in this case, here, this is just parallel to general. So I don't want to over, I mean, I don't want to stretch this parallel too far. This situation is quite a lot more complicated as we saw from the previous talk. You're going to have to, instead of analyzing things in terms of coordinates and choosing nice coordinates near the boundary, you're going to have to introduce non-holonomic frames because there's different behavior in these different directions that respect the maximal complex subspace of the boundary and then the real direction transverse to that and so on. Direction transverse to that, and so on. And yeah, so there's not a super strong parallel, but there's definitely in spirit parallel, but this is more technical. Okay, yeah. Doesn't it cost you not very much to go from the C finding function just rescue? Yeah, this is just uh so Andrew's saying, like, um, why not just use an AH metric for application? Use an AH metric for application. So, this is really just an academic question, if you like. So, what happens if you have a metric? What happens to the geodesics if it's performally compact, but not asymptotically healthy problems? I mean, in principle, it could be that you have some physical. So, I'm still coming from this CR side of things where that was always motivating this, and it's a problem to get us into thinking about these things and so on as well. But, I mean, I guess in principle, But I mean I guess in principle there could be situations where you're you're interested in a metric that doesn't happen to all of you. I'm just saying it doesn't cost you much. Yeah, but then the geodesics will change. Right. Yeah, if you're interested in the geodesics of the conformally compact thing, because that's the metric you have to want to work with. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So as anything. Yeah, so as Andrew's saying, you're roughly going from something like, let me give you kind of toy model. Okay, so upper half plane to say dx squared plus, and maybe you add in some higher order terms, or you make this just look like that, you're a point, to going to the not asymptotically hyperbolic situation, is kind of like putting a function of x. Is kind of like putting a function of x inside down here. Just to oversimplify a little bit, make it concrete. So, what happens if, you know, we know what happens if we look at the geodesics here, right? And you have, okay. You have a geodesic and you have these pieces of circle. And of course, if you look at it in the disk model, it's much bigger. And it's pretty clear, well, it's very clear that everything is mass, right? But yeah, so what happens here? Okay. So this is different from what happens in the Fefferman result where you have a log term in the metric because you can assume that the metric is smooth here, but you still run into difficulties, where long terms start to appear in the behavior of the geodesics. And so theoretical. And so the approach that Matzeo has is you write out the geodesic equations and then you try to turn them by change of variables into an equation that's flow. Then you can understand what's going on in these scattering theory problems because you can turn the geodesic equations into a flow. If you had, like in Jared's thought, you had these two boundary pieces, maybe you had some topology in between, and you're shooting geodesics between them and so on. You can shoot geodesics out from the boundary because you can replace on the interior. Can replace on the interior, you can use basically the standard coordinates, but scale them in some way so that at the boundary these directions are distinguished. And then you can use those as initial data and shoot the data back out, and so on. And so this can be done. It turns out that you need the AH condition for this. What happens here? Well, you can try to draw the picture of what's going on. So I try to do that. If you put this thing here where you have some gradient, and you have a And you have a Jitus starting here and going down. Well, the easiest way to think about it is to think about a Jita's if it goes from here to some point, it's a little bit above here, because then it's going to bend to one side in order to take advantage of the shorter lengths as x increases this way. So you can kind of see that instead of going straight down, geodesic between those two points would go something like that. We also know that geodesics and conformally compact things, it does. Conformally compact things, you don't need the asymptotically hyperbolic condition, but geodesics and conformally compact things have to hit the boundary perpendicularly. You can prove this in a simple way. Well, you can prove it by the analysis that we do, but you can also prove it using, say, tractor calculus. There's a cute argument that's like less than a line. So the scale tractor, the so-called normal tractor of this thing has to be zero. That's the geodesic equation written in tractors. And then when you go to the boundary, And then when you go to the boundary, this thing becomes the normal to the boundary. And this normal to the boundary, the normal of the j-dysic has the double product close to zero. Okay, so then this thing curves back in. It feels like that. Work out what's going on here. Get this. Okay, but we want to know, okay, so you can kind of street for once like that. It looks pretty feasible that in this one, you know, this lower-dimensional case, that as you vary. This lower-dimensional case step is you could angle this thing very smoothly and so on, but we want to know analytically what's going on. Okay. So what happens? Let me just put up a quick theorem. I'm just going to assume that we start off with something that's completely smooth, though for potential applications, one wants to think about what's the minimal regularity for all of this and so on. But already we get log terms when everything is smooth, so then. Already we get log terms when everything is smooth, so maybe that's a good idea to do that to emphasize. So I'll bet x be a smoothly bounded domain in a remaining manifold. X to the H and let rho be a positive finding function for For x and g h over rho squared, then let me just consider one g dysik and then talk about what happens in my variant. So let gamma from 0 to infinity into x via geodesic for a g that. For a G that leaves all complex things. Okay, so this is the metric's complete in any case, so if I have to start off with geodesic, then it's going to go on forever, but I don't want to have it track one. So then I can say the following. So, one, first of all, First of all, this is not a super hard thing to prove, and I think it's probably in Matteo's thesis and this generality, you don't get stuck at this point. The limit as t goes to infinity of gamma t in the boundary exists. So you tend to some definite point on the boundary. You also tend to it orthogonally, so I'll write that down. Uh oh, I should say, yeah, okay. And Fermi coordinate chart, so how do I tend to the boundary? Nefermi coordinate chart x0, x1 up to xn. So like I said, I've changed my dimension as n plus 1 here. is n plus 1 here with the boundary of x being x1 plus 0 near this point on the boundary we have so The gamma dot ft is order x0. So shrink, this is exactly what happens in asymptotically hyperbolic case. You can just come over here and say, okay, you can have a look at this guy. This geodesic is definitely going straight down, right? But you want to parameterize it by unit length for the hyperlic matrix to get correct the actual geodesic. And you can use Dead is it. And you can easily see that that's zero e to the minus t. And the velocity of it is, if you differentiate that, the velocity of it is also pointing down and it's proportional to the distance from the boundary. It's equal to its length is equal to the distance from the boundary in that case. And the other ones really do that too. And then, so I should have stayed here, I missed something. I should have stayed here and I missed that thing. So I always use color to correct myself when I'm teaching. We'll actually see. So that's the component that's going towards the boundary of the velocity. And yammada, let's just use, let me just use i, say, for the other components. So those are the tangential components of t equal, and this is the new thing that happens. The new thing that happens. So here you get order x0, I should have used a different letter, but x0 squared log x0. This is the new thing that happens. So if you go over here, these are circles, they certainly look like pieces of parabola near the boundary. So here, I mean, here we're saying that these things look like. These things look like y squared, or some constant plus y squared. If I view them as a graph, I should have drawn my pictures every way, maybe. Whereas over here, what happens is, and of course, if you wanted to do the thing that I was drawing up here, if you wanted to change the direction that they come in, you just have to change a constant that's in front of that y squared. What happens in this case here is that you get something times y squared. y squared log y plus something times y squared plus dot dot dot. And so this to get the family of different things here, you vary this thing. So I'm going to call it U2. I was looking at Jarius' regularity for the minimal surface thing. So like where you have two-dimension and higher things, right? You get expansions like this. And actually this fits into this actually, even though that's a middle. This actually, even though that's an asymptotically hyperbolic setting, this fits into that pattern because your long term that you get in the higher-dimensional case is just down below the y squared if you would go to the bottom dimension. So that's actually exactly the same pattern as the m plus 1 long. Yeah. So you're assuming that x is smoothly bound, but in the half-space model, kg inference will have g as it's just a completely different way. So I'm just throwing a local picture in here. So everything is, the whole thing is local, and the result is proof locally and so on. But when I'm stating this result, just to keep it simple, I'm sort of assuming that I have a compact manifold with boundary, right? So when I say staple compact 6, I'm meaning I'm heading towards the boundary. But when you prove it, you just say you have a data set. I mean, you can prove that. If you leave all complex sets, you can have. If you leave all complex sets, you're going to have to tend towards the boundary. But when you study this thing, you're just going to kind of localize around the boundary and have a geodesic that's in this part heading towards the boundary. And then it gets trapped. You can see these geodesics bend towards the boundary. So there's a kind of region of points and directions where they get trapped and they go in the neighborhood of the boundary, where they get trapped and go to the boundary. So you're just proving it for those guys, really. Um essentially edits and edits is trying to classify what the GD things do, but I think you go that's the stress, right? Edit stress energy stress. Somewhere. I don't know. I think I'd have to take some time to digest your question and think about it more so I can answer off the top of my head. I mean, I'm not thinking of this as a dynamic, yeah, I guess a physical dynamic. A dynamic, yeah, I guess a physical dynamical system, so much. But that's what you're kind of saying, right? Yeah. But we're just thinking about what is the effect of introducing this thing, which is change, right? This is constant. You end up with this picture where, so if you're in an asymptotically hyperbolic case, then this is always order x naught squared. You don't get this false. The log term goes away. And the log term here is actually precisely so. So if I pull that guy. So if I call that guy a squared, so what I'm doing is I'm, in this picture here, I'm taking my defining function rho is not the same as my defining function x anymore. I can't choose those two things to be the same like I would do in a simplely hyperbolic case. So rho is equal to a times x. Note where this is some positive smooth function. And then what's showing up is that this log singularity is kind of clear. This is 1 over a in this picture. is this is one over a s in this picture here is one over a squared d by dx of a so the fact that this is got a non-zero derivative there is giving me this log together cool you can you can also see from this thing I claimed before that you know this is going to zero faster sorry this one's going to zero faster still than this one so you're hitting the boundary perpendicularly right because you have high Fermi coordinates still Because you have high Fermi coordinates, so this one going to zero, fostering that takes that. So three gamma hits partial x at a right angle. And then the, so that, so this is kind of this thing here is kind of what goes wrong in the This thing here is kind of what goes wrong in this framework when you drop this assumption on the row. But we're actually interested, you know, for the applications, we're not so much interested or caring about an interesting thing that shows up when you go through the analysis. We're interested in the smooth dependence of the endpoint on the initial direction. But to get that, you need to have some kind of system which is regular up to the boundary, right? And in order to make a system that's regular up to the boundary, you force it. Is regular up to the boundary, you force to introduce polyhomogeneity into the system because of this thing here. But that introducing the polyhomogeneity into the system doesn't hurt you if you look at how do the endpoints vary at a given time. It only hurts you in terms of the, you can't see if the distance kink and the behavior as you're hitting the boundary. But that's, and that, that part's kind of, it's a, it's, I mean, it's not exactly the same as. I mean, it's not exactly the same, but it's the same idea as what came from in the new syntax result, where he had this log term that came from the metric, but he was forced to include this log term in the geodesic equations, but this didn't mess up the smooth dependency. So we get the same thing in this case. We're forced to include a log term, but it comes from, not from the log term in the metric, but in the derivative of the metric alone, from, comes from, it's sourced by this derivative of the A. And it's just a thing that comes out when you. I mean, there's probably some nice way that people from this audience could see why. You just think abstractly about conformal geometry and you go, oh, there has to be a log term there. But this is not how we see it. You just write out the geodesic equations and you see that there's a term that's going to produce that. You have to you have you have you have equations which are singular at the boundary and you have to change variables and so on until you can make it non-singular and in order to do that you have to use a polyhomogeneous change of variables. I didn't mention Michael Jesse and I would kill you. I mean this is just a cartoon, so this all works the same in higher dimensions and this thing is just the gradient. I mean this has components in different directions and this is just the gradient of A rather than b by the x of a. But I'm not sure I understand the question because you're trying to like, I mean you're, I mean, you're To like, I mean, you're, I mean, you're changing when you change the variables, you want to subtract off the log term, basically. You can't quite do that, but you want to do something like subtracting off the log term from the variables. The question is, is there a CC metric that kills a lot? So this term will only be not there for all of the geodesics that hit the boundary if you're asymptotically hyperbolic. So that's another result, right? So if you, if you So if all geodesics have this behavior, rather than this behavior, then that forces the A to B possible boundary. If that forces you to be isopotic and hyperbolic. So you can think of this as a way of testing, if you like, kind of measuring if you are. Okay, so let me just add the item here that we were interested in. So those geodesics that I just arrayed were very nicely and smoothly at the point. Points. So or the fixing gamma naught and varying gamma dot naught will be the end point limit. Limit as t goes to infinity of gamma of t and boundary of x varies smoothly. And moreover, we can parametrize the boundary this way using the initial directions. We can locally, smoothly The boundary using initial directions B with make the B equals to one. So, exactly as in the fifth minute. I guess. Okay. Cool. And this is what we want. This does give us some kind of boundary regularity statement for conformally compact things. It's kind of saying that if you have, so it says that if you have Berollary, I'll just draw a picture. If I have X1 and X2, and this is conformally. X2 and this is conformally compact, this is conformally compact, and I have an isometry between these things, and I can use the geodesics to get that I end up with a conformal diffuse between the boundaries. So, what I don't get relative to what Pfeifferman had was: so if you So if you contrast with Pfefferman, so in the Pfefferman situation, you can do that, right? So you start off with a eichelomorphism, you get a CR diffimorphism between the boundaries, but you already know, because of the Hartox phenomenon and several complex variables, that if you had a CR diffimorphism between the boundaries, it extends smoothly to the inside to give the biholomorphism. To give the biholomorphism. So, what that means is that you have not only smoothed this on the boundary and smoothness on the inside, you have smoothness on the closure. This is different here. I have smoothness on the interior. I have smoothed this on the boundary, but I don't know about smoothness in the normal direction at the boundary, and I don't know if you could recover that in an informal setting. Whereas you get this for free from the smoothness on the boundary in the CR several complex variable setting of hard times. So, this is why, I mean, this stuff is kind of over. So this is why I mean this stuff is kind of all more interesting in this more technical CR setting than the conformal but I thought this was an interesting thing in any case. Cool. So before you so what are do x1 and x2 these serve the role of x and x tilde in your theorem? Like what are you establishing in? No no no no. So I mean if I if I No, no, no, no. So, I mean, if I if I so if I make this an X1 and I have another one, I'm just what I'm all I'm saying is that in some sense the if I have an X1 the interior of a performing compact thing, basically what I'm saying is the upshot of this theorem is if I have one X, right? And it's then, but I'm just thinking of it as the interior of a potentially conformally compactifiable thing. There's only one conformal compactification in the sense, like there's only one conformal infinity, it's uniquely determined. It's uniquely determined to smooth conform differomorphism. But yeah, then this, you probably should be able to say more because you want to, because you're not getting that the way it's attached as a smooth manifold with boundary, that that's canonical. Does that make sense? And I'm not sure whether you can get that or not. Yeah? It may be that you're yeah, if I naively stand. Yeah, if I naively standing here thinking about it, it seems like you should get that too, but I haven't really properly sorry that you should get regularity in the normal direction as well in the setting, but you don't get that for free, you know, in this case, unlike in the other case. Does that make more sense of why I wrote this? Yeah, it's not a big thing, but it's just the analog of what you have over here. Yeah, so, but I'm trying to explain why we're more interested in doing this version, because you're getting. In doing this version, because you get stronger results out of it. And so the same thing if you're going up in dimension, if you can get a smooth map on the boundary to the boundary, then you're going to get smoothness up to the boundary. So you get the smoothness in the normal direction for free. Cool. Yeah, so I'm going to stop there. Thank you guys. Now we can ask.
