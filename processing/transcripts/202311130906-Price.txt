With the different networks. And so I'm just going to drill into CanMod here. And you notice, as I'm clicking around the graph, the page on the right is changing so that you can see detailed text about the nodes that are displayed there. So for each of the networks, we were starting initially to try and just get a sense of the people who are involved with it, the research that's taking place within the network, the tools that the network is contributing. The network is contributing, the different training programs that are being generated, some of the initiatives that the network is planning beyond that, and some of the data that they're sharing into this space as well. And so, from any of these particular points, you can navigate to look at, for example, starting with the people. We've tried to bring together all of the people who are in the CANMOD network, but also draw some of the connections. So, draw some of the connections where people are working across the different networks and also included people who might have come into some of the training sessions who are not necessarily formally part of the networks, but are in the periphery where they're contributing as well. So, in this context, you can click to look at particular participants. So, I've clicked on Jesse here, and you can see that around here, we've got a set of nodes that Of nodes that link to some of Jesse's interests in ecology, microbiology. You can get a sense of institutions that he's working with and also a sense of where he's based. And so, for example, if we were interested here to learn more about microbiology and some of the interesting Microbiology and some of the interests of people who are working in this context. You can click here and also begin to discover other people who are working in this context. And so we've been populating the graph starting from those initial seed data points in the Google Forms. And over time, that's grown to have over 850 nodes. Nodes and about 5,000 cross-links, which I'm just zooming out now to show an overview of the network as a whole. And we're also starting to layer in some of the research outputs that have been generated from the network as well. And I can zoom in and show you that. So, from the initial starting point of the information supplied by the The information supplied by the forms. We've been iteratively adding new nodes. And the graph is set up in a way that anyone who would like to edit it is able to edit it. We've set it up so that you have to ask for permission to do that, so that it's not open for anyone just passing by to edit the work. But anyone who would like to edit, anyone who would like to contribute is able to do that. Like to contribute is able to do that, but we're not necessarily expecting anyone else to do that. You're very welcome to do it. And if you'd like to learn more about how to do that, I'd be delighted to talk at any time. But essentially, the way that we've been running this is I've been acting along with Steve as kind of ethnographers for the network. So trying to listen to understand the different dimensions of the work that's involved, looking for the connections that are implicit or explicit in that work. Explicit in that work and gradually layering them into the graph. And the reasons why we've been doing that are DEIDM initiative is an unusual and complex initiative spread both across the networks themselves, but then of course across all of the different institutions that are involved with that. And so we've been gathering together institutions as nodes within the graph, linking the people to the institution. The graph linking the people to the institutions, linking people to the networks. There's also the resources that the network is using and generating. And so, again, looking to identify those, connect them to the creators of them, connect them to people who are using them as part of their research. And also, where, because training is a key function of the network, trying to surface the workshops that have occurred and the materials from. The materials from the workshops so that there's a record that you can navigate to of those events, but also you can then begin to explore those thematically as well. So, to give an example of some of those things, we were looking at the training and we can drill in to look at the CAN mod training. And here I've just got up the Just got up the schedule for this session, and as we're going through the next few days, I'll be adding in slides and perhaps later if we have them, video from the different sessions. So here's an example of another recent workshop that took place. So there's a little bit more content on this one. So this was the ARMZ EDIN Summer School on modelling infectious disease that took place. Modeling infectious disease that took place this summer, and you can see some of the participants who took place in this context. And if we click on individuals, we can learn more about them. And again, trying to surface in this context, some of their interests, some of the institutions that they're linked with, also other talks that they've given or other work that they're doing in this context too. So if I go back to the homepage of the graph. To the homepage of the graph. I mentioned also that we're beginning to look at the different software packages that are being used in this context so that you can drill in. And if you want to learn about a particular software package, then you can look at the particular one. We've got the links going out below here to the places where you can see and test the software. And where appropriate, we've also sharing papers that describe the use of the. Papers that describe the use of the software here. If you're interested in R-based packages, you can come in and look at the different areas within the network where R is being used and some of the different software packages that are written in this context as well. And I mentioned also within the networks, we're also starting to look at the research that's been. The research that's been generated and shared. So, if we go onto the CAMEL publication site, you can see here the set of papers primarily focused on the COVID papers. I think there's probably about 100 papers being generated by members of the network on COVID across the duration of the work. So, we're capturing the papers, surfacing them in this context, and then beginning to look. them this context and then beginning to link the papers across to the individual authors as well. Part of the reason for doing this is to create something that people can come and explore and learn and perhaps be useful as a training resource. But one of the primary initial benefits that we found for this is just allowing for discovery across the network when the network exists across multiple institutions with their own websites and multiple individuals with their own website. Off from individuals with their own website, that it can be difficult to get a sense of where within the network you might find somebody who has resonant interests with yours or who might be doing work that could potentially be complementary to yours. And so, the whole structure of the graph is surfaced and crawled by the search engines. So, you can search within the tool. There's a search tab on the right, and you can click and look. Search tab on the right, and you can click and look and search for elements within there. But a simple thing to do is just using the normal sort of search functionality that you would use, say, just to go to Google, and you can kind of force search results. Sometimes using EIDM or CAMMOD will be sufficient, but if you stick the word debate graph, because it's quite specific in front of something, so looking here for AMR, antimicrobial resistance, you can see here that Nicole. You can see here that Nicole is somebody who has an interest in that area, and so we can learn about her research. And from here, this is, I should say that this is a different view, which presents each node as a central page with the links that were ordinarily radially displayed around the page displayed to the left and at the bottom. And so you can see that there's a connection here to antimicrobial resistance, and we can see. Antimicrobial resistance, and we can see the group of other researchers working in this area. You can also see that there was a project occurring in the Omni network on modelling the transmission of antimicrobial resistance in livestock. And so if you're interested in finding something across the network, sticking the word debate graph in front of that is a good way of doing it. As I showed, a thematic one there. For example, if you One there. For example, if you were interested in the people within the EIDM network who are working at PIMS, Debate Graph and PIMS will bring you into the PIMS page. I'll switch back to the visualization here so that you can just see the sort of network of things around. So you can see individual researchers working in this context and then again begin to drill down and look at their interests and research. Their interests and researchers as well. So, we've also, within this, begun to look at the future of the network. So, we brought some of the documentation that's being shared in this context into the graph as well, and beginning to interlink it so that the narrative of the network's own understanding of itself can begin to be displayed here. So, we've broken out the Here. So we've broken out the, some of you may have seen the charting of future white paper to surface this material in this context. So you can see, for example, the benefits of continued emerging infectious disease modelling and sort of can drill down to look at each of these in this context too. You can look at the future research and challenges that have been identified in this case. So the different objectives. The different objectives, the established objectives, so the project disease outcomes, project disease outcomes by levels and transmissions of contact. And from there, you can see some of the methods that are being applied in this context and some of the papers where they're describing those methods as well. Also, most of the interaction so far has been human interaction of adding to the graph and action of adding to the graph and people coming and looking and searching using it. But all of the data within the graph is available via APIs. And so for example, here's a screen of Troy Day's page and some of the background information about him. And this is also available in a JSON link. Available in a JSON link data form. And so potentially, we're interested to see once we're sort of really getting into all of the nuances of the network, layering in any of the different dimensions that you would each like to see added to this, then potentially the fact that we can surface this in this programmatic form might open up a range of other things that can be done because of the graph has been created. So if anyone's interested in explaining, Has been created. So, if anyone's interested in exploring that, both in adding to the structure of the graph in that way, or by pulling insight out of the graph and using it in different contexts, then we'd be very interested to talk to everyone about that. If you don't want to come in and look at the graph, you can sign up to join the community of the graph. And if you do that, then you'll receive a daily digest of the updates to the graph with links that can. To the graph with links that can bring you into the particular areas. So, I've just got here an example of the digest that I received this morning from some of the work that I was doing yesterday. Different elements within the graph are coloured differently within the digest. So, yesterday I was working through adding a lot more of the papers on the CanMADSAD site, but also adding in one of the workshops that occurred recently and lawyers. And Lloyd Elliott, who was leading that, was somebody who I haven't captured in the network so far, so adding him into this context. And from the digest, you can click in to look at the particular pages and learn more about Lloyd and also learn more about the particular workshop that was taking place then. So that very quickly is an overview. Quickly, is an overview of what we've been doing so far and some of the rationale for doing that. There are lots of mechanics with the tools, lots of different kinds of ways that you can visualize the information. You'll notice when you land on a node that has dozens or in some cases hundreds of connections, that the radio view may not be so useful. So, there are an outline view that can let you come in and look at the organ. You come in and look at the organizations, breaking them down by sort of different sub-categories. So we can look at the academic organizations that are involved, and example, the Fields Institute, come in and look at that and look at the connections surfaced in yellow here. If you want to look in other ways, you can switch into a different kind of box view that lets you again see the connections and explore the graph in this way. The graph in this way. So, lots of mechanics. That there are some guidance on the site for how to navigate and work with this. If you're not interested in that, just using that search trick as a way of dropping in and serendipitously discovering connections is another way of working. And I'll pause there so that we've got a few minutes just to reflect to answer any questions. And as I said, I'm going to be. As I said, I'm going to be continuing to be working in the background throughout the next few days. So, very happy to answer any questions after this session. And we'll be looking to draw in any material that you're happy to share from the event into the graph as the workshop is proceeding. So, I'll pause there and maybe stop sharing for a moment so that I can see the room as well. Uh this one.
