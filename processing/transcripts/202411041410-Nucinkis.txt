Thank you for the organisers for asking me to speak and also asking me to speak longer. And yeah, so it's always great to be there. So yes, I'm going to talk about automorphism groups of cantor algebras. And the connection to topological full groups basically has been done by Delia. So I'm going to talk more about the first part part. More about the first part, how they come about, by I think they're a neat little construction, what you can do, and see what we can do with them. And so there is, of course, huge overlap to what has been said before. And so there's a, in Shinley's last paper, there's a sentence where he says something like, it all began with Thomson's group V. So let's begin with that. Let's begin with that. But actually, I'm going to talk, I'm not going to start with Thompson's group V, but with Thompson's group F. So Richard Thompson defined three groups, F, T, and B, when was that in 65, 1965? And never published the notes. And then And then group theorists, and I'm a group theorist, and for what? When I came across these books, it was F that everybody talked about. V had, because at the time, shortly before that, it was proved that F is of type F infinity. And V hadn't been done or was stunned a little bit later. People already knew that. People already knew that V was simple and finitely presented, that F was finitely presented, and so that's why V was always interesting because of it being a finitely presented simple group, infinite simple group. And so let me quickly define F and explain why they're they're cool. And then we already know that V is a full group of. That V is a full group of shifts and things. So the connection is there. I don't have to motivate that anymore. So, how do we define F? So F, and then I define the E. So F is the group of piecewise linear orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the interval, 0, 1, with with breaks inside a half and slopes powers of two. So it's a lovely group, easily described. So let me give you an example of an element in F. So you have and you have again your domain and codomain And the element, the piecewise linear element that we get here is an element in the whole group. And so why is this group interesting? Because first of all, it's totally free. So that's helped by when I came across these groups, everybody. When I came across these groups, everybody was excited about this one because it's torsion-free and it has a few other properties. Tortion-freeness comes from the simple fact that if you take the first, in every element, the first bit that's not slope one, and then you apply the chain rule, and then any power of it will never get slope one. The first one that doesn't have slope one, apply the chain rule, and it will never get to slope one. So it's torsion-free, no elements of finite order. Finite order. If you any elements with disjoint support commute, so you can have arbitrarily high abelian groups, free abelian groups sitting in there. So this group is torsion-free. You can actually show that not just arbitrarily high, but you can say infinity. So that's just this one. And it has It has, yeah. And then, so that you can just read off from this one here. But then there's this way, and Delian already wrote out some of the examples how you can write them by truly pair diagrams. So it's also clear that if you have an element like this, you don't have to draw it, you it's given by its uh by the subdivision of the intervals. Yeah, of it. Of the intervals. Yeah, of the domain and codomain, you take the subdivisions. If you have both subdivisions, you have your element. So, what we can do instead is draw our subdivisions down here. We start a point. So, we type our interval and whenever we subdivide, we draw out caret off. And so we get a rooted binary, finite binary tree. And the same thing here on the other side. Thinking on the other side. Okay, so that gives us our element. Of course, this rooted tree, a binary tree, is not unique. Now we could always introduce some fake breakpoints. Let's say we introduce one here, and we have a fake breakpoint here, and that would amount to having n. Another carrot here, which we call a redundant carrot. So, actually, when we talk about an element in F and its trivia representation, often we think about the smallest one that represents it, and not just any other one. And the fact, or we talk about, we think it's an equivalence class of three. So, and then we can actually think of our elements. So, this is the element. We think of our elements, so this is the end, like zero. Sorry, how do you can you tell from the current for the two trees that is acorn? Yeah, yeah, because this one here and this one here, if you remove it, you have the same information. You can always tell if they are redundant carrots. Because they hang off the same spot. It's not the same spot, but you have to respect the order. So this interval gets mapped to that interval. That's fine. And when I come to V, then that's not so easy to see anymore. Yeah, so what's what I was going to say? You can multiply just given I need two three-pair diagrams like this one here and if you multiply this element with itself what we do is the fact is that any two subdivisions of the interval have a common refinement. We use that fact. We refine so that the middle trees So that the middle trees are the same. And then we have to add, of course, this element, we have the redundant carrot here, the other redundant carrot here. And then we can cross these two out, and that's our new element. So having this representation by three-pair diagrams gives us an easy way of finding a presentation for our elements. Ends vote for our group. And what we do is we have a tree here, T1, we have another tree here, T2. And what we put in between, we just write down a spine with the same number of leaves that this tree, or these trees have to have the same number of leaves, of course, and then we Then we write down the spine at the same number of trees and write our element as a product of these two things. And now if we add a carrot here at the nth spot, that's the same thing as adding a carrot here on the nth place in the spine. And which means that in the end what we know is. That in the end, what we know is that the elements, these elements here, where we have a carrot at one of the spine points in the first entry, these are the generators. So that's x0, that's x1, x2, x1, 3, 4, and so on. And so. And then for the rest of the talk, before you can try and figure out that this really generates the whole thing, and you can write f as generated by this x0, x0, and so on. And furthermore, that we have this relation that x0, xi inverse, xj xi is the same as xj plus 1. Same as xj plus 1. So that means it's a bit of a bigger math. But now for all of j bigger than 1. But what it tells us in a very easy way is that this group is finitely generated. Because all you need is x0 and x1, you get all the other x's. So it's finitely generated by x0 and x1. And with a little bit more effort, you can actually reduce that infinite presentation. Infinite presentation, the infinite presentation here, the infinite number of relations also down to a finite number of relations. So it's finitely presented. And so this tree-paired one is really something I'll come back to a lot because that will also give us spaces. Shin was talking about some constructions of input spaces. This is sort of the original idea. So this is the prehistory. So, this is the prehistory to everything that's been done in recent times about proving finiteness conditions that generalize these finite generation, finite presentation for these topological food groups and S and so what is V for V, instead of subdividing Subdividing interval. What we do is we look at piecewise linear maps still, but they are only left or right continuous. You just have to decide from where you want to come. And they're not necessary orientation. Oh, they're orientation. But what we allow. But what we allow for is, for example, something like this. Switching those two things around. Yeah, so this is what this thing got sent here. No, I'm always getting this wrong. This thing got sent here and this one. You allow something like that. So you allowed, in a way, what you allowed to do. What you're allowed to do is you take, if you think of it as actually the beginning of an infinite tree, you're allowed to take what was called the cylinder sets or the compact opens in the boundary of the tree and to move them around. Mark this one: one, two, three, two, three, one, two, something like that. You have to preserve all the addresses of the little cylinder sets. Yes, you preserve. If you allow it to mess around in the cylinder sets, you get something on the screen. If you allow it to mess around in the right way. And that's I might if I have time agreed to say something about that. Okay, so and that's V. Yeah, so V is just allowing for permutations. Just allowing for permutations. And the same thing happens here when you take your three pairs, but now you allow for permutations at the end. So what you do is instead of putting a spine in the middle, you put two spines in the middle. And you put the permutation here. So you have a permutation here, and you have two elements of f. And again, that shows you that the That shows you that way, you can prove that this group is finitely represented. So, what was I going to then say about this? And yeah, so that's Thomson's quote. And then Higman came along in 74, Frank Higman, and looked at Looked at generalizations of these groups, of this group V. Let me now stick with V from now on. And might say something about F later again, because oh yeah, why we all got so excited about F, because it was proof that's F infinity. I'm going to define that in a minute. Also, it has infinite cohomological dimension because it contains arbitrary high free Believing groups. This has comological dimension n. Homological dimension N and homological dimension closed. So homology is torsion-free and is of type F infinity. We do not know whether it's amenable. It's not elementary amenable. It has simple commutator group. And the fact that it has a simple commutator group, and you know the ability. Simple commutator group, and you know the abelianization is just a Z squared, it's quite easy to see that it can't be elementary amenable. Elementary amenable means that you can build it up from abelian groups and finite groups just by doing extensions, group extensions, and directed limits. When was the proof that it's not really material meaningful? Sorry? Sorry? You know when was it? When was it? It's in Cannon Floyd Perry's articles, survey article. That article is from the 90s. But it must be before that. I don't know. It's because they write it as a survey article. They don't claim originality in the article. So I don't know. Okay. So at V, then, you're only a At V, then, Euro only allowed one sort of break point where you like positive slope except at one point. No, no, you wild anything. You can go wide. Go as wide as you want. It's F, except you do a permutation. Instead of respecting the order, you can do a permutation. So that was just the easiest example I can draw. Yeah. The only example I can draw. So. So Hegman then. So Heigman then looked at these groups, at the groups V, and defined these groups V and R, which means instead of having looking just at a tree, a binary tree, you can have ternary trees and you might even have forests of ternary trees. So you have something like this going to. This going to this. But you still have to have a fixed number of E's. So this would be an element in P32. And the same procedure works. You can look at a lot of the properties of V are easily extended to the properties of the NR. And these groups are simply. That was the English theory. And it was Nikola Schewich who realized that when r is equal to 1, that these are can be seen as topological triggerful groups of some shift. And Matsui then later generalized. Generalized and by children. Yeah. So and uh yeah, but then of course you go on then came Melanie Stein and instead of having a uniform RT she asked she allowed for mixed R Ts of a ternary and binary tree. Ternary and binary tree. And again, we she allowed for several for actually for forests rather than just trees forests. But let me just stick with one way. So you could have something like this. One, two, three, four. Elements like that. And she generalizes to where the arities of the trees were co-prime. The thing that happens. The thing that happens here that you did not get before, because you have two different keratites, you might actually look at, if you look at it, what is the subdivision of the integral here? So you have a binary tree, you subdivide the integral, you half it. If you have a ternary tree, you third it. So this tree pair corresponds to Pair corresponds to this subdivision of the interval. So, but now what happens if we subdivide, if we have first and then we third it, that is the same thing as first thirding and then half. So there was an added complication here that we have these two different carrot types and we have what's it called? A, what's it called? Some sort of commutativity relation here. And some kind of relation on our tree path. And Brains groups were mentioned before as well. And instead of now, let's do a 2v, instead of taking subdivisions of the Subdivisions of the interval. What was done here was we're taking subdivisions of, actually, it's squared, but we draw it as squares. So where we allow maps from the same number of cubols. What do I want to do? Something like this. Something like that. And that trying to represent this as tree pairs is a little bit more difficult. And what can we do? So let's do the let's use the horiz that's vertical. The vertical one with a white carrot and the horizontal one with a red carrot. And the horizontal one, the red carrot. And so, this, the left-hand side, let's just do the left-hand side here. So, that's this one here. So, we end up with the one here, and then we take the right carrot, and we take the top to the left and the bottom to the right. We can represent these by three pairs. Of course, now there is a problem with the boundary of that tree because we have these two colours. Right from the counting side here. But again, we have a relation, namely, if we take an interval and we do a vertical one first and then a horizontal one, then um we end up with one, two, three, four, like this. 1, 2, 3, 4, like this. But this is the same as first doing the horizontal, oh, this was the horizontal first, and this is the same as doing the vertical one first, and then doing the horizontal two subdivisions. And there we get, no, now I've done it wrong. This is a 1, 3, 2, 4 this way around. And this is a 1, 2, 3, 4. Yeah? So we're doing the whole. Yeah? So we're doing the horizont horizontal first and then we subdivide. So again we have these relations here that we have to work from. And now let me define our counter algebra. Okay, so in this was all these were not in group These were not included. The Steins and Brinz groups were not. What Matsui did was sort of describe ENRs here. Looking at things like Stein's groups and Brittany groups to describe them as topological full groups, this one, this is what Deviant. This is what Divian described, how we do it with K-graphs. So, but so what we, so let me now say what we did. That was with several people over several iterations. So, I'm not going to go, that was in the 2010s around that. So, this was where the So, this was with Koshlukova Martinez-Peres Matucci. So, it's not one paper, it's a series of papers very of course. We sort of make our way to defining these counter-algebras. And what we do is we follow what Higman does, in a way, and what Ken Brown does with his proof of F infinity. Something I must say something about it. So, as you've seen here, I've used colors. And that could also be seen as two colors. So, we start with the set automorphism group colour. So you start with a set of colours and then you look at sets u that are necessarily infinite, u that satisfy the That satisfy them have the marks assigned to them. So for each colour, you put an arrity, which is how many problems your tree will have, ni, so n1 to n k. And then we have a set u and we look at maps from, so for each i in k, In k, we have a map lambda i, which goes from u n i, the default direct product, to u, something like multiplication, if you just have two. So these are called universal algebras, that's where it comes from. And for each alpha, i, so we have n i operations alpha i, so the j. So the j and go from u to u. It's a bit like the scalar multiplication. And what we actually do is we often write alpha i, we just put them all together as alpha i one because alpha i n i from u to u to the u. And what it is, if you look at these maps, you take you have n i points in u, let's just have three, and then you are here, and that's your lambda i of these three of these three. And the alpha is going down. And so, what we do is we start, and what we take is we take a set, a finite set X, and we look at all the we say u is an. Uh the we say u is an omega word algebra if it's an algebra if it's a set that's a passive that one. You take the free uh object on the set and that's and that's the free omega word algebra. But that's of course not enough. So what we now have to do is we have to look at some conditions. So we put some relations on there and then we have two sets of relations, one that We have two sets of relations. One that already Higgman knew about, this L relation sigma one, and that is if you expand with one colour, so that is expand by this alpha, so this is this thing we call expansion, and the lambda we call the contraction. So if you expand by the same colour, If you expand by the same colour and then we contract again, we end up with the same part. So, and the other way around. So, lambda i, alpha i is the identity of u n i and the other way around. So we were not allowed to have some. We were not allowed to have something like we're going up here and down and then with the same colour and we end up some levels. That's one of the conditions. And then the second condition is some kind of commutativity relation. So if we have, let's call this A1, not lambda anymore, and this is A2, and this is B1, this is V2, B1. So then the relation here would be that A1, B1 is B1, A2. B1 is B1A1, but A1B2 is the same as B2A1. And so we get some commutativity relations commuting relations. But these commuting relations doesn't have to be as nice. So they just are conditions on words of length two in two different colors. Different colors, and they assign to it a word of length two involving some other two colors. And it doesn't have to be that everything goes nicely and adds up to four here. So at the moment, we're not very, very strict here. Yeah. I think I got lost at some point. What is U, you mean? U is just a set that has these two operations on it. Okay. Operations on it. Then we call it an omega algebra. And we just take the free object amongst these things. So the value is this omega omega x. Yeah. And then what we do is we look at, we factor out congruence, some commuting relations, they're not really commuting relations. And then we factor out the full sub congruence given by all these relations. Congruence given by all these relations. And then we say u sigma is by these relations by sigma. And what we take is this variety of free objects. Again, we take this object. Okay, and then what those people who know about k-graphs will see. Know about k-graphs, we'll see that these relations of length 2 are just sort of like very similar to what you know from the k-graphs. So, one thing we have to have, so and then we call this thing, we call this a cantra drawer. And what is our set V? What is our group V sigma? V sigma. V sigma is now the group of so I've said what expansions and contractions are, but I didn't say what our sort of what takes the place of a basis. So we say a subset one A subset Y of U is admissible if it can be obtained by a finite sequence by a finite sequence. Of simple expansions and contractions. By a simple expansion contractions, I mean just an expansion with just one alpha or one lambda and a contraction. No, expansion with one lambda alpha and your contraction. So, uh So, in a way, if you look at from x. So, if this is our x, then this one here, these three elements would give us an atmosphere. And then you define B of sigma to be the group given by max from y to y dash. From y to y dash, but those are admissible sets with the same cardinality. Okay, so that's how you define your group, but we have to have some restrictions. We have to say our canto entropy or our group Algebra or our group, our sigma, we say this is valid if when we do this restriction, we do not have collapsing. So if your original basis was of size n and then you apply in w and then you apply your relations to it, it stays size n. So if this map here All this projection we get here sends a basis, an admissible z, and then we say that they have the same cardinality if this one's yeah. And um we yeah. Uh okay, can you leave me assembled this model if you A condition? It's difficult to think of one, but something where you have a relation like this with two colours, you've only got one colour. I mean, if I'm not... Yeah. If I shouldn't think about non-admissible, it said that's not admissible is these two points. If you think of it as sort of, if you look at the boundary of the tree. If you look at the boundary of the tree, what you have to have is that you basically cover the entire boundary of the tree with your admissible set. So that the cloak is covered by the cloak and so by section. The next question was: why is that a group? B plus B. Because So we have to put slap some conditions on. We have to be careful. We have to be careful that these things are, that we don't destroy things, that things don't happen, that something not valid is not true. Then the other thing we want to ask for is that it's bounded, i.e., that any two admissible sets have a common expansion. Expansion. And you just go down. So basically, what we can then say: okay, we have our set X, we have any other set which might be anywhere else, but we can actually think of anything lying below X. So any two, any two admissible sets have a common expansion. And then lastly, we have complete. Complete means what it is that any two colors are related. So what we could see with V2 here, so we could move red up and put white at the bottom. And we're asking this, it's going. Andrew is asking this, it's complete that if you have several colors, that you can do that, and also that there are no other shenanigans. Yeah, but something you can think of as that. And valid bounded and complete means actually that then V sigma is, I don't know, we don't need complete, is the full automorphism. And um so and this is not written up yet but and may have been subsumed. May have been subsumed by work of Shi Li recently, where he says everything begins with me. If you have a valid so this is If we have a if sigma or u sigma valid, bounded, complete, then what we can say is it's the same as the topology then V sigma is Is lambda h t, what was all the notation that we had from this is the full group of some, yeah, not was lambda h, lambda h t for some lambda, which is now aperiodic three. What was the last one? Profinite. Profinite. Thank you. Profinite. Yeah, so what what you do is if you just think of the ones where x is one, all you think is rather than than writing your trees out downwards, you just wrap it all up. just run it all up. Yeah, so we have the in in for V V for our two V as as a Russ already oops no, that should not be another right one. But we can do it for all the other relations. Shines groups falls into this and so on. Yeah, but I have to say there's work by Owen Tammer that does similar things. That there are similar things. And Schin's recent paper on representations of categories, that there is overlap. But I think it's only overlap. So why do I think it's only overlap? So one thing is this condition. So one thing is this condition Fp infinity that we can do as well, or F infinity. So F infinity is a group property that comes, that's a geometric group property. It means that the group has a k pi1 of kg1 that's finite. So that's what's a kg1? It's a space. AG1, it's a space, it's a CW complex of something that's made out of spheres and attaching that has its fundamental group is G and all the other homotopy groups varnish. And then you look at its universal cover and here you have the group G acting nicely on each dimension. And you only have finitely many orbits in each dimension. And F infinity means that you have that it's finitely. means that you have that it's finite it has finite n skeleton for every n okay so and all the groups ever since the proof that f is f infinity that was the very first proof that was done by Brown and Gagen in AET six In 86. And then V and V and R was done by Brown shortly after, 87. I don't know. It was somewhere around then. And these proofs all relied on the fact that one can take, one can build some kind of coset. And this coset. And this poset is for us the postet, and for us the poset would be the set of bases, which is partially ordered by expansion. So less or equal if you can expand it. And then you have, that gives you a poset. And so the message here is build a space. Build a space which is not an EG out of posets, out of some kind of posets, out of set B of B we call it B because this comes from bases, it's some kind of poset given by bases. You take the geometric realization of this poset, which means that whenever you add the vertices are the actual elements of your poset. Elements of your postet. And whenever you have a string of n inclusions, you get an n syntax. That's your poset. And because you're bounded, you can always contract anything to a common refinement. So this thing is always contractible. Yeah, so this EG is contractual. Yeah, so this EG is contractible. But on the EG, this is contractible. G acts freely. G does not act freely on this set. But the stabilizers are nice enough. And so the stabilizers are nice enough, but then this here we have Here we have G finite k skeleton. We don't have that here. So there is then a machinery by Brown, and everybody so far has used this machinery, everything by Brown, that gives us a recipe of how to transform this poset into how to find a nice space from this poset that satisfies enough properties that you can read. Properties that you can beat off those conditions. Namely, you build a space X, X is gone, Y is gone, Z. You have a contractible space, Z, and it has a filtration. And these things are G finite. And the stabilizers behave well. Stabilizers are good enough for what we. Are good enough for what we need, and then look at the homotopy, how the homotopy groups, the connectedness of the pairs, said Di said very scope. And you look at the connectedity of these pairs. And that has to be and that bit is a difficult one. That's what everybody struggles with when they when they make those proofs. When I make those proofs, that these things are of type F infinity. So let me just finish with a bit of history because, yeah. So Stein's groups, I have a few more minutes, not any problems. Stein proved that her groups are of F infinity sometimes in the 90s. Then there was a lull. Then there was a lull, and everybody struggled with KB. And so with Desi and Ramshita, we managed K equals 2 and 3. And then for arbitrary K it was I don't know. And I think it's a very good idea. And yeah, so and and um then we proved this for our groups. That's with nitrogen. And then on the other side, this proof by Matsui proved that his groups are of type F neutrality using this method. Shin is proving it. Shin is grouping it for his groups with that method, and everybody seems to be using that method. And there's this meta theorem: all Thomson groups are of type F infinity, and I hope that's not true, because it would be boring. So, I mean, we need, for example, we need for our groups, we need completeness. So here we need oh, I should probably say that, our things have to be complete, valid and bounded. Valid and bounded. So, what happens if it's not complete? I don't know. And so, what has been done, so there have been families of groups, of Thompson-like groups, where this doesn't hold. So, but these are sort of hybrid groups between. Did somebody mention the group and crosshead which groups already self-similar groups where you sort of fold in self-similar groups into your group F, R V. So these are V, G, and this is done by Skipper, Witzel Hemski. So where this, so they built some hybrids, let's call them hybrids. And as you see, they're very, I mean they're And as you see, they're very, I mean, there's clever clouds, super clever constructions. These are some sets of V and some self-similar groups. And they have families, GN, that are of type F N but not F N plus 1. And simple. And again, there's the use. And again, they use Brown's method. Because Brown's method is not just that this connectivity connectivity. So I've given you here the easiest version. Brown actually has an if and only if the group is of type F and if and only if some connectivity holds. So that's what they do. What problem do I have? Okay, so then I'm not going to write it. So recently we have some. But recently we have some results with, and I mentioned their names with Castellano, Narciona and Santos Vego. But we also only find only we also find Thomson hybrid groups. Hybrid groups. So we find another family and another family of hybrid Thompsons. And they are not simple. I don't know what I'm going to call them. That has the same thing, that are F N, but not F. Fn, but not Fn plus 1. But here we have to rely on Chimik and Baal's result that Shin mentioned earlier, that V is Zacyclic. We only knew Q acyclic, but because of their result, we can actually do this. And the methods we use here, we go back to a very homological group by Bie, where he constructs his groups that are of type F n but not Fn plus one sort of thing. Fn, but not Fn plus 1, sort of original ones. But again, they are not, these groups are not topological full groups of anything. We can construct something that's not discrete using something like this, but then it's not even Hub Thompson-like. So the hunt is still out there for a Thompson group or Thompson-like group, sort of an honest Thompson group, that's not of type F infinity. That would be That would be nice. No, I started.
