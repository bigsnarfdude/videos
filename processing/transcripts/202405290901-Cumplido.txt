Thank you very much for inviting me to give this talk. And so, because the discussion, the discussion session of today is about art in groups, my aim here is to give you an overview of what has been done about hyperpolicity in art groups. I'm not an expert in many of the subjects or techniques I'm going to talk about. Going to talk about. So, yeah, I'm just going to explain to you what's been done, what are the main techniques, what are the main complexes that have been used. So, when we discuss, we can have like the references. Okay, so first thing maybe is to explain what is an RT group. So, we have a finite set of generators and then And then all the relations look like this. We have alternate products of personal generators, like that, and the length of this relation is the same length as this relation. And normally to express algebra, we use copsetographs. Um so I think in general what we do is no edge if there's no relation between S and Z, in which case we say that this length is infinity, and we draw an edge if this is not infinity with the link. It finishes with the label of the relation, of the length of the relation. You're not going to find this notation for coxotegraphs all the time because for example for spherical type art groups, which are the art groups we have, a finite coxotego, this the data into This proximity. We have many, many infinities here. So we have many tools here and no infinity. So we draw no edge when we have a commutation. But in general, we use this one. So about hyperbolicity. I think the flagship example is the break group. Not the break in the break group that sometimes we note it like A N, sometimes like calligraphically n plus 1. In this we have end generators and relations. Relations of this type when these are not consecutive, and when they are consecutive, we have this relation. And so we know, of course, that this is the mapping class of these plus one functions, and we know. Functions, and we know a lot about mapping plus rule. So we know a lot about brains. So, um, where should I start? Maybe by my result. So, when I was doing my thesis, we were trying to generalize some results about mapping classrooms to art and groups of spherical type material. And we realized that there are these objects that are called parabolic. That there are these objects that are called parabolic subgroups that, in the case of the breakgroup, are completely analogous to curves in the curve graph. So it happened since that, since 2019, these subgroups have has played a very important role in the in knowing more things about um articles. Article. So first we need to know what is a standard problem exactly. And it's just a subgroup generated by a subset of generators. And by van der Leck, we know that this is again an outsing group. Again, an outing group. So we can talk about a parabolic subgroup having finite types, where every type is the same, or F C type, because again we have this. And a parabolic subgroup is just a conjugate. Any conjugate of a standard one. So for braids, we have And we have the end factor in this case. Taking a subset of generators is equivalent as taking the points that are potentially moved by the elements in this subset of generators. So for example, if we are going to take the generator the generators one and two One and two, the first generator switched the first two points, and the second generator switched these points. So there is a bijection between the multi-curves, the round multi-curves, and the standard parabolic subgroups. Does it make sense? And for any parabolic subgroup, we just have to use the action of breaks in the curve graph. Index curve graph. So for example, if we are taking this parabolic sample, standard one, and we want to see what is the projection between this parabolic subgroup. And so, what is their image in the curve? So, what is their image in the Kergraph? We just have to use the action of sigma 3, and we will obtain something like that. So, there is, and of course it's not just curves, it's multi-curves, really. It's multi-curves. So, that's why, if we want to construct a complex that is completely analogous, we are going to use only irreducible parabolic subgroups, which are the reparables. Parabolic subgroups, which are the reparabolic subgroups that are kind of decomposed as a direct product. Okay, so using this idea, we construct the complex of usually parabolic subgroups. I have a question. Yes, sure. Can you say again, I guess, how the curves correspond to the standard curve loss of groups? Yeah, so if you take. So if you take a subset of generators, you take the curve that circles the points that can be potentially moved by those generators. This complex has exactly the same definition as the curve complex as vertices. As vertices, we have irreducible parabolic subgroups. Maybe I should do that again. So don't get hurt. And so we have this and we have it's a flat complex, as the curve graph. Complex as the curve graph. And we have this if the subgroups are disjoint, but not really disjoint, because we can have two situations. Maybe they are disjoint like this, or they are just disjoint like this. One contains the other. And this is a hard And this is a hard condition to check. So what we prove is that we have this if the generators of the center, so we have P and Q for spherical arting groups. Indeed, first we did it for a spherical type, which again are the arting groups. We have finite coconut group and they have Caused structure, and those are. Hauser structure, and those are the ones that are conjectured to have non-trivial centers. And for things have non-trivial centers, and for all the others, they are conjectured to have trivial centers. So we say that we can draw an edge, they are disjoint, if their centers commute. The generator of their centers commute. And this is the And this is a much nicer condition because it's very easy to check. It's very easy to check. We know exactly how the center of a spherical type article looks like. Yes? Parvoids commuting or one thing contains the other? Yeah, it's exactly the same. It is the same. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's equivalent. Having this adjacency condition that we obtain just doing the analogous thing that we do for the curves is the same as having the generators on the center cross-conflicts. So we did that and then we stopped because actually what we were trying to do is to prove that the intersection of parabolic subgroups is again a parabolic subgroup. Is again a parabolic subgroup, which is a very hard question. It has been the aim of my academic life. And so we. Sorry, can I just ask? What's a spherical? Is A spherical type or the parabolic subgroup which is spherical type? For the R T group to be of a spherical type, and then every, if the Reingroup is equal to spherical type, every subgroup is a spherical type as well. So, Rose, in her thesis, she generalized this construction for F type. Try and some more is dry. So you can see S type after it looks as amagamentated products of spherical type and or also the clicks of the coxeter graphs are finite type, as you say. And what she does is to And what she does is to take, as Berta said, only the spherical type parabolic. Which makes sense because those are the ones with non-trivial center. And she proved the same condition. Same uh adjacency transcript. Now, about hyperbolicity of this complex. We know of course that in great rooks we have it because it's a curved complex. And Rooks is working very hard in this case. And for some cases, for some spherical cases, we also know it by the word. Knowing by the work of Matie Caradais and Bruno here. And what they did is first use the relations that we have between the break group and some spherical type RT groups. So we have spherical type and also Euclidean type. So we have that the Bn. So we have that the Vn, which is not the break group, is like if we have if this is the break group with the other notation for cox of the group, which means that we have a 3 relation between these two, a 3 relation between these two, and a 3 relation between these two, 3 and 3. And all the other things commute, the Vn is the same, but with a 4. But with a four. And we know that there is a monomorphism to the break group. And using this monomorphism, they prove that the parabolic complex for B N is quasi isometric to the parabolic complex for. Parabolic complex for the grid group, AN. And so it's also hyperbolic. And they also use some relations between the Euclidean type and this Euclidean type and this Euclidean type that also have some relations with. P N the great group. And they are able to prove that their associated parabolic sub-group complex are quasi-isometric to some sort of this one. So they are also hyperbolic. So please. When is this known to be hyperbolic? This is known to be valid? I mean, for grade groups, it's the curve graph. Yes. And then the only things we know is that for this graph, we have a monomorphism, and they are able to prove that still the parabolic subgroup complex is quasi-isometric to the curve graph. And for these two, nucleant type is quasi-isometric for a subgroup. So this is the only thing we know regarding the hyperpublicity of those um of this com new complex, not that new anymore. And for rads. And for rats, yeah. Yeah, we forget rats. If you do it for rats, you get the same complex that some of them love the HTTPs and it all works. Yes, it is. Thank you, thank you. Which complex you get? You get the extension graph or you get the contact graph. You get the extension graph. Extension graph. Yes. Yes, yes. Thank you. Yes, yes. Thank you. Okay, so this is what we know about this complex. And then there have been other attempts, other nice complex. There is the additional length of the additional length complex by calculus artists. And piece. And so the idea here is that for spherical type for spherical type, we have Garcade structure, which is a structure that gives us normal forms. So we can always So we can always write an element in this form with l where this or this is the generator of the center generates the center and Charlie proved proof Charlney proved that. Ruth Charney proved that these normal forms give geodesics in the KD graph. So the question that Matthias and Bert asked themselves was: okay, if Was, okay, if this is a geobasic indentative graph, and I look for rates, for example, I have rates, and I look at the curved graph, I look at the curve graph, and I have a base vertex. Then, is this adjudic? And what do we do next? So a geodesic here gives a geodesic here. And they say if this is. Yeah, this is the K D graph. So this is the K D graph of the break group with the standard, with these generators. So they're called the single generators. This is the K D graph and this is the Kerr graph. So the Kerr graph. So So they say, okay, this is true if geodesic here goes to a geodesic here. Then if you have a geodesic triangle here, you should have you should have a thin triangle here. And what they do is, we don't know if this is true. Let's modify the Haley graph in order to have exactly this. So they squash. So they squash they squash the KE draft They squash the KE graph and basically they add to the the the KE graph adding some absorbable Absorbable element. So, what is an absorbable element? Y is absorbable if there exists x such that when you add, when you multiply. add when you multiply x and y this has the same normal formula so it's called absorbable because you have your x with your normal form and you put y here and you don't have any new length so it's like it's absorbable and And so the idea is: hold all this. So you will have, as Vertex said, the cosets, these cosets, because you don't really care about data and because the conjecture is that for an Arctic group to be For an R group to be cylindrically hyperbolic, you have to portion by the center. So we take those processes. And then we said that two are adjacent, basically, if we can go from one to the other by an absorbable element or just one of the ones that we have before. One of the ones that we have before. And it's so they squash this. And the nice thing about this complex is that you don't really use the curve graph. You don't use it. You just have these conditions that are completely dependent on the Garcett destruction. So they are able to define this complex for every Garcett group, not only Arteta groups, but every Garcett group. And they are able to prove. And they are able to prove that this complex is that this gramo hydrobox. And what they use is the guessing geodesic lemma voltage. Lema So they use preferred preferred paths and basically they have to check the thinness of the triangles of the preferred path. I think that Eliot used something similar in his talk, right? So yeah, they're able to So, yeah, they are able to prove this. And then, an interesting thing is to see if there is some relation between this complex and the complex of parabolic sub-proof. And in their paper, they are able to prove that if you have the Kerr graph, if you have the Kergraph, there is a There is a leaf chip function that goes to the additional length complex. And for every spherical arcting group, it is also true. It is also true. And they prove that this graph has infinite diameter. graph has infinite diameter if infinite diameter if the group is irreducible so not a direct product of all the arsenal and in a second paper they prove that for every irreducible spherical type Spherical type. Spherical type. This is a cylindrically hyperbolic. And what they do is to find a WPD element. So finding a element. Okay, so This was one of the first results at the time. The first for spherical in general. And then there was a very, very interesting paper by McCammon and Solway, where they proved. Where they prove that if you have a Euclidean type of type, so the cocceter group is acting on Euclidean spaces, then this injects in a crystallographic group with Garcetta structure. So Mathieu saw this and thought, ah, I can do again the same thing using this Garcon structure, which is really more complicated than this one. And so he he generalized uh these results to Euclidean type as well. So he also proved that uh things are accidentally. Are actually hyperbolic with the additional length complex that you can define for every garcup. So, grab it with this one. Okay. So, enough of spherical type, I would say. And so we have for rats. What more? We have now we have a series of papers that use the delinear complex. Should I explain? Complex. Should I explain what is the Velinear complex? Yes? So the Velinear complex is a complex that has been used since the 90s. I think the first one was Ruth Charnay and Mike Davies. And so what they do is basically to take all the subset of generators that induce That induce a spherical type spherical type subgroup and they take the poset of the coset of this and you solve the linear complex or modify the dependent the delinear complex. Is the realization, the geometric realization of the derived complex. So this is a very powerful tool that has been used all over and over again. And so okay, Okay, that worked. So, some results that we have, some family of article groups that have been proved to be asymmetrically hyperbolic. We have Indira chapter G and Alex Martin. Alex Martin that they prove that we have a cylindrical hyperbolicity for FC type with diameter diameter of the coccytograph at least. At least at least three. And so they use precisely the action on the Delina complex and are able to prove the following theorem. So if you have G acting essentially and non-elementary, all are cut zero. Zero cube complex and you have two hyperplanes H1 and H2 such that the stabilizer of one intersection with the stabilizer of the other is finite, then. That G is silicon hyperportal, and they use the action of those groups in the linear complex, and they are able to prove that. Then, Rose and Ruth came again, so this is first, and they generalize this result. Can I ask you questions? Yes. What do you mean by essentially? Essentially, is that no element Is that no element acts like the trivial one? I'm more than they were able to prove it for arts and groups for arts and groups that are not adjoint, meaning that the coxeter. That the Coxeter graph is not the joint of two other subjects. And being able to do that means a cylindrical hyperbolic. It is asylum hyperbolic. Exactly. So this is, I say I'm going to hyperbolic. But here the only spherical type that we have is the spherical one. Yeah, we have this spherical. The spherical, yeah, we have this. There's no spherical type. So, all the spherical types have exactly so we can get so what they what their idea was we are not going to use the linear complex, but a new version that is the click complex that was made by Cornell. Go then go there and Paris. And the idea is not to take the spherical type subgroup, but the T that spans a click. So T is a click. So the idea here is to The idea here is to be able to make induction arguments. So you don't take the infinities, it's the idea. So you don't care about the infinities. So it's cat0. Yeah, they prove that it's cat0, exactly. And the idea is to generalize this and that the abstractions to prove things are the infinities. So if you are able to prove things for attributes that don't have any. That don't have any infinity, then you can generalize them. So that's all. When is the pre-complex? When is it known to be CAD zero and when is it known to be hyperbolic? I have zero cat zero for all RTs. For all RT, yes, yes. Yes, yes. And is it never hyperbole? Sorry? Is it never hyperbolic? Um o I think only when the when the lean complex is hyperbolic. Yes. Yes, yes, I think so. Yeah, yes. So what's the hyperbolic space that witnesses the acylindricity? So? So what's the hyperbolic space that's witnessing the ecylindricity? Here? The cathode space and then like PBF type construction. Yeah, yeah, exactly. You use results that connect you to That connects you to is like the WPD element and so on. So I see you guys, there's no explicit description of those. No, not really. Not really. And are they known to be universally similar collections or not? No, I don't know. It's not known. They're not. It's not known or they're not? I don't think it's known. No, no, I don't think it's known. I think it's. Yeah. Okay, so they use this and they construct the WPD element, no? And yeah, maybe I should put this is cat0. This is cat0. And so I'm not forgetting anything. Yeah. Yeah. And then the next step has been recently out, no? And it's Out, no, and it's a paper of Rose and Alex McPan and they are able to prove this result for any article and article visually splitting. So, any article group. Visually splitting, so any eigengroup with not with infinity, right? So as long as you can decompose this, well they don't prove that, but they give nice nice conditions for this to be a silent pale hyperbolic. So basically so basically there is They are able to prove that if we have this malnormal or weekly malnormal or malnormal, then we have a cylindrical energy. In our normal in the whole group or in the vertex? In the whole group. In the whole group. And what they use is the result of the result of oh I have noticed they use the known result of minaceal and osium so we have that tells that if you have a amalgamated product And C is weakly monormal, then G is virtually cyclic or symmetrically hyperbolic. And it's very nice because they're also able to prove that this is equal. So if you have that the intersection of perbolics is perbolic, then you have. Of verbolics is verbolic, then you have this stage. So then you have this condition and then you have a cylindrical parabolicity, which is really nice because the intercept of parabolic is the program that I like very much. And now I can cite rows and say, oh, this is. And her team and say, oh, this is very important, because they have a thing because it remotes. And so this was the story of FC type, I would say, and related families. How much time do I have? Twenty minutes. So um maybe I go with the story of uh it's isl and two dimensional. And two-dimensional. So for XXL, which are R2 groups where the relation is at least four, like four or five, four, four, four. I then proved that if you have a bleed. But if you have at least three generators and some element acts on cat0 piecewise Euclidean complex With a rank one asymmetry then we have a cylindrical improvising thing and this is system is yours or not? You have the the You have the b the I was how was it? I have it somewhere. I think this is yours, right? It's basically yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's so you have you have to recycle. This is good to decide or and attempt to construct this complex for this family of groups, I would say in a very ad hoc way using the presentation of the group. We also have some results by Catherine Boldman, where she used the concept of an article group being relatively extra-large to a family of sub-groups. So you have a Coxeter graph defining your group, and you have a family. Your group, and you have a family of subgroups in such a way that the generators of this family covers the whole family of generators. And we say that this is extra-latch related to this family if every time that you have a vertex between two families, then there is another family. There is another family connected to this one by a law. And she proved that if not all edges, if not all edges are two, then we have a edge and and she used uh another modification of the Berliner conflict. Another modification of the Virinia Conflict modify with the following subset so as subsets we will have the empty set empty set our generators so one two our generators then if you if we have two families that are connected subsets like this for every family connected and also just this one and she's able to And she's able to prove this result using a criterion by Mathemat. What do you mean when you say that the Domain path like Madapart or the founding subset? Yeah, so it's the same construction doing a coset. So you do the cosets of this subset, you do the coset of these assets, you have Coset of this asset, you have a coset and you construct the derived complex of this coset instead of libraries instead of instead of exactly. And so here is the Martin's criteria, which is It is the Martin's criterion which is used that says that if a group acts simplicially by isometries in a cat zero and there is a vertex vertex with this is a stabilizer. This is the stabilizer such that one, the orbits of this equalizer on the link of V are unbounded and this stabilizer is weakly. is weakly malware. Then G is virtually cyclical or cylindrical. So she uses that. So she shows that this construction gives a cat zero statement. Yes. I think so. Then there was Alexo, Martin and this is the big time of the talk. I think I can write pretty ski without looking at the Key without looking at it. They prove a cylindrical hyperbolicity for two-dimensional hyperbolic type. So two dimensional is that if you take the if you for every triangle you take the relations you have this one and one one or two two one one and so two dimensional because the only spherical type that you get are dihedral. So That are tihedral. And hyperbolic type, the Coxeter, the Coxeter group is hyperbolic. And so they are able to prove syntactical hyperbolicity. And they are the first, they use the linear complex. We use the Delinear complex. And they Today of standards which are the fixed points the fixed points uh in the complex, in so if this is in the complex. So, this is a very innocent complex of generators and conjugates. So, they use this complex and another criterion that I don't have much time to prove that this is a significant hyperbolic. And then, Alex's student, Nicolas. Nicola Basco, he proved it for all two dimensions. And what he did is use this criterion. He used this criterion and he modified again the linear complex. So he constructs something called the augmented the linear complex. Complex in which basically what he did is every time you see an infinity, you replace it by a six and you impose that the stabilizer, so that you have an infinity between S and T and then the stabilizer of the vertex corresponding to this S T imposed that is the free group. And with this complex, he's able to apply this. Scratchy. If not a rack. So, yeah, because we already have the result for rags. So if this is not a rack, then you have that this next portus is at zero, and I use the crazy. And regarding And regarding isolated hyperbolicity, I think the last thing is a recent paper of Gilmas Propolo. Very recent, just in archive. And she's able to prove ideological hyperbolicity for many. For many, many types of locally reducible articles. Maybe I don't have time to explain the whole specific, but the conflict she used here is different because she She takes, it's similar to the linear complex, but she starts with all parabolic submons, with all parabolic subs, not just the finite type, what we call now art and complex. And she does some modifications as well. And yeah, it's it's a bit long, so but yeah, uh modification. Notification of the article take all parabolics not only speak a lot speak a lot. Okay. So I think this is all we have regarding accelerated hyperbolicity. And then regarding HHS, regarding HHS, regarding HHS, what we have is basically what Alice told us. So we have racks, we have mapping class groups. There is a question I have for 18. HHS. We have it for mapping class groups. So, for traits, what happened for the groups that, so Bn that has the monomorphism to AN and the Euclidean type is Euclidean type. That goes also here. And then the latest result is a paper is a paper of Alest. Is a picture of Alice, Mark, and Alice. So who is there first? I need okay. Sorry for having my tasks. I may prove HHS for um two dimensional two dimensional Two-dimensional um hyperbolic. And I struggle with this paper, but I think I get the idea. And the idea is to detect the things that obstruct hyperbolicity and to construct, to do combinatorial HHS. And so you look for the direct product, which Piotr and Alex found to be things like this. And so this, they want to be the maximal synthesis, and then they construct a nice complex which is the computation graph of the minimum of the intersection of this. Of this. And so this graph turns to be quasi-isometric of the linear complex. And you like that because it has many nice properties. But for having the HHS the combinatorial HHS uh condition, you need the links to be hyperbolic, and for the links to be hyperbolic, you you need to do the spudification. You need to do the spidification, you know? And with a very long paper, doing this, they can check all the combinatorial HHS processes. And I think we don't have anything else regarding HHS in articles. For now. Except drugs. And drugs, yeah, and rugs and mapping passwords. Rugs and mapping passwords. The drugs is like the The drive is like the passage, yeah. Okay, so I think I covered it all. Are these two-dimensional art groups in type the top-level curve? Really tightly the top level curve around the HHS structure is the compound. Okay, so since you know the starting group stuff very well, so from what you were able to get out of the Alex, the one with Alex, Mark, and Alex, which of these other art groups do you think, like, just if you blurb your eyes and try to figure out what they did, which of the other ones do you think falls within that same sort of framework? That same sort of framework, it could be approached in the same way. In the same way as this? Yeah. I mean, like, what sort of tools that they use there, do you think, apply? Like, which other families of art group do you think are most applicable? I think we could start with spherical types, for sure, because they share many, many properties with great groups. Maybe it's it's hard. But maybe it's hard just in terms of using this strategy, right? Because the spherical ones are the ones that have their delayed components just. No, but I was thinking about the mapping class group approach. Yeah, yeah, thinking about the mapping class group approach for grades. Then. About like FC type. FC type or like FC type with knowledge gradient. Yeah, so you get you get there's a similar, like you can cone off the delete complex in the same way, and it's when you do that, it's quasi-asymmetric to this complex of parabolic subgroups. So if you could prove that that was hyperbolic, then you would be doing great. But also do you cone off the complex in that case, but still are like explicit to counter. Yeah, of conjugates of standard parabolic. Yeah. When it's infinite type, if you do that for a finite type, the complex parallel sublues is infinite diameter and the filling complex is finite diameter, then you cone it off and it's still finite diameter. I don't know if there's two people in the so spherical type does seem reasonable to approach the mapping plasma techniques and everything where you want which techniques? With the mapping classroom. With the mapping plastic technique. Oh, free. Nobody else. I mean, I I'm also working on that. I mean I'm also working on SP type ones by that project. Also me. For a certain time we were working on even FC type which should look pretty similar to RAX and we were trying to follow the same code for RAX, like one of the possible approaches. For which type, sorry? Even FC type. Even FC type. Which should really quite raise. No, we were we were starting from the hitrons and then doing them like just doing them algorithm three products but it I don't know we got stuck pretty fast well we're gonna have a whole discussion about assuming for great
