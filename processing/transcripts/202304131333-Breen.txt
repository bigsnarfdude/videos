Topic is the digital correspondence in all dimensions. Great. So let's see. First preliminary comment is to thank the organizers for having us all here and inviting me to talk as well. This has been a special, special week so far. So the second thing I wanted to say is that in grad school for six years I had an office deep in the interior of the building very far from the pound. So since leaving, I'm still getting accustomed to the concept. Getting accustomed to the concept of windows. So, if I stop and look confused and I'm gazing off into the distance, I might actually be confused or I might just be looking at the window. Or the view of myself. But I'll try to stay focused. If it seems like I'm distracted, you can snap me out of it. Yeah, so I'm going to be talking about the Giroux correspondence, which is a statement about contact structures and open books. So I'm, like I said, Books. So I'm, I guess, a contact topologist. That's the angle I'm coming from. But before getting into this, I wanted to start out by doing my duty and talking about how this fits into the context of this workshop. So, workshop context. And really, all I want to say for now, I'll come back to this at the end a little bit. Now, I'll come back to this at the end a little bit, but like I said, I'm a contact topologist. So, as contact topology relates to four-dimensional convexity, one of the things that we've seen a lot already this week is that if you have some sort of, say, symplectic manifold where you impose a convexity condition, so call this a Weinstein joint or something like that. By the way, my version of four-dimensional convexity as far as this talk goes is going to be wine steep. One of the things that we've seen this week is that level sets or boundaries of this thing are contact manifolds. So three-dimensional contact topology interacts very heavily with four-dimensional convexity in this case. So take some kind of hypersurface and this would be convex. So this relationship is very well established that three-dimensional contact topology is informed by and informs four-dimensional, say, symplectic convexity. If you'd like, my talk is going to come from the other side. So rather than seeing four-dimensional convexity with contact topology from below, I want to see it from above. And that interaction is a bit more interesting. And that interaction is a bit more interesting and different. So here's what I mean by that. Suppose I have a five-dimensional contact. And I impose a kind of convexity condition on this. I'll talk more about what I mean by that in a second. But I can then look at, say, a generic level set or a generic hypersurface. For a generic hypersurface in this five-dimensional contact modifier. Now, that's going to be some four-dimensional thing. So I'll draw this. It looks suspiciously also two-dimensional. Like my five-dimensional contact looks. But a generic hypersurface here is going to be four-dimensional. Is this thing going to be a convex symplectic thing? No, not in this sense, because one of the things In this sense, because one of the things that we've talked about is that a convex symplectic manifold, there's a restriction on the topology. You have to have a boundary. But a generic hypersurface of this kind is a funny kind of convex object, which you can think about as being the union of two Weinstein domains. So one of these hypersurfaces, this is going to be a Weinstein domain. A Weinstein domain. This other half is an upside-down Weinstein domain. It'll be a negative Weinstein domain where you reverse the direction of your bucket field. Not saying this carefully at all, but I just want to point out that you can see four-dimensional convexity from above inside a five-dimensional contact manifold. Contact manifold. So contact topology also interacts with and informs, and vice versa, four-dimensional convexity, but upward dimensionally. So this is what I'm going to be talking about. This is maybe the takeaway of this talk. And so I think I'll be jumping between dimension five as I feel like it, but everything I say today extends to all dimensions, and for what it's worth, that includes dimension three. Okay, anyway. To work up to the Jreux correspondence, I want to start with some historical context. Is that the issue for the Gibraltar correspondence in five dimensions or three dimensions? This is a five-dimensional correspondence picture. So I'll explain more exactly what I mean by. More exactly what I mean by something like this. Let's see. So the name, the Giroux correspondence, this first refers to the celebrated theorem of Giroux about 20 years ago, which is the following. So I'll write down the theorem and then I'll tell you what the things in the theorem are, for those that don't know. those that don't know. But so maybe a little bit informally, I'll say that the Giroux correspondence as the Giroux correspondence in dimension three says that isotopy classes of contact structures on a three manifold. These are in one-to-one correspondence with support. With supporting open book depositions. I'll tell you what this means in a second. Modulo, an operation called positive stabilization. This is fairly This is fairly significant for a few reasons, but one of the things it says is that on one hand, we have contact structures, which a priori are a fairly geometric thing. On the other hand, we have open book decompositions of three manifolds. And that's a very topological idea. So this correspondence kind of tells you that actually contact structures are very topological things. And moreover, this builds a pretty explicit relationship between contact and structures. Between contact topology and say the technology of like low-dimensional topology, mapping class group stuff, and so on. Anyway, so this is kind of a well-known cornerstone result in three-dimensional contact topology. I think the next thing I want to do is, let me tell you what these things mean, because I don't think so far in the workshop we've defined open book. This has come up a little bit, but I'll write down some definitions. I'll write down some definitions. So let's see. I'll tell you what a supporting open book decomposition of a manifold is. So here's the definition. A supporting open book decomposition, which I'll just start abbreviating. I'll just start abbreviating OBD of a contact manifold M3C is the following data. First of all, you want a transverse link in your three-manifold. Such that when you delete that, you get a vibration. So, in other words, smoothly, this is like a fibered link. So, I want a vibration away from that link. This is called the binding. And if I stopped here and ignored this word transverse, that would just be an open book. Would just be an open book decomposition of the three-minifold as a smooth topological object. The contact structure is coming into play, first of all, here. You want this binding to be transverse to the contact structure. The other thing that you want is you want there to be a choice of ray vector field for your contact structure, which is transverse to all the fibers of the vibration. Of vibration. So there is a, I'll be a little bit lazy, Morgan can find raves for us less time. So there is a rave vector field that is always transverse to these fibers, which are called the pages. Okay, what's the idea? The idea is that you have contact structure, and it's a bunch of these twisty planes. You want this vibration of your three manifold such that, not vibration, but you want this open book decomposition such that the contact structure is as tangent to the pages as possible. You cannot require that you find pages that are tangent because it's a contact structure. Because it's a contact structure, but you just say, as much as possible, I want the contact structure to be tangent to the ditches. That's this condition essentially. And maybe the point is globally that you push all of the interesting kind of twisting of the contact structure toward the binding. Now, I'm interested in this stuff in higher dimensions, so I can basically extend this definition. Basically, extend this definition as written. I have to change a few things. So maybe I'll do this in red. If I instead wanted to do this for a manifold of arbitrary dimension, my binding no longer is a link, but it's, I'll keep that up. Your binding should be a codimension 2 contact sub-manifold. Sub-manifold. This is the appropriate generalization of a transverse link. A transverse knot in a three-dimensional contact manifold is a one-dimensional contact sub-manifold. So your binding becomes a codimension two-contact sub-manifold. And I think the rest of this is fine for the most part. The idea here is that your page. Here is that your pages inherit a symplectic structure. So, this condition about wanting the contact structure to be as tangent as possible to the pages, in higher dimensions you can say, well, I want the contact structure to induce a symplectic structure on my pages. That's also true in low dimensions, but the symplectic condition on a two-dimensional page is not all that interesting. But So, in fact, since this comes from a contact structure, you get an exact symplectic structure, and you can further require, if you want, maybe I'll write this down, that your pages be something like Leoville or Weinstein. So, I'm going to go ahead and get a little bit of a message. Definition. So, an OVD is what I'll call strongly Weinstein. If all of the pages are Weinstein or they have birth-death points, I will allow birth-death points in my own. So all pages are either Weinstein or with Earth Death Pulse. Like I said, this is only kind of important in higher conditions. Okay, so that's. Okay, so that's this. Supporting open book of a contact structure. This positive stabilization operation is as follows. So, definition. Oh, before I tell you that, I have to remark that there's a slightly different way that you can think about an open book decomposition, which is the primary way that I'm going to think about it for the purposes of this talk. So, here's a remark. An open book decomposition of a manifold or of a contact manifold, you can think about as a sort of relative mapping tortoise of a page with the monodromy map that you get by going around the filter. So an open book decomposition. This is maybe what you'd call an abstract open book for those of you that have seen that language, but an OVD can be taught. But an OVD can be thought of as a relative mapping torus of sorts. I'll call this thing S. This will be a compact neighborhood, or like a compact version of my page. So I'll take this to be a Weinstein version. So I'll take this to be a Weinstein domain. Say a compact retract of pi inverse zero. And a monodromy map, which in higher dimensions you need to be symplectic, and you need it to be the constant on the Constant on the or the identity on the boundary. So this is a symplectic monitoring event that fixes the memory. Sorry for running into the point of why does this give you an open book decomposition position? I'll just draw a picture. I won't be careful about this, but here's the idea. The idea. So start with: here's S, here's my page. It has an exact symplectic structure that I'll call, say, Lambda. I can thicken that thing up. I can take the contactization of that page, which I'll draw like that. Like that. So here's I'll go over there. Here's S cross an interval, and I can give this a contact structure by doing dt plus lambda. So this is the contactization of the page. I think this has come up at some point. And then I'm going to identify all of these. All of these page boundaries as one. So, continuing my little diagram, I'll collapse all the boundaries to one single boundary to get this sort of bouquet of pages. And then I'll use this monodromy map phi to take this guy. Map phi to take this guy, move it all the way up here, and I'll get a closed panel. And I'm being very sloppy about this, but you can do this in a way where you're consistent about building the contact structure and so on. And this process will then do this carefully, you'll get a closed contact manual. And you can show Contact manifold, and you can show it's more or less equivalent to this idea. So, all this is to say that when I think about open books, as far as this talk goes, I'm primarily thinking about them like this. I'm thinking about them as the sort of relative mapping torus of a Weinstein token. I bring that up because this is the easiest way to describe what positive stabilization is. So, this is the last part of the Jreux correspondence that I haven't told you what it means. Zibri's definition. So, a positive stabilization of an open book, which I'll write this way, is the following. Maybe I'll just draw a picture as my definition. But let's suppose that here is, here's Here's my age S, and then the binding B is going to be the boundary of your A. To positively stabilize this, what I'll do, well in dimension 3, so that if your page is a surface, you can just pick an arc. Attach a one handle to your page. along the boundary of that article. Then you get a circle by gluing on the core of the handle that you just attached. So I have a new page because I've added a handle. And then the monodrome I will change by composing with a positive Dane twist around this circle. Oh. Maybe I'll just. Maybe I'll just. Not a great definition, but I'll say it again. In dimension 3, pick an art with boundary on your page, blue on a 1 handle, compose with a positive Dane twister number. You can also do this in higher dimensions. The thing that you need is for this purple arc that you stabilize along, this is going to be a Lagrangian disc. So, in general, You want this to be a Lagrangian disc? Yep. The handle you glue on is going to be a critical Weinstein n handle along the boundary of that disk. And then you compose with a higher dimensional positive symplectic dangerous. So it's the same basic kind of operation. The thing you now have to be careful about. The thing you now have to be careful about since you have symbolactic data is that you need your disk to be a Weinstein. This is a Weinstein. I think those were all the definitions I needed to go back to a theorem that I've conveniently erased, but I can stay. Race, but I can state the theorem a bit more carefully now that I've told you about this stuff. The Giroux correspondence in dimension 3 says that, first of all, if you pick your favorite contact manifold, you can find a supporting open book decomposition. Supporting open books always exist. Moreover, the stabilization equivalence part says that if you have any two supporting open books, they admit They admit a common stabilization. Or rather, there is a sequence of stabilizations and destabilizations that you can do to get from one to the other. Sorry, maybe it's because probably you need to check if you get a sphere. Yeah, yeah, so there's there's a lot to a lot to check. Now, that's the correspondence in dimension 3 from 20 years ago. At the time, there was a partial extension of this to higher dimensions. So I think that's a good idea. So, also 20 years ago or so, so I'll attribute this to Juru and Mosley, to be honest. They considered the situation in higher dimensions. First of all, given a higher dimensional contact manifold, you can ask, does there exist a, say, strongly Weinstein Say strongly Weinstein supporting open book, and then what's the status of some sort of stabilization of openness? So, as far as existence goes, they were able to prove that they always exist. So, we still knew 20 years ago that your favorite contact manifold of any dimension admits a supporting Strongly Weinstein open book composition. But the stabilization equivalence at the time was much weaker. And to tell you why it's weaker, I need to remark how they proved this versus how Giroux thought about this stuff in dimension 3. This is important for the story of this talk. The story of this talk. The correspondence theorem in dimension three, the technology, the ideas were very different than this higher-dimensional region. So in particular, what Giroux did in dimension three was use his convex surface theory. The picture that I drew over here with the funny double Weinstein, that's a convex hypersurface in the language of contact topology. And he used that idea in dimension three to build open books. Dimension 3 to build open books and think about it. Basically, that amounts, as far as I'm concerned, to doing like contact Morse theory. So in Dimension 3, we used very Morse theoretic ideas to think about open books. Completely different in higher dimensions. In higher dimensions, they prove existence of supporting open book decompositions using this Donaldson technology that I think has also come up in talk at some point. I won't go into this too much, but I won't go into this too much, but so this Donaldson technique imported into contact topology by Ebor, Martinez, Torres, Presses, where you can look at sections of certain complex line bundles, the zeros of those sections, you can get a binding, and so on. So that's how they thought about this in higher dimensions. And so the stabilization equivalence Stabilization equivalence that they were able to is that any two strongly Weinstein supporting open book decompositions obtained using the Donaldson technique were strongly stably equivalent. So obtained by the Donaldson technique, which is the Technique, which is the thing that proves this are strongly stable. So, this is something, but in practice, this is a little bit annoying for a few reasons. One is that it does not say that all Say that all strongly Weinstein-supporting open book decompositions are equivalent. It only says that the ones you get doing this Donaldson technique business are equivalent. But even more impractical is that I think it's very hard if you have an open book that you care about, I think it's very hard to tell if it came from this Donaldson technique. Like this Donaldson stuff involves like sufficiently large powers of things. Of things. So, in practice, I think it's just very hard to know when the Donaldson technique comes into the picture and how to use it. But anyway, in arbitrary dimensions, there was some sort of equivalence. There's existence in some sort of equivalence, but approved using very different. What does strong mean? Oh, yeah. So, okay, thanks for asking. So, I won't talk about this too much, but strong. But strongly Weinstein means all the pages are Weinstein, except maybe you have birth/death points. There's also a notion of weekly Weinstein where only one page is Weinstein. And then you don't require, you know, say anything else about the rest. That's weekly Weinstein. I think right now, if you want to do all this stuff weekly, so when I say strongly So, when I say strongly stable equivalent, another thing I'm allowing here is like Weinstein homotopies or like homotopies of open books. And so, you could say like a strong Weinstein homotopy is a homotopy through strongly Weinstein open books and so on. So, yeah, thanks. That's the strongly here. Is it's preserving this condition that all your pages are Weinstein or Print? Okay. Now, almost catching up to today call this a remark. So, starting about, I don't know, four or five years ago. Honda and Huang, maybe all from Kevin Sackle as well, some others started kind of further developing convex surface theory into higher dimensions. Like I said, the three-dimensional correspondence statement was thought about using convex surfaces, very Morse theoretic ideas. And the problem is that at the time, it didn't extend very well to higher dimensions. To higher dimensions. Or they didn't have higher-dimensional versions of convex hypersurface theory that were very useful. So, recent work has been toward extending convex surface theory to like an ample convex hypersurface theory. So, Kao and Young, and like I said, some others independently extended I mean, the concept of a convex hypersurface existed, but the theory was not very useful at the time. So they extended the effectiveness, or the utility of the theory, to arbitrary dimensions. And we're able to reprove existence. Prove existence of supporting open books using the convex hyperservice theorem. So that's a new proof of open book existence, very much in the spirit of how things were done in dimension 3. And I'll just write down what I said. Reproved existence. I'm going to talk about exactly how this works because it's important for the stabilization part. But so this is still before my time. And then I have since joined the parade. And finally, this that I guess is what the talk is about in some sense. Is about in some sense is to finish off the stabilization equivalence using these convex hypersurface data. So what we're working on right now is the statement that any two strongly Weinstein supporting open books are strongly stable equipment. So again, a more complete version of this using the techniques that are much closer in spirit to how things work in Dimension 3. And for what it's worth, like I said. Like I said, dimension three as well. Okay, that's my history lesson catching up to now. And I'll spend the rest of the talk seeing how much I can tell you about how this works. Any questions so far? Dimensionless, but in dimension three, do you like size and reverse flock itself? Yeah, because in dimension three, this strongly Weinstein condition is kind of the ideas of the group. The ideas of the group. And the first thing that I want to try to convince you of, and I call this this array, is that we can think about open book decompositions more theoretically. So here's my first claim: that an open book decomposition is basically the same thing as a The same thing as a contact-handled composition. What do I mean by that? Here's a quick definition. So if you have a contact manifold, a contact Morse function. Is the data of, well, you first want a smooth Morse function. But the thing that makes it contact is you want the gradient of this thing to be a contact vector field. So you want the gradient of this to preserve the contact structure. So a choice of vector field X. Field X such that it's flow a choice of gradient length such that the flow preserves your contact structure. So this is the same basic idea as like when you define a Weinstein domain. What is that? It's a symplectic manifold with the choice of Morse function such that function such that your gradient preserves the symplectic, not really, but such that the gradient interacts with as nicely as possible the symplectic structure. Same idea here. To talk about contact manifolds Morse theoretically, you want a Morse function, but you want the gradient to preserve that structure that you care about. This gives you a contact handle decomposition. And my claim is that. And my claim is that that gives you an open book. So I'll just draw a picture to try to convince you of this, but here's the idea. Suppose I have one of these things. Maybe I'll jump down to dimension five now, but again, all this holds in any dimension. So here's a five-dimensional contact man, and I'll And I'll pick one of these contact Norse functions and I'll order the handles so that they're, say, self-indexing. So I have a zero handle. I have some one, two, three, four, five. There's one thing I can do with that. Up to five. I've gotten really good at that. Like where are the Moore syntheses? Yeah, so sorry. So I mean, these are the inputs. These are like the critical points. Yeah, yeah, yeah. points. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yep. So this is like a zero handle corresponding to an index zero critical point. This would be an index three critical point. Okay, so contact topology is a little bit interesting in that there are kind of two middle dimensions. And it turns out that if you look at these contact handles, down here you have 0, 1, and 2 handles. Contact 0, 1, and 2 handles are just Handles are just thickened Weinstein 012 handles. Small contactizations of Weinstein handles. So these are just thickened Weinstein handles. Up here, the three, four, and five handles are just thickened negative ones. Thickened upside down. Thickened upside down. So thickened negative ones. How does this give you an open book? I'll just make this up so quickly. So the idea is, well, So the idea is: well, then if I look at this lower half, this is just going to look like a thickened Weinstein domain. I can draw it like this. So here's my collection of 0, 1, and 2 numbers. It just builds a thickened Weinstein domain. What this does is it tells you what the page is. What is the page? So the Weinstein domain described by these thickened handles, that's your page. The upside down things tell you about the monodroming. So the upside-down guy you just glue on, and that defines your monodromy map. So here's the three channel parties. That's the That's the idea. Contact handle decomposition gives you an open book. If you've thought at all in the past in dimension three about how, say, from an open book decomposition, you can get a Hayguard splitting of a two-manifold, I'm basically describing the exact same thing. It just works. Okay, so really at the end of the day, to say stuff about open book decompositions, I'm going to try to phrase things in terms of contact Morse functions or contact. Contact more structure contact. How's that? Believable, at least. Okay, so if I want to prove then that my favorite contact manifold has a contact handle decomposition, sorry, has an open book decomposition. I want to build a contact horse function. Okay, so. Okay, so here's how this works. So to me, this is Albert of the question. I think they probably have to be. Because you're doing a bit more than just gluing five-dimensional candle bodies, they have to interact nicely. Yeah, so there's like all sorts of interaction between like tidy glue on these handles. So there's a lot more structure built in. There's a lot more structure built in rather than just good topology. Yeah, I think that's a good question. Okay, so really quickly, how do we get existence using these convex hypersurface theory ideas? The starting point is to just start with a smooth Morse function. Maybe I'll require it to be self-indexing as well. So I'll just start with a smooth Morse function. I'm not going to make any assumption about this being concact at all. And then I'll chop it in half for the moment between the index 2 and 3 handles, or in general between the index n and n plus 1 handles. Now, if I look below here, and I flow this negative piece back to This negative piece back to its skeleton. This is going to be an n-dimensional CW complex. If ambient dimension is 5, this is like a two-dimensional CW complex. And by an H-principle argument, like an open isotropic submanifold H-principle argument, you can witness. You can witness a small neighborhood of that thing as a contact keyboard. So, some retract of this lower piece you can write as a contact handlebody using an H Men score. Then I can do the same upstairs. I can just flow upwards. The skeleton of this thing, I can write a very small neighborhood of that as a standard contact body. What that leaves you with is this piece in the middle, which is going to be smoothly a trivial cobordism. All the handles are above and below. So that leaves you with this piece, which is going to look like some sigma. Some sigma across an edge point, where sigma is like the boundary of either one of these retractive contact tamper bodies. And what Honda and Huang show is so That generically, after a bunch of wiggling, if you have a trivial coordinate like this with a contact structure, generically all of those levels, except for finitely many, will be convex in the sense of being two Weinstein domains glued together. So generically Sigma cross S. So one of the layers, or you pick a layer in this middle part, is convex. And by that, I basically mean Weinstein glued to a negative Weinstein. Except Except for finitely many S values. Now, if you have a chunk where you're just convex all the way, you don't need any contact handles to describe that. That's just a trivial cohortism, both smoothly and at the level. Both smoothly and at the level of the contact structures. But at these failures of convexity to go from one, like from before one of these failures to after a failure, you do need a pair of contact handles that form something called a bypass attachment. So they show that each of these failures of convexity from one end to the other is described by a bypass attachment, which is a pair of contact angles. Of contact angles. So, moreover, each failure of convexity is described by A bypass attachment, which for our purposes it's a pair of smoothly canceling contact n and n plus 1 handles. So in this picture, that would be 2 and 3, two middle dimensions. And three, two middle dimensions. They smoothly cancel. It must be the case that they smoothly cancel because this middle layer smoothly is a trivial coordinate, but they may not necessarily cancel contact topologically. This is a thing that can happen when you do contact ecology. Get handles that don't cancel smoothly, or that cancel smoothly, but don't kind of But don't kind of trivialize at the level of the context structures. So smoothly canceling handles that don't necessarily cancel contact topology but if I put together everything I've just If I put together everything I've just said, we started with the manifold. We wrote the lower handlebody as a contact handlebody using some H-principle argument. Same thing up here. And then the middle layer, if you do some generic wiggling, you can fill it in with some sequence of bypass attachments, aka sequence of contact handles, and then you have a contact handle decomposition of your whole manifold. That's the idea. That's the idea. Now, I have a couple remarks about this. One of which is relevant for the stabilization part is that it is also possible to have a bypass attachment that does cancel contact topologically. If you interpret that at the open book level, that's a positive statement. Level, that's a positive stabilization. So a bypass attachment that is also truly trivial at the contact level is called a trivial bypass and reinterpreted at the level of open hooks. That's exactly what it costs for stabilization. One remark? Um oh well. Um oh well okay I can give you the very basic idea of that wasn't your deadline almost like it okay so a few key ideas uh come into play here and I can kind of quickly summarize the idea of the stabilization argument but one comment here is what you're doing given a contact name What you're doing, given a contact manifold, is you're as much as possible separating the contact topology from the smooth topology. Coe calls this a mushroom burger, where you have two buns, and then in the middle you have this patty, which is the mushroom patty. The buns contain all of the smooth topology and only that. They don't have anything interesting going on. anything interesting going on contact topologically. You've used an H principle to write them as like a completely standard neighborhood, whereas the paddy has no smooth topology, but all of the interesting contact topology. A mushroom because of I think it's a mushroom burger because when they first did this genericity argument for the contract. Genericity argument for the convex surfaces: the kind of wiggling you have to do is you have to install these wiggles that look like mushrooms. I think that's what. Okay, so I'll summarize everything I just said by just writing mushroom. I had one other remark, but I forgot, so I'll move on. So, oh, right, no, this is important. So, also. Also, thinking about what happened in this mushroom patty, here's what I would say. Existence of open book decomposition boils down to doing one parametric convex hypersurface theory. That's what this kind of a result is all about. This is like a one-parametric convex hypersurface theory. So existence. existence equals one parametric convex hypersque. I bring that up because part three, which I'll say as quickly as I can, is finally where I come into the picture. This is the stabilization part. The idea is the same thing as, well, let me only just read through. So what's the idea? You want to prove that if you have two supporting open book decompositions, that they're related by this sequence of stabilization system. At the level of this contact Morse business, what that means is I'm going to have one contact Morse function, f0. And another contact Morse function F1. And I'll just pick a homotopy between a smooth homotopy. I can't say anything about how contact this is. But very generally, the goal then is just to do a contact surf theory where I go from here to here. I think about everything that can happen more theoretically. There's a lot of stuff that can happen, but you just have to keep track of everything that can happen. Track of everything that can happen and interpret all of that stuff at the level of bypass attachments, open books, etc. Do all that successfully, you can then argue that this is a good point. Specifically, the most important part boils down to doing this mushroom idea parametrically. What you can do is normalize this homotopy. Normalize this homotopy in a way that you have a parametric mushroom burger where the buns are time independent. So when we proved existence, that kind of completely normalized the buttons so that they had a standard contact structure. You can do that parametrically. A lot of work goes into that, but you can do that so that the buttons stay fixed the whole time. So that the buns stay fixed the whole time. And in the middle, all you have is you have a one-parameter family of mushroom patties. So you can think about this as then being sigma cross an integral with, say, a family of contact structures. The mushroom patty over here is described by a sequence of bypass attachments. The mushroom patty over here is described by a patient by a patient Patty over here is described by a possibly different sequence of bypass attachments. And you need to interpret everything that can happen in the middle in terms of adding and deleting trivial bypasses. And so the idea is that the stabilization equivalence boils down to doing two parametric convex hypersurface theory. Convex hypersurface theory, like two-parametric surf theory on sigma at the contact level. So stabilization equivalence is two parametric systems. Okay, I know I'm out of time. I have one last final comment to maybe close out all the talks today. To maybe close out all the talks today. So if you've zoned out, you can zone back in quickly. Here's something to take away: if you haven't thought about contact structures in higher dimensions before, in particular, in terms of how it relates to four-dimensional complexity. To me, this is what all this stuff is about. So a contact manifold, if I think about it in this Morse theoretic description, it's like a thickened Weinstein handle body down here. Handle body down here, a thickened negative Weinstein thing up here, and they're glued together. So if you have a contact manifold and you wake up and you think, okay, I'm going to do some math today, if you do your math constrained to the lower handle body, so that you're doing stuff with your 0, 1, and 2 handles, you're just doing a thickened version of Weinstein theory. And at the level of the five-dimensional context, Of the five-dimensional contact manifold, that's not interesting. It's interesting because Weinstein theory is interesting, but at the level of the ambient contact topology, doing stuff down here is just thickened Weinstein theory. Same thing up here. If you just do stuff up here, you're not doing anything interesting at the level of the contact structure. Contact topology in dimension five is interesting in the relationship and interaction between the two four-dimensional theories. Four-dimensional theories. You have some right-side-up Weinstein thing, you have an upside-down Weinstein thing, and contact topology in dimension five is how they interact. So I'll basically repeat what I said at the beginning, that in terms of four-dimensional convexity, three-dimensional contact topology is obviously very interesting and important. But I think there's an equally interesting, kind of intricate, different relationship from above that comes from the interaction of these two. That comes from the interaction of these two. But okay, I'll stop there. Are there any questions? So, are you assuming there is a different organism? Oh, from here to here? Yeah, so I chopped this in the middle originally. So originally they were glued together along the same thing. And these retracts, I didn't lose any topology when I did that. So I retracted onto like the topological skeleton of both of these things. Skeleton of both of these things. So this boundary and this boundary, smoothly, it's still the same as the original that I cut along. Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. I mean, um. Okay, that's fine. Um Good question. You can certainly ask many of the same questions about the monotromy, but I guess I don't know if there's a direct generalization.
