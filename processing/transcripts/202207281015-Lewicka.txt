It's a great pleasure to see some of you, to discuss with some of you, to listen to all the wonderful talks. So I'm going to discuss a result, actually a couple of results that I obtained in collaboration with King Han, who is in the audience, and Mahadevan, who actually is not in the audience, but who suggested the problem and the project. So this is about isometric immersions. Geometric immersions with rectifiable geodesics, but really I'm going to talk about the structure of geodesics in kirigamized thin sheets. So, okay. Yeah, so we all know what origami is. Origami comes from, the word origami comes from the Japanese ori for folding and kami for paper. So it's just the art of describing rules for creating folded structures. Folded structures from patterns on a flat sheet. And I guess from our perspective, so as I said, Maha is the person who suggested the project. And so I will be quoting a lot, at least in the beginning of my talk, his papers. So they have this algorithm, anyways, without going into the details, of creating faults, of producing oligarchs. Faults of producing origami structures, which give you a sort of discrete surfaces in the approximation of smooth surfaces. So, say you want to have a ball or a kind of a vase or some hyperbolic type of a surface, and all you care for is approximated by something which may be discrete and which is the object that you obtain via orogamizing a thin sheet. So, the question is: can the energetic barrier that separates the originally flat and then the eventual folded? And then the eventual folded states be decreased by introducing cuts. And this is how we arrive at kirigami. Okay, so kirigami is like origami with cuts. The explanation, the word kirigami again comes from the Japanese. Kiri is cutting, kami is paper. And now not only we are allowed to fold, but we are also allowed to cut. Of course, these are the concepts that are very, very familiar to many of the researchers. To many of the researchers in the audience. So, again, just in this one of this is the set of pictures from one of the Maha experiments. So, suppose you want to approximate again in a discrete manner some surface, like a hyperbolic surface here, kind of a ball, I guess, a double ball, a cone. So, what they find out. What they find out, the way that they do it is: well, they take a flat sheet of paper and then they introduce cuts. And the cuts are introduced in a specific algorithm, which I'm not going to go into, which allows for the following thing to happen. So then when you apply tension to both sides of the sheet, that is, if you basically grab one side of this square or rectangle here and then the other side, okay, and then you. Other side, okay, and then you pull away from each other, then the cuts are going to open. I have a very modest example of a kirigamized sheet. Okay, this is a square, and you have just one cut here, just a single cut. And say I'm applying tension at the point P here, at the point Q here. You see? So it opens, opens, opens, opens, and then I get something three-dimensional, albeit very simple because it's just a simple cup. Because it's just a simple cut. One single cut, which is placed at the very center. So we are in the symmetric situation that P and Q are exactly on the two opposite sides symmetrically placed of the single cut. And then, so when they do it with something, of course, more complex, indeed, they obtain discrete kirigamized approximations of the surfaces that they want to approximate. That you want to approximate, and I guess when you place this object in a bath with some solution, then the holes are going to close and you get a nice approximation of an object that you want to produce. So now what they observed, and this is a starting point of our project, is that of course the pattern of cuts not only matters for the eventual shape that you The eventual shape that you obtain when you apply tension, but it also matters for the deployment trajectory of the sheet. And moreover, not just that, so what is the crucial component, crucial information here is not just the structure of the cuts, how they are placed, but the geodesics, which are the lines of shortest distance, which connect the points where the cuts are. Which connect the points where the tension is applied. And this is the end of the beginning. Why I guess Maha and you know people in his love are interested in this topic. And this is where we, yes, we came into the project. So the question is to study the structure of geodesics in a Kirigamized sheet. So in this simple experiment that I showed you, what is happening here, when you pull those two points away from each other, okay, how far can you? Other okay, how far can you pull? It's very obvious, it's very easy to observe that you can pull as far as the length of the geodesics. And in this example, you have precisely two geodesics. One goes like this through the top of the cut, and one goes through the bottom endpoint of the cut. Okay, so in this process, what you get at the very end, both geodesics are going to become straight lines. Okay, so this is very Okay, so this is very something very simple. The cut opens up, both geodesics become straight lines, and the distance, the furthest that you can put those points apart, is exactly the geodesic distance on the original flat sheet with the single cut. So the question that we want to address, and in fact, these are our two theorems, one just a simple observation, another one actually took a longer time to find. Time to find a detailed constructive proof says that precisely the same situation takes place no matter how many cuts you have. So you may have a crazy structure of cuts. I'm going to be very precise in the mathematically precise in a moment. So this is just one single cut. But imagine you can have millions of different cuts. They can be intersecting. They can be of different lengths. So here we are always taking straight cuts, straight sections. Taking straight cuts, straight segments. Okay, that's the only assumption. But otherwise, their placement, their position, their number, as I said, they can intersect the way that they want. Still, the observation, the experimental observation was one, geodesics are always piecewise linear. That's a natural observation. The second one is that on pulling the two points, this polygonal geodesics straighten out, while the sheet deforms in the third. While the sheet deforms in the third dimension and the geodesics become straight, they become rectified. Okay, and we get a configuration that, in particular, we can get a configuration. There is no uniqueness here, that is a piecewise affine isometry. Well, I guess if I just if I make, right, so this will be my piecewise, this will be the piecewise linear isometry. Okay, so this is just pieces, just the flats on both. Just the flat list on both sides. I have bought flat lists. So we are going to prove those statements precisely. And this is the content of our result and this talk. So can I just clarify, Marta? So your claim is that for any path through deformation space, the endpoint will be one of these geostatics rectified and straight paths states that you will see the precise, you will see a precise. see the precise you will see a precise theorem in a moment okay but that's that's that's what okay let me let me continue so to to formalize the picture so i introduce a few definitions um so i'm dealing with an convex set omega this is the sheet okay and inside omega there is given a graph g which consists of vertices and edges so this And edges. So the edges are exactly the cuts. So a typical edge is denoted by L, L I. I have finitely many cuts, cuts from 1 to n. And Li is a segment which joins two vertices A, J, and A K. I'm always thinking of closed segments. These are my cuts. The union of segments is denoted by capital L. This is the set of all cuts. So now without loss of generality, I can assume that the graph is... Of generality, I can assume that the graph is planar, which means that the intersection of two cuts of two edges is either empty or consists of a single vertex. Well, because if I had two intersecting, this is just for the sake of the bookkeeping, right? If I have intersecting edges, intersecting cuts, two intersecting cuts, I can always replace by, for example, by four cuts which are on. Four cuts which are only meet at one of their end points. Okay, so this is not a restriction, but just for the mathematical description, my graph G, which consists of cuts and the end points of cuts, there are the vertices of the graph, is a planar. So here you see three very simple examples. So the cuts are always in the stock. are always in the stock will be in on all the pictures are the purple dotted lines. Okay, so here I have one, two, three, four cuts. Here I have just two cuts. And here I have one, two, three and four. And I always have two points, P and Q. Okay. And here I've drawn, we will come to the definition of the geodesic in a moment, right? But you can already anticipate geodesic is the shortest path between P and Q, which avoids. Between P and Q, which avoids cuts. You can touch the cuts a little bit. It's the limit of smooth curves, right, which avoid cuts and join P and Q. So here I have one geodesic which goes like this. I have another geodesic which goes like this. Here I have one geodesic which goes like this. Another one from P to A2 to A3 and Q, then from a third one from P to A2 to A4 to Q, and here I have. To Q, and here I have four geodesics, which are these polygonal lines. Okay, so a question in the audience? Yes. So, can you choose P and Q arbitrarily? Yes, yes, of course. Of course. So, this is the point. So, I am given an omega and I am given cuts. This is the onset of my problem. I am given omega, I am given set of cuts, and I am given two points P and Q. In omega. P and Q in omega minus L. Yes. So here you see I have very simple pictures. The situation is sort of symmetric because it gives me a nice picture, but there is no restriction at all. So does the boundary have to be convex or something like that? The boundary of what? The set omega is convex. Yeah, you will have, you will see the mathematical, so for the mathematical results. Results omega, which is the omega, which is the sheet omega, that is the domain in which the cuts are distributed, is convex. Oh, yes, yes, okay, thanks. Well, okay, I could say many other things, but yeah, in the theorem, it is complex. Okay, so now the definition onto the geodesics. So, given two points P and Q, distinct points, which are Distinct points, which are in the same connected components of omega minus L, because of course we can imagine that the cats are so much, you know, distributed crazily that there are disconnected components. And taking P and Q, which are, I know that the path between them exists. So they are in the same connected component. Then the distance between P and Q is defined as the infimum of the length of piecewise C1 curves, which join P and Q and which avoid L. Okay. L. Okay. So further, any piecewise C1 curve which starts at P and Q is called a geodesic from P to Q in omega minus L, provided that, look at condition two here, it is the uniform limit of a sequence of piecewise C one curves as before, that is avoiding L complete. Avoiding L completely, okay, and such that its length equals to the distance defined before. Okay, so I cannot, so for the geodesic, a little bit of abuse of notation because my cuts are closed segments. So the geodesic may touch the cut. So the geodesic is not completely outside away from L, right? Like in this picture, you see, you see this cut. picture you see you see this cut ends at a one or like in my simple model here right so the geodesic the geodesic goes like this so it touches the cut at one of its endpoints but of course it is a uniform limit of curves which are not touching the end point yes and converging to this to this polygonal geodesic can i just clarify something so i understand so your geodesics are always assumed to be of shortest length Assumed to be of shortest length. Yes, this is exactly. So if I were to, in diagram two, if I were to move the point A1 up very far, then path- And there would be only one, exactly. Then if A1 was going very far, then it would be just P, A1Q would be the geodesic, and there would be no other, nothing else. Yeah. Okay. So, okay. So I have. Okay, so I have, so these are the three simple examples here. Look at this picture three, right? I have this L1, L2, L3, L4. So again, this is just a symmetric situation because I want to show you that you can have many geodesics. So you can go from P to A1 to Q, but then there is another one, P, against this point that's unlabeled, then A2. That's unlabeled, then A2, then this end point of the cut, and Q. Because, I mean, it's arranged in a way that the length of this polygonal exactly equals to the length of all three other three polygonals, and these are the shortest paths. So, very common, as you can imagine, very complicated pictures are possible. So, in this picture two here, in the first line, you have five geodesics. Okay, so you go. Okay, so you go from P, so the bottom one is the blue one, then you have you go by red, like this, following the blue, and then go up here, and then follow blue again. Then you have the green. Well, you have more. You can go by the green up to here and then follow the blue, of course. Then you have the golden one, and then you have the black one on the top. Yes? Top. Yes. And actually, you know, it's hard to, in this very general context, it's hard to tell anything about how these geodesics look like because, I mean, apart from the fact that they are polygonal, but this is the RM1. So, for example, you could think, oh, maybe the bottom and the top geodesic, maybe they are convex. So far, everything, you know, all pictures were of this sort. No, because look at picture number one. So here I have, okay, so the purple and the purple. Okay, so the purple and the purple lines are cuts, and this blue, dark blue, one, two, three, four, these are also cuts. So then if you take P and Q, which perfectly sit in the same connected component of some large square where those cuts are positioned, then you will have one geodesic which goes from P to the top of this purple line and then goes down. Purple line and then goes down, right? You can pass this way, and then it again goes up and to Q, so it's not convex. Also, the angle, right? You may think from all the pictures that I showed you that perhaps the angle between the lowest geodesic and the highest geodesic when you are at the point P or Q should be less than 180 degrees. This is not necessarily true. So here you have P and Q. Here the cuts are one, two, three, and four. Three and four for purple segments, and you go from P to Q. You can go either through the top or below, and you know there is more than 180 degrees here in this internal angle. And lots of other situations can happen. So, here are our theorems. The ORM1 is an easy theorem to have. The RM1 says that if in this in the context I'm In the context I'm discussing, there always exists at least one geodesic, and each geodesic is necessarily a finite polygonal with interior vertices at the end points of the cuts. Okay, so all interior vertices are distinct and they are in green. And moreover, a geodesic either, if you take a particular cut, then geodesic either does not Then Geodesic either does not see the cut at all, or it contains the entire cut, or it just intersects the cut at the end point. Okay, so that's like in the examples that I showed you. So this is theorem one. And theorem two says the following. So here now for simplicity, I'm taking P and Q at the boundary of my domain. Of my domain. There exists a continuous and piecewise affine isometry, continuous and piecewise affine map from omega minus L to R3, which is an isometry. So it means almost everywhere, you know, mathematically, gradient u transpose gradient u is identity. And it has the property that the image under the map u of Under the map u of every geodesic from p to q, p and q are fixed, so every geodesic can be a lot of them from p to q under this u, its image is a segment, is coincides with the segment between the image of p and the image of q. So that's exactly what we have seen here. Here I have one single cut, I have one jaw there's Single cut, I have one geodesic, I have second geodesic, I have P and Q, I extend. This is my map U. You see, this geodesic became a straight line, and the other geodesic also became a straight line. This is U of P, this is U of Q. The image of both geodesics is the segment between U of P and U of Q. So in particular, the distance equals to the geodesic distance. Equals to the geodesic distance between the distance that we define between P and Q and coincides with the length of each geodesic. We have another question from the audience. Yes. Martos, so there's no guarantee that there's a continuous family of isometries that takes you from the flat state to the configuration you're constructing, right? This is not our result. We didn't follow. Our result. We didn't focus on that. Okay, so this is about the last statement. There is, there is. I would tell you that there is. Yes, but that's not the result. The result just gives me the existence of one, you know, I'm not telling you how I got there, but there exists one isometry which rectifies simultaneously everything. If I could, I had the same question, but I wanted to follow up with a slightly deeper question. So if you give me Deeper question. So, if you give me two such mappings that you might construct, can you always are they? So, is the set of isometries path connected? Can you always find a way to go between two such mappings? I don't know. This already took a very long time to prove this. This is the first factor in the results. So, you know, I can speculate, I can tell you what I think, but the result that we have is that is the one that you see right now. Is that the one that you see right now? Okay. Well, what do you think? Yeah, yes, yes. Any you know, if, well, okay, I don't. Okay. So is the statement clear? Or we have other questions maybe about the statement. Statement. Okay. So, very quickly, but for completeness, let me go through the proof of theorem one, which says that every geodesic is a polygonal. So, the proof goes by the path shortening algorithm. So, here in this three, but there will be more pictures, you have one example of the cuts distribution of cuts. Cuts distribution of cuts. This is point P and this is point Q. Now you take a curve which joins P and Q and avoids all cuts. So the path shortening algorithm is going to produce a polygonal by shortening this path. And it will have certain properties, and then we will choose the geodesic will be the shortest one out of the polygonal paths with joint P and Q that are obtained by this algorithm. Are obtained by this algorithm. So you start with P, and then P is not in L, it avoids, it's not in this, not within cuts, right? So you start looking at connecting P by straight segments with points that sit on this curve. So your first segment is a degenerate segment, P P. Okay, and then you move the other end points of the segment. Endpoints of the segment away from P in the direction of Q on this curve. So since P, since omega minus L is an open set, then if you start, if you go from P to the second endpoint, then this segment is going to avoid L completely. So you are traveling with the second endpoint of the segment, right, away from P, away from P, and at some point, the segment, right, so Point the segment, right? So, like this segment, which is vertical, one here, is going to see L for the first time. So, you are going to hit the set L, or you will end up, you will go all the way up to Q, in which case you set sigma as your PQ, as just the segment PQ, and stop the process. But in the other scenario, more likely scenario, right, you have in general many different cuts. So, you go from, you declare point Q1. You declare point q1 the first and end point, the first point on the curve when the segment pq hits, sees the set of cuts, sees L. And then you define, you call p1 the closest vertex on L, which is the closest to q1, which is on this segment. And then you are going to keep pp1 as a part of your As a part of your polygonal path, and you are looking at the remaining piece of the segment, which is P1, Q1, and you concatenate it with the piece of the curve that starts from Q1 and ends at Q. Okay. And then you continue with the algorithm. So then you go back to the beginning, that is, you apply, you are looking now at P1Q. Okay, the curve, which is which is piecewise C1 curve, which starts from P1, goes as a straight segment to Q. Goes as a straight segment to Q1 and then ends up at Q. So again, you see this is what happens on picture 2, right? So you start with P1, Q1, you move this point Q1 along the curve. It's still the segment, the segment is not going to see in its interior L. At some point it will. In fact, here the picture is such that the entire cut P1, P2 is within the segment. But this is the first time that the aforementioned segment sees. The aforementioned segment c L. Okay, and then you declare the point, the second endpoint, q2, and p2 is the closest vertex, the closest point on L. Okay, L is a closed set, which sits on this segment. So this is your P2. And then you continue, right? So then you keep P1, P2, P, P1, P2. Then you look at the curve P2, Q2, all the way concatenation up to Q. And again, Attenation up to Q and again back to square one. So then you will get this segment, and finally you will get this segment. So from the original sum from PQ, here you obtain this polygonal P P1, P2, P3 and Q. So you define the sequence of those curves, eventually the polygonal curve inductively, and of course their length decreases. And of course, their length decreases at each inductive step. So the algorithm terminates in a finite number of steps because the length of each polygonal that you produce right here, here, just P P1, here, P P1, P2, here, P P1, P2, P3, and so on. So the length of each polygonal is bounded by the length of the original curve. And moreover, at each step, it increases, right? Step, it increases, right? Just the polygonal, not the piece of the curve that you are keeping for the algorithm. But the polygonal, each length at each step increases, but at least the minimum distance between the two points, two vertices in my graph, Ai and Aj. So this is a number, positive number. So I have at most finitely many steps. And then the geodesics. Um, then the geodesics can be chosen as the shortest one among those finitely many such polygonal paths as above, as I just defined. And I say finitely many because you only have to look at the polygonal paths that are non-intersecting. Because of course, if they were intersecting, then you know you can avoid the the other the loop and then you so you you you come back to each vertex at most one. Each vertex at most one time, so you have finitely many such paths, and the shortest one is exactly the geodesic, which has the properties, I mean, the geodesic according to our definition. So, that is the end of proof. So, now, really, the heart of my talk is to explain to you the algorithm. Because also we have a precise algorithm here which produces the isometry, okay, the isometry which rectifies all such geodesics that we produced in the previous theorem. So the proof goes by constructive algorithm, and there are five steps. So just to give you an idea, and then we go in detail. idea and then we go in detail in those steps. So step one may be a little bit counterintuitive. In fact we will be seeing portions of cuts. So you have you remember you have this convex set and you have lots of cuts. Who knows how they look like. Okay. And I'm going to see, I will be very precise about that. There is procedure in which I will be sealing parts of cuts which are Parts of cuts which are non-essential. And non-essential means that they do not affect the geodesic distance between P and Q. In this process, I will be producing many more geodesics. So at the end of the day, I will be rectifying not just the original geodesics, but I will be rectifying other geodesics, other lines which may be passing through some of the original cuts. Because in the process, right, but Because in the process, right, but my theorem will be, will hold, right? So in the process, I will decrease, I will shrink the set of cuts to a smaller set. In the second step, okay, so those inessential, after seeing inessential cuts, I will obtain the pattern of cuts, which I will be calling minimal. I will describe what this minimality means. It turns out that every minimal set of cuts, which is the set which cannot be shrunk. Is the set which cannot be shrunk further via the sealing procedure, okay, must come from a graph that is a forest. Okay, so it doesn't have loops. So forest is a collection of finitely many trees, okay, so connected components of a graph without loops. And then I will be ordering that I will produce many more geodesics in the picture. So then I will order all there is a way of ordering. We order all there is a way of ordering these geodesics. So, geodesics will come in consecutive order: the first, the second, the third, and the fourth. Now, between the first, between two consecutive geodesics, I will be seeing trees, which are the cuts, the remaining cuts, the connected components of the cuts of my graph, which will put certain cuts together. So, I will be seeing trees between two consecutive geodesics. And then I will explicitly construct the isometry. The isometry between the consecutive trees and within each tree. Okay? Between the two, between any two adjacent geodesics. So I will be putting the regions, right? So there will be the division of omega into finitely many regions. This will all become hopefully more clear with pictures on next slides. Okay, so I will have regions that are. Regions that are separated by the geodesics and by the remaining cuts. So, on this picture, just to anticipate, this would be this triangle would be the first region and this triangle would be the second region. And then there will be all the outside end of it. Okay, so this will be this one, this would be like the first geodesic, second geodesic, to only two geodesics I have here, and I have a single tree, which is. And I have a single tree, which is just a single cut, which is in between those two geodesics. And this gives me the first region and the second region. So, on each of these regions, which, of course, much more complicated than here, I will be by hand precisely defining the isometry. And then in the, so this is step four. And in step five, just simple, I will construct the isometry on the exterior region, that is the region that sees just one geodesic from the bottom and from the top. So let's see how this algorithm works. Step one: the cut sealing procedure. Sealing in essential portions of cuts which do not affect the distance. So I have my cuts ordered. Like in this first picture here, I have five cuts. L1 is horizontal, L2 is diagonal. Okay, L3 is also horizontal. L4 and L5. L4 and L5 are vertical. So, of course, I can put a different ordering, right? Different labeling. But I put some, I choose some ordering of them. So then I'm going to move the first endpoint of, so also the endpoints are ordered, right? I know what is the first endpoint of L1, what is the second endpoint of L1. So I'm going to move the first endpoint vertex of L1 towards the second vertex. One towards the second vertex, and while doing it, I'm checking whether the geodesic distance from P to Q shrunk or not. Okay, so since I will have now less and less cuts, the geodesic distance will be the same or it will be less. So you see, in this picture, I can start this, look at this left MOS vertex, and I can start seeing the cut L1, right, starting from this left endpoint. This left end point, and nothing happens. The jaw is the geodesic from P to Q still, you have to pass on the top, or you have to pass on the bottom. So, in fact, you can seal L1 completely till the end. You can remove L1 completely and adjust as the distance between P and Q and remains the same. That is what I'm doing. Okay, so then I look at L2. This is this diagonal. Again, so let's start from the bottom vertex. I can seal it. I can seal it and I can remove it completely. I can completely seal L2 and the distance from P to Q will remain the same. How about L3? So now L1, L12 are removed. L3 I can also completely seal. But now stop. Okay, so what remains is just L4 and L5. So you see, if I start sealing L4 from the top, of course the distance will decrease. The distance will decrease, right? I will be going from P, not like this, but just a little bit below and up to the top end point of L5 and then to Q. So I cannot, in fact, I cannot see any portion of L4 and I cannot see any portion of L5. So this configuration, which I see here, I call it the final minimal configuration. Of course, the minimal configuration that you obtain, right? So you've done it, so you understand the procedure. You seal the endpoints in a given Seal the endpoints in a given order. You start sealing the endpoints of each cut, and you stop sealing the first time when the geodesic distance wants to drop. It wants to become strictly less than the original distance. So from this configuration of cuts, in fact, of course, depending on the order of the cuts, you can obtain many different minimal. Can obtain many different minimal configurations. So, you see, let's look at the second picture. Right here, L1 is vertical, L2 is the diagonal, L3 is vertical, and L4, L5 are horizontal. So, L1, let's start sealing. No problem. I can actually seal completely, seal it completely, L1. L2, I can also seal it completely. So, now what remains is the horizontal. Is the horizontal, right vertical, and the bottom horizontal. And then I cannot do anything. So if I start sealing L4 from the left, the distance drops, right? This becomes less, more, this P going to the top and going to the right is going to become a little bit more straight with a larger angle, right? If I move L4 its left and point to the right. Likewise, if the right, if I start seeing from If the right, if I start sealing from the right endpoint of L4, then I'm creating an opening here. So this whole, these two segments in my geodesic can become a straight line. And then I go back to Q. So of course, this drops the distance. For the same reason, I cannot do anything to L3. If I start sealing from the top, again, I'm creating an opening, I can pass. So this is the minimal configuration. Notice that in both examples, I still in original configuration. Still in original configuration, and the two minimal configurations that I produced, I have two geodesics, the same geodesics that I have. But what I mentioned before, in the cut-seeding process, it is possible that many more geodesics in general are created. So let's look at this example. Here, here, the ordering is L one is the horizontal, L two is the right vertical, L three is the left vertical. L3 is the left vertical, L4 is the diagonal, and L5 is the bottom vertical. Okay, L1, as before, I am completely annihilating it. I'm sealing it completely. This is L1. L2, I can also seal completely. So now I remain with a triple, right? With this vertical, diagonal, and L5 horizontal. They all have a common vertex. So you see. So you see, L3 from the top, I cannot see as before, because then I would be having a shorter path between P and between this second endpoint here, vertex here. But I can start seeding L3 from the bottom. Okay? I can start seeding. This is no problem still because then I'm creating a passage somewhere here. But if I go from P to here. Go from P to here, and then where do I go? Right? Either I have to go around to Q or somehow I have to, you know, I have to go back to, I have to go to this top endpoint of L2. And this will be, so going from P to this point here and along the diagonal, of course, is longer than going from P to the top of L three and to the right end point here on the horizontal cut. the horizontal on the horizontal cut so i can very easily i can i am allowed to start sealing l3 but i cannot seal it till the end because exactly if i seal too high then i will be able to pass from p to this point here and this path is shorter than going by two diagonal by two segments as on the picture so in fact you can seal l3 up to some point L3 up to some point. And in this process, which point? The point such that the distance, such that the length of the diagonal from P to this point where I stopped my sealing, and then all the way up here, and then back to Q, is the same as equals the geodesic distance between P and Q. So you see that in this order, configuration order, I have produced a new third geodesic in the middle. The first two. Geodesic in the middle. The first two ones are still kept, the original ones, and I produce another geodesic. And there is still yet another picture where again I produce another intermediate geodesic. So this is the cut sealing procedure. I just asked you a question about this. So I could imagine that there were other ways to seal cuts, and in general, you could find like a minimal left cuts. Anyways, Cuts. Anyways, my question is: what? So, why did can you just explain what? Why did you choose to seal the cuts in this order instead of a different order? Just in order to write down any order, right? So, that's exactly what you're saying. You choose an order, you label your points, you choose an order, and you start seeing cuts. Okay, so my point here is that, of course, the final, the minimal configuration naturally depends on the order of cuts. On the order of calculus, okay. You choose any order, yeah. So now the following observations are um should be made. So you arrive to some minimal configuration, but then if you repeat the same process to that this minimal configuration, it will not be altered. So, you know, so you could think that, oh, maybe I went through this process, I created a minimal configuration, but then I go back. Minimal configuration, but then I go back to L1, whatever remain, and maybe still I can conceal something. No, it's just a lemma, you cannot do this. Okay, so this is minimal in the sense that it is stable. You cannot alter it further by applying the same process. And so, what I've already said, since the new L is the subset of the original L, finding the isometry relative to the new L. Relative to the new L will yield an isometry for the old L as well. So this will just mean that I am not somehow using, I'm not using all the openings. I don't have to do it. I still create an isometry where some of the cuts will, or some portions of the cuts will behave as if they were sealed. Okay, so a new U created as in my theorem with the properties for a smaller. properties for a smaller L also satisfies the claimed statement of the theorem for a larger L. It is now not hard to notice that for the minimal configuration has two properties. First one is that the minimal configuration, the cuts have no loops. So this graph, right, you remember So, this graph, right, you remember underlying graph for L is a collection of trees. And this is really simple to observe because, well, if you had cut in a minimal configuration, if you had cuts which create a loop, then, well, by minimality, what is the minimality? It means that I cannot, that if I opened the loop, right, anywhere, if I started seeding from any vertex, then I would have a shorter path. Then I would have a shorter path, shorter path to go from P to Q. But this means if you are opening just a little bit, that they would have to enter the interior of this loop and then exit it through the same, because you open just it a little bit. But this means that you could still shorten this path, not going inside the loop. And that would be the path that is admissible for the original L, but it cannot be shorter. But it cannot be shorter than the geodesic distance because by the definition of geodesic distance. Moreover, you can show that every vertex in a minimal configuration, every vertex that is a leaf, yes, so you will have a tree, right? You will have cuts which are meeting at some point, but every vertex that is a leaf, that does not meet another cut, must be. Cut must be a vertex of some geodesic from P to Q. Okay, so this is like here I have an example of just without, so where every tree is just a single cut. And you see, this is a me, since this is a minimal configuration, then through every endpoint of those two cuts, there passes some geodesic. That is the general property of every minimal configuration. In general, it doesn't have to be true. generally it doesn't have to be true you see in my example here if i had another if i had another cut like this right so it doesn't doesn't matter it's still the geodesic still this is the geodesic and this is another geodesic well but this cut is inessential so in my cut sealing procedure this cut would be completely annihilated so for the minimal configuration every vertex is a leaf of some geodesic so now we So, now in the second step of our procedure, we are going to label geodesics and order them. So, it is possible to find the so the geodesic we find the partial order relation. So, geodesic is less than sigma r less than sigma r plus one. This means that the concatenated polygonal from p to q via sigma r. via sigma r and then back to p via sigma r plus one encloses a region that is oriented counterclockwise okay so then there exists a smallest geodesic and then you can order them not all of them you can choose an ordering okay of geodesics with the following property that if you have sigma which is between sigma r and sigma r plus one sigma r and sigma r plus one okay then it must be there is nothing in between then it must be either sigma r or sigma r plus one so you see i'm not saying that all geodesics are in this partial order you can take the blue line and then you can take the so if you take the red from p to this point and then like this and then to q you see the red geodesic and then if you take if you go by And then, if you take if you go by green from p to this point and then continue with blue, they cannot be compared, right? Because they intersect each other. It's like a crisscross. But still, you can go with sigma one, which is blue. Then you go up just to cover all trees. So, first, you do the blue one, then you take, for example, the red one, which goes up to here, and then you go up here and here. Then, you go with green, sigma. Then you go with green sigma three like this, and then you continue the red. Then you jump up, go with golden from P to Q like this. And then you finally jump over this last three, in this example, just a single cut, from P to Q. So here you have a sequence of five geodesics satisfying the spatial order relation. Okay, and there is no extra geodesic. There is no extra geodesic in between any of them. Okay, so that is it's possible to do this to do this labeling. Now, we are going to see what happens in between two consecutive geodesics whose order I described on the previous slide. Okay, so here is some sigma r and here is sigma r plus one. So I'm going to talk about this region dr. Talk about this region, DR, I call it. DR is the region between sigma r and the next one, sigma r plus one. This region. Sorry to interrupt. I'm being rude. Just to remind you that we are supposed to be wrapping up at 12. So if I could ask you to just speed up maybe a little bit. I completely forgot. I'm sorry. So because. Oh, it's 12 already. Okay. Okay. Okay, sorry. So yeah, so you have those you have those different areas in between the trees and within the trees. So on each of these areas, I'm going to construct, we are able to construct the isometry. Now it is easy to construct the isometry in between the trees. the trees but the main point and the main difficulty is what to do um what to how to how to construct the isometry between not within a tree but between the consecutive trees so obviously i don't have time for that sorry i completely lost time um so there is an argument which i prepared um to show in a simplified To show in a simplified situation where all cuts are separated, where they are not touching each other. So I have one cut and I have another cat, and there is a way of showing you how between two consecutive geodesics and between those two cuts, how the isometry is constructed. Then it is very technical actually to construct new in the general case, which I was not going to discuss. Going to discuss. And okay, that's the end of my talk. Thank you. Can I suggest the following? Just because we are again behind the schedule, can I suggest for people who have some questions to just stay here and ask questions and discuss things with Marta? And then people who have maybe want to go and have lunch already if you're hungry. And have lunch already if you're hungry. Um, it's okay for you to leave. So, basically, imitate what we've done last time with the last session. Is that okay with everyone? Yeah, okay. So, in addition to that, recommends that during the informal meeting time, yeah, one breakout room and one reading room. I think that time will be too late for Marta. She's in Poland now, as I understand. Ah, okay. So, yeah. Oh, okay. So, yeah, so in that case, maybe stick around now. We can take one or two questions now. Okay. Okay. Fine. So, one or two questions. Yeah, go on. So, Marta, it feels like, I mean, sort of intuitively, a geodesic that doesn't minimize length, that only locally minimizes length, you might expect to have a similar picture. Do you have any? Expect to have a similar picture. Do you have an opinion? But what do you mean, Jodesik, which does not mean you? So you mean not for you meaning? So if you change the shape of your domain, you could turn a length minimizing geodesic into one that's not. That was already noticed early in the talk. Yeah. Or you change the cuts or something. But you're not changing the local picture near the geodesic. Geodesic. So the condition that a geodesic locally minimized length is weaker. It's simply that you cannot make changes. You know, it's like, look, on a sphere, the great circle is a geodesic, a piece of a great circle that goes more than halfway around, only locally minimizes length. Only locally minimizes length, yeah. But here, right, so in this picture, think of this straight segment. Yes. This definitely minimizes length between its two endpoints. No, the geodesic has to go from P to Q. Okay, so. But it doesn't have, but its length might not be the distance from P to Q. Okay, so then it's not a geodesic. So what is your definition of geodesic? Your definition of geometry, a geodesic is not the path of shortest distance. I wonder if I can try to clarify the question. So, the theorem says that for the geodesics, as Marta defined them, under the isometry, as I understand, they become straight lines in space. That's correct, right? So, Bob, I think maybe if I can paraphrase Bob's question, can you give some understanding of for your isometry what the image of one of the What the image of one of these geodesics, which is only locally length minimizing but not globally length minimizing, would be which is only locally length minimizing, what is happening then? Okay, so even you see, even in this, even in this example here, you want to extend the right, so I just made it. Right, so I just made a tear. You can extend this cut further. And then, I mean, there is no way it becomes a straight line, no? The shortest one becomes a straight line, and you have to do something with it. With the longer one, it has to wind around in some way. It's too long. So, I'm not sure what right, there's just one. So, here you have. Right? It's just one. So here you have just one geodesic. This is the bottom one. Here I extend it, I tear. So there is this is this is longer. So then you are thinking of this polygonal. You call it the local geodesic. Okay. So then when the cut opens, just this, the real geodesic, which is the shortest part, this becomes the straight line. In fact, the other one cannot become. The other one cannot become the same straight line because it's too long, okay? So it does what it wants, or you can, I don't know, if you want something specific, some proof, some property of what happens with this local geodesic in some isometric immersion. I mean, if you ask specific questions, then no? So, Marta, can I ask a question? Hopefully, it's a quick question, but Hopefully, it's a quick question, but the sealing procedure is closing a bunch of cuts. But of course, in the real system, it will tend to use as many of those cuts to its advantage as possible. So it suggests, I mean, so of course, I think you have a systematic way of constructing these things. But I would suspect that the thing that you would actually get at the end is the one that manages to use as. Is the one that manages to use as many cuts as possible, not the one? I am not sure. I, my conjecture, what I would say, what I see here is that the cuts that we are seeing are inessential. So in the final picture, there will be floppiness. You see, this is as, this is, imagine that you have a cup here, right? And then it's like this. It's still, this is still open, but it's not going to open. There is no way, there is no reason for it to open. So it can be. So it can be, it can do whatever you want. It will not, it will only use the essential portions of the cup. Can you understand? You start like this, and then you open. You are applying the tension, right? And the tension is really, it extends. I guess I'm suggesting that for you to try to prove another theorem then. Because I think, so physically, if you have cucks, it's intuitive to think that you should use them or the. That you should use them, or the problem would try to use them. Trying to prove that you don't have to use all the cuts, you know. In fact, that the minimizing, the actual minimizing configuration should be one of these sealed constructions. Exactly. It's kind of an interesting problem. And I don't think it's completely intuitive. So I don't know. Maybe you should try it. Thank you. Thank you. So that was two questions. I have a third, but we should let them go for lunch. We need to be back by 1.30. Please remember that. Yeah, so I guess everyone is released now, right? Is that right, Irmgard? So can I ask a quick question? Sure. So do you have any feeling about if So do you have any feeling about if this theorem would be still would still hold if, I mean, we cut the Kirigami on like a spherical surface or curved surface, something like that. When you pull a PNQ, it's still, the GD sequence are still on. Yeah, but then what do you want? So what do you you have a state? So my question is, does this theorem still hold one? This theorem still holds when the surface is curved instead of. Yeah, but then what do you would want an isometric? You want an you have to define what is the isometric immersion into what space? So let's go into R3. Yeah, some simple case. So you start on a sphere, you have cuts on the sphere, and then you want to find an isometry into. Yeah, and then the question is: what's the analog of the statement that the image curve is now no longer a straight line, but still so what so fun, what that's the crucial point, right? What's the third criterion having to do with the image curve that you want to achieve? So, what do you want? Do you still want that? Do you still want that those cuts are that the geodesic becomes straight? No, certainly not. No, certainly not, certainly not, but maybe something like uh you can why not? Why not? Well, because if you're on a sphere, you can't uh well, the cut the cuts would have to be very peculiar, right? Yeah, peculiar. Correct, peculiar. Okay, well, Fan should finish the question, though, because it was his question. You can think of an experiment, right? Exactly. You will take a spherical. A spherical dome, you have some cuts, and then you still pull. Maybe, yeah. So you end up with a straight line. Yeah, I don't know. No, I don't think so. If you have an open region of the sphere and you do an isometry on it, then I don't see why you could have the boundary turn into a straight line. Wouldn't that seem to violate? Wouldn't that seem to violate something having to do with Gauss curvature? I don't know. That's not what we worked on, but naturally, that's... Just curious. So, Marta, I had a different question, which is, so this sealing process I find very interesting. And you mentioned that actually your construction gives a homotopy rather than a single isometry. I don't know. Rather than a single isometry. I don't know if that was, that was Paul's question, but I don't know if during the live talk it was clear. So, first of all, is that true? Are you constructing a homotopy of isometries or are you simply constructing a single isometry? No, we are in the theorem, we are constructing a single isometry. But the way the construction process, I mean, this is how it's formulated in the paper, okay? But in the construction process, I mean, this is exactly because we say on each of the we say on each of this on each of these regions that I completely didn't have time to explain in detail okay I am just this is completely constructive proof so I understand the region originally the region is straight is a flat sheet and then eventually it is there is some folding origami like pattern very simple very explicit of that particular region and it is parameterized by And it is parametrized by degree of freedom. Exactly. I can make it. So then, based on that, fine. So then, based on that, my question is as follows. So, if I were to take one of these cut sheets in a laboratory and I were to pull a little bit on it, would I actually observe that the cuts that you're choosing to seal remain sealed in the laboratory? I think that's an interesting conjecture, right, for a mechanician. Conjecture, right, for a mechanician. I think the answer would be no, because it's not like you're using folds, I guess. So it's not like you would expect the actual sheet. You see, this is a big non-uniqueness here. Even in the sealing procedure, there is a non-uniqueness. Right, right. Even the seal, right. So if you were to actually. So think of this. Think of this pattern here, right? You have five cuts. There is certainly too many. You don't need this many of them, right? Many, you don't need this many of them, right? Well, for those two geodesics, and then you start pulling apart, and then what happens? So, some of them will open. So, I guess you may also be thinking of adding an energy then into this to, I don't know if you're going in that direction, trying to add an energy into the, like an elastic energy into the mix and do a minimization. No, I am not. But you are, of course, that's a natural thing. Yeah, Ian probably goes know that there's oh, Bob's here still. That there's here still some experimental papers that Mahadevan and his group did that preceded this work. And these are with sheets, right? So it's not modeling. And, you know, so for sure, when you do the sheets, there's bending energy. You're, I mean, the configurations you're getting, you know, these straight lines are maybe. Know these straight lines are maybe a little bit like folds, and the place where they meet, the cuts, they're singular. They're not decones, but they're singular in the same way. And so I guess they must have made observations that are related to your question, but I don't know whether they were explicit in the paper. Probably. I mean, it's, you know, this discussion of You know, this discussion of geodesics and whatnot, remind, for whatever reason, reminds me a bit about this construction that I do with wrinkle patterns, where we end up drawing diagrams that I think are corresponding to lines of force. Anyways, my question is: there must be some mechanical insight that one can gain from the set of shortest path geodesics, which have to do. Which have to do something maybe with the way in which forces are transmitted in the sheet as it's loaded. Right. But finally, the forces, when you pull hard enough, the forces are transmitted from P to Q along this geodesic. And when you pull hard enough, somehow the leading order behavior is that it has to fit into a strict. Is that it has to fit into a straight line. And because all the work you have to do to bend the sheet of paper in three dimensions or the membrane, that's all lower order terms. Right. But what's not clear, and I think interesting to ask, is whether or not the large deformation picture you just described connects to a bifurcation picture, which is what I was asking about. Yeah, and I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Marta, are you still there? Yeah, sure. I'm here. Maybe you know? No, I don't. Okay, very nice talk. Thank you. Obviously, there's more to do. So maybe I can. I think the question I originally asked, maybe it didn't come out clearly. Okay, in the case where there's more than one geodesic, you could do your construction for any of them, correct? By geodesic, you mean my definition, definition you have to sort of all of them are simultaneously rectified, not just one, all of them. Okay. And each one will have a very And each one will have a very different picture involving what that, you know, what that deformation of the entire sheet mapped as a map from the reference sheet. I'm not sure if I understand, Bob. No, you have 50 different geodesics, and you have just one isometry which rectifies all of them simultaneously. I see. I see. And is that the claim? Like, this is the theorem. They're always going to be rectified simultaneously. Yes, that is the theorem. Like here, here you have two geodesics. Yes? That is the U. You see? Straight light here. Straight line here. Bob, sorry. You asked to slightly. So I don't think Marta is claiming that all isometries which have the property that they achieve. Which have the property that they achieve this distance are simultaneously rectified on the geodesics. I think she constructed a single one. No, this is also a true. This is also true. Think about it. If you have an isometry such that the distance between this is the okay, that's true. Yes, it's clear because you're in three-dimensional space. That if U of P and U of Q are away by exactly the distance, then all geodesics have to be. Then all geodesics have to be mapped to a straight line because where else do they go? They have to go. Because it's in flat space. Yes. Okay. All right. So now I have the picture. I understand your answer. Okay. So that is a natural thing to imagine, but here it took some time to actually prove, and we have constructive proof of one such isometry, not written in the paper, but as I said, you can have a path, you know, path which exactly corresponds to this pulling apart. Okay. Yeah. Thank you for explaining. Thank you for explaining. Thank you. Okay, very good. I have to go grab lunch. It's a little, I skipped lunch until now, so I must go. But nice to see you again, Marta. Thank you. Bye, everybody. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye.
