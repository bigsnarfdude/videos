The following talk by Pablo Quesada from Universidad de la Fronter in Temuco entitled IHS Manifolds with OK TrueType with an actual description. Thank you, Pablo. Thank you. And thank you for inviting me to this beautiful place. It's the first time I see someone, so I'm very happy to have you. Okay, this is a work which we started after I visited. Which we started after I visited a body last year. It was given by us, by Alexander, and we've been working on it the last few months. So, today I'm going to give some context in the question. So, let X be a H S microphone be an atom fission group and we have a microphone. An atom fission group, and we can see at the exact each and the S everyone. So if you know is there a symptom system which acts acts simple. And we're gonna put M there. And more M is more to be controlled by this code. So there's a bit a lot of work done in this part, in KT Surface, in the syntax part and the spectrum part. There are a lot of people here who have done a lot of work here, important work. But I want to focus on some of which motivates this work in KPTSPR. It's not in KTS. It's not easy. So the fifth one is what I need to work. If you prove that the zero is less or equal than 960 and if it is equal, then this zero is isomorphic to the material N20. Fundle prove that E is less or equal than 3A or 0 and if we have equality then we have that G is in this exact sequence. And there is a unique gateway surface with this action gate surface With this attachment which is the commercial face of the nicer I don't forget. I don't know if I can step. Sorry if I misplan this. Classify the symptoms. And in particular, it's the biggest in particular is the biggest brain.     In particular, that's the big one, biggest one. And that's why we care about that. Why do we care about that? Like in this case, they care about entity, which was the biggest one. In this case, the group is much bigger. There is a lot of tomorrow species. But that's the column. What does the column is semi-direct product but they use the point two points sometimes in local data? They use two points, two points instead, instead of this in the rate of the ratio. And so what we want to do. What we want to do is a story k3 square target with an group such that we can put this group here and we also want that m is bigger than one. We want some non-specific. We find some non-suspect of the short you find something face with this. Let X be small to be for full for full we just saw that fx is HSS Honeyford of H. HS anifold of H quartite. And we also have the Abdunfisson group of X injects itself on the Abduna Fission group of the funny varietal length. So if we can find an with this action, we can induce a reaction on a Git where type function. And it's not that hard because You can consider the mark in the corner. And then, obviously, this is wrong. This is fine. This is true. Obviously, we have here this action in the coordinates and going into so F extraction of and we can check that syntactically that's only by checking with Python so we want to talk We want to study this. How do we want? Do it by that theorem. So in that case, M is 3? In that case, M is 3 or 6? So, how we use that theory because we know that in k squared, the automorphisms of x are so in his paper, and because Honen Mason, in his paper, a part of giving the list of symplectic group which acts on the square, they also gave the They also gave the the invariant and coin variable. So, for work group we have that in variables, which I'm gonna denote by this. Like this is this very nice matrix, and the point battery lattice is very big, but it has rank 20 and is negative definitely definitely. So, with the game variant and convariant lattice, we can start working using non-results of action on k square type manifold. So, results we need very classical. I don't know, like this and this bigger one and Then egg is predicted and now that the card is gonna have those bits signature. We know that the point battery lattice is mid-size the denominator. So, since it has track 20, the denominator is going to be very big. And otherwise, the transcendental lattice is inside here. And we know that A level of N is A level of N is less than. M is less than 23 minus 4 squared. So in this case, we're gonna have that the card number is 21 because it's 20 loose 1. So in this case, M is gonna be 2, 3, 4, and 6. So in all exact sequence, there's no multiplier. In subsequence, there's no much but many values for it. Since it's projected and the group is finite, we can just see that. We can consider an invariant Africas and then L is gonna be in the invariant lattice and particularly then we have the L square is gonna be 6L with end with the end anomaly because we can see the metric circle not that Not that it's only good. Also, the central lattice can be computed as the orthogonal inside the invariant lattice. And it's gonna have the it's gonna be like this. It has like two. So, the idea to study this is the first idea is to study the possible values of the L, the possible polarization of fact, together with the possible horizontal lights. with L square equal to 6N but that's very big so we have to find n the positive n. Both fields and separate two m is always M is always different than 4 because E0, which is this acts on the imminent lattice of X0. But the isometrics of this lattice doesn't have an overflow reason. And also six is we're gonna only study two and three because six is the compact three is six. So we don't need to study the it's gonna show up when we study the other two. Is this something you do with the computer? Or the computer tells you this? Computer computer tabs you know this pipe yeah it's not that big it's like 24 it's very small so you can bypass check number of every element So we only study m equal to 2 and m equal to 3 and we want to bound the possible values of n. So we want to 6? It's because if we have an action of 4 2 and a half an hour, if we have an action, If we have an actual order six, yeah, it's gonna actual when we use it. So we want the balance the balance of L square that you just need. And for that, we use that zero and we check that particular. We don't have too many values. For m equal to two, we find that l square is equal to six, eighteen, and twenty-four. 24 and for m is equal to 3, we have to m square is only equal to 6. So there's not many possible values for the reception. And then for every one of these, we take a basis of the embarrasses and check which possible L we have in the basis, and then we compute the junction. In the basis, and then we copy the panelists. So for everyone, and we see if the accentality can happen, because I don't know, if we're assuming that it has another three atoms reason, which acts on the transcendental the accidentality, the transcendental lattice has to be of a certain To be all faster, it cannot be any matches. And with that, we found the following existence. Like the reference. And some of these results of these things, there are also parts shown by Thomas Wawat. So there's an overlap there. But the methods are so we have that. We have a false signal. Thank you very much. And we have this is two times because we have a non isometric isometric and L square equal to a t and And it takes people to say six eight two times. This presentation, we have two options which are not isometric by the isometrics of the embarrassment. And for M equal to three. And if I have three cases is this also and this doesn't say much except these two cases because we know that if we take uh gated quite a bit. Uh Square with a presentation which is six polarized and which has the visibility equal to two. We know that and the alpha we know that is a fun value of flexible waiver. And I give a sample And I give a simple effect for the list algorithm in IGF Manifold of a textbook type with the such part is this follow. So I and it's the final validity of like of the final quality of the format of each of each of We can chat to Nomarikin that it has the biggest optimization group. Or this type minus or context for type but type minus and is big is equal to one step of four nine sixty, which is so much bigger than in surface case and like. I'm going to limit it because I don't have my time. Thank you.
