I hope people on Zoom are able to hear me. I'd like to thank Carl, Luis, and Lynchuan for the opportunity to speak today. And it is wonderful to be back in person. So Kevin in his talk focused on somehow the global aspects of this notion called splinters. And in my talk, I'll talk more about the local theory of splinters and concentrate on some local open problems. Some local open problems about this notion. So I'm going to fix a ring R, not necessarily noetherian, and I'm going to give you a definition of a splinter in a non-nutherian setting. And we'll see why in this talk I'm doing so. So R is a splinter if for any finite surjective Map. Now, because R is not Netherian, it's unreasonable to expect that this map, the induced map on rings from R to S splits. So the more appropriate condition is that the induced map of rings from R to S is pure as a map of R modules. Of R modules. And pure is again this notion known as universally injective, which just means that if you tensor the map from R to S with any R module, the map stays injective. So just to remark, if R is Neutherian, then and you have a finite map from R to S, then the co-kernel is obviously a finitely presented module because over a Neutherian ring, finitely presented and finitely generated are the same thing. And when the co-kernel of a ring map is finitely presented, kernel of a ring map is finitely presented then purity and splitting are the same so my definition specializes to kevin's definition in the noetherian setting all right so let's discuss some properties of splinters so the first property is actually a very famous theorem i guess this is the second time this theorem is appearing in this lecture series so regular rings are splinters and this is the famous direct samantha And this is the famous Dirac-Saman theorem. So, what this theorem tells us is that the notion of a splinter is a characteristic independent notion of singularity. Splinters are reduced and they are normal if they're a domain. Let's just say they're normal if they're a domain. So, they're integrally closed in their fraction field. Splinters are also stable or preserved under localization arbitrary products. So, the problem is then if you have a ring which does not have finitely many minimal primes, then I don't necessarily want to get into the Necessarily want to get into the in the Neutherian case, it's it's always normal, so it's a product of domains, yes. So, arbitrary products of splinters are splinters, infinite products as well, and filtered co-limits of splinters are also splinters. So, even if you like working with noetherian rings, these last two operations, the arbitrary products and filtered co-limits, will take you outside the noetherian world. Co-limits will take you outside the Netherian wall. Then the next property is that the property of being a splinter can be detected locally. So it's a local property. A ring is a splinter if and only if the localization at all prime ideals, equivalently, all maximal ideals are splinters. And the splinter property satisfies pure descent. So, what I mean by this is. So, what I mean by this is: if you have a pure map from R to S, and S is a splinter, and R must also be a splinter. So, the splinter property descends. And a domain R is a splinter if and only if the map from R to its absolute integral closure, which is an integral. Its absolute integral closure, which is an integral closure of R in an algebraic closure of a fraction field. It's not canonical, but because algebraic closures are not canonical, but it is unique up to non-unique isomorphisms. So if this map is pure, and why is this true again? The map from R to R plus can be written as a filtered collimit of finite maps. And in each of those, when you have a map finite map, injective map from R to S, that is pure, and a filtered collimit of pure maps is always pure. Filtered co-limit of pure maps is always pure. So, this is still pure. This is okay, same as in the Noetherian world. And now, I'm going to discuss some more non-trivial properties. So, suppose your splinter or yes, suppose you have an excellent splinter. So, if you don't know what an excellent ring is, if you're thinking of an example of a noetherian commutative ring in your mind right now, that is probably excellent. Okay, so an excellent splinter not containing the rational numbers, they are. They are Cohn-Macaulay. This is due to Hawkster and Hunici in characteristic P. It follows from the fact that R plus is a big Cohen-Macaulay algebra in characteristic P. And in mixed characteristic, this is true by recent work of Bargoff, where he shows that the periodic completion of R plus is a Bitcoin-Macaulay algebra. And the fact is that because R is a splinter, the map from R to the periodic completion of R plus. To the periodic completion of R plus, as well as the map from R to R plus, they're both pure. And regular sequences descend also under pure maps. So, this is Cole Macaulay. And the other fact is, and this is Karen's thesis, splinters are F rational, whatever that means. So, this means that the parameter ideals are, for parameter ideals, tight closure agrees with plus closure. So, F rational in characteristic P. This is due to Karen Smith. Karen Spith. Because any normal thing is a splinter. So that's why, yeah, so yes, that's a great question. So the question was: if you are in equal characteristic zero and you're a splinter, do you fail to be coin-Macaulay? And that can happen because in equal characteristic zero, any normal Newtherian ring is a splinter. Okay, so let's do some examples. Some examples. So, I think the easiest way to construct non-regular examples of splinters are as direct summands or even pure subrings of regular rigs. This, for instance, is going to tell you that coordinate rings of affine toric varieties are splinters, and what else? Group actions when the order of the group does not divide the characteristic. Does not divide the characteristic of the underlying field because of the Reynolds operator, that's going to be a splinter. Veronese subrings are going to be splinters, and so on and so forth. And the next one is due to Hoxter and Hoonici. They show that, and this is again, if you know what this notion means, the weak F-regularity, weakly F-regular rings are splinters. And this third example is due to more recent work of Marin Schwed. So, if you're a BCM regular ring, then pretty much by definition, I think. I wouldn't attribute this to HES. And by definition, you're a splinter. I promised you that there are interesting classes of non-Netherian rings that are splinters. So, I showed that any valuation ring. That any valuation ring, infinite crawl dimension, finite crawl dimension, doesn't matter. These are always printers, and these are usually highly non-Etherean. And more recently, Shu Ji Liu, who's a graduate student at Princeton, showed that ultra products of local splinters are always splinters. If you don't know what an ultra product is, If you don't know what an ultra product is, the way I always think about an ultra product in this talk is: an ultra product of a bunch of local rings is going to be the localization at a prime ideal of a suitable infinite product. That's what an ultra product is for me in this talk. I'm not going to define them in terms of ultra filters and so on. And that's the most useful perspective to have in this talk for ultra products. And these ultra products are also non-Ethereum. Okay, so the central question of today's talk. So, the central question of today's talk is the following. So, if R to S, let R to S be a regular map of Neutherian rings. So, the question I want to ask, and I'll tell you what a regular map is in a second. So, the question is, if R is a splinter, if the base ring is a splinter, is the overring a splinter as well? That's the central question of today's talk. So, let's recall. So let's recall what we mean by a regular ring. So recall that a map from R to S is regular if it is flat and if all the fibers are in Ethereum and geometrically regular. It just means that if you extend the field, the base field of the fiber by any finite extension and tensor the fiber, it stays regular. The fiber, it stays regular. Okay, so let's do some examples of regular maps. If this is not something you think about, any polynomial extension, adjoin a bunch of variables, any polynomial extension is going to be regular. At all maps are regular. And localizations, arbitrary localizations are regular. Arbitrary localizations are regular. If you know about the notion of a smooth map, a smooth map is just a regular map, which is a finite presentation. So it's where S is finitely presented as an R algebra. And if you begin with a New The The Neutherian local ring that is excellent. The most famous example, perhaps, of a regular map is that the map from R to its M at its completion is regular. And the way you can get more regular maps out of these basic examples is that you can compose any regular map and it'll stay regular. So compositions of regular maps. Are regular as well. Okay, any questions so far? Three follows from one and two. Yes, that's a good point. And I'll get to that. Yes, precisely. So I want to motivate the central question, and I'll keep the central question on the other side. I think even though I'm supposed to switch. I think, even though I'm supposed to switch, I'm going to motivate the central question by showing to you very quickly that the central question implies the Direct Salmon theorem. And most of the heavy lifting of this proof is really due to Mel. Okay, so step one is the hardest part of the proof, due to Mel from 83, where he shows that the direct sum and conjecture, it was a conjecture back then, follows. If you can show that any unramified complete regular local ring is a splinter for a complete DVR, V, P of V, where P is the characteristic of the mixed characteristic DVR. Characteristic of the mixed characteristic DVR or residue characteristic, sorry. Mixed characteristic 0p. Okay, so Mel reduced the direct Simon theorem to considering only a complete unramified regular local ring. So then how does this central question, this ascent, under the under regular map help us? So observe that you can do the following. You can take the Following, you can take the map from the complete DVRV to the localization of the polynomial ring in n variables at the obvious maximal ideal. And now, this is a local ring, so you can take the completion with respect to this maximal ideal. And when you do that, you just end up with the power series ring over V. So the first map is regular because you've adjoined variables and localized and compositions of regular maps are regular. And the second map is regular because V being having fraction field of characteristic zero, this automatically implies that V is excellent. So if you have a D V R whose fraction field has characteristic zero, you're excellent. So the only problems with excellence happen. So, the only problems with excellence happens in prime characteristic for DDRs. So, this is a composition of two regular maps. So, this is regular because V is excellent. And so, then it's not hard to see that DVRs are splinters. The Direct Stunner theorem would follow. Direct summon theorem would follow if you because this is a composition. The these two maps that I've written is a composition of regular maps, so it's regular. And since you know that a DVR is a splinter, you'll get that the target ring is also a splinter. If you knew this ascent theorem about the ascent of the splinter property under regular maps. Okay, any questions so far? Any questions on Zoom? There was something in the chat. So someone asks, are there examples which are splinters by the new definition, but not the old? There probably are, but I can't think of one off the top of my head. So I made this distinction between purity and splitting for finite surjective maps. And the person is asking if there is a distinction. Are there examples where you can find splinters where the map, the finite extensions are pure, but Map the finite extensions are pure but not split. I don't can't recall one off the top of my head. Okay. All right. So moving on past the central question. So the central question is very natural. See, the ascent of properties, any notion of singularity and the regular mass was first extensively studied by Groth and First, extensively studied by Groth and Deek and Nagara. And any reasonable class of singularity that you know satisfies regular ascent. So, for example, the following notions that I write down all satisfy regular ascent. So, these properties are preserved under regular maps. So, reduced, normal, Cohn-Macaulay, Gorenstein. Complete intersection. The property of being regular is also a sense under regular maps. And if you are a characteristic P person, I'll put an F and I'll put a bunch of words after it. So if you're F rational or F pure or F regular or F injective. So, these notions all ascend under regular maps, and these are by no means easy results. So, there should be lots of attributions here that I'm not giving. These are hard theorems. Okay. And so it is, because we expect the splinter notion to be a reasonable notion of singularity, we also expect that the splinter property is sense under regular maps, is the point. Sorry, can I ask? Do you assume that closed fiber of a regular map is geometrically regular or regular? So the question was: Do you assume the closed fiber of a regular map is geometrically regular or regular? So by definition, all the fibers have to be geometrically regular. That's the definition of a regular map. Yes. Okay, so the central question is again: if you have a regular map of Noetherian rings. Have a regular map of noetherian rings from R to S, if R is a splinter, is S a splinter? So I'm going to make some reductions now using some heavy machinery, heavy but not perfectoid machinery. Okay, so some reductions. So the first reduction is the neuron-Popescue desingularization theorem. So this theorem says that, whoops, a regular map of Netherian ring. Of noetherian rings is a filtered co limit of smooth ones. Okay, and so because the splinter property is preserved under filtered collimits, the first reduction is that to show Is that to show regular ascent in general, it suffices to show that if R to S is smooth and R is a splinter, R is a Netherian splinter, I'm only considering this regular ascent theorem for Netherian rigs because I don't have good structural results for regular maps of non-neetherian rigs. So if R is a Netherian splinter, then S. Then S is a splinter. That's the first reduction. So I can go from considering something which may not be a finite type to considering something that is a finite type. And then the second reduction is the fact that was alluded to by an audience member. So by the structure theory of smooth maps. If R to S is smooth, what does this tell us? This tells us that for all prime ideas, Prime ideals of S, you can find an element not in the prime ideal such that the composition R to the localization of S at this one element is can be factored via a polynomial extension and an eta one. So this is a polynomial extension in the next. So, this is a polynomial extension, and the next one is et al. So, using this structure theory of spooth maps, we can make the following reduction, further simplification for our problem. So, the next reduction we make, the upshot is that it suffices. Is that it suffices to show splinter ascent in the following cases? Following two cases. The first case is just for a polynomial extension. By induction, you can assume that n is one. So if r is a splinter, then r adjoin x has to be a splinter. In the second case, And the second case is the etal one. If R to S is etal and R is a splinter, then you want to show that S is a splinter. And if you know these two cases, then by the structure theory of smooth maps, you get smooth ascent. And then because every regular map is a filtered collimate of smooth ones, you get the regular ascent in general. Okay. Any questions about the simplifications? Yes. Sorry, maybe it's. Yes. Sorry, maybe it's not a nice question to ask, but like for the Direct Summan theorem, you only need polynomial, adding polynomial variables and completion, right? Adding polynomial variables and completion, yes. And so what other applications are you looking? Like, I don't know, why don't you only care about those two cases? Well, you want a theorem that applies for regular maps in general, right? So that's the application I have in mind. That's the application I have in mind. Okay. These other notions satisfy regular ascent. So we want splinters to also satisfy regular ascent. And one of the reasons why is, okay, in prime characteristic, for instance, there's this big open conjecture that splinters are equivalent to F regular. F regular rings are known to satisfy ascent under regular maps in general. So you would expect the splinter property to do have this same, like satisfy the same theorem. And so I think this equivalent. I think this equivalence between F regularity and the splinter property is somehow too hard. So, my approach is to see how many theorems we can show about splinters that are known about F regular rings. This is one of them. Okay, so maybe that's not a very philosophically satisfying justification, but yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah. So the first result due to Kevin and myself is suppose that R is an Ethereum splinter. Let me show that if R to S is a tall. R to S is a tall, then S is a splinter. So we knock off the second simplification. And we also show, and now Eamon will fall asleep for the rest of the talk, if R is local and the map from R to its completion is regular, then we show that R hat is also a split. So we show that if the splinter property ascends under completions and atom maps. First step in answering the general problem or addressing the general problem. Okay, so I want to talk about the key sort of ideal theoretic state results that we use to prove one and two that might be of independent interest to some people. And one of them already appeared in Karen's thesis. So the setting is: suppose that R and S are domains, R is normal, so it's integrally closed in its fraction field, and I is an ideal of R. So the first observation is due to Charon. So it's if R is noetherian local and the map from R to And the map from R to R hat is regular, then you have this following nice result, which is that if you take the ideal, you expand it to the absolute integral closure of R, contract it back to R. This is the same as taking the same ideal, expanding it to the absolute integral closure of the completion of R. Closure of the completion of R, which is a lot bigger than the absolute integral closure of just R, because the map from R to R hat is very transcendental. And you contract this back to R, you get the same thing. Yes, this is all characteristic. I'm going to be careful about my hypothesis of mixed characteristic and positive characteristic. So when there is no hypothesis, there's no hypothesis on the characteristic. Yes, this is characteristic independent. And so sort of looking at Karen's. And so, sort of looking at Karen's proof more closely, Kevin and I isolated the following result, which holds even in a non-Netherian setting. So, if R2S is an extension of finite type and has finite fibers, so the common terminology for these kinds of maps are quasi-finite maps. Quasi-finite maps. So if R to S is a quasi-finite extension, then a sort of similar contraction, ideal contraction statement holds. So you can take an ideal I of R, and now R and S need not be noetherian. So, okay, so for this statement to make sense, you first fix an absolute integral closure S plus of S and take an embedding of R plus inside S plus. Okay, so you can do that. So expand I. So expand I to R plus, contract it back to R, because you're interested in the purity of the map from R to R plus. So if the map from R to R plus was pure, you would expect this ideal to be I itself. So you expand the map from R I to R plus, it's contracted back to R. This is the same as expanding it to S plus and contracting it back to R. And some examples of finite type maps with finite fibers are, for instance, finite. Maps with finite fibers are, for instance, finite maps, unramified maps, and etal maps. These are some examples of what these types of maps are. In Karen's result, she actually uses some model theory, but in the language of commutative algebra, and she uses Artin approximation. In our result, we use Zariski's main theorem. Those are the key technical tools. Those are the key technical tools in each of these results. I'm sorry? No, you don't. Her theorem does not use ultra products at all. So she can somehow states it in a very down-to-earth manner in terms of solving polynomial equations. Yes. And we'll get to that kind of statement later on in my talk. So the question, what was your question again? I should repeat that for the audience. What was the hidden ingredients? Yeah, so the question that was asked was, what are the hidden ingredients? Asked, was what are the hidden ingredients in the Karen's proof and the proof of Kevin and my statements about quasi-finite maps? And so, Karen's proof uses Artin approximation, and our proof uses the Racy-Spin theorem. These are the main ingredients. Okay, any other questions? Moving on. All right. All right, so we said that filtered co-limits of splinters are splinters. So, what can we get as a corollary? That will be useful, is that if Rm is an Ethereum local splinter, then the Henselization and strict Hensalizations of R are also splinters. Because the Henselization and strict Henslizations are filtered co-limits of et al. maps. Or filtered co-limits of etal maps, or pointed et al. maps or splinters. So how does this corollary help us? Okay, so if the splinter property, so we want to show, the statement we have to show is that if R is a Ethereum splinter, then R adjoint X is also a Netherian splinter. And the splinter property can be checked locally. So you can pass to assuming that R is So, you can pass to assuming that R is local, and then you can further assume that R is strictly Hencelian using the ascent theorem. So, suffice this to show that if Rm kappa, the residue field, is a noetherian strictly Hencelian. And so, what does this mean? This means that the field kappa is separably algebraically closed. It's in particular infinite. So, if this is a splinter, so if this Newherian strictly Hanselian local ring is a splinter, then when you join a variable, you stay a splinter. So, why is this helpful at all? We've just reduced the problem from a local ring to a strictly Hencelian local ring. So, this will kind of go back to Jakub's question about what Karen used in her proof. So, what does strictly Hencelian give us? Well, strictly Hencelian and the neuron-purpose desingularization theorem. Singularization theorem gives us the following nice result: a variant of Aten approximation. It says that if you have a regular map from this strictly Henselian local ring to S, which is faithfully flat, so I just mean that there's something above the maximal ideal here. Then you have the following nice conclusion, which is Art and approximation. Which is Arten approximation in this setting. It says that if you have any collection of polynomials, finite collection of polynomials with coefficients in a polynomial ring and finite number of variables over R. And if this finite collection of polynomials, these collections, the collection of polynomials, if they have a solution in S, then they do so in R as well. Do so in R as well. So this is usually in Aten approximation, you have S is R hat, usually. And in Aten approximation, R can be Hinselian and not just strictly Hencelian, because the extension of residue fields is nice. It's an isomorphism on residue fields. But in general, you need strictly Hencelian. In general, you need strictly Hencelian for this type of statement to hold, I think. What is the connection between the source that are the curly arrows? Oh, I'm just saying that what the connection is, so what does strictly Hancelian give us? Is it gives us this kind of a statement, and I'll tell you why that's useful in a second. Okay. All right, so this is a surprising theorem that I was not aware of, and that should use. Was not aware of, and that Shuji observed. So, this kind of being able to solve polynomials over S and then being able to descend them back to R, the solution, what does this tell us? Am I not changing my pages correctly? I think I'm not. Oops. All right, so this is a result of shortens. Let your base ring. Let your base ring R be noetherian, and let S and T be any R algebras whatsoever. Suppose that for every finite collection of polynomials in a polynomial ring with coefficients in R, this collection has a solution of in S implies this collection of polynomials also has a solution in T. So suppose that this hypothesis is true. So then what does Shorten show? Schotten show, he shows then there exists an R algebra embedding of S to some ultra product of T So, if whenever you have a collection of polynomials with coefficients in R, if this collection has a solution in S implies that it also has a solution in T, then you can always embed S in some ultra product of T. And this theorem is actually using a non-trivial result from model theory. From model theory. This uses Wash's theorem from model theory. And you can find this theorem in this nice book, The Use of Ultra Products in Commutative Algebra. Okay. Questions? And I'll tell you why this is useful in a second. So then Shiji observed using this result, the following result. Okay, so before I discuss Shiji's result, what do we have in the previous slide? We have that if Rm is strictly Hanselian local, and you have a regular map from R to S, then this polynomial solvability condition holds. So if you apply Shorten's result, this should. Shortens result, this should tell you that if it from, if you have a regular map from a strictly incelian local ring, then you can embed S, the target, in some ultra product of R using Schoten's results. So this is why the strictly Hencelium property will be useful in today's talk. All right, so I'm going to move on to the observation, or very nice observation. So there are two parts. Suppose you have a flat map of Noetherian local rings such that the maximal ideal of R expands to give you the maximal ideal of S. Some sort of unramified condition. Not really unramified because for unramified things, you need the map on from R to S to be, sorry, from the map on RAC D fields to be separable. But okay, so the first observation is. Okay, so the first observation is very nice observation is that any R algebra map from S to some ultra product of R to an ultra product of R is pure That's his first observation. And the next observation, which is now somehow easy, is that if you assume now that this map phi is regular, and this is again, I'm making no assumptions on the characteristic whatsoever here. Characteristic free statement. If he is regular. Is regular and R is a splinter. This implies that S is also a splinter. And let me tell you now why this is true. I'll explain it to you in words. Okay, so you have the map, local homomorphism from R to S. What you do is you just apply the strict tensorization functor. So you get a map on strict tensilizations. And by Kevin and my result, My result, when you pass through the strict tensorization, the base again stays a splinter. All right, so we can assume in Shiji's second result that the map is one where the base ring is strictly Hencelian. Okay, and now what we just observed is that in this setting, you can embed S using Schoten's result in some ultra product of R. If R is a splinter, R is a splinter because an ultra product is just a localization of a suitably chosen infinite product. The ultra product is also a splinter. And the first result says that the map from S to the ultra product, which is a splinter, is pure. And splinters always satisfy pure descent. So this tells you that S is a splinter. That's the justification. Okay, questions all right and moving on so I'm going to change gears slightly. I'm almost at the end of my talk, so I'm going to change gears slightly from regarding this question about regular ascent to some related problem. And the motivation for this related problem really comes from a result of growth integ. Problem really comes from a result of Grotendieck. So, Grothendieck made the following nice observation in EGA. So, he showed that if you have a Neutherian local ring, and if you assume that the map from R to its ematic completion is regular, so I think excellent, just a very Just a very slight weakening of excellence, then Growth Index showed that this regularity condition alone ensures that the regular locus of any essentially a finite type, our algebra, is open. So, what this theorem sort of philosophically says is that regularity. Is that regularity, the notion of a regular map is related to questions about openness openness of loci, various loci, Cohen-Macaulay, Normal, Gorenstein, so on and so forth. So on and so forth. So, then the natural question that we can ask, since we are dealing with splinters and not these other singularities, is that if R is excellent, is the splinter locus of R open? Open. Any questions about the question? This is simple enough. This just says: if I know that the localization at a prime is a splinter, can I spread it out? This is a principle localization. That's all this is saying, asking. And excellence is really important here because Mel. Important here because Mel Huxter has this really meta theorem that says that if you have any reasonable notion of singularity, then openness of loci for that reasonable notion of singularity fails for the class of locally excellent rings. So excellent rings where all the, sorry, no locally excellent rings are rings where all the localizations at primes are excellent. But these may not be excellent, right? And so any reasonable notion of singularity fails to have open loci for the class of locally excellent rings, and splinters do as well. Excellent rings and splinters do as well. So, this is just a very simple application of this very general result of MELTS. So, excellence is important. And so, the first characteristic dependent result, so now is the following, due to Kevin and myself. So, is the question clear? Can I just scroll past the page number 13? So, is the open splinter locus open? So, I want to keep Shiju's other theorem on the slide on the On the slide, on the projector. So, the first result is the following: characteristic dependent. So, suppose you have a Noetherian local ring of characteristic P, and assume that the map from R to its completion is regular. So, then we have the analog of growth index theorem for the splinter locus. So, then what the theorem is saying is then the splinter locus of locus of any essentially a finite type R algebra is open and the proof of this result essentially reduces to the case where this essentially a finite type R algebra is F finite and in the F finite setting there is a very robust theory of uniformly F compatible ideals and then we use the theory there to show We use the theory there to show some stabilization of traces of finite extensions type result, and that's how we show the splinter locus is open in that setting. Yes? Can you remind me what essentially a finite type means? Yes, very good question. So essentially a finite type just means the localization of a finite type thing. Sorry, yes. So the question was, what does essentially a finite type mean for the Zoom audience? And so the final result today. Today is now that you have the previous result by Shiji and this openness of loci result, then use some standard commutative algebra techniques to show the following. And I'll state it with in as what is the opposite of general, not general a form as possible, so that you know just what is required to prove ascent, regular ascent. All right, so this question is: suppose. Question is: Suppose you know the following. So, suppose whenever AM is complete local, you know this the splinter locus of A adjoined just one variable is open. I'm not even asking for general essentially a finite type, just this one variable adjoin it to a complete location. One variable adjoin it to a complete local ring. Suppose, suppose you knew the disciplinary locus of a adjoined this one variable is open. Then, using standard techniques, you can reduce the ascent theorem under regular maps to this other theorem of Lewis that's on still on the right-hand side. So then R locally excellent, if R is a locally excellent splinter. Locally excellent splinter. And locally excellent means that all the local rings of R are splinters, but need not globally be an excellent ring. So if R is the locally excellent splinter. Locally excellent splinter. No. Okay, okay. Because you can, to show splinter property, you can reduce to the local case. Okay. Okay. And then, yes, but that's a good question. The order of the adjectives. That's a good question. The order of the adjectives is okay, I think. Yes. So, if R is a locally excellent splinter, then R adjoint of variable is also a splinter, which is what is the only thing that we need to show to prove regular ascent in full generality. So, what Shriji's theorem does is it reduces the problem of ascent to the problem about showing openness of loci. Okay, and so as the final corollary. Maybe I should not write this. Yes. No, two has this condition. Oh. So the expansion of the map. So the question was by does the other theorem of Shiji already imply this theorem about adjoining variables, but the other theorem of Shiji has this unramified kind of assumption where the maximal ideal of s must expect. Maximal ideal of S must expand to the maximal ideal, sorry, maximal ideal of R must expand to the maximal ideal of S, which you no longer have any adjournment variables. So that's a good point. But you can get around that using an induction on dimension kind of statement. So then the final conclusion of all of this is that regular ascent is true in prime characteristic for locally accidental rings. Because in prime characteristic, you do. Characteristic, you do have openness of loci by Kevin and my result. So, if R is now a locally excellent splinter of prime characteristic P, then R adjoined X is also a splinter. So, then the open question for the audience and the Zoom audience as well is: can we show this in mixed characteristic? And I will say that none of the results so far have used. So far, we have used perfectoid techniques in any way. I mean, ultra products might sound scary, so model theory might be scary, but this is all independent of these recent fantastic developments using perfected mathematics. But I expect this openness of loci question to probably need the existence of Bitcoin-Macaulay algebras in some way. But it'll be nice to have a proof that doesn't do that because then we have a new proof of the direct sum. Have a new proof of the direct summon theorem that doesn't use perfect techniques. And by the way, so in prime characteristic, this also gives a new proof of the direct summon theorem. Okay, but that's not so impressive because the proof of the direct summon theorem in prime characteristic is already was well known is due to MELF from the 70s and does not use any perfectoid techniques. Okay, I will end my talk here. Are there any questions? So if you're thinking of being a splinter as a sort of singularity condition, do you have a sense of what splinters look like? And what's so the question into geometry, what would they look like? So the question is: if splinter is a notion of singularity, then what could Then, what would splinters look like geometrically? I mean, I guess so. I don't particular know the so in characteristic P, they are expected to be F regular, but that's not geometric. So You expect them to be equivalent to BCM regular? I don't know if we expect that. That's weak and voice. I will say that due to Anuraga, in the Gorenstein setting, splinters are known to be irregular. And in the case where the anti-canonical is finitely generated. Sorry, in the Q-Gorenstein setting. Sorry. Yes, Mel. Sorry, yes, Mel. I was just saying the quarantine setting was Craig and me. Sorry, yes, sorry. The Q quarantine setting. Quarantine setting, it follows from the equivalence of F rationality, F regularity. So when you reduce to the F finite case with this theorem that's still on display on the left-hand page, that the gamma construction? Yes, that uses the gamma construction. I have one comment about the non-Ethereum case. Ethereum case, which is, it's not directly relevant, but in the non-Etherean case, you can have a map of algebras R to S that's pure. And when you join an analytic indeterminate to both rings, R double bracket T, test double bracket T, it's no longer pure. That can happen. I see. It's in the paper where I introduce approximately Gorenstein. Okay. I suspect some strange things can happen in the non-3. So, Mel, to be more precise about your question, for what we really need, we don't even need the gamma construction. We kind of just need the existence of a faithfully flat map to an F finite ring. That's kind of like the gamma construction. Finite ring. That's kind of like the gamma construction, where we don't need any control on the fibers or anything, just the existence of a faithfully fat F finite cover. Yeah, but can you make such a map without using the gamma construction? True, yes. Okay. I'd be happy to see such constructions. More of them you have, the merrier. Sure. There was another question. You had a question? Yeah. You had a question? Yeah, so we know that the, I think in the Q Barnesian case, we know that the splinter locus is open. Can you then get the theorem that adjoining the variable is a splinter from for the Q-Warrenstein case? Yes. So this is what like whenever you know this openness of locus result, all the general other results will immediately give you that adjoining result. You have A, right? It's going to say that for every A, you need to know this result, or only just for A equals to R. Know this result, or only just for a equals to r, you know. So, if see, once you reduce to the local case, you need to know that for the completion of that local ring. So, so if you knew that for the class of Q-Gorenstein rings of mixed characteristic, right? So, in particular, if you assume that R is Q-Gornstein, then you know your theorem that you have a cent for regular maps. Do you? Yes, provided you have this openness of low-square statement and mixed characteristic. Do you have that for the Q-Korenstein case in mixed characteristic? case in mixed characteristic is the splinter locus of um we probably know what is that so the question for the zoom audience is that if if you knew that the splinter locus when you join a variable is open when the base ring is qgorenstein does that imply regular ascent when the base ring is qgorenstein and the answer is yes if you knew the openness of locus statement in the mix Openness of local statement in the mixed characteristics setting. I think you can just join the variable and use the adjunction machinery in the QR case to do it directly. So that's why you should approach the QR solution. Kevin says that you can use the adjunction machine. Sorry. Kevin says you can use the adjunction machinery in mixed characteristic to address the adjoining of Characteristic to address the adjoining a variable from a QR and steen ring from the seven-author paper, for example. But but but this is just but this is like this heavily uses like BCM algebras or R pluses BC algebra. So this does not satisfy my requirement of having a proof without using perfect techniques. Okay. Are there questions in Zoom? Are there any other questions? Are there any other questions, or Dr. So, Mao, just have one comment on the gamma construction? I think the way that Rankeya said, like to avoid, you can avoid gamma construction if you first complete and then you just do the complete tensor product with the algebraic closure of the field. But that's a phaseway flat, and you pass it on. You don't need to domain or they don't need purely inseparable. So, that I think that's. So that I think that's not that is what I was trying to say. Thank you, Lynch. So you could avoid gamma construction if you thank you. Yes, that is what I was trying to say. No, nothing on the screen. Okay, shall we thank the speaker again? Okay, shall we thank the speaker again?
