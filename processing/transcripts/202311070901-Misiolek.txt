on geodesics for fluids for the Euler equation. So it's a geodesic flow on the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. So that was a problem that was standing for 25 years. And Gerard solved this positively just giving examples in particular. And he has, yeah, and he is now in the University of Notre Dame. In the University of Notre Dame, I think ever since. Gerard, you'll correct me. Gerald? Yes, that's right. He had five PhD students. Actually, two of them are here. Patrick can be on it. And he is known not only for this finding of quantity points, but I think that Gerald, for the first time, he started studying free commission of exponential. Commonness of exponential operators of the jet exponential operators and proved her commonness for groups of gauge transformations. And then I continued with many classes, and Steve is one of them to study a component of the one on the group of the exponential map on the group of volume-preserving different marxisms, which has various applications and. Various applications and consequences for fluids. Another thing that I would like to mention is that he discovered that the Kamas-Cohn equation is the geodesic equation on the group of Garathor group or on the group of different fields of the circle with respect to H1s of the metric. That is a beautiful kind of cousin of the category of equation. His equation. And he does a lot of work in studying continuity of the solution map and other stuff. So in particular, probably he will tell us today about some of that. So with this, let me announce his talk. So the first topic will be our P Swed and he will tell us on continuity. Tell us on continuity properties of the loop maps for the SQG family. So, get welcome. Thanks a lot, Baria. Thank you, everybody. I am really sorry I cannot deliver this talk in person. Well, I hope there will be another occasion when we can meet. And in the meantime, enjoy Banff. It's a great place. Joy Banff. It's a great place. Okay, I'm going to stop the video and use the slides, which I have to select first. Okay, hopefully, I hope you can see what I'm seeing right now, which is the first page of my talk. Okay, so. Okay, so the title, as Boria said, is On Continuity Properties of Solution Maps of the SQG family. So the SQG here means surface quasi-geostrophic. This is really a work in progress. So this is really a report on a work in progress. And some of the collaborators are listed here. So starting with Truan Bu, he's a graduate student at the University of Illinois in Chicago. And Martin. Illinois and Chicago, and Martin Bauer, Patrick Hesslin, and Steve Preston are all at Banff and present at the meeting. Now, another thing I should add is that not that long ago, I actually gave a talk that overlaps substantially with what I'll be talking about today. So I apologize to especially all of you who saw that other talk, but hopefully I will also. Hopefully, I will also point out some new things, time permitting, and the themes will have to do with what Baria was mentioning. So these are like my favorite themes in the type of mathematics that I'm doing. Okay, so I will present four results. The main character in this story is the family of inviscid surface quasi-geostroms. Family of inviscid surface quasi-geostrophic equations parametrized by this parameter beta, which is such that when beta is zero, we have the 2D Euler equations, and when beta is one, we have the standard surface quasi-geostrophic equation. So, this is really the main reason for my, not only my interest in the family. Now, the standard surface quasi-geostropic. The standard surface quasi-geostrophic equation has been around for quite some time, but it was brought to mathematicians' attention by Konstantin Maida and Tabag in the mid-90s, who among many other things pointed out some striking similarities between the SQG and the 3D Euler when it comes to certain analytic difficulties that one encounters when studying these equations. When studying these equations. So now, the reason for one reason to be interested in this family is because it interpolates between 2D Euler and 3D, well, SQG, which is morally kind of like 3D Euler. So one can view this family as a tool to study fluids. I mean, that's one way to look at it and try to track the changes. Try to track the changes using this beta as a color in these equations. Try to track the changes of various analytic and geometric objects and constructions as we move beta from zero to one. Okay, so the first theorem was proved for the SQG case, so beta equal to one, by Piers Washerball and Steve's former student. And the remaining case. And the remaining cases are joint with Chuang Wu. Well, the statement is the following: that the SQG family here are Euler-Arnold equations on the group of exact diffeomorphisms of some manifold. I don't want to worry about the boundaries, so let's think of T2 or R2, so it's a two-dimensional manifold, with respect to the inner product here given by this expression. Expression. Now, the inner product is on the left side. We see vector fields. On the right side, we see some functions. And the reason is because the tangent space at the identity to exact diffeomorphisms can be identified with stream functions of zero mean and equipped with this bracket here below so that vector fields can be represented as symplectic gradients of these stream functions. Okay, the proof is just a simple calculation. Is just a simple calculation. So let me first remind all of you that the abstract Euler-Arnold equations on a general Lie group with respect to some right-invariant metric look like this. The right-hand side is where the nonlinearity sits and it's quadratic. And in the case of Euler-Arnold equations, this is given by the Lie algebra coadjoint representation with respect to the inner product here. And now if we do the And now, if we do the little calculation, starting with here the left-hand side, the beta inner product of add star on UVW. These are vector fields. And because we're working with vector fields here, I want to use the commutator. So the commutator is defined by the asymplectic gradient of the Poisson bracket from the previous page. And then the standard calculation leads to the formula, explicit formula. The formula, explicit formula for star, which looks like this. Um, no, I put it in a box because it will play a role later on. So we'll come back to that. Once we have this add star operator, then we just plug everything into the abstract Euler-Arnold equations, sorry, and then identify this object here as, well, call it theta, and we immediately. It theta, and we immediately obtain the SQG family. Okay, so the one immediate consequence of this little calculation is that if we switch just like in the case of fluids to Lagrangian formulation, to Lagrangian coordinates, then we can interpret the Lagrangian solution map of the SQG family as in geometric language, as the exponential map of the right-in variable. As the exponential map of the right invariant metric induced by the beta inner product, the formula is standard, it's right here, so that the exponential map is given by these solutions of the flow equation, which you see here. These solutions, in turn, can be interpreted as geodesics in the group of exact diffeomorphisms, which started the identity. So, think of this as the identity configuration, just like for. Identity configuration, just like for fluids, in the direction of initial velocity u0. So we would like to know whether this map is well defined, whether we indeed are dealing here with some honest, true infinite-dimensional Riemannian geometry. And yes, we are. And in fact, we can prove the following result, which in the case of Euler equations was proved by Schneerelman in 2012. In 2012, and the SQG standard SQG equation by INSEE, if I remember correctly. And the statement here is the following. If S is greater than 5 plus beta over 2, this is definitely not the sharpest statement, then this map U0 into the Lagrangian solutions from going from Hs to the tangent bundle to exact diffeomorphisms is. Bundle to exact diffeomorphisms is, in fact, real analytic. There are two corollaries that I want to mention here. The first one, right here, says that for any beta, the Cauchy problem for the SQG family is then locally well posted in HS in the sense of Adamar. So this means that we not only have local in time existence and uniqueness of solutions, but also at least continuous dependence of the Least continuous dependence of the map theta zero to theta, right? Of the data to solution map. So this is number one. Number two, the second statement is about the exponential map here, and it says that the Riemannian exponential map is in fact differentiable and itself is a local diffeomorphism near the identity in the group. This follows right away, just as in the classical, that is finite-dimensional Riemannian geometry. Dimensional Riemannian geometry from the calculation that shows that the derivative of the exponential map evaluated at zero is the identity, and you know, then just a simple application of the inverse function theorem does it. So, what I want to point out here is that theorems three and four, that I will discuss a little later, will deal respectively with the first and the second statement here. Statement here. But before going there, I want to say a few words about the proof of theorem two. I mean, just briefly. So the idea is to switch to Lagrangian coordinates and then show that the right-hand side of that system that we get there, which corresponds to the family of SQG family, the right-hand side is real analytic. In order to do this, In order to do this, we rewrite the original system in terms of velocities. So we take the SQG equation and we apply these operators. Now, this is fractional Laplacian composed with RK. These are Ries transforms. And when we do this, we get the system right here, the two stars, where the right-hand side now is given by this unpleasant-looking formula. Unpleasant looking formula involving commutators with the fractional derivatives and the fractional Laplacians and the Ries transforms. And this is applied to the fractional Laplacian and then this wedge of R and U. So R is the vector-valued Ries transform, R1, R2, the components. And the wedging means precisely what you see below. U, of course, is the velocity. U, of course, is the velocity. Okay, so once we have the formulation in terms of velocities, then it's a usual, I mean, very standard thing to pass to the Lagrangian coordinates. That's because the left-hand side here, I mean, first of all, we know that gamma dot, so the flow is u composed with gamma, that's the connection. So if we take now gamma dot dot, the second time derivative, and use chain rule and so on, then we recognize that this material derivative will be composed. This material derivative will be composed with gamma and will give us d over dt of gamma dot. So we immediately get the right left-hand side, and on the right-hand side, we have the conjugation of Q with gamma. So with compositions with gamma and gamma inverse. And the system, the three-star system that we get, is the first order system of ODEs, in fact, as it turns out, on HS cross-HS. And the main workhorse lemma is the following. Is the following. So, first of all, we want to show that the system three is equivalent to the original system one. This follows from the, you know, just one has to trace back all the steps, except that maybe I should point out one interesting thing. So, because the intermediate step here is involves the equation, two-star equation for velocities. And if you just look at this equation, the system, it is not immediately clear that the divergence of u of t is zero for all time. For all time. So, this requires some work. And one can get it using estimates and Granwall type inequality. Okay, and then the second statement in the lemma is, yeah, that's where the main effort has to go. It shows that this map here on the right-hand side is real analytic. Once we have this, then we just apply abstract ODE theorem with parameters in analytic settings. This is what Sasha did, for example. This is what Sasha did, for example, used it as a tool in proving this analogous result for 2D Euler. Okay, so now let me go back to those statements in the corollary I mentioned earlier and first address the Adamar situation. So the Adamar rule positiveness. So yes, we have a continuous dependence of theta zero to theta, I mean of theta on theta zero. To theta, I mean a theta on theta zero in the original Cauchy problem for the SQG family. But this is, as it turns out, the best we can expect. So that's very similar to what we know is the case for 2D Euler, and actually for 3D Euler as well. But the statement says that if S is greater than 4, then this Eulerian solution map is not uniformly continuous if it goes from bounded sets in HS into the continuous curves in HS. Continuous curves in HS for sufficiently small betas. So, this is essentially a perturbation-type argument. The proof, which I will very briefly try to sketch here, involves putting together various ingredients. So, there will be four lemmas. The first of which is lemma due to Bourguin and Lee. So, this is a sharpening of an earlier result that Alex Simones and I proved in 2010. Proved in 2010. And it says the following: that if we have a classical solution to the Euler equations, UE, then we can always find two sequences right here of solutions, of Eulerian solutions, such that at time zero, they are first of all confined to some delta ball around UE0. So that's the initial datum for UE, and are such that the difference goes to 0. Such that the difference goes to zero as n goes to infinity. So, this is what happens at time zero. And at any positive time, then the solutions, the corresponding solutions, have to stay apart, have to be separated. And this is how separated they are. There is a the tilde here means that this is up to a constant, but that constant depends only on delta and s. Now, the second ingredient, the second lemma, was proved by the Chinese. Was proved by the Chinese mathematicians Yu, Zhang, and Zhu. And it has to do with the beta, I mean, sorry, the SQG family. So if we take some parameter T, so this is some fixed sum time, then and take a vorticity solution of 2D Euler. So again, this is 2D Euler, just as before, except that this is the vorticity formulation. Then any solution theta beta of the SQG system with the same data. System with the same data has the lifespan that's at least as big as T, and furthermore satisfies the following inequality, differential inequality. So you can see that this is quadratic on the right-hand side. And I should point out here that the constant C is some universal constant, so we don't need to worry about it. But there is another constant, nu beta, and this nu beta has this form. New beta has this form, and that's very good for us, as I will point out, because this constant goes to zero as beta goes to zero. Okay, ingredient, the third ingredient, lemma three, is the classical result of Cato, which is essentially a uniform bound on some finite time intervals of solutions to 2D Euler. So here is this bound. It's given in terms of some. It's given in terms of some monotone function phi s and depends on t. So that's the time interval and the HS norm of the initial data. Okay, so now the proof goes like this. We consider two sequences of solutions to the SQG family called the sequences theta tilde n and theta bar n with initial data given by ascets of the initial. As carols of the initial velocities that were indicated in the lemma of Bourguin and Lee. So in lemma one. Okay, so these are the concrete initial data that we will be working with. Now, since we're dealing here with 2D Euler, then all these solutions are global in time and we can therefore fix some sufficiently large common lifespan T. Common lifespan T for all the solution sequences that appear in that second lemma. And from that second lemma, we then obtain the corresponding differential inequality. Now, concerning this inequality, I want to point out that the terms where we have the differences, the HS norms of the differences are good. We like them because that's what we have on the left-hand side here, the derivative. But these are the terms that have to be But these are the terms that have to be controlled. And the control can be done precisely using Cattle's lemma above. So, you know, we know that the initial data here, the sequences of the Eulerian data, this is from lemma one, from the Bourgen-Lee lemma, must be confined to this delta ball and therefore they will depend on the HS norm of the fixed classical initial data of the classical solution u E0. So they are bounded, all these sequences in HS norms. All these sequences in HS terms are bounded by some fixed delta zero. And from here, we immediately, and using the lemma of Katzo, we immediately get the bound for theta tilde and for the sequences of solutions. Okay, once we have this, now we can proceed to multiply the, oh, this should be the equation, the inequality I just discussed. I just discussed. So it's a different star here. So we multiply that inequality by this exponential and look at the following quantity right here. Obviously, this quantity is of interest because it involves the HS norm of the difference of the tilde sequences. So these are sequences of solutions for the beta family and for the Euler, to the Euler equations. So the inequality that we are now looking at is this: it's a quadratic inequality. It's a quadratic inequality. We want to obtain a bound for the function, so we can apply a very nice result of Peter Constantine from 1980s, which is the following, that if we have a continuous non-negative function defined on some fixed interval and some constant g, and then we have a parameter which ranges between zero and some fixed number here, which depends on t, g. Here, which depends on t, g, and f, then any solution of this differential inequality must satisfy this bound. Okay, so in this bound, we have f, we have t, and we have nu. Okay, so we have this parameter right here. So how do we apply it to our, in our case? Well, we just pick g, f, and nu in this way, and observe that the constant nu is that nu beta. These choices will, in particular, the third choice will also give us a constant beta zero by simply setting new beta zero equal to new zero, where new zero is given here in Constantine's lemma. And this way we'll obtain beta zero, the constant which is independent, positive and independent of n, and also a bound on the HS normal. On the HS norm of the difference of the tilde sequences. So, of course, here we have some constant, and then this is multiplied by the betas, which the factor involving betas, which goes to zero as beta goes to zero. We get an analogous estimate for the bar families. So, putting all this together, we have what we expect, namely at time t equal to zero. Time t equals zero, we have the initial data, the difference of the sequences of initial data in HS norm has to go to zero. This is a consequence of Burgundy lemma, I mean set up. And then for any positive t, say between zero and t, triangle inequality gives us first this. Now, these two terms are controlled by the inequality from the previous page, which is derived, and they go to zero, so they're really essentially of all. So they're really essentially of order beta. So this is O of beta, while this sequence is controlled below by Le Minf of the difference of velocities, and therefore we have our result. Okay, now concerning the second statement in that corollary, I want to discuss the following term. I mean, as I said, this is still a work in progress, so we have more results. Progress. So we have more results, but this is the one that pertains to wholeness. So I think it's fitting that I mention that. So it's due to Martin Bauer, Patrick Heslin, and Steve Preston. And it says the following. If S is greater than 3 and beta now is a parameter which is greater than or equal to 0, but strictly less than 1, then this Riemannian exponential map we introduced earlier of the beta metric on the On this group is non-linear fret home of index zero. So this means that its derivative is a fret home operator bounded necessarily in this case, which has finite dimensional kernel, finite dimensional co-kernel, and closed range. We already have a kind of technique for proving this type of results. So I can just describe it very briefly. We look at the derivative of this exponential map because it's an exponential map. So from first Riemannian. From first Riemannian principles, we know that it describes solutions of the linearized geodesic equation, which is known as the Jacobi equation, linearized along some fixed geodesic, call it gamma, and say that it starts at the identity with initial velocity, u0. It's a geodesic in this group of exact diffeomorphisms. And this derivative can be decomposed as a sum of two operators. These operators, what's crucial here is that. Uh, what's crucial here is that this is essentially an invertible operator, and this turns out to be compact. Okay, that's really the gist. Here are some more explicit expressions. The operators that we see here are, so we see compositions and some integrals, which are really inessential, but the compositions are with bounded operators, and this operator. And this operator right here is again, I highlighted it because this is the same operator as the co-adjoint operator I showed you on the first page. So very quickly, it's this box right here. And I will write this down again. I will write the formula explicitly on the next page. Because, so, what we need to show, as I said, is. What we need to show, as I said, is that this operator or this operator is bounded from below, at least essentially, so essentially invertible, and this is compact. And the way to do it is to look at the inner product here of that first operator omega with W's and Hs and take an HS inner product. And you can see that this will be bounded below by this expression. So because it's an inner product, so we have two W's there. Because it's an inner product, so we have two w's there, so just cross the square, cross this factor, and we have lower bounds in terms of the hs norm of w and hs minus one norm of w. So that's great. Now, as for the second term on the right-hand side, and if we look at that k operator, and as I said, this is precisely the at star, the co-adjoint representation. Here, I again write down the formula, the expression that we derived for it. formula the expressions that we derived for it and this can be shown that the we can show that the hs plus one minus beta norm of this operator is bounded by the hs norm of of w so if beta is strictly less than one then we have compactness by the standard releichondrashov theory now all this leads to the following estimate for the derivative of the exponential map the hs derivative the hs norm of The Hs norm of that derivative is bounded from below by the Hs norm of W, Hs minus one norm of W, and then this Hs norm, which is Hs norm of gamma. So I just write it in this way because it's a compact semi-know. So this is the one that involves the K operator. Once we have this type of estimate, and you can recognize that this is, you know, a kind of analog of an elliptic estimate, and that's because that's correct, because fit honest has to do with a lot with ellipticity. So we expect this. Ellipticity. So we expect this type of analysis that will lead us to something like this. Then, once we have this type of estimate, then showing that dx has closed range, finite dimensional kernel is standard. And what this means is that this dx as an operator is a bounded semi-Fredholm operator, but we already know that the derivative of this dx at zero is the identity, and therefore. zero is the identity and therefore so we i mentioned this earlier and therefore has index zero now we also know this is perturbation theory uh of of operators that uh uh in index which is the the the difference of the dimension of the kernel and the dimension of the co-kernel uh of semi-flatom operators is uh is a continuous map on on the space of semi-flattom operators so we get the the index zero property right away and of course also finite dimensional And of course, also finite dimensionality of the co-kernel. Okay, so this indeed is all I wanted to say, except that I would like to add and maybe make two comments. So the first comment, very brief. The first comment is that the fact that this is true for better strictly less than one, I hope will be explained further maybe by Patrick. If Patrick gives Patrick, if Patrick gives a talk in the afternoon, because we know that there are counterexamples when beta is equal to one. So Fred Wholeness fails at the SQG end. So, okay, so this is first comment. Now, the second comment is the following. So, this has to do with what I was saying about the SKG family being a tool. So, we have the following. Tool. So we have the following situation. So in terms of when it comes to Fred Wholeness, we have that at beta equal to zero and then all the way to beta equal to one, we know that fret wholeness holds. Okay. So that's the picture that we now have. Now, compare this with a global industry. A global in-time regularity of the SQG family. What we know there is that, of course, at beta equal to zero, we have the 2D Euler, so we know that we have global solutions, but then this is an open problem for all the betas that are greater than zero. Of course, one can then try. Then try to get a better insight, a better picture of what's going on, and try to track the evolution of other objects. One can look at coadjoint orbits, one can study other properties, but essentially this can be hopefully used as a tool to study fluids. So that's my hope. That's my hope and part of the work in progress. Okay, that's all I wanted to say. Thank you very much. Garrett, thanks a lot. So, what what is your prediction for better greater than zero for global irregularity? So based on what Constantine, Maida, and Tabak were telling us, but also based on the work of Wu and Cordoba and Gancedo. Yeah, it's not clear. What we do know, what we do have, is a very nice Bil-Katomaida criterion that is applicable for all betas between zero and one. So we know what is missing. We know what we need. However, one may try to speculate if and looking And if looking at other properties that one can analytic and geometric, like for example, Fred Holmness. I mean, Fred Holmness gives us a certain estimate. So it is like an estimate. Well, it's not this one, but it's something like that. So this is some kind of additional tool that we have. It gives us some kind of control for. Kind of control for betas at least that are greater than zero and strictly less than one. Can it be used somehow in the regularity problems? Perhaps, but I don't know how at this stage. Is it fair to say that for uh better greater than zero, it looks like uh the Euler equation with has the same flavor as the Euler equation with the fractional dimension, like in twenty three. Yeah, you want to make a comment? So, they're actually there's proof like Pislab, Regic, and other people they prove their first QG patch, which is slightly more similar to the other decomposable one. And the reason why that's really just about the, if you like, put beta to a little bit bigger than zero, then the equation is the world. Okay, so whose work? So whose work I you know there is some echo that I don't quite I reject the art of artist and also recently it about his book the robot multi-skiji pen i i i don't think i understood everything but but uh um i'd definitely be interested in uh any new uh work any new papers or preprints Any new papers or preprints on well-positiveness here? So, some other questions or comments. So, again, girls, happy birthday again, and many more achievements. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Well, we hope that you don't say that because.
