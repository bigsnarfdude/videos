All right. Next is Jordan Richard, and after him, Jonathan Co. will be the next one. So go ahead, Jonathan. So, Andrew's already talked a bit today about neural Bayes estimators. And yesterday, Raphael spoke about spatial peaks and threshold models. So today, I'm speaking about neural Bayes estimators for spatial peaks and threshold models. Specifically, models that use sensitive likelihood for inference. This joint work with Andrew and Raphael and Matthew Sainsbury-Dale, who is absolutely the brains behind the operation, but focused. Absolutely, the brain's behind the operation, but thankfully, he isn't here to hear me admit that. Okay, so all we're doing is adapting the neural base estimators that we've heard about today so that we can take in sensored data as input. Hopefully, everyone now is aware of sort of the computational difficulties in fitting spatial tremor-dependence models. But if we worked in a spatial piece of a threshold framework, often we use sensored likelihoods to circumvent the bias involved in using non extreme data to estimate stream appendance. Data to estimate stream appendance. And already the models we're working with having tractable likelihood functions quite difficult to fit. Sensoring compounds these issues because you have to use integrals, and we heard a bit about that yesterday. And so the solution to solving our computational issues is just not to use a likelihood. We've heard today about, well, we should use likelihood, but I'm stressing that we just don't use it ever again. So consider inference for five popular models: Gaussian processes, max stable, and inverse. Gaussian processes, Max stable and inverse Max stable processes, and our Pareto processes, random scale mixtures, specifically the Huser-Watsworth model that Raphael spoke about yesterday. And in all of the cases, our simulation studies illustrate gains in both the computational and statistical efficiency relative to using the competing likelihood-based approach, so that is a pairwise or even the full likelihood in some cases when we use our proposed neural base estimator. And our application. And our application to monthly Saudi Arabian PM2.5 concentrations really illustrates the computational benefits of our amortized estimator. So, here is just an observation of the surface average PM2.5 concentration for July 2012. It's quite high-dimensional data. It's arranged on a really big grid. It's 242 by 182 regularly gridded locations. And because of the high space of non-stationarity in the data, we fit local and isotopic fusion Wadsworth models with five. Fusion Wadsworth models with five parameters. In a moving G by G window, so to all possible subsets of data on a G by G regular grid, we fit these models for a smoothing level G between 4 and 32. The entire analysis then uses 130,000 extreme mode model fits. While some neural base estimates train, and in these cases it takes between 10 and 24 hours to do it, a single model fit takes between one and four milliseconds to do absolutely. And four milliseconds to actually evaluate. So, just for comparison, then, in the case where you have G is equal to six and you have an isotropic model, if you use the full sensor likelihood-based inference that Raphael and Jenny used in their previous application, it takes about 12 hours to fit a model. Our approach is 43 million times faster. And I apologise for the sort of the indirect criticism there. The full likelihood-based approach, limited to low-dimensional. Likelihood-based approach limited to low dimensions, roughly 36. Our approach, when g is equal to 32, we have over a thousand dimensions. And here's just some illustrations. I just want to, I'll just, this is just some parameter maps. So on the left-hand side is Dell, so this controls whether or not the process is absolutely dependent or independent. On the right-hand side is the angle and the anisotropy transformation. Okay, so just to end on a rather contrived anecdote, if we were to repeat our entire analysis. If we were to repeat our entire analysis from scratch, so for all values of g, using our NBA neural-based estimator-based approach, it takes about four days to train our models and a few minutes just to evaluate them. If we use the full-centered likelihoods, under a rather conservative assumption that the computation time scales linearly would be, it takes a thousand years. And I've only got five minutes, so obviously, we're not a minute. And this is for a single set of fits. Actually, when we start to think about factoring in uncertainty estimation for our parameters. Conservative estimation for our parameters, you know, this is ridiculous, obviously. But if you like me, you're sick of using pairwise like us or just like us in general, please come and see my poster this afternoon. Thanks very much.
