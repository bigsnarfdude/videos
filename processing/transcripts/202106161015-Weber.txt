It is my pleasure to introduce Professor Francisca Weber from the Carnegie Mellon University, who will talk about a convergent numerical method for a model of liquid crystal director coupled to an electric field. Thank you for the introduction, Eleni, and thank you for inviting me to this wonderful workshop and give me the opportunity to give a talk. Opportunity to give a talk. It's maybe a little different than the last talks, hopefully, not too mathematical. I see that the audience is very diverse, but maybe there's some value to it. So I'll talk about quite a simple model compared to some of the models we have seen, but I guess I wanted to be able to do some math, and that's why I started with a simple model. And so maybe one can extend things to more complicated models. To more complicated models. So, in this model, we think of liquid crystals as elongated molecules. So, we can picture them as rods, like in this picture here. And as we all know, the liquid crystal phase is something like the one in the middle, where the molecules are mostly aligned, but not completely. And then we try to model the orientation, the channel orientation of the molecule. So, there are many models. The one we'll focus on is. Models. The one we'll focus on is the Ossium-Frank theory, but there's also Ericsson-Leslie hydrodynamic theory that is connected to the Ossium-Frank theory or the Landau Des Gen theory and many others. So what we try to model is that a vector field, D, that is a vector field that takes values in the sphere. So it has always length one. Omega here is the domain wherever the molecules are located. Can be in two or three dimensions depending on. Three dimensions, depending on what kind of application we consider, and then when we look at the Aussie and Frank model, the equilibrium configurations of the liquid crystals are minimizers of the Aussie-Frank elastic energy, where the energy density is given here. And so these three terms correspond to different orientations of the liquid crystal. One is play, the first one, the second is twist, where the molecules are kind of twisted, and a third is benwear. Are kind of twisted and a 3D span where clearly the molecules are banded. And yeah, so there is usually there's one more term that I omitted here that can be, depending on what you look at, you can like reduce it to a boundary term. And so since my title says I'm interested in an electric field, let's look at one of the applications that we are interested in. So where you have a liquid crystal between So, where you have a liquid crystal between two polarizing filters, and some liquid crystals have the property that they can polarize the light. So, depending on how they're oriented, the light goes through or not, or gets twisted, as you can see here. So, you have like a liquid crystal substrate between two filters, where one is oriented in this way and the other one in another way. And then, depending on the liquid crystals react to the electric field, and depending on how the field is applied, the How the field is applied, they will orient in different ways. So, here they're sort of twisted, and you see the light goes through. Here they are in a nice alignment. And because the filters are oriented in different ways, the light doesn't go through. Or there might be other ways to picture this or other types of liquid crystals that do it differently. Oh, sorry, that was not intended. And yeah, so you have an applied voltage, and this is basically. And this is basically the idea of how a liquid crystal screen would work. And so we already had an energy for the liquid crystal directive field. So now we need to figure out what happens to the electric field. And so in one theory, according to Stuart's book, the energy density for the electric field looks like this. So here E is the electric field and D is the electric displacement. Electric displacement and the energy density contribution looks like this. So it's one half of the product of the electric and the displacement field. Also, the displacement field satisfies a constitutive relation, which you can see here. So epsilon zero is the permittivity of free space and epsilon perp and epsilon A are dielectric constants. Epsilon A is called the electric anisotro dielectric. Electric anisotropy, dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal. So you see, this is how the liquid crystals affect the electric displacement. So this term is just basically parallel to the electric field. And then depending on how strong the influence of the electric, the director field is, this term is larger or smaller. So for example, if D is parallel to the electric field, then it will be rather strong. And if it's orthogonal, then it will be close to zero. Will be close to zero. And there's also some predictions about this. So if the epsilon A here is larger than zero, then the director tends to align with the electric field. Whereas if it's smaller than zero, it prefers to be perpendicular. Similarly, you could add a magnetic field. So this is the energy density for the magnetic field. Here, B is the magnetic field, H is the magnetic induction. Again, we have a constitution. Again, we have a constitutive relation for the magnetic field. So, the first term is parallel to the magnetic induction, and the second term is the coupling to the liquid crystal field. And here, again, mu zero is the permeability of free space, and mu A is the magnetic anisotropy. And you can like make similar predictions as in the first case, as in the case of the electric field. So, you add these terms to the These terms to the energy, the energy density or the Frank energy density. And then you can look at minimizers, which are static configurations of the liquid crystal. So it's the prediction. Now, if you want to add some more dynamics, say inertia, you can instead consider a least action principle where the inertia is balanced by the other energy contributions. And so, if you can either try to minimize this directly, or you can look at the Euler Lagrange equations, which describe stationary points or saddle points at least. And then if you add also dissipation to the picture, the Euler Lagrange equations become this expression here. So, the first term is from the inertia, the second term from the damping. This is the variation of the Ossim-Frank energy. Gamma is a lot. Gamma is a Lagrange multiplier, enforcing the constraint that the director field has length one. And then these are the contributions from the electric and the magnetic field and how they couple to the how they influence the liquid crystal director field. To model the electric and the magnetic field, we use the stationary Maxwell equations. There is no free charges, so we assume so the right hand side here is zero. The right-hand side here is zero. Also, you could instead look at the dynamic Maxwell equations with time dependence. But since the time scale is very different or much faster than the liquid crystal, we thought it might make more sense to just consider the stationary Maxwell equations. And as we can see from the equations, so the equations for D and E and the equations for B and H are very similar. So they basically have the same structure. Similar. So they basically have the same structure, and also these source terms here are of the same type. So you could actually rewrite these in terms of h, then the constants will change a little bit, but it will look kind of the same. So for because the mathematical analysis and the numerical scheme will be very similar, and also because it's maybe a little easier to keep the overview when presenting, I'll omit the terms for the magnetic field and just look at. Magnetic field and just look at the system when you have just an electric field. But we could add this and the like the scheme and the theory should extend to this case. So basically this is what we get in this case here, epsilon A. Epsilon one is just the product of epsilon zero, epsilon A. So I have to write a little less. And this is the system of equations we get. Also, we remember D has a relation to the electric. Has a relation to the electric field that we will use in a moment. Make one more simplification that is probably not always physically relevant. As we have seen in the last talks, the constants in the Aussian-Frank energy, they can be very different. If you do set them equal to the same, then the Aussian-Frank energy density will just become this expression, one half of the gradient of d squared. And okay, and then this term basically. Okay, and then this term basically becomes Laplacian of D. So at least the numerical scheme should be able should be possible to extend it to other constants, but the theory, the convergence analysis doesn't go through, at least not at the moment. Maybe it's possible to do it, but I haven't managed so far. One other thing that we can use to simplify the equations, so at least if the domain is simply connected, the equation at the curl of the electric The equation that the curl of the electric field is equal to zero implies that it is the gradient of a potential. So that is maybe more relevant. And then these two equations simplify to one elliptic equation. And basically, this is the system we get. So here what we get from using the one constant approximation. And this equation is what we get out of these two equations after using that the curl of E is equal to zero and therefore curl of E is equal to zero and therefore E is the gradient of a potential V. And moreover, using the constitutive relation. So you see that basically this is the Laplace of V plus some perturbation. So if epsilon 2 is small, then basically there's some sort of a smaller perturbation or heuristically speaking. So depending on how large epsilon 2 is, that basically tells us how much the director field influences the electric field. And then we need some boundary conditions. And then we need some boundary conditions. And these are also, so for V, we prescribe the potential. So that's sort of like an applied voltage. And for D, for now, we just assume that the gradient in the normal direction is zero, so sort of outflow boundary conditions. And this, if you want different boundary conditions, then this should be more complicated. This allows you to get nice energy stability for different boundary conditions. Energy stability for different boundary conditions might be more complicated, which has to be studied. And there's some lots of previous works and lots of related works to this system. I tried to mention some that are related to the model that I consider, but there's many more. So when you ignore the electric field in this equation, you get a damped wave map equation. So this term disappears and this equation disappears and then you basically get This equation disappeared, and then you basically get a. And if you ignore this, you get the WaveMap equation. If you ignore this, you get the heat map flow. So it's related to heat map flow and WaveMap equations, where there's lots of previous works with different types of how to accommodate the constraint. It's also related to the more complicated model of the Leslie-Erickson hydrodynamics, which Duran Wockington worked on. They did not They did not satisfy the constraint explicitly. What they did is they did some relaxed version where you add a Ginsburg Landor potential and then this allows you to get more regularity and like do other things that make the analysis a little easier, which is also an option. Then another model is the ERX model, which has like variable degree of orientation. Like variable degree of orientation, so it's a bit more general. No cheto, Walker, and Zang they designed numerical schemes to find equilibrium configurations on their electric field. For a non-static or more dynamic situation, Arsen, Rider Nopoli and others looked at the Aussin-Frank system, the Aussin-Frank energy with an electric field. I don't think they showed convergence, and so at least this one is. And so, at least, this one is one-dimensional, this is more multi-dimensional, but I think it's more computational. And then there's also work on the Q-tensor model with electric fields. So, let's have a look at the numerical scheme, the main idea. So, I guess the main difficulty is the constraint, the unit length constraint, which is non-linear and causes non-linearities in the equation. You can see this directly, but if you try to compute this Lagrange multiplier here for me, This Lagrange multiplier here formally, you would see that it's kind of a non-linear term involving the gradient of d. And then, so therefore, the whole equation is non-linear, and so you also have to take into account the energy to obtain stability of the numerical scheme. So, basically, if you can satisfy the constraint, also satisfying the energy gets a little easier. In order to satisfy the constraint, we define what we call the angular momentum, W. So, this is the So this is the cross product of the time derivative of D and D. And so then what we do is we try to derive an equation for W and its evolution. So first if you just do some formal vector calculus, you take the cross product of D and W, you plug in the definition, then this becomes this expression here. Now, if D has length one, this is just one, and moreover, D is orthogonal to dt. So what you get is that So, what you get is that dt satisfies this equation because this term disappears and this is just dt. So, basically, this you get by taking the derivative, the time derivative of d squared, which is equal to 1, and so it should be 0. Now, to get an equation for w, you take the time derivative of w and plug in the equations. And so, this is what you end up with. You end up with the term with the Lagrange multiplier disappears because the cross product with d is equal to zero, and the source term becomes this term. So, overall, we get this system. The elliptic equation stays the same, and then we have initial and boundary conditions. Now, why should this be of any use? So, let's do a formal calculation. If we take the time derivative of d squared here and then use a chain rule, we get this expression. chain rule we get this expression. Now we plug in that dt is equal to d cross product w in our reformulation and so this has to be zero because d is orthogonal to d cross product w. So that implies that the length of d is conserved and if it's initially say d0 is the initial condition equal to one then it will be one for all times. So now we can try to replicate this in a numerical fashion by using some sort of Fashion by using some sort of midpoint discretization. So Tm here is a time step. Delta T is the time step size, M are time steps, so integers. We denote Dm to be the approximation of the director field at time Tm. Sorry. And Dm plus one half is the average of the different time steps, Dm and Dm plus one. And then we discretize the time derivative by discretized the time derivative by this forward difference. So dm plus 1 minus dm divided by the time step. And then the right hand side, which was this expression before, we take the average of the two time steps. So now if we take the inner product of this expression with the average at time steps m and m plus 1, then the right hand side will disappear because it's again orthogonal to the m plus 1 half. And on the left hand side, we have this expression. And on the left-hand side, we have this expression, which is now equal to zero. So, because we take the inner product, this expression here is basically dm plus one, the norm of dm plus one squared minus dm squared, which is equal to zero. So that means that dm plus one has the same mod as dm. And so you can iterate this and use induction, and so it has the same life as the approximation of the initial. Same length as the approximation of the initial data. So, if you approximate the initial data in such a way that it has length one, then this constraint is preserved. This way, you obtain a constraint. And now, if you discretize the rest in a reasonable way, you will also obtain some energy stability. And this is one way to do it that I chose to do. So, I already told you the discretization for the equation for D. D again Tm are the time steps. Now DTFM for some quantity df is just this forward difference in time and this again is the average. So the equation for W we also discretize using sort of midpoints in an implicit fashion. This is the damping term. And then for the source term, we have to use some kind of weird average here, which allows us to gain energy stability. Allows us to get energy stability. And then the elliptic equation doesn't have time dependence, so you can just think of it at each time step. So this is pretty non-linear. Oh, sorry. You can solve it using a fixed point iteration and show that it converges. One can also use some other ways to solve the non-linear system like Newton iteration, but then you can show convergence necessarily. So if you use a fixed point iteration, you can show that under some time. You can show that under some time-step restriction, it is convergent. Oh, there's a question, I think. Oh, okay, this is not to me. Sorry. Sorry. No problem. Okay, so and then for the spatial discretization, we use finite elements for phi and finite volumes for W and D. It may be possible also to use finite elements for these two equations. Also, to use finite elements for these two equations, but I'm not sure. I chose this because it allows you to use certain identities that you can then use to get energy stability, and the equations have more hyperbolic type than the last one. But it might also be possible. So, then if I denote the spatial parameter by h, the spatial grid size, then I get some approximations, dh, wh, and phih. So, I will use this notation. So, I will use this notation in the following. With this discretization, you can, sorry, this looks horrible, you can show energy stability as long as the initial condition is bounded in some reasonable space, which you can see here. So basically, the gradient of D has to be bounded, W has to be in L2, the Lebesgue space, and the gradient of V, which you can obtain by solving the elliptic equation using the constraint and everything, then this is also possible. The constraint and everything, then this is also bounded, and so you get a bound for these quantities at later times. Here, by gradient h, I mean the differences, sort of a discrete version of the gradient, the differences of d in all directions. So dh and wh are piecewise constants and vh is a piecewise linear. So you can take the derivative almost everywhere. And here gh tilde is the extension of the boundary condition for Of the boundary condition for phi on to the whole space. So that's one of the assumptions that you have to make that this boundary condition can be extended. So using this energy stability, you can then show that the scheme is convergent at least as long as epsilon is larger than minus one and sigma and alpha have to be, or sigma at least have to be larger than zero. It's maybe possible to do it also for just alpha larger than zero and sigma equal to zero, which would be the purely dissipative case. Dissipative case. This you need basically to get ellipticity of the elliptic equation. You see, if this is less than minus one, then you might have a problem here with the type. And basically the main steps, and sorry if you're not a mathematician, then this is going to be terrible. What you do is you derive a priori estimates from the energy balance that I showed you earlier. This is coming from the constraint. These three come from the energy balance. Here again, the gradient. Here again, the gradient of h is kind of the differences of dh in all directions. So then, using compactness theorems such as Aubelion's lemma and Banacharol-Alo-Group, you can derive a convergence of sub-sequences, dh of the derivatives and of VH. These only in weak star this strongly. And so you obtain that the limit is a weak solution of this system. So this looks almost like what I So, this looks almost like what I showed you earlier: the continuous system, except for this term here, which is just a weak limit of the product of gradient of VH with gradient of VH and VH. So, because the equation is non-linear and I have only weak convergence of weak star convergence of gradient of VH, I cannot directly show that this limit is what I want it to be, D times D inner product of D with gradient V. inner product of T with gradient V and times gradient V cross product with T. So to do this, I have to use some sort of, I need strong convergence of the gradient. And what I do is I use some sort of diff curl lemma, which is kind of natural in this situation because you have a structure with a curl and a divergence for the electric field. So basically, if you have in a, okay, this is not exactly what the scheme does. Okay, this is not exactly what the scheme does because it's a finite element scheme. But if you have some sort of the curl of the approximation EH, where EH is the gradient of VH, is equal to zero, and the divergence of DH is equal to zero, going to zero, and this relation, then you can conclude that the product converges weakly to the product of the weak limits and not just to some random order thing up to some sub-sequence. And then what you use is that you have. What you use is that you have actually this expression for EH times dh, which is something quadratic. And then using this, you can derive that EH or the gradient of EH converges strongly. And that is basically how you show that the limit is a weak solution. Now, some numerical examples. So I haven't done too many numerical examples yet. I haven't done too many numerical examples yet. What I try to find here is whether there is this alignment with the electric field depending on whether epsilon A is larger or less than zero. So I use a mesh size of 1 over 64 approximately and then this is a time step restriction. The domain I just use a square and this is just 2d sigma. The constant in front of the second order time derivative is one half and k I just use equal to one. And k i just u is equal to one. This is the boundary condition, so you see it varies in time as a sine wave, so it gets larger and smaller, and then it's like also spatially varying linear in x and like a sine wave in y. And then the initial time derivative of the director field is equal to zero. So for the first experiment, I just use this constant initial data for CE0, and you see it's only varying in the plane right now. And then I do two experiments, one with epsilon one and epsilon two. With epsilon one and epsilon two larger than zero, which corresponds to epsilon a larger than zero or less than zero, depending on the other constant. No, the other constant is positive. And then the second one with them negative. And so this is what I get. So the top row is the director field and the bottom row, the electric field. And from left to right, it's time 0.25, 0.5 and 2. And you see that actually pretty quickly, the director field aligns with the electric field. Rector field aligns with the electric field. I hope you can see it's a little small. So the electric field points first in this direction and then it points to the left where it stays. And you see the director field also starts mostly aligning from left to right and according to the electric field. So here the alignment is pretty good. So now if I use the opposite signs, it does align in the opposite direction. So the electric field again looks more or less the same. It doesn't seem to be perturbed. Same, it doesn't seem to be perturbed very much by the director field, so maybe I'd have to choose this constant to be larger to obtain that. And you see that it aligns basically in the other direction. So here's another experiment that was mostly for fun. So I take some initial data that looks like this for the director field, and the electric field is similar again. It's the same initial condition. And so this initial data it developed. Initial data, it develops singularities if you look at the pure weight map equation. And so I was like, okay, let's see what happens if you add these source terms. And so alpha is the damping constant. If it's rather small, you see that this is time 0.25, 0.575, and time one. And you see that at the small time, it looks like there's something weird going on. There's some sort of singularity possibly developing. And then the director field bounces to. Bounces to the left and then back to the right. And so it seems to be wiggling back and forth a bit. Also, remember the electric field changes a bit. The electric field doesn't seem is very similar to what we've seen before. It doesn't seem to be affected much by the director field. And then here's one more where alpha is larger, the damping. You again see something going on here, but it's much, maybe if I chose a smaller time, you would see more of it, but it seems to relax more quickly. It but it seems to relax more quickly, and the director field then again seems to be going back and forth, like according to what the electric field does, it doesn't seem to wiggle as much. And here's the electric field, a little boring. And I think I'm more than out of time. So let's sum up. So what I'm planning to do in the future is also to consider more channel coefficients. So you can simulate more realistic scenarios. Can simulate more realistic scenarios. Then I took very simple boundary conditions for the director field, which might be more interesting if you choose weak or strong anchoring and whether this can be extended to that. Also, whether you can add, say, an external flow and whether this makes a difference and is relevant. And then, of course, like because this is just all Sim Frank's theory, maybe it would be more interesting to look at variable degree of orientation models as well. And all right, thank you for. And otherwise, thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Francisca, for a very interesting talk. Any questions?
