I am very happy to get to speak at this Dynamical Algebraic Combinatorics Workshop. Thank you for the invitation. This will be a mostly expository talk. I will discuss infinite phrases and how they naturally appear in cluster algebras. So first, I want to tell you about this Ketalan object. About this Catalan object called Conway-Coxeter Freezes. I start with a row of ones and a row of, sorry, a row of zeros and then a row of ones, and I fill in the rest of the entries with positive integers following this SL2 rule. Basically, for every diamond like this, I can think of it as a two by two. Of it as a two by two matrix, and I required that the determinant be one. So one times three minus one times two has to be one. Another restriction is that it should be bounded below by a row of ones. The Conway cocceter phrases are in natural bijection with triangulations of a polygon. Of a polygon. And here is one way to see the correspondence. I take a triangulation and I look at each of the boundary vertices and I will just count the number of triangles adjacent to each vertex. So here there are four triangles, one triangle, two triangles, two triangles, two triangles, and one triangle. I take this number, one, four. I take this number 14122. So that corresponds to this row of the freeze. This is called a quiddity sequence. These were studied in the 70s, but fast forward to 20 years ago, when cluster algebras were introduced, people once again became People once again became interested in phrases because of their connection to cluster algebras, which I will talk about later. Here we can replace the positive integers with these Laurent polynomials called cluster variables, and the SL2 condition is still satisfied. For example, you can check that for this diamond, this product. This product minus this product is equal to one. Here, the positive integer entries correspond to the number of terms in the Laurent polynomials. So now I want to talk about a generalization of the Conway-Coxeter phrases. There are many different ways that these have been generalized. Ways that these have been generalized. But in this situation, what I will do is I have the same rule, but I will remove the restriction that I have to have the bottom boundary condition. So, in fact, I will require that the freeze should go on forever. So, again, I have a row of zeros, a row of ones, and I have these. row of ones and I have these positive integers satisfying this SL2 condition for each diamond. It turns out that every infinite periodic freeze corresponds to a triangulation of an annulus or a once-punctured disk. The correspondence is similar as before. So here I take this annulus and I And I can pick either one of the two boundaries. So here I'm looking at this outer boundary. There are two points on the boundary, and I will just count the number of triangles adjacent to each vertex. Here there are three, and here there are two. So the liquidity sequence is 2, 3, and I will put that 2, 3 in this row, and I will use. Row and I will use this to then fill in the rest of the infinite freeze using the SL2 condition. Here is a punctured disk. And again, I count the number of triangles adjacent to each vertex. So here there are three triangles, two triangles, four triangles, and so on. And I take this quiddity sequence. This quiddity sequence for one two three two um so that's a typo but I take this quiddity sequence and use that to fill in the rest of my freeze so so now I want to make this infinite freeze but instead of using integers I want to have my entries be cluster algebra elements. Cluster algebra elements. But first, let me just say a few words about cluster algebras. So, the idea is that this is a subring of the field of rational functions, and we have a distinguished set of generators called the cluster variables. And to get all of the cluster variables, All of the cluster variables, usually we start with n initial cluster variables plus some information and then use these to compute all cluster variables iteratively. And I want to focus on cluster algebras, which can be modeled by surfaces. And in fact, I will focus on the ones functor disk and the annulus. So here's a punctured polygon. And here's an annulus with two marked points on one boundary and one mark point on the other boundary. And when I say an arc, I mean an internal curve between mark points. And a triangulation is a maximal collection of non-curves. Maximal collection of non-crossing arcs. For example, this is a triangulation in the one-sponsored disk, and here's also a triangulation in the annulus. I can perform a flip for a triangulation. So, what I do is I take a quadrillion. A quadrilateral, and I can remove the diagonal in the quadrilateral and replace that with the unique diagonal that is different, that is in the same quadrilateral. So, in this example, let's say, so this is a quadrilateral, and I can remove And I can remove this arc here and replace that with the unique arc that stays in the same quadrilateral. So I get this new triangulation. In the example with the annulus, this is a quadrilateral. And to do a flip, I can remove this arc and remove it with replace it with the Replace it with the unique arc that is in the same quadrilateral. So I get this loop here. And this is my new triangulation. So to construct all of the cluster variables, I start with this initial cluster. So you can think of it as weights on the arcs. And then you do these foot. And then you do these flips, also called mutation. So here I'm doing a mutation at this arc, but I can also do a mutation at the other two. So when I do a mutation, I get a new cluster. So I keep the weight of the other two weights the same, but I replace this weight with Replace this weight with a new weight, which I didn't mention, but it is follows this Ptolemy rule, which you can read from just looking at the quadrilateral. So we repeat this mutation process and produce all of the clusters. So, for example, I can start here. I mutated at two to get a new cluster. To get a new cluster, and from here I can mutate also in the other two directions, and I can follow all of the possible paths and get all of the clusters. So the cluster variables would be the elements of the clusters and the union of all of these ways to get the clusters. And so And so when you're doing all of these mutations, the expressions that you get do get pretty large and complicated. So it's clear that you always get rational functions, but it's very surprising that it turns out that you always get a Laurent polynomial, meaning a polynomial over a monomial. Monomial and also you have non-negative coefficients. So as you do more and more mutations, you always get a Laurent polynomial in the initial clusters with positive coefficients. So, the idea of the infinite freeze of cluster algebra elements. Cluster algebra elements is that for cluster algebras from surfaces, these arcs correspond to cluster variables. We can also take what's called generalized arcs, where now self-crossing is allowed. And these correspond to cluster algebra elements, which are Laurent polynomials with positive coefficients, even though they're no longer just. They're no longer just the cluster variables. So these elements corresponding to the general arcs between the same boundary of an annulus or a punctured disk form an infinite freeze. So here is an example. I let's see. So I Let's see. So I divide this into level where the first level consists of arcs which don't have any self-crossing. And then in the next level, so in level two, I will have arcs which cross itself once. And then in the next level, I'll have arcs which cross itself two times. And so this is a corollary of this. Of this more difficult fact that the self-intersecting arcs correspond to elements of cluster algebras using this Skine relation, where whenever you see a crossing, you can remove that crossing and replace that with these other, the sum of these curves. And here's an example of how you might resolve it. How you might resolve a crossing. When the variables are specialized to one, we again recover the integer infinite freeze pattern. So for example, here, these arcs correspond to cluster variables and they correspond to this entry one. And we can also specialize to not just integers, but non-zero numbers, and that would give us non-zero entries if we were to do that. And these were the levels that I mentioned where I divide different elements depending on. Elements depending on how often a curve crosses itself. So here is an example of an infinite freeze pattern. This one comes from a punctured pentagon. And each level has five rows. So you might notice that as you go. As you go down, the entries do get larger. So now I want to talk about how they are growing. So first, notice how as I'm jumping between levels, here, when I take the difference, this is always. The difference, this is always a jump of three across this row. And as I'm jumping from this level to this level, I'm jumping by seven across the row. And the same here, the difference is always 18. So this is something that holds in general. general so this this jump is is actually some something that satisfies these normalized chebyshev polynomials where it's defined using this recurrence so so now let me talk about what what that means in cluster algebra so these So, these elements that are called the bracelets correspond to important elements in the cluster algebra. So, certain products of the cluster variables and the bracelets form a nice basis of the cluster algebra called the bracelets basis and the elements corresponding to the Elements corresponding to the bracelets are known to satisfy the normalized Chebyshev polynomials as well. So, this is the same TK that I wrote over here. And so, in the freeze of Laurent polynomials, this jump between the levels just correspond to the bracelet and Bracelet, and depending on what level you're on, it corresponds to how many times your bracelet is crossing itself. And so this number that's an integer is just the number of terms in the Laurent expansion for the bracelet. So the punctured disk case is a simpler case where this growth factor is. Case where this growth factor is always two. So you can check as we go down, we always have this jump that's here. The jump is two, two, two, and so on. And that's because in the punctured disk, every bracelet corresponds to the integer two, regardless of how often the bracelet crosses itself. So, now I want to talk about a symmetry that happens in the infinite freeze. In the classical Quinn Ray-Oxiser freeze, we know that the freeze is invariant under a glide reflection. A glide reflection is where you do a translation and then you do a Reflection with respect to a horizontal mirror. So, here, this triangle here is the same as this triangle, but translated and flipped. And one combinatorial reason or a pictural reason why that should hold is because in the polygon, As in a polygon, if we have these two edges that have orientation, even though the orientation are different, they are really the same thing topologically. But in the punctured dis or the annulus, when I go from this vertex eye. This vertex i to j, or if I go from j to i, they will give me two different arcs. So in the infinite phrase, you don't have the same glide reflection, but we define here what's called a complement symmetry. And the definition is basically we say that two We say that two arcs are complementary if they have the same endpoints and they cross themselves the same number of times, but they'll have different orientation. All right, so here are some pictures where this gray triangle has arcs that are complementary. Have arcs that are complementary to the curves in this yellow triangle. So they're not the same, but the arcs are called complementary. So one way that we can apply this concept is to do the following. So here I have an infinite freeze from a postured disk. Infinite freeds from a pointer disk. And it is known that this has what's called an arithmetic progression. So if I just take any diagonal in the freeze, for example, this one, and I look at the jumps between levels. So here, this jump is This jump is always three. So, this is true for any diagonal. So, for example, if I take maybe this one, this jump is always 12. Let's say this diagonal, I can track that. Can check that when I'm going from 5 to 14 to 23, my jump is always the same. And so this could be explained by the fact that this jump is just the sum of the two complementary arcs from the top level. So there's a more general formula, and it's written here, but basically this explains the relationship between the rest of the entries of the freeze using the entries at the top level and also the bracelets. And I want to close with just mentioning two recent papers on infinite freezes. So the first one is doing infinite freezes on the annulus, but seeing how the like one freeze on one boundary of the annulus connects with the other boundary of the annulus. And then the And then the other one is instead of looking at triangulations, look at dissections and see how, like, what kind of infinite freeze you can get. And then before I end, I want to mention, so for people who like Tableau, during the informal discussion today, I would be interested in getting feedback about an And getting feedback about another project. So, this was a recent RU project on boxball system and RSK, which will be presented during the Friday poster session. So, feel free to stop by so I can tell you about that and ask for your feedback if you like Tableau. And thank you very much for your attention. All right. Well, let's thank Emily. Okay. Okay, and are there any questions? I have a question for Emily. Is there anything like a paths model or a matchings model that gives combinatorial significance to the entries in these infinite freeze patterns? Yes, it is the same. So I believe that was something that your REU students back like in the early 2000s. So this will just be like the snake rough model. But yeah, so one way is to just think about the snake graph model or the other way is to think about this. So this BCI topple is like an older work where you count the number of ways to match triangles. Ways to match triangles. And then I think so later on, like during Jim's REU in like early 2000, some of the students did a connection between these matching to like paths. They're now called T paths. So for the infinite freeze, instead of being on the poly. Instead of being on the polygon, you just stay on the punctured disc or the annulus. And here is a picture where I just make a cover of the punctured disc, but I'm really just doing the same T-pads or matching or like thinking of it as a snake graph formula. All right. All right. I have a quick question as well. So, behind the finite freezes, there's some sort of type A stuff going on. For the infinite freezes, and I'm sorry if you said this and I missed it. Is this like an affine type A or a loop group sort of thing going on? Yes, so D, let's say. What is it? So in So in well not quite, but for so one way to think about this is for like fine A, the things that are at the top level correspond to just some of the cluster variables. And then the rest of them, yeah, so the rest of them correspond to cluster algebra elements, and then the same thing for Then the same thing for the type D. So you don't quite get all of the cluster variables this way. All right. Thank you. Any more questions? Maybe I have a comment. This is François Berjeon. There's lots of similar notions considered by physicists under the name of T-systems. And so, and they consider So, and they consider generalization where rather than just the SL2 condition that the matrix has small matrix 2 pi 2 as determinant 1, they consider larger k by k or k plus 1 by k plus 1. And there's a Laurent phenomenon also in that instance, but it doesn't seem to be covered by cluster algebra. Cluster algebra. So maybe this is an interesting direction to look at. And by the way, infinite freezes were considered a long time ago. That's a notion that goes back at least to Cordes and Roselle in 1972. So if you want to know more about lots of background about this, there's a very nice survey paper by Maurier Jenou. I'm going to put in the chat the references. The chat references so that you can look it up. Do you and Christoph Rottenhauer have a paper on this? Yeah, yeah, we have a paper on this. But the Maurice Genou has made a very great job of looking at all that's been done on this. So that paper that I just put in the archive is a good place to get started to learn about all the things that are about this. I will add that. I will add that, all of this to my slides. Okay, well, thank you, Francois, and let's thank Emily again. All right. So now I believe Jessica will be making breakout rooms, and we can stay around for informal discussions. The speakers will each be in a room, and you'll be able to ask further questions or just hang out. Questions or just hang out? Should I keep saying things? I'll open them. So recall, you have to
