I'm a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of SIAM and IMS. So, thank you for giving a talk here. We are happy to have you. Please go ahead. Thank you. I'd like to thank for the invitation. This looks like a very exciting washoff, and it's great to be part of it. So, today I want to be. It so today I want to report some very recent work that I have just posted to archive preprint about two weeks ago. But I will also like to review some of my older work with Wo Luo and my current PhD student, Jiajie Chen, and my former student, Del Huang. Yeah, he just graduated last year. Okay, so for this audience, I don't need to say too much about. This audience, I don't need to say too much about the background. So, we are concerned, we are concerned with the 3D incompressible oiler on our stow equation, so given by this equation. So, this equation is known to be difficult, especially in 3D, because if you look at the vorticity, it has produced a water extraction term, which has a formal quadratic non-linearity. But because the Biosaurus law related to vorticity through the so-called Rich transform. A so-called Reeds transform. So, gradient U is a Reed transform of zero degree. So, a gradient U can be bounded from above and below by vorticity in the L P node, like P from greater than one less than infinity. So, formally, it is a quadratic nonlinearity. So, it is a supercritical non-linearity for 3D navigation. So, so far, the global existence for 3D Navy Store is only known for small data, in small data in this sense. In this sense, this product should be small or in LP greater than three. So there's various kinds of non-broad criteria. The most well-known one are due to Prodi and Surrey and that impose condition on the velocity field in LPLQ with PQ satisfied this inequality. The critical case PQ3 is most interesting. It's only proved by Veradamir and collaborator in 2003. And there was a very well-known possible galactic result due to Kappa-Valley-Cohn neuron. The result you took the valley coherence in 82. This is a simplified proof by Fran Kua Lin saying that for any suitable weak solution of 3D Nausil, and the one-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the associated singularity itself must be zero. So in the case of 3D as a symmetric Nausil equation, that imply any singularity, potential singularity of 3D as a symmetric Nausil must lie on the symmetry axis R equals zero. X is R equals zero. So there's also some very interesting result for the SSMs reading LSDO about the lower bound of the blow-up rate for the velocity field. So due to these two groups in 2007, so they proved very interesting result that if the velocity field can be bounded from above by this rate with some potential block time capital T, C could be arbitrarily large. And with additional assumption that U for R. U for R large can be bound by C over R, and there's no volume. And there's also a very interesting result by Terry Tao in 2014, where he constructed a symmetric average bilinear operator, mimick the erection turn, the transport turn of the Nauso, have a similar kind of property, at least in terms of Fourier space. And the average Nauso, if you show that there exists a divergent. Show that there exists a divergent-free initial condition u0 such that the average Darmis equation can develop finite time similarity. So, for the 3D Euler equation, there's been also a number of theoretical study, the most well-known one due to Buk-Kaddle-Maida. So, if the Euler equation blows up at finite time capital T, then the vorticity had to blow up, more will have to blow up in this fashion. So, it has not integrable the maximum vorticity. So, my early work was inspired by the work of Peter. Work was inspired by the work of Peter Constantine, Charlie Pfefferman, and Andy Bider, where they indicated the vorticity direction, the unit vector, if you factor out the amplitude of vorticity. If the vorticity vector has some regularity in this sense, in the noble local order one neighborhood of the maximum vorticity, you have this control on top of the assume the velocity field remains bounded, then there's a no problem. So if you So with Deng Jian and Jen Deng and my former student Sing Mui Yu in 2005, we use we adopt an Lagrangian approach and get a more localized version. So we can allow by following a small segment of what is filament, what is what is filament, if the velocity along this vortex filament, the maximum norm in this small segment, the arc length of the segment allowed to collapse. The arc length of the assignment allows to collapse to zero at the secondary time. If this is integrable in time, and plus the replace this or the one-region regularity of the vorticity vector by this curvature control along this filament, then you can also exclude both. And there's some very exciting results 2019 due to Terry El Guindi, where he showed that for a family of a C alpha or T C initial data with very small alpha. Small alpha, the 3DS symmetric oil equation can develop a finite time singularity. For initial data, have no swoop. So that is quite surprising because we know for smooth initial data with no swole and there's no water stretching, then this should not blow up. Okay, so at the same time, there's many effort by people looking for a potential oil singularity by numerical computation. There's a long list, there's a partial list of various attacks. List of various attempts. In particular, the work by Bacher, he presents some evidence that two and a parallel water tube could develop a finite time similarity. And then with Rowley in 2006, we kind of pretty much repeat the computation using this almost the same initial data, but without an extra filter that he used. We observe only double exponential growth. We do not see the finite time similarity. This looks like a lot of cancellation going on. Of cancellation going on, as indicated by this kind of result, this kind of geometric regularity. There's a lot of cancellation competition going on between erection and water stretching term. So this is what I would like to say. For the 3D oil equation, there's also a Lagrangian description. So if you think about define the capital X alpha T as the flow map, right? The Lagrangian flow map start from T equals zero at alpha and then transport it by the velocity. Alpha and then transported by the velocity field. And then the maximum vorticity along the characteristic will be amplified by the Jacobian of the format times the initial data. But the Jacobian has to be divergent, determined, has to be equal to one due to the volume-preserving property, incompressibility. So there's a lot of constraint about how the nature of the blow-up. It turns out very often it has to be flattening with a lot of stretching or flattening. It's very hard. Fattening, it's very hard to have an isentropic collapse like the compressible case. So, in 2014, so my former postdoc, Go Law, and I, we reported a new class of possible fine-time singularity. So, the singularity occur, this is for 3D as a symmetric Euler equation in the cylindrical cylinder, periodic in Z direction. So, the singularity occurs at the boundary. So, we impose the osteometry for the vortex. Osymmetry for the vorticity and angular velocity, and then the uh so they form the ring at argument one zero zero. So the ring collapses into zero in finite time and invited all the previous blow-up criteria because these vectors had taken a sudden turn. It's not smooth at all. So we basically solved this 3D as is symmetric Euler equation in this transform variable introducing u1 equals u theta divided by the u. introducing u1 equals u theta divided by r, omega 1 equals omega theta divided by r. So this is the angular velocity, angular vorticity, angular stream function. And then we only apply the last smooth swap initially to U1 and set the other two velocity field to be zero. And we use a highly adaptive mesh to solve this problem. You can see that at some finite time, so the absolute absolute value of this vector developed like a delta function. Developed like a delta function singularity at argument one, which is at the boundary zero zero. It is in the physical R and Z plane. If you zoom in using our transform coordinate rho and eta, that is where we perform our computation. You can see that you can zoom in the singularity, you get a very nice self-similar looking profile. Very well resolved, the singularity. So by using this very effective, also very special tensor product kind of adaptive mesh. kind of adaptive mesh where we construct the analytic map the map analytically every some from some every some time step you can achieve a very large local resolution effective local resolution of this order you need this kind of resolution to really pin down the the potential uh blow-up rate and cell symbol structure so this is the the the least square fit in the very late stage of the computation of the maximum morticity as a function of time See as a function of time, we can get a very good fit. So, this is the dot is the data, and the other solid line is the fit. And you can see that we're using two different methods to do the fitting for the exponent, the singularity time and the constant, and they converge as you increase the resolution. And the exponent is about 2.45, agreed to three-digit, and the third digit, the fourth digit, I only also agree. The fourth digit I only also agree almost, yeah, six change six to seven. So that certainly violated the Bukaddermeyer condition. So inspired by this computation, there's a number of very interesting theoretical development since 2014. In particular, Sasha and Vladimir approved a long-standing open question. For the 2D Euler equation, we know there's no finite time singularity, but theoretically, the analysis indicated radio voltistic and Indicated radio voltisticity can grow double expansion fast in time, but it has never been showed that this bound could be tight. So they use a similar kind of setting initial boundary condition with osymmetry. They prove rigorously that it can be attained. It's a double exponential growth rate can be attained. And also in that paper with Paulo, we propose a one-dimensional model, we call it the so-called HL model, along the boundary, the argument one. Along the boundary, the argument one. So, with this group of people, so we prove vigorously using an energy functional analysis kind of argument that there was a finite time similarity. And the symmetry condition, everything is very crucial to derive the desirable property for the kernel, for the reduced kernel, a lot of cancellation going on. And also in 2016, Sasha Sasha, Yenya, Yao Yao, and Slato, that they prove that actually for a family of solutions ranging from slightly more similar than 2D Euler to all the way to SQG kind of similarity, but for water's patch type of initial data, but the patch touch the boundary. Again, they need the presence of the boundary. They can prove there's a finite time blow-up for this family of model. I mentioned Algines with. I mentioned Al Guindis result earlier. So, with my research group, we also attempt to see if we can come up with some kind of analytic understanding of this computation that did with Go Law. Can we really prove for smooth initial data satisfy the symmetry condition that they really develop finite time single? Moreover, we observe it looks like a cell signal. Asynthons, the cell signal blow up. Can this be justified rigorously? So, that has been very challenging. has been very challenging challenging so we we've we uh because the singularity occur at argo one which is away from the argo zero so the 2d axisymmetric oil equation has the same scaling as 2d business equation right so maybe if you make this change available u1 squared equals theta is like the temperature or density omega 1 equal to vorticity omega so if you assume that the 3d Euler blow up in self-similar fashion and then you can make this ends up you substitute into the equation you find that this actually Substitute into the equation, you find that this extra term becomes asymptotically small. So, actually, in some sense, they are indeed scaling, they have the same scaling as the 2D Business equation. If you let U1 theta equal to U1 squared, so this right size is homogeneous, right? But distance are symptomic small, so that basically has the same scaling. So, it makes sense to also study to the Business equation, which has a slightly easier, simpler Biosomal law. So, we adopt this so-called So we adopt this so-called dynamic scaling formulation that I first learned from George Papanikola when I was a professor at Quran in 1987. So they developed a very effective computational method to study, blow up a linear Schwinger equation, especially in the critical case, critical non-linearity. So by introducing a stretching variable, Cl, the three parameter here, this is in the case of a 2D Busnet, and there's a damping variable. This for the theta, you also introduce a damping variable. This for the theta, you also introduce a damping variable. So, the stretching variable is so that you instead of a focusing block, you're trying to stretch so they have an order one support, and then you introduce a damping coefficient in omega and theta so that the amplitude remains finite. But you need to impose some condition for these three scaling parameters so that it's completely equivalent to the original physical equation. So, this is a constraint. So, the purpose is that by The purpose is that by we scale the space and time as t goes to infinity, you a finite time single that becomes a steady state of the dynamic scaling equation. So then if you have a non-trivial steady state, that means the original physical equation converts to a self-similar profile. So by making this additional introduce additional scaling variable, we call capital C theta, capital C omega, that defined through the little C theta, C omega, and so on, you can show that by C omega and so on. You can show that by using this, by scaling the space and time and the amplitude, the time is given by this rescaling is completely equivalent to the dynamic rescaling equation, completely equivalent to original, to the Buzzner's equation. Moreover, you can show that as long as this scaling prime, the C omega converges to a constant, which is strictly negative. And then that will show that we scale time, maybe we scale from the physical. Maybe if we scale from the physical scaling time back to the physical space, that will become a finite time. So, if you can show somehow that the dynamics scaling equation converts to a non-true steady state, but with the scaling prime that's C omega negative, meaning they have to damp the block, become a finite entity profile, then you will have a finite time similarity in the physical space. So there was also a lot of developments by a technique so-called motivation technique. By a technique, so-called modulation techniques, so by PDE people. So it becomes a very powerful analytical tool. So we want to adapt this kind of framework to develop a computer-assisted proof. Sometimes you need computer, but computer only assists only in the very minor, in some verified, some constant. So they get a very sharp bump. But most of the analysis we rely on. Analysis, we rely on weighted functional analysis, weighted softness analysis. So, let me briefly outline the strategy. So, you need to put things in this case, we have a vorticity and we have a density. These are two evolution equations. You can write it as a couples dynamical system. Of course, it is not local because velocity is unlocal. I have a quadratic non-linearity. So, we like to solve the dynamic scale equation to approximate steady state. We don't know whether or not there exists an exact steady state, which is very hard to prove without any regular. Which is very hard to prove without any regularity. It's the Euler equation we're talking about. But numerically, because we observe very robust grow-up, and numerically, we can solve the dynamic visceral equation to approximate steady state with a very small residual, very accurate profile. So that is our starting point. We have a U-bar as a proximate steady state. You can interpolate the whole space using a basis function with a very small residual, for example, 10 to the minus A or 10 to the minus 10. You can make it decimal. And then you would like to consult an exact solution. A exact solution of the dynamic scaling equation by construct a perturbation, a correction to the possible steady state. So the way you substitute this into the equation, there's no error, right? So you can derive an equation for the perturbation, u tilde. You get a linearized term, because we know that it's the u bar, and then there's a quadratic term because the vectors only have water stretching only have quadratic linearity. And then this is the residue. So a lot of work is going to prove the linear. So, a lot of work is going to prove the linearized stability that you have some damping effect when you formulate in the dynamic scale equation, and then you can control the non-linear term. The linear term is easier because the perturbation is small. The U tilde does be a fourth epsilon, right? In the appropriate norm. So, that is the key part. You need to construct some weighted kind of H1 norm or some sub norm. So, they have some kind of damping effect, meaning the U part is stable in some sense. In some sense, you have no unstable eigenmode, meaning that no eigen mode has a real positive viewpoint. Okay, so if you can show that there's some positive lambda so that you have linear stability for the linearized operator, dropping a non-linear term, dropping an error term, right? That's the first thing you need to do. It's the most difficult part. So once you have that, you can formally write this perturbation using the Hammond principle, right? And then you have to construct the norm so that you have non-linear stability, typically a rate H1. Linear stability, typically a radio H1 norm would be sufficient. Sometimes you need to use a higher sub-lip norm. So you can, then you can close it, right? So then you can control the perturbation dynamically because now you have damping for the linearized operator. So as long as the initial perturbation is small enough, bounded by some energy ball, capital A, A typically is of the same order as epsilon, has to satisfy this inequality, then you can show that this perturbation can never get out of this energy ball. It's stuck there forever. And that is sufficient. And that is sufficient to prove there's a finite time singularity because you have an antiguous steady state to start with, right? And then you can show that this guy remains small. So that all the energy nodes dominate by the approximate steady state that we constructed, either analytically or numerically. So that is the whole philosophy of our proof. Using this idea, we have been successful to prove a few intermediate results. So we just published a paper in CPAM. Paper in CPAM we published quite a few results. In particular, I want to highlight the result for the deck for the 1D degree Gloria model in the whole line. So it's not, it has not, it is an open question whether or not it can develop a finite time singularity is globally smooth. So for the de Geguori model on the circle, a periodic condition, people tend to believe it should be a global existence, right? The existence. In fact, there's some very nice results by Hao and Vladimir, and also my student Judgy Chen just recently proved some very nice results for the periodic case. But in this paper, we show that you can construct a class of initial data, we have compact support, symphony initial data, but on the whole line, but developed for expanding, asymptotically expanding cell simulable. And we for Judge Judge Chen. And with Judge Chan, we also proved that for the 2D Business and 3D isosymmetric oil equation, inspired by the work of Terry L. Guindi, but if the initial velocity fields in C1 alpha be with alpha very small, we can show this a compact support initial data with finite energy that develops asymptotically self-similar block in finite time. And very recently, we just posted a archive preprint with Jajie and Delfuang that for the one the HL model, although with model although with uh with sasha and valadami and yao yao and and choi and and go low we we proved using functional analysis id method that the hl model blow up in finite time but it does not say too much about the nature of the blow up any analysis seems to be difficult to generalize the 3d or 2d boosting equation so we made an attempt to test this idea using dynamic scaling in the 1d system case so we are able to follow the strategy i just outline here The strategy I just outlined here that you can actually prove this a finite time cell similar to blow up with the exponent extremely close to the one that we observe in 3D, like a two-point, the CR will collapse like a 2.993 or 996. Yeah, it's surprisingly the Vundi model is surprisingly good in capturing the behavior of the 3D Euler equation. Okay, so the remaining time, I would like to focus on this two preprint that I just posted. Preprint that I just post on the archive a couple of weeks ago, less than a couple of weeks ago. So, this is so the result I talked about earlier before law is very essential this thing land occur on the boundary, one. So, by now people, we all realize that the present of the boundary played a very essential role to have a sustainable and stable law for this reading oil equation. Although we have not been able to prove vigorously yet, but various models simplify going in the direction. Going in that direction show that they very critically rely on the present of the boundary. So since then, we try very hard to see: is it possible to have a singularity at argular one in the interior? Because that's its only place. Now we still can have a potential block, right? For the, I mentioned the capabilities connumble result. So, but it turns out to be extremely hard because anything, any initial data that look like they have a potential chance in growth tend to be Chancing growth tends to be unstable, meaning that it find a way to escape. It's not sustainable blow-up. So, very recently, I give a lot of try, and also in my previous paper posted in February with Delphuang, we construct a family of a two-scale trouting weight initial solution that seems to develop a singularity argument at the origin. But that's not exactly for Euler. For Euler, it becomes very unstable. It develops free scale, not only. It develops three-scale, not only two-scale. If you put constant scales in our equation, because it's a two-scale nature, it does not blow up. The mortisity, maximum mortisity only increased by a factor of two, less than factor of two. It's kind of disappointing. So we have to apply a degenerate viscosity, that the variable coefficient degenerate the origin like the R squared plus Z square, so that it just gives the right amount of stabilization, keep the 50 instability stable, but not destroy the potential signal. But not destroy the potential singularity of the Euler equation. So this is a very delicate balance, right? But after that, after we post that paper, so I say that, well, that's not completely satisfactory. So is it possible to have a broad scenario without using a degenerate viscosity? Because that's not the physical, right? Yet artificially inject control how the viscosity should degenerate, should decay at the origin to manufacturing. To manufacture a single element. So, after a lot of trial and error, so we come up with this very simple initial condition. So, for the condition, initial condition that Delphi and I construct is very sophisticated, but based on a lot of numerical try and try to fit the initial data, analytic initial data that agree with our numerical constructive initial data. So, that's not very clear, but ENO has a very special construction vorticity and velocity. It has to construct in a certain manner so that the two. Instruction in a certain manner so that the two-scale scenario is stable, sustainable. It's a lot of careful design to manufacture that kind of initial data. But this one is relatively simple. It's a tensor product initial data. Periodic in Z is basically assigned 2π periodic. But you have to normalize, you have to break the off-simmy, the even symmetry along a Z to the pi of 1 over 4. It's an off-function with respect to Z, but you cannot. function with respect to z by you cannot without this denominator it will not blow okay it completely very differently and this power 18 is very important too it turns out that the in the one that i constructed therefore we basically have a one here we also have the one minus r squared which one is you want to vanish at r to one want to push focus the singularity at r to zero turns out that that gets that's how you get the two scale and also generate a tail instability so i have to play a lot to get the wide To play a lot to get the y combination so that you can r and z at the same comparable scale, not to try to prevent the formation of a two-scale. So, it turns out that this one worked very well. So, this is the initial data for U1 to show you the picture is not completely not complete. It's half of the period from zero to Z from zero to one half, right? And it's all extension for Z negative, but you can see it's biased towards zero zero, right? And a very fast decay. Right, and a very fast decay towards the boundary, right? That's why this is a one minus r squared to the 18 that is very very important just to prevent the detailed instability that we observe in the two-scale scenario and omega one is just zero. So we use the same setting that I before the earlier with the Golo, right? And similar setting, we basically use the same kind of numerical method, right? A second order method. A second-order method discretization in space, run the CUDA in time and an adaptive time step, and you can sort a two-adaptive mesh map analytically, and then you solve the transform equation in the low and eta plane. So the solution remains smooth for all time in the transformed domain. Okay, so this is for the, let me show you the 3D Euler equation first. So this is the evolution of U1, the angular velocity field device. The angular velocity field divided by R, omega one, the vorticity divided by R, and the three times snapshot. Okay, you can see that the entity has been scaled. Also, there is a pole, the X, Y, R, and Z has been scaled. You can see it has developed, travel towards the origin and develop a very thin structure. If you take this, the vortex looks like a thin structure and grow and approaching to the origin. This is the cross-section of UI. This is the cross-section of U1. You can see it more clearly, develop a sharp front along the radial direction. This is the origin, propagate in this direction. And this is the Z direction, also produce a one-dimensional traveling wave towards z equals zero. But the flow developed by hyperbolic flow near this symmetry axis. So actually the radio, the exit direction, the flow, the direction we push, trying to push away from the origin from zero, zero. So it because the, I will show you later on that. Because I will show you later on, because the strong alignment, so that some of the linear alignment that overcomes the abrasion, pushing the flow away from zero to zero, so that you have a blowout at the origin. So for the special kind of initial data, we construct, so initially the maximum ally on R to zero, alley on the symmetry axis, you want maximum. We denote R, capital R, and Z, capital Z is the position where U1 achieves the maximum globally. So at the beginning, Globally, so at the beginning of the early, very early time, because the way we construct the initial data, maximum lie on the symmetry axis and travel downward, and then after some time, and then you go horizontally outward and then turn around and then approaching the origin. So, at the early stage, when you travel downward, the alignment between U1 and Percy 1, so you can see the equation, the right-hand side have a two percent ones of Z times U1. That's the water stretching term. So, you can see the percentance of Z initially at least. The perceived of z initially is negative initially. Omega one is negative, this is zero. Perceivance of z initially is zero. But everything, the velocity is induced by the swap, last wall. But at the beginning, it's not in the right direction. You can perceive z is negative. So you actually u1 actually decreasing initially. So the alignment is negative, going down. And then when it begins to come out and then beginning to turn it around, and then especially when you turn back, turn this back to approaching the origin. Is back to approaching the origin, then the alignment becomes strong, becomes positive alignment, right? But then it experienced a phase transition. And then because the front become very sharp, front, and then the alignment drop. There's a drop. This is the late stage. But then it stabilizes at the very late stage, then turning back. So we also try to monitor whether or not this initial data with a two-scale structure like the one I did computed with Der Huang. So we monitor the rate. So we want the ratio between R and Z. So at the beginning, R goes zero. So if the ratio goes zero, and then when it goes out, in the beginning, the increase looks like it wants to increase, look like going in the two-scale structure, and then it drops. So it doesn't, the ratio remain kind of bounded to some extent. So then we can monitor the maximum growth U1 and omega 1 and the maximum rotistity, right? And you can see that, and also make sure this can see the rapid growth. And then the double log makes sure that this dot doesn't only. The double log makes sure that this dot doesn't only grow double exponentially in time. So we take a double log of u1, omega1, and then maximum vorticity as a function of time. You can see certainly grow faster than double exponentials. And this is also a look like a tornado type of single, very similar to the one that Delphan and I computed. So if we started with these streamlines, we did straight lines down a position that very close to kind of lower towards the Lower towards the lower end, but starting with very far in our direction, and then it gets sucked into the symmetry, then you travel towards the symmetry axis and rotate around, and then they travel up and they're coming down. We're going like a circle like this. If you train another initial data, it's going a little bit lower, the z zero direction will be lower, and then they're going going a circle like this, up and down, up and down, like this. And when you get very close to the And when you get very close to the singularity, the symmetry axis, right? This is the position of the maximum U1 in R direction and Z direction. When you get very close to the symmetry axis, very close to the maximum location of U1, you can see that the solution just goes straight up. The streamline just goes straight up, like no spinning because the velocity field, the angular velocity field is very small near the symmetry axis. Small near the symmetry axis. But when you go with a bit lower, but not very close to the scale of time, then you just have a periodic circular motion. That's very important because it keeps the whole bulk of the mass of U1 that not being transported away from the symmetry axis. This is the most destabilizing effect. The reason many previous attempts failed because the hyperbolic flow tend to push the flow upward, right? It's a downward and then upward. It's downward and then upward. But because they have this circular convective flow structure, so the flow gets kept in this circular region without being sucked away or transported away. So then you have enough mass so that as the solution gets larger and larger, you get stronger and stronger velocity fuel that push towards the origin. So because the U1 is a false function, it also induces a false function or omega 1. Off functional omega one, although omega one set to zero initially, but dynamically it becomes generated off functional omega one. So that that generates a dipole structure. So this is the so-called hyperbolic flow, right? There's a other part for z negative. And because it's a you can consider as a symmetric flow, you can extend it as an even function as a function r, you can see this, you can imagine this hyperbolic flow structure around r goes zero and z e goes zero, right? So this is the dipole structure, very important. It generates Dipole structure is very important, it generates an active velocity field, right? First of all, the flow gets pushed very close to the z go zero, and then the negative flow radial velocity field will push towards the origin. And the flow also trying to push away from the z go zero, to try to not let the maximum velocity, maximum U1 approach into the origin. But because this strong alignment and in alignment, that's stronger than the upward aggression. So that the maximum. So, that the maximum keep approaching to the origin. That is the most crucial consideration when we construct the initial data. Because most of the initial data we try in the late stage, it cannot overcome. The linear vertical stretch is not strong enough to compete with the upward transport, and everything in the late stage gets pushed upward and will not be sustainable. So, this is a lot of view in UI and UZ is a counter. You can see that the unlike the You can see that the unlike there's a very strong shear here. So the blue one is the velocity pushing downward. So the maximum velocity, the U1 will travel from far away and then get pushed very close to zero, zero. But there's a very strong positive velocity push upward. This upward transport. This red dot is the location of the maximum location of U1. Okay, so there's the Z transport, we push down and that suddenly it turns. We push down and then suddenly turn and push up. And the radial direction, this one push towards the symmetry axis, and then over here we push back. So that's why there's a circle. This is a circular flow. This is the one that keeps the flow stay here, not being transported. So we want to make sure that our solution, our matches can strong, is good enough to resolve the potential singularity. Lotus in the R. Potential singularity: notice in the R and Z physical plane, you can see develop a potential singularity, a point singularity, and the origin in physical space. And this is the transport, the solution respectively transform variable rho and data. This is where we use a uniform match to solve this video oil equation. You can see it's very smooth throughout the computation. You have to, from time to time, update the map so that they make sure that we can still resolve. Sure, that we can still resort, follow the support of the singularity. So, this is the U1, it's a three, the top view, and this is the background, the mesh. You can see that the mesh concentrate near the region where you have the most singular solution for U1 and then we got one. And we monitor the ratio between maximum TC versus the initial maximum TCS counting of time. You can see that by this time it was increased by more than 5,000. And we also monitor whether or not the built And we also monitor whether or not the built heteromita condition is satisfied. So we just integrated this quantity. You can see there's also very rapid growth. And so this is the Nanina Nyron. You can see that, right? So this is what it was talking about. The perceived of Z. So the Nanini was especially in the two percent of Z multiplied by U1, right? So the Z cross section, you can see it is monosomally decreasing, right? The largest with the maximum at zero zero. So that tend to pull up. So that tends to pull up the U1 near 0, 0. So that generates, and also when you go away from the 0, 0, there's a sudden decreasing here and even become negative. So the back, the tail gets pushed down, right? And the front get lift up. So that's the mechanism generating one dimensional traveling wave towards zero, zero in the Z direction. In the R direction, it's the same. So this is the place our initial data, my initial data is different from the one that I did before. From the one that I did with Delhuan for the 2D children weight, two-scale children weight solution. This remains relatively flat. In fact, in the early stages, it's also monotonously decreasing. So this is very special. That's why we keep lift this part for U1. But for R near zero, they lift up, have a very large growth also. For the one with the Derve, the two-scale traveling way, this has a compact support. It's a very sharp drop and then becomes zero. becomes zero so so so that that's why it has two scale i don't want to have two scale here otherwise that that that will not now silver cannot blow up so this is this significant this is a very important difference and also you can see the percent sub z suddenly drop beyond this maximum position and become negative again they push this down and push this up that's why it's only one-dimensional turn away towards the the origin so i have done a careful resolution study to make sure done the careful resolution study to make sure that the u1 omega1 plus psi1 the energy everything converge like second order so this is i only show you one one representative is the maximum morticity the maximum normal function of time you can see as you increase the resolution and then you the the error decrease you also get better than second order conversion so that at least you get second order conversion as you find a match you can even get the looks like a better than fourth order conversion then we do various fitting to see Virus fitting to see what is the potential block, right? And you can see that the maximum TC blob are like a like one over T, right? So it seems like a very good fitting, except near the end, I will come back to this later. There's a mild two-scale structure developed, like a logarithm, right? So there's some kind of deviation towards the end. So this is a maximum velocity square. You can see the maximum velocity basically. see the maximum loss field basically draw like a one one square it's one square root t u one omega one if you do a cell similar scaling variable analysis u1 is part of the mortisive vector so so it's just also blow up scaling like one over capital t minus t and plus i one like so basically the mortar structure in term for u1 is the quadratic nonlinearity because of the alignment i mentioned earlier because it's quadratic nonlinearity here so we have to blow out like a one-to-one We have to blow out like a one-to-one capital T minus T. So that is self-consistent. And also, we want to make sure that it's either two scale or one scale. What is the collapse of the rate of Z? That is the most important thing. So the Z square, you can see that the scale like almost like linear, except near the end of the computation. It's a mild two-scale structure. So this is very different from the one that I did with Denhuang for two-scale, because in that case, the Z-scale linear. So Z scale like the capital D minor G, not the So z scale like the captain minus not the square root. The square root is the one pushed for the narrow stove, it's compatible with the narrow stove scaling. And we also want to check the three-dimensional at the two, is it really a cell singular blow-up? So we look at the cont of U1 at three different time snapshot, and then we do this dynamic scaling variable center at the center of the triangle, the maximum location of U1, and the Z is the small length scale, capital Z. So you introduce this change variable. So, you introduce this change variable, you can see that in terms of the dynamic scaling variable, it's almost static, right? The solution has not really changed. And the same thing for the vorticity. This is the physical space, you can see this change, they travel towards the origin, but eventually in terms of dynamic scaling variable, almost like it does not change much. In the cross-section, you can see more clearly, this U1 cross-section as a function of R. This is the physical space. When you scale it using the dynamic scaling variable, especially last two times, it almost does not change. It almost does not change. It looks like a collapse to a cell similar profile. In the R direction, the top row, the bottom is the Z direction. You can see the similar behavior. We also want to ask how sensitive is this initial data. Do we have to use this exact initial data or is it stable if you put a small perturbation? So then I put a small perturbation, the first one about 0.1% perturbation to this original initial data, but I make it more oscillatory and decay slowly. Slowly, as a functional R. And the second case is that I have a 1% larger perturbation that even lower, make the decay rate even slower as a function of R, and make it even more oscillatory in Z direction. And the last one is I don't add any perturbation. I simply change this omission initial data. Sine 2 pi Z to 4 pi Z. I do not add anything else. So all the other case, the omega 1 capital P0 initial. The omega when it caps to be zero initially because initially the original data omega is zero, so you cannot make large perturbation. So, but this one turns out to be this would be order one perturbation. This turns out to be give you completely different behavior, give you two-scale structure. But the first two case, with a relatively small initial perturbation, it does not change. It does not really matter much. So, these are the R cross section of U1. And when you scale them together, you can see they almost collapse on. You can see they almost collapse on top of each other. In the Z cross-section, very similar. So, look like for small perturbations, like 0.1% or 1%, it doesn't really matter. You keep the same. The self-similar profile seems to be stable. But when you take an order and change, change sine 2 pi z to sine 4 pi z, right? Everything else is the same. You got completely different behavior. You get this two-scale structure of the traveling way. The Z, capital Z now scale like a capital T minus T, like exactly like the one that I Like exactly like the one that I computed with Der Huang in February and in that previous paper. And the profile does not converge, give a completely different profile. So it's sensitive to the initial data in some set, but if you're not sensitive, you make a very small perturbation. So how you can solve the initial data actually matter. So then we come to the Naval Stowe equation and say, well, given that the 3D Euler equation seems to develop a single cell similar, as I'm telling the cell similar block. As I'm telling the self-similar block, and the origin that is scaling compatible with the Nausso equation, why don't we try to see whether or not Naus2 may develop singularity, right? But it turns out that how you choose a viscosity is very important. At the beginning, I thought that, well, large viscosity may tend to kill the oil singularity. Why don't I keep the viscosity very small, like 10 to the minus seven, 10 to the minus 5? It turns out that, no, you see turbulent flow, that the potential oil singularity, the steerage instability trigger very, many, many scale. trigger very many many scale scale the small scale development dynamically so you get that you don't get a stable profile so the oil equation the sheer instability lead to turbulence right you cannot you don't see you see some trends in growth but then very quickly it's not sustainable you cannot resolve it either because it's not the focusing block my my adaptive metric will not be effective in that case so then it turns out that you you take a relative large initial large concept Large initial constant viscosity, but only for up to a certain time for the initial phase. Then you have to increase by a factor of 10 after this. By this time, the maximum morticity increased by about 500, a factor of 500. And then you make even larger viscosity. Turns out larger viscosity enhanced the non-linear alignment stretching and produce a very long stable phase of non-linear alignment. So, this is the dynamic evolution of U1. U1 at three times. This is the by this time, the maximum vorticity already increased by a factor of 10 to the power four, 10 to the power five, 10 to the power six. This is the vorticity. Okay, it's a very rapid increase, travel towards the origin. So this is the position of the maximum U1. We label as capital Z, capital R. We can now, with the viscosity, regulatory, you can compare much closer to the origin. And this is the Naninian alignment between U1 and P7 sub Z. So in the Euler equation, you can see that. Of C, so in the oil equation, you get to see the sudden drop, right? A very sharp drop. But here, you get a very mild draw and then stabilize. This early stage and the late stage, so the Nanina alignment always stays pretty strong. And the two-scale structure, only towards the very end, it's a very mild growth, pretty much stay around 3.5 throughout the computation. So essentially, it's one scale structure. So again, we monitor it back from U1 growth, but some week one and one. Muslim weak one and axomorticity, a very rapid growth, like study growth, and then take a double lock. Again, you see that clearly more than linear. This is the time that we, when we switch to the viscosity from 10 to the minus 4 to 10 to the minus 3, you see surprisingly similar structure of the 3D oil. It's preserved. It's amazing. Even using such a large viscosity, you have the same kind of tornadoes singularity or streamline structure and this is circular flow that kept. Structure and this is circular flow that kept kept in this region and this dipole structure at this two times by this time 10 what is it row 10 to the power of four by this time 10 to the power of five 10 to the power of six and this is the the velocity field in the u r direction u z direction has you keep the similar structure but except that the origin has a very sharp layer here for the Euler now you can recognize but it was also and this is the the the box of the UY And this is the box of the U1 plot in the physical space, right? You can see this clearly like a delta function block at the origin. This is in the transform space where you do the computation row and data, you can see very smooth spread out solution. And this is the U1 in the top view. This is the mesh behind it. This U omega 1. And this is the most interesting thing. We want to see how much vorticity amplifies relative to the initial vorticity, not vorticity, right? So by this. From the TC, right? So by the time you add the computation, you already increased by 10 to the power 7. I had never seen such a rapid growth observed for the narrow stove with such a large viscosity. If you also try to see if the Bu catomiter conditions satisfy for such a rapid growth what you see, it looks like it seems like a blow, right? Turns out the only chancing growth, very rapid chancing, it does not block in that time. So this is an alignment between U1 and the U So, this is the alignment between U1 the perceived of Z. So, I mentioned earlier, it has a similar kind of structure, right? It generates one-dimensional traveling weight, so versus the zero, zero and argument, relative to flat. This is the signature of our new initial data. So, this is why I talk about relative flat and long La Nina alignment when you add the strong viscosity, right? This early stage and late stage. And this is how the trajectory code, you can get very close, look at the 10 to the minus 3, very close to the origin. 10 to the minus 3, very close to the origin. And this is the ratio between R and Z. You see, most of the time, stay low, and then towards the end, it's just a sharp turn, but still, in terms of the value increase, it's relatively small, right? It's around 3.5. Again, we did a resolution study, right? So vorticity, methane vorticity, and the conversion, and so on. So the scaling, very similar, except that. Being very similar, except that Doctorable Tc looks like they have a lot correction in the good direction, both fast and the capital minus T, and Ross View have very similar scaling. So on the surface, look like it's satisfied by view catamide condition, but we may tempt it to conclude that now is still may also block, but that turns out not the case. But u1 omega1 also, u1 and plus 1 sub z again have the same kind of one over capital T minus C block. And the z direction, right? Look at how fast the small scale collapse in time. So, in early time, you can see clearly it is a square root capital T minus T, the same kind of scaling that we observe for Euler equation from Aristotle. But you can see the quality of fitting degenerated a bit toward the end. So, we zoom in the late stage, you can see there's a minor lock correction. And this is the one that somehow destroyed the blob because if you have this kind of collapsion, you're widely the scaling. You wipe the scaling of the Nazi equation, then the viscous term eventually becomes dominate. So, let me also show quickly that you can see the same kind of similar scaling distance physical space, that the dynamic scaling variable is for omega 1. You can see the same kind of cell similar structure that we observe with the 2D Euler, and you take a cross-section very similar. The pressure we also monitor because for my cell patient, if you blow up, it has pressure to go to minus infinity. Again, you see. Infinity, again, you see a very strong negative pressure row. If you're trying to fit how much, how fast it goes to infinity, the minus p, it looks like a linear in time. So everything pointed to the possibility that it may blow up. So we also tested this stability to the initial data, the three initial data I showed you earlier. Again, you had a very strong stability for small initial data. Somehow you avoid draw-up itself. So, how does it avoid? We check two quantities. One is the entropy, how far this L2 norm of grow in time. So, we also check the L3 infinity criteria by Ronomy and collaborator. So the ancestrophy is very interesting because it's a very rapid growth. Even if you try to integrate the fourth power of the L2 norm as functional time, Power of the L2 norm is functional time, it looks like you have a very rapid growth. But if you try to zoom in the late stage by plot against this scale time, you can see that it saturate. It does not block infinite time. So you have to take extremely careful enough resolution and zoom in, not jump to the conclusion too early. And if you look at this L3 normal for velocity field, you experience some mild transit growth and then it drops. Is it dropped? Of course, the L3 normal velocity may be very small, but that does not explain why we have this relative chance in growth because it's L3 normal and broad criteria is based on compactness argument. It does not give you a direct, the concept is very hard to control how large. Yeah, so my time is up. So I let me tell you one more thing. I also checked again another criteria by Zhenlei and Xi Jang. So they test the maximum, the total circulation, how fast it can grow as r goes to zero. They say that if you can have some mild decay, like log to the minus two power, then you cannot work for the SSY matrix 3D oil, a 3D nine stone. So you can actually, it can be modern to this constant, right? In fact, you have a very rapid transit row and then it drops. But interestingly, if you raise this power from two to four, looks like it has not dropped. like uh it has not dropped has not saturated yet right so you can see that kind of uh looks like in the borderline case it does not blow up but kind of close to to to to blow up to to to to to blow up so we to explain why it can escape the blow up of my equation we constantly dossi is that the if you look at the alignment the competition between water stretching and diffusion term because as i mentioned earlier that the z developed a myer lock correction towards the end you can see that the competition water stretching Can see that the computation water structure remains strong throughout the computation, but the diffusion term was gaining stronger. We compute the ratio between the water structure versus the diffusion term at the position you want to achieve the maximum. You can see that it keeps going down and then going down. It's a downward trend. So that is the one that eventually leads to a number of. So my time running now, so maybe I will skip the last part. So we show that actually, if you apply the eviscer, the solution dependent. The solution-dependent viscosity, but slowly decaying in time, slowly decaying in a sense, it's like a log capital T minus T to minus three through the fitting. We find that then you can see the competition between water stretching and the diffusion turn. The diffusion then, because you multiply this slowly decaying viscosity, time-dependent viscosity, because of the multiply Z square. If capital Z square, scale like a linear. Z square scale like a linear in time for exact cells blow up from Austin, then this should be all the one, there's no decay because the log correction of the Z Z like a square root capital T minus Z divided by log minus two third. So that gives you a very mild correction. So this to add here, I'll show you how fast this time-dependent viscosity decay in time by fitting against this log per se of Z. So that both for the constant viscosity and Both for the constant viscosity and the decaying viscosity, you see that the G, the decaying viscosity factor decays like a cubic power of this factor. But since percent of Z go to zero like a capital T minus T, so that G of T is kind of slowly vanishing like this. So this seems to show that I will not show the rest of the computation because then you can see with this decay we started the mortisity mass mortisity grow huge amount. Grow huge amount 10 to the power 9, 10 to the power 10. You can keep going as long as you have enough resolution. And almost all the structure, the property I show you for Euler and Arsenal equation, completely preserved by this decaying scale. Okay, so you can see the same kind of behavior. I'm quickly going through. It's kind of boring if I show you everything. But just so basically, I show you that, well, for some very simple, but Some are very simple, but especially this design initial data to treat the Euler equation as a symmetric Euler seems to develop a singularity at the origin in the self-singular fashion. And we also try the Nausen equation with relatively large viscosity, constant viscosity. And that can lead to very chancing, rapid chancing growth. We have maximum roticity relative to the initial data, more than 10 to the power seven. Actually, it should be 10 to the power 6. Actually, 10 to the power 7, I think. Yeah. I think. Yeah. Yeah. It disagrees with 10 to the power of 7. Then we apply, because the solution developed my two-scale structures and I still actually just avoid development singularity. So by applying a slowly decaying time-dependent viscosity, rough delta disorder looks like that could keep the balance between water stretching and diffusion term. That seems to develop finite time singularity. But one very interesting thing we observe is that with a quantum viscosity, quantum is gaussy and the the the the the diffusion turn for the through circulation have an extra transport effect transport turn convection turn it produce so this transport turn if you move it to the right left hand side it will push the solution away from rg0 to away from r0 but r the capital gamma vanish like a quadratic like r squared at r go zero so this this diffusion term basically trying to counter the radial transport term is have an active transport Transport term, which have a negative transport, push the solution towards the Argo zero. But if this caused term, in addition to vehicle as a shock flame, we also have a side effect that trying to push the closest regulation gamma away from R0. So remember, I mentioned the work by Lei and Zhang that if this guy remain bounded, meaning that gamma has some decay at R0, then it cannot blow up for SSMHC. So this one somehow is a One somehow is a destabilizing effect. So I'm thinking maybe if you try to get rid of the isymmetric constraint, close to the initial data we constructed, maybe there's a better chance for the non-esisymmetric now still may have a chance to blow up. That's something we would like to further investigate in the future. With that, I stopped. Sorry for running over time. Thank you. Thank you. So, any questions? I see Anna. No, but I do have a question. Hey, Tom. So this issue with the viscosity growing and then you have to take them decaying is very interesting. Decaying is very interesting. Do you have any indication of what might happen if you put boundaries? Because I'm thinking that boundary generates vorticity, right? Even at very small viscosity. And so that might be that perhaps one can does not need to take this viscosity, you know, decaying or maybe you can take them decaying slower, I mean, faster. I mean, faster. That's a very interesting suggestion. Why now we use office, right, to generate a sharp front near zero, zero, but you said to put the boundary at zero, zero, right? Well, I mean, yeah, if you can, but even if it's not at zero, zero, you know, you might, I mean, the vorticated boundary away from that, you know, may, I mean, not in the access in matter case, but if you can do a perturbation of it. Perturbation of it. I see, I see. Yeah, right now we have a boundary at R1, but that has no impact too far to the R0. Yeah. Okay. Right. So we have a no-slip, no flow boundary. Okay, I'm sorry. Okay. But okay, so maybe if you put it, yeah, but yeah, then it means you have to put it really close to the singularity. Then you cannot move it. Yeah, right. That doesn't work. In fact, we try to make sure that the single. We try to make sure that the signal is not generated due to the effect of boundaries. That's the whole point. Okay. I come this is a very excellent talk. Thank you for this very interesting talk.
