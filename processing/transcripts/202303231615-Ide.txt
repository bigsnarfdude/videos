So so this is the schedule for today. So eventually we'll get here, summary. So not the 20 minutes, but I'd like to give 10 minutes talk so that I can convince you that how the Lagrangian data assimilation, of course, and data assimilation can help numerical weather prediction side. And then we'll go to the summary session and geophysical. Session and geophysical data she only have one person, so you can ask a question to him, and then we move on to the last part of the assembly session. Yeah, we'll do that together. Yeah, but we'll finish the first part and then we can do it together too. And then we'll go to the end. So that's the plan. Okay, so where is that? So really I just try to raise money. Thank you. So, so Kimberly, I want to give a visual presentation. I won't go into detail. So, once I get my So, once again, I'd like to convince you first of all that wind data is really missing in numerical without prediction. So, we did some experiment assuming wind data that NOAA is not using at the moment. And then I tell you beyond that, how does it relate to the referendum generator assumption? So, that's cool. So, it's really known that the numerical prediction we have improved a lot last year. We have improved a lot last few decades or so. But the one observation really missing is that the wind. We just don't have the wind anymore. So I worked with NORA and this team to investigate how important is it to have the wind. If we have wind data, how much can it be improved? And the European Satellite Agency, ESA, has launched a kind of experimental satellite to observe wind. Observer win. So ECMW has been assimilating this data, French is, and then the German is, but the US hasn't done it yet. So this is a kind of a first result of assuming those data. So this is showing you this particular satellite. You can see that how much data we have a day. And then I'm just going to give you nearly the visual. So we assimilated it. We assimilated it. And then red is the direct assimilation. We didn't do too much. And then green is the one that we tweaked a little here and there, like observation, the covariance that you saw the triangles this afternoon. So we are doing that. And then, so this is the baseline without assuming wind. Anything above is better than baseline. So you see that if we tweak, it really has a great positive impact. Great positive impact. So it's really clear that the wind data is missing. I'm going to just show you the. This is the precipitation. So you can think of it as just a tracer field. So something like this, your tracer field is moving with the wind. So if you have a wind field, obviously you can improve your chemical data simulation. Right? And then I'm saying that if we have, you can improve chemical data simulation, we can. To the creator simulation, we can implement the methodological mimic adaptation. So that's the goal. Once again, I'm just showing you that green is good, right? So it's improving. Let me also show you something interesting. Remember that the Chinese spy balloon? So it's not only China who does it. Google did it too. And it's not a spy balloon, but the Google has lots of balloons over there. The parents over there trying to give the internet connection to those areas that didn't have internet connection. So we thought they also provide the wind data. So if we have those WIN data, how much impact it can make? So these are the areas that Google was particularly interested in. So if we do that, oh, before we go there, we get a high app. It's really missing. So if you compare Yeah, um it's this is Stratosvia This is Isin Gabriel This is Noah So if they are really good, it's gonna be diagonal, right? The fact that it has a broad range, especially in this region, is that the even it should be rough or no cannot predict wind well. Wind well. So once again, this is showing that the wind data is really missing. So how important it is that wind data is. And then I'm just showing that everything, everything you see green as a blue, that by assimilating those balloon data, we improve the numerical weather prediction. Right. So that's that. So I hope I convinced you that the wind data is very important at the moment for the numerical. That at the moment for the numerical weather production. So, the next question is: about librarian gender designation. So, from here, I'm going to be using a toy model. So, what I'm going to show you is the ocean in this case. So, this is kind of ocean, right? And then I'm going to show you the actual trajectory, but I'll give it there. So, the question is, suppose I'm just seeing these trajectories. Just seeing these trajectories. Question is: Can I actually recover the author state? Again, these are the branch I'm trying to do. And so what I'm doing is I'm using the toy model, causal geoscopy model, and see what happens. Right. And I'm going to use D for drifters, F for the field. And then idea is very simple. The idea is very simple. So I have a model. This is shadow, like QG model, or shadow order. So I have a velocity and height. And then this is my observation. For us to be able to do data assimilation, I need to be able to observe photography or the individuality in the model. That makes sense, right? If otherwise I don't have observed forward or vector, I need to be... I need to be able to compare my observation in my model. So, what we do is that we actually augment this drift equation. So, my drift line is moving with the, in this case, current. So, if we do that, this is the augmented system. There's a correlation between my field, say current, and the digital position. It's correlated. It's correlated here, this correlation. And then, if I, when I observe the drift affision, this correlation is going to put the information back to the field. So, by treating the field, the portion model in this case, and Lagrangian motion, I'm I'm I was I'm able to uh recover other input that drift the information back to the field. The information back to the field. So it's just a coupled system representation. That's all I'm doing. So for you, you can think of it: this is a chemical system, this is my meteorological field, we couple together, and then we'll be able to use a correlation to recover the information. So that information will go this way, forget about information comes back for the identified. So I'm going to just show you that if we Just to show you the presentation. So, this is my control. So, I have an eddy, and you're gonna see these eddies start moving. And then I have a six drift dance, four drift dance, two drift dance, starting from totally different initial conditions. So, the question is, can I get this eddy in these systems? And you see that this is 246, right? It's very small. And obviously, if I cannot recover it. And then obviously if I cannot recover it, I'm not showing it. So it must be I must be able to do it. See how quickly I can recover the AD? Oh, it's still working, but the fact that there is a coherent structure giving you this spiral motion made me able to, you know, really recover that flow view. So having this structure is a good thing. Structure is a good thing. So if you see the coherent structure in your chemical field, that's a good thing. And I'm also going to show you one more thing. So this is, suppose that I have a velocity here, not the drift up. So we did the Alzheimer's gamma filter. So I'm just showing you a 0.3 colour members. So this is the velocity. If I have labulation data, you see how. You see how big the correlation wedge is? And then it's really giving me the coherent structure. So, this is how Laguranchan information is very useful to recover the flow view. And then I'm just going to show you the animation. So, the green is the correlation point three by the anti-Lagrange data. The small little one there is if you observe it as a velocity. So the fact that it's moving with the coherent structure gives me more information to the flow of. Alright, so I hope I convinced you that the Lapidian data solution is a good thing. And then maybe, you know, hopefully we can work together to improve both credit systems. So that's my conclusion. Thank you very much. Alright, um, so with that, we go to the geophysical. Unless you have any questions, we go to the geophysical field data simulation section. For the summary. Any question? Any discussion? Yeah? Just a comment on this. I think that's exactly. Comment on this. I think that's exactly what we did for atmospheric using high-speed. We have the 3D particle is similar to your drifters. Yeah, so I think it would be great. I mean, of course with high speed, you cannot do the observing system design. But for those who can actually do the observing system design in terms of whether it is sensitive. Whether it is sensitive kind of thing, it will actually improve if you can improve some sensitive observation. Yeah, and then maybe we can do that focus sensitivity to observation impact that we do. Right now we don't have that capacity. But maybe JDA can provide you that. Eventually. Not right now. But yeah. You're nothing. Yeah, but I hope that I was able to convince you that the fact that it's cut for the system, not only that you can improve the chemical constituent, can also benefit from you too. Can we prove that to NOAA? Because then they would be more interested in doing chemical data simulation. And doing chemical data simulation, putting resources into it. I hope you can. And you, Anula. I was thinking you could. I guess I don't talk to your people. Happy to talk to your people. Absolutely. So I was just going to say, so when I was writing the second edition of the tech book, I missed this in the first one and thought, okay, it's just going to be a little bit into 3D bar until I actually started doing the research. And now that I'm ongoing, they've just made. Research and Malay Born doing data summation is his own chapter. But starting with your work originally moving up to Christine Penny's just published something you get when you get GKS using the branch and page simulation. Usha is more advanced using the different. As far as so GMAO assimilates my directory. GMAO assimilates minimum vectors, so what GMAO does, we assimilate minimum vectors, why doesn't NANSA? And maybe we can get together and then try to talk to Noah. I mean, we can talk to right? I mean, this is a kind of like connecting the mass community and science community to the operational system is one of the goal, right? Oh let's that was a little bit more. Can we scale in retrieve the motion vectors? That's actually another good point. So you have a field, right? And then you suppose you observe the field. There is a lot of mathematical things we can do to improve Lagrangian data surface, such as field alignment of the optical. Alignment of an optical flow, like atomic signals and vector people do. And then, if we can do that, rather than assimilating the wind vector, we can assimilate the image. Image assimilation. Any questions? Another comment I want to make is like a lot of wind information already being assimilated for the weather forecasting. By the full clustering. Not enough in terms of with respect to radiance assuming data that's massive. Wind data, I mean it's really missing. It's a well-known fact that we don't have the dynamical information, enough dynamic information, or dynamical prediction. Yeah, of course, there are a lot of missing parts, but when I saw the list of the List of the observations are simulated, they have a lot of wind information, but maybe do you mean like for the satellite? The satellite is, you know, like the wind record from satellite is just coming. A decadal survey, a few years ago, nearly identified that we need more data period. We need more data, Peter. Yes, yes, but. Wind data. Yeah. Yeah, right now I just mean like right now a lot of wind data are already assembled, but still. That's it. More questions? That's it. Yeah, thank you. So um geophysical. So geophysical. We have cold wine this time, cold beer, plus a bit of red wine as well. Okay, so we can get a discussion in the Twayi the other. Okay, okay. Thank you, Dijay. Well, he wrote wine, by the way. So let's thank Liza. So
