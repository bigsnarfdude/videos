Thanks for the introduction. Fortunately, there are still some audiences here. My talk is about the Chaparric problem for hypercalor varieties. At the start of the definition, we Definition. I think I'm the first talk that not working on the algebra close field. Let's pick the field contained in the complex number field. And we give the definition of the hypercalor variety over the such general field. A hypercolor variety is a smooth projected variety over K, such that its fundamental group in the Italian is trivial and is geometric. Geometric two global two form is the set of global two form is generated by a no way to generate two form on the on such field and the remark is that if if x is hypercalor in this sense then we then it's uh it's a uh it's better to the complex number field is a complex uh hypercalor variety in the classical things is the same. In the classical scenes, is the same. And for hypercalories, of known types, such as the citron type, LG6 and OG10, its deformation type is independent of the embedding of the K to the conjugate numbers. It's point to raise my questions. To raise my questions about the fineness of hypercalorial varieties over a number field, let K be a number field and we fix the embedding to the complex numbers. And let M be a set of hypercalorial varieties defined over K. The Shaparouge problems ask for the fineness of the following set, which say that we fix the deformation type of hypercalor varieties and we consider all the k-isomorphism class of hypercolors in. Class of hypercolors in the set of hypercolor type, and they need to satisfy the good reduction condition outside a finite place of the number field. Then we claim this set is a finite set for some set of hypercatal varieties. The start condition is, we will call it the Chavarich condition, which corresponded to the existence of the integral point. To the existence of integral points inside some general varieties. And the second remark is that we can replace the start condition by some weaker one. For example, you can consider the so-called the cohomological Chavari condition. I will explain the condition later. Let's record some history for the Chavarij problem. The Chavari raised the question not for higher dimensional variety. Of right it. And he just raised a question for curve. The classical Chaburge conjecture is for such set for fineness of such set. Let S be a finite place of the fixed number field. And we consider all the smooth proper curve over the field K with fixed general T. And it has the good reduction outside the final place of the number field. He claims this set is. claims this set is a finite set. It's proved by Fartins in 1983 for the proof of a model conjecture. And we were, it's a classical order geometry that the model conjecture is just a consequence of the Chaparric conjecture by the Kodiak Parisi construction, which constructs for any rational numbers on the given curve, and we can construct Curve and we can construct a finite degree or fixed degree verified exact as the rational point. And the map are also defined over the number field and with good reduction outside some finite place. And we can apply the Chaparrici conjecture for curve to deduce the conjecture for the fineness of rational points. And for the high-dimensional analog, For the high-dimensional analog, we have some guideline from some famous conjecture on the fineness of rational points on varieties. Still, we fix the number field k. We have Feynman's conjecture from due to Bobir and Lan, which say that if X is a smooth projective variety over K of general type, then its rational number, then its rational points are not. Do not form a RSC dense subset. Some remark is that we have more final conjecture on the fineness of rational points, which is called the Lang-Boeta conjectures, or something is the Lang-Boeta dictionary between the rational points and some geometric property, complex geometric property of the algebra. Property of the algebraic varieties, which about the hyperbolicity of is complex, the complex varieties is equivalent to the fineness of rational points. So we also have some stacked version for the long variety architecture. We can replace the project project varieties by some projected lump stack or Or other just a quotient stack to state the long version conjectures. Then we can deal with some varieties with quotient singularities, for example. Oh, let's start the example list. The first famous result for the high-demand analog Shavari conjecture is the Fardin's proof for the Chavari conjecture on the update bright. Conjecture on the available varieties of fixed dimension G with and there he generalize his results to the any availing varieties of fixed dimension G. Actually, the proof of model conjecture or the Chaparric conjectureful curve is from the Chaparric conjecture of bidding varieties by the Torredi theorem. And for hypercaler, just a start. For hypercalor, just a story start 30 years ago. Andrew proved that for hypercalor varieties with a beta number bigger than three of a given dimension with a very ample polarization of bounded degree, that we prove the Charbert problem. And Lawrence and Serving prove that any hypersurface in the fixed abelian varieties. Surface in the fixed abelian varieties, it also satisfies the Shabbat conjecture. And Shoyue and Takamatsu remove the polarized, the bonded polarized condition in the Android result for case surface. It said for any increased surface to satisfy the Chavari condition, this is a finite set. You don't need to require it has a bounded polarization. Bounded polarization. And Takamatsu also works on, works out the Chavari conjecture for on-rigged surface. And there are lots of many other results for the Chavari conjectures on the list here. So let's end the main part of my talk. It's about the Sharper reconjection for hypercolor varieties. We generalize some work. Are some work given by Andrew and Sher. Let M be a geometric type of hyperk varieties. Let K be a number field. S is a finite place of K. Then the joint work with Foulier, Lijua, Tepi Takamatsu, and myself show that if the beta number is bigger than four, then following Sharper reset is finite, which require the Sharp. Require the hypercalorizing deform, have a fixed geometric deformation type and with good reduction condition. This is our first main theory. Just to remind you, some history of the proof of Andry, he used the classical construction for hyperkaloriti and the K3 surface, which And the K3 surface, which is called the Kuka-sadaki instruction, which relates the hypercale variety with some abetting varieties of very high dimension. Let HKD be a fixed geometric connect component of the modular space of hypercale varieties of degree D and fix some complex number points on the modular space. Then a long form A theorem from the Ling Andui resolve Madaputsu Pera Bing and show that we have the following diagram from the hypercalor varieties, the modular space of hypercolor varieties with fixed point. The first one, the P, is a period map. And we have some, we have P had a period map to the Shimura variety of a second type. And on the Shimura side, we have a we have We have a we have some section from the Shimara variety of softened type to the to a Shimara variety of Hort type, which is given by the spin group of the given lattice. And the gamma is a morphism defined over a number field E, and the other period map and the junction map and the spin representation map are all defined over Q. Are all defined over Q. So we have a diagram defined over some number field. And strict speaking, you should, for some technical reason, you need to replace the modular hypercolor varieties with its double covering by temperature orientations. The diagram here is not exactly true. And the main idea of the proof is that if we idea of the proof is that if we fix a geometric component, then instead of the classical Sataki construction for hypercalor, we have some uniform grassataki construction, which is a morphism from the hypercalor varieties, a connect component of hypercaloritis to the abeddar varieties of genus D, for which the genus the genus of the abedian varieties is independent of the degree D. So for any degree hypercader, we have a Degree hypercaler, we have a map to a fixed target of the model space of our betting varieties, and it's also called the Zarhin's trick for hypercalor varieties, which transform some results for polarized hypercaler to unpolarized version. And the second key word is to is the fineness of Picard lattice. Of Picard lattice. With the uniform static, we can show that for the hypercalor varieties in the shabbaruti set, they have the with the same tacket in the in the modern space of bedding varieties, they have the same transit lattice. And for these reasons, you can see that the PCR lattice in the Shabarou G set is finite. said is finite it's also finite here we use a good reduction condition uh to uh we we we use a good reduction condition of the hyperkalo varieties to deduce the good reduction of the abetting varieties by the test good reduction uh criterion for abeting varieties and uh for the fineness of the of the image we use the fardin's finite theorem of abedian varieties on on in something In some sense. And the last technical point, we used some virational geometry of hypercarrier to deduce the finest result of isomorphism class. Just before the, just after the first three steps, we get the, we sometimes get the fineness of a bird class in the Java set. average set and we need the need some rational replacement to to to make the varieties be a much much better one. And we can apply the Karmato-Morizone conjecture for over non-closed field, which is worked out by my co-author Takamatsu and with the boundary And for the and with the boundary square of the exceptional classes of the MPM, MPM classes. Yeah, this is some keywords in our proof. It's something technical proof, but I attract some keywords here. The second part of my talk is about a weaker one of the shower rich set. Of the Chavarich set, which means which is called the cohomological Chavarich conjecture for hypercalabarities. It's said as follows. We notice that the good reduction condition can be replaced by some cohort multi-core condition, which means that we can require the if an hypercanovaritis has good ration outside S, then his cohomology are unramified as GALO modules, which means that. As Galois modules, which means that the inertial group outside the given finite place acts trivially on these groups, on these modules. And so we can replace the Shabbar rich condition by so-called core multiple Chaparric condition. And this is our second theorem. If M is given, if a known type hypercalebaris, for example, Hypercatal varieties, for example, the K3N type, genite, Kumar, OG6, and OT10, then the following common discovery set is finite, which requires X is a hypercatal variety defined K, which is a geometric deformation equivalent to the given deformation type. And all its homology groups are ramified outsides as modules. Then, Then, such set is a finite set. If you are confused with the co-module travel language condition, I can give some geometric description for this condition in the lower dimensional case. For example, Litke, Mathmoto, and Yang Yang proved the following theorem. For K3 surface, Zun the K3 surface at a prime big. At a prime bigger enough, then the unrampedness of this second co-modern group is equivalent to he it has a reduction without worse AD singularities. So such co-modern condition is equivalent to some geometric condition in the lower dimensional case. And more precisely for the core module sharp. more precisely for the core mode charity condition for different deformation type we have following different uh we can have following more precise requirements for the core multi core shaver condition for example for k2 surface due to takamo takama2 we can just require the h2 to be unramified not not the whole combo groups for qin type we can and ogc og10 we OG6 OG10, we can also require the H2 is just being unverified. For JNS Kumber OG6, the full condition is necessary. The reason is that for such cohomological average condition, it depends on whether the automotive group of X acts successfully on the uh expressly on the on the whole comoji groups and for some for some finite index set i and for generalized kumer and ot6 the automotive group of x the geometry point does not act fastfully on the h2 so we require it to uh require it for the whole cohort groups The second remark is that for by a recent result of Zhang Shen and Leunfei, for any hypercolor varieties in dimension four, the cohomology sharpened conjecture holds for the host, and which means that we need the whole coherence group are unrefined in terms of the other Gao module. And you can show that any hypercaler varieties in dimension four satisfied. Right is in dimension four sets by the cohortical Shabberg conjecture. And we have some recent progress on more geometric case, not just the arithmetic case, which is called the pointed Shabbaridge conjecture for hypercadder varieties. It's an improgress theorem due to Fourier, JLE, and Tagama. Julian and Tagomaswell and myself, which said that let X be an algebraic closed field in characteristic zero. For example, you can consider K to be your favorite C and C zero is a pointed curve over K, meaning that the zero is a fixed closed point on the curve. Then the following set is finite, which consider a smooth problem map from to a smooth proper map from to a smooth prop family of the hypercolor varieties over over the given given curve. And we also fix hypercolor varieties over K and we require the special fiber of the family to be the given hypercolor varieties. Then the Chaberjee set is a finite. We should remark that the X can be The X can be only an algebraic space because we don't require the family to be projective. It's just a proper family. And for polarized version, it means that F is a projective family, then it's just a consequence from the hypervelocity of the model stack of polarized hypercalevarieties. Yeah, the final part of my talk is some remarks and some future questions on this project. The first one is about the natural generalization of the core multi-sharing conjecture. If it holds for all hypercalor varieties, not just for the known types of hypercalor varieties, it's varieties is if it is sufficient to show auto xx on the cohomological ring or the just the direct sum of the cohomological groups H star X trivially the second question is about the relationship between the homological sharper condition to the geometric case. So for higher diagnostic Case so for higher dimensional hypercalebar varieties X, what does the common travel condition mean in geometric case as in the physical case? Another question is about the fineness of frame pipe partners over a non-closed field. For example, if you know the, if you can show the direct current spree. The direct current preserves deformation type of hypercaddo varieties over our field, then the cohomologic sharper condition will implies the fineness of a frame cut partner over K, because you can show the direct quantum preserve the Sharper condition. If X and Y are frame cut partners, then X satisfies the commercial Sharp condition implies Y satisfies the commercial Charbury condition. So all the frame partners of X lies in the Common Charge. Partner of X lies in the common charge reaction set. So the So if they also lies in Sam the deformation type, then you can apply our theorem to deduce the fineness of partners. I think this is the last question. My talk is here.
