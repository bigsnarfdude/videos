present a little bit on that and Amy and Maria already gave a very excellent introduction to some of the things that I want to talk about. Mostly when we think about evolution, we think about environmental variation, genetic variation, the interaction. And what I think about there is, yes, all of that is driven just by the survival and the production of individuals. So there's the demographic. So there's the demographic parts to it. But in addition, we see also this demographic stochasticity that has nothing to do necessarily with the environmental or the genetic variation. That is what I'm partly interested in because also this influences evolutionary dynamics and few people think about that, right? Maybe few people think about that. We look into clonal systems, so here isotope. System, so here isogenic bacteria in more or less an identical environment. Then we see that there is some asymmetry when bacteria is growing, builds here, divides, and then we basically have two cells. And these cells are not identical, they differ somewhat in their cytoplasm content, and so that creates some asymmetry. That creates some asymmetry, and this asymmetry again is not linked to genetics or the environment necessarily. We can also look at this same process under the aspect that when the individuals are dividing, there is a new cell wall built here. And it keeps the old cell wall and it caps a new cell wall that way. We have kind of an old pole and a new pole of the cell. Pole of the cell. And the question is: then, is there some asymmetry related to the small pole and new pole process? And often in terms of aging, we think about some damage that might be asymmetrically divided between these two cells. We can also simplify that as this is the model cell or the model. This is the mother cell or the mother lineage, and we have daughter cells that are coming off. And I use this term because I think it's a little bit easier to understand. This heterogeneity or asymmetry, I will evaluate using a general stress response RPOS. It regulates about 10% of all E. coli genes and it's And it has both householding functions. It's also general stress response, but it's also associated with the transition into stationary phase. So what we aim to do is quantify kind of like these molecular dynamics and link it to the demographic traits of the cells. And what we do there is using a microfluidic. Is using a microfluidic device. Here we see kind of a lab-only chip. So we have on a little cover slide, there's a PDMS chip, and now we are basically diving into this thing that's also called the model machine. But there's a huge amount of media flowing in, huge amount related to the amount of bacteria that is in there, and so it's. And so it's highly controlled with respect to the temperature, with respect to the violent media. And then we have our cells sitting here in these side channels and our focal cell is this cell that sits at the dead end of these channels. This is a face contrast view of it. This is with the RPS expression. And what you can see And what you can see, yes, cells are growing at different rates. Also, lineages seem to be growing at different rates. They divide at different sizes. And here we see as well there's differences in gene expression between these different lineages, and also we see kind of waves within the lineages. Again, this is all non-genetic. All non-genetic, non-environmental turbine. So, if we look into that, this is Audrey, she did most of the experiments here, all of the experiments here. So, this is a single cell across time. We see the up and down regulation of this RPS expression. RPS is also negatively correlated with growth rate. With growth rate or cell elongation rate. So, basically, we have high growth rates, we have low RPS expression. If we have high RPS expression, we have low growth or division. And both is related to division. So, basically, this has some meaning in terms of fitness reproduction. And the question is: how do these gene expression dynamics influence? These gene expression dynamics influence the demographic traits of the individuals and also the demographic dynamics. I don't need to give you much of the introduction to the structured population model, so that's kind of what we can do with this. So we have three age classes here. We have our fertilities, we have our survival probabilities. Amy gave a much better introduction than I can give. But what we can see, it's just like differential. It's just like differential equations, and we just rewrite them in a matrix form. And what I will show later on is like using more a classical differential equation approach and a matrix approach to tackle some questions. We can have the same thing in a structured population, and again, here is our matrix model where we have the protection matrix that is. Protection matrix that is composed of the fertility matrix and the transition, and all the nice properties that Amy already mentioned with population growth, sensitivities, generation time, structure and so forth. So not different than any differential equation, except that we don't want to write it down in the complexity immediately. Complexity in the so to think about this as a damage dynamic, so we just have some abstract damage that accumulates over time. Here is the initial mother with a given damage level, and it grows and it divides, it accumulates some damage, and at one point it dies. And this is work by Murat, who has done all the heavy lifting for the math. And so we basically have. And so we basically have the mother lineage, we have the damage production rate and some noise parameter around that. We have the damage partitioning when the mother and daughter are dividing. There are similar models that do not account mostly for this asymmetry here. Also, make some simplifying assumptions on the stochastic components of the system. Components of the system, so but it's it's definitely interesting to read quite a number of these models. So very interesting. So here we see single lineage realizations of these, of this, what we model, until they reach a critical level of damage and they eventually die. And the black and Black and red is just different properties of the accumulation noise and asymmetry parameters. So what we did is using a jump diffusion process, so basically we have here the accumulation, so the drift term, so the accumulation of damage, which is just exponential. We have some noise around that, so basically it's So, obviously, it's not such perfectly predictable, but that follows the trend. And we have this chump process. So, when cells are dividing, basically there is this asymmetry, and suddenly you have much more damage, or you basically keep the same damage as this asymmetry. And we focus on this model lineage, so we don't track the daughter lineages for this asymmetry, but For this asymmetry, but you can also do it similarly. And we have both a simulation approach to it and also analytical approach to it. We're interested in how do these molecular parameters basically scale then to the demographic tangent. The demographic, I mean, I mean, it's called different demographic distributions because often we see these distributions or we measure these distributions, and we would like to know how they come about and what drives them. So if we look into lifespan, then we can see here, for example, that it follows an inverse Gaussian distribution. So here we have the mean and the shape parameter of this inverse Gaussian that then describes our Then describes our distributions of our likelihood distributions. We can also look then here into probability density functions of the along basically the different lineages or that are shaped by the different lineages in the damage. Here, this is the mean, and this is. Is two times standard deviation. So we can see some lineages are basically not accumulating a lot of damage at the beginning, and then some they tip off until they die. Others are behaving quite differently. This is the comparison between the analytic approach and the simulation. So we were quite happy with them. And we can also then look here, for example, into some characteristics of this. So, here is different damage rates. So, this is damage accumulation at low or higher damage accumulation. This is the asymmetry. So, when the cells are dividing, we have damage noise level down here. And we can look at the mean of these lifespan characteristics: so, mean lifespan, the variance. So mean lifespan, the variance. You can look into the shape. So we can see we have lower damage accumulation rates. We are more often in a symmetric situation that the lifespan is more symmetric or more skewed when we have higher damage accumulation rates. We can also look here into dispersion where basically our kind of null expectation is everything. Expectation is everything is driven from some outside mortality, then it would look like it was unlike, and then we have under and over dispersion. So these are nice ways of linking, again, the underlying characteristics to some demographic features. We can also fit it to an actual model that actual data that is observed. So, basically, here's survival, mortality rates. Survival mortality rates, and compared to classical complex mechanism models, they really perform almost always much better and explain things better. There's also some interesting features that we have discovered that we were not aware of before, but I'm not going into much detail. So, now that was kind of the jump diffusion approach, classical differential equation. Differential equation. And if we now look into the matrix approach, so far we look into discrete variables, but there is this integral projection approach where you basically not have a size as a discrete value, you have it as a continuous variable, and then later on you actually discretize these functions and go back to And go back to more or less what applies here as well. And so the trick here is the same thing. You have a kernel here, and you have your probability vector. And in the kernel, you have your survival probability, you have your size transitions. So this is from size at time t to size at time t plus 1. And you consider as well the variance around these. And these are, as we And these are basically just logistic regressions that you fit. You have a probability of reproduce, and you have the number of offspring. In our case, this is just one, so that simplifies. And then you have the size distribution of the fruitroots or of the offspring. So this is when we have one variable, such as size. What we did is expand this to two variables, so we wanted to track at the So, we wanted to track at the same time our PRS and our size. And then it looks just by adding here, like instead of size, you just have the two variables. There's a little bit more complication behind it because you need to estimate the cograites and so forth, but in principle the approach is the same. The approach is the same. So, if we look here into this survival, so it depends on the length of the cell and the RPOS level, we see there's not much effect of the RPOS. This is the probability to divide, and then we have here, for example, the offspring distribution. So, here's the length of the mother something. Something plus something here. The axis here. So this is the length of the mother, and this is the RPS of the mother. And so then these are the offspring type that are produced. So we can take each mother that has this length and this RPS produces a distribution of offspring that looks like that. So again, Looks like that. So, again, with the length of the daughter and the RPS of the dot. We can also then look into the growth rate. And there, since in a regular approach, you would just say, well, okay, the mother is basically does not change its size, but for us, because the cell is divided. Is dividing from a large cell into two smaller cells, so then we basically separate out when the mother is dividing. We have this distribution, or when the what mother is only growing, then we have the other one, and then we just weigh these to how often do you divide, how often do you only grow. And that gives us basically the joint, close, and division weighted transitions here. Transitions here, and it looks like that these matrices are all or spares. So there's, in fact, it's just very small numbers largely, but obviously we can also assume that they're spares. And one of the problems then comes back to the question: how do we deal with such matrices? I can just do a brute force and just vectorize everything. vectorize everything and then multiply and do my whole spiel or I'm thinking about or we're thinking about nice ways of doing it. Tolja has suggested to do adaptive integration using Markov chains, other aspects, maybe what Noah mentioned or Julia, you might have some ideas how to deal efficiently with that. So this is With that. So this is just a way of reduce or dealing with sparse matrices. Again, we can then calculate all the things that Amy has mentioned. So basically, even though a lot of these processes look like stochastic, they're still basically influence as well the population dynamics. And we can either use this jump diffusion and what we're And what we're right now doing is expanding it as well to these other parameters like growth rates and so forth. And then here's the problem with these, how to deal with these large matrices, but again, it's very easy to do things. And nowadays, things are easy to do computationally. What I also think is a question that can be approached with that. Can be approached with this, other than understanding this asymmetry, this noise approaches is also how different distributions actually alter basically our evolutionary or our population dynamics and later on our evolutionary dynamics, an aspect that I think that has not been touched on so much. With that, I like to thank you and thank Muad for the modeling. For the modeling parts, Archery, for the experimental part, and Tolcho also for discussions and some other collaborators that are involved in the project and for the funding. Thanks so much. So, Olik, I really enjoyed this talk. Some of these. This talk, someone because a long time by the way, we've spent all this time thinking about senescence, and they always say that you know, senescence will evolve in anything where you have a difference between the parent and the offspring, but in binary cell division, there should never be a difference. And I think that this is really interesting. So have you thought about sort of how this formally ties to some of those older senescence models? Or is it just it doesn't really matter because you're you're actually measuring lifespan, which is could be well enough. No, like um we are thinking about senescence quite a bit. Like, and so here is a little bit like what is happening, for example, in terms of these processes. Yes, one thought like they were dividing symmetrically, but then again, we know older cells or these mother cells are growing slower than the daughter cells, so there's some way of rejuvenation. We also see within the cell. Also, see within the cell already that here, so this is after right after the division, this is the RPS. We see that there is this division already, and what we also see is that there's reduced RPS signal, and it's not just reduced RPS signal at the old pole, it's also other metabolic reduced signal. So, that this asymmetry within the cell then basically creates. Within the cell, then basically creates this symmetry among the cells, and it increases with increasing age. And there's quite a number of complexity behind that. There's also some confusing things because, yes, these mother cells are growing slower, and RPS is usually leading to higher RPS to slow growth. So we expected that they had higher RPS levels, but they don't, largely because of this area that is reduced. That is reduced. And also, what we found is like people thought, yes, bacteria just divide symmetrically. And what we see is with an increase of this age, potentially an increase of this non-active area, that mother cells are actually slightly larger. So we actually get an asymmetry even there. So people have not thought about that. But even beyond that, About that, but even beyond that, you can think about a lot of ways of asymmetry and how it influences aging. And this is something that we do as well, but I wanted to ask him about the checkout who's done a lot. So
