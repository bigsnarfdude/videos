And uh we could change this session. The first speaker is a Prento Pony Caspariana of the University of Japan. And the talker title is a Valentinian linear comparison of computational testimonies for the flow of these press points for processing. Thank you. I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me to be here today. I'm not a biologist, but I'm free. Please bear with me. Come from the solar mechanics side of the tracks, as you write. But anyway, my interest in these problems comes through my work on homogenization, which is reading average estimates for the average behavior of heterogeneous systems. Force media is a natural problem to A natural problem to investigate these kinds of tools. And I'll tell you a little bit about those tools, maybe not so familiar in this community. So I'll start with some background, right? So of course, Garson's law, there's a linear relation between the pressure gradient, which I call alpha, and the flow rate or the superficial velocity of the fluid through this. It through this heterogeneous poros medium. There was, at least in the homogenization community, was an explosion of results back in the 80s and 90s. And there's also very old work of interest in particle beds in particular. Particle beds in particular, and there's this formula. You can blade carton and cosenium that has this form. So this normalized viscosity that takes away the particle diameter, the length scale in the problem, has some complicated, just some complicated function, not so complicated, function of the porozin C. But the thing But the thing that we know, for example, when we study composites, right, is that the effective behavior is quite sensitive to the microstructure. It doesn't just depend on the only fraction of loss. It depends on the microstructure in possibly very sensitive ways. And so there are these results that go back to Pagner and collaborators, Brent Milton, where Where they obtain bounds for the permeability of this fluid, right? And the permeability of this fluid flow in terms of the porosity. Notice that this is still an isotropic distribution of connected pores, but it's made in a different way. Connected pores, but it's made in a different way. It's a random distribution of penetrable spheres. And you see that now you get something that has a log in it. This result, by the way, has an interesting property, and that is that it's exact in the limit when the porosity is almost 100%, or when the volume fraction of the rigid face is small. This recovers a limit that goes back to Stokes, which is this result here. This result here. The porous medium may be anisotropic, in which case, the permeability becomes a tensor, a second-order tensor. Here I'm going to look at this results for square distributions of aligned fibers of circular colour. Distributions of aligned fibers of circular cross-sections, one of the simplest geometries you can construct, that's periodic, and there's a permeability along the fibers and permeability transverse to the fibers. And people, as a result, going back to Hignon and Ford, 96, where they computed these permeabilities numerically as a function of the porosity. There are also asymptotic results for small concentrations of fibers. Again, square distribution. Again, square distributions, going back to Sangani and Akrivos, you see that in this case, the result is asymptotic for, again, for large porosities, right? And it has this, these are two-dimensional results, and it has this funny behavior that goes like the log of 1 minus the porosity divided by the porosity. So these results are quite different, especially when you go to the limits of high porosity and. When you go to the limits of high porosity and low porosity, people have tried to also, you know, numerical results are not, I mean, are fine, but sometimes you don't want to have to resolve every single velocity, and so people try to come up with interpolating formulae for these things, these formulae for this particular case of square hexagonal fibers that go back to part. Fibers that go back to Tamayo and Barangi. This is a plot of results for the permeability as a function of the porosity, hexagonal fibers, square fabric, and then BCK, 40. You can see that they're kind of different. But the picture is a little bit deceptive, right? Because this is log scale. Getta take that into account. Alright, so we're interested in yield stress fluids, in particular physical plastic fluids. I'm very interested in elastic effects, and I was very interested in the talks this morning, but we haven't gotten there yet. I think homogenization can be used to account for risk-elastic effects, and I'm excited about trying to look into that. To look into those problems. So Matt gave a very nice presentation this morning and he told us about these types of Yield stress fluid behaviors. I need to, because I'm going to be using variational formulations, I need to introduce some concepts here that may not be familiar to everyone. Everyone. So we assume the fluid is incompressible, right? So the stress can be decomposed into a pressure and this extra pubiotoric stress. We assume that the rheology of the fluid is isotropic, so it has a precipitation potential, a function of the strain rate, D, but depends only on the equivalent, the normal flow D, if you like. And so. And so, you know, so this is just a function of that quantity, and you can get the spreads by differentiating this potential with respect to D. And that gives you something that is linear in D, and it has a viscosity that depends on this equivalence strength rate. And this, in the solid mechanics community, people call this the secant viscosity. In the fluid mechanics, In the fluid mechanics community, I think some people call it the effective viscosity. But it's just, right, the derivative of feed, the potential, is divided by the equivalent stress all. An example, just to make things a little bit more concrete, is Herschel bulkly fluid. This is the form for phi. This is the form for the secant viscosity. And this includes these parameters, the yield stress, kappa. The yield stress, kappa, the consistency constant, and n is the power law index. You know, this includes various limits. Latn equals one, yield equals zero, kappa equals zero, you can get bingham, our law. Here we're going to be mostly interested in shear-they fluids, which correspond to a case where n is less than 1. We do the same thing for shear-thicking fluids, but then It but then the results change a bit. There's also a dual formulation. You can define the potential of the deviatoric stress and essentially through the Zeni transformation. And then you have a corresponding inverse relation, giving you the strain rate as a function of the stress involving one over this secant disc. And it can also be expressed in terms of the equivalent stress, one-half. Stress, one-half the manual tolerance. It's been interesting these viscoplastic liquids because of, of course, connection with oils. I'd like to tell you about some work that was done by Altharis and Pinder, 1987. He looked at various types of waxy oils, and these are plots of shooting. These are plots of shear stress as a function of the shear rate. We see that these are no Newtonian fluids because you need a finite shear stress to make this thing flow. Anyway, he modeled these oils with the HK Perschel-Botley model and making use of the experimental results, he came up with this formula here. Results, he came up with this formula here for the average pressure gradient as a function of the superficial velocity. Everything here, the down yield and kappa, the properties of the yield stress fluid, the n as well. But you see, it has this permeability that he estimates from the corresponding permeability for. The corresponding permeability for a Newtonian fluid. And what he used, sorry, this should be in Calcutta, what he used was the BCK formula because he was interested in these sandbags. He also found a good fit to his experimental results by putting in this constant here that he determined empirically. Based on numerical results, now for flow. Results now for flow through periodic media. We saw some results this morning, right, for yield stress fluids through periodic microstructures. McKinley and collaborators also proposed the result of this form in terms of the permeability of a corresponding Newtonian fluid. And the yeah, the thing that I'm going to get into some technical details next. Get into some technical details next. I don't know how much time I'll have to go through those, but our main result basically, as I said, is a variational formulation, and it gives you a bound on the homogenized dissipation potential for the flow of a yield stress fluid in terms of the homogenized dissipation potential for the flow of a Newtonian fluid through the same Morris medium. For the special case, For the special case of an HP fluid in an isotropic porous medium, we obtain this result. Alfaris and Pinder, they use dimensional analysis and try to fit something to some numerical results. We made no assumptions. This is something that comes out of, well, there's a mathematical assumption, but I'll talk about it in a minute. Assumption, but I'll talk about it in a minute, but it's basically the variational estimation of this dissipation potential that then leads to the differentiation to this non-linear relation between the average pressure and the superficial velocity. And it has this, this is a threshold pressure gradient. So nothing happens until alpha bar gets to this value. And you can see that, and this is. And you can see that, and this is the result that says that this average pressure gradient is a constant that depends, of course, on the yield stress of the fluid, and is given by the square root of the porosity divided by K tilde. K tilde depends on the porosity, through its microstructural dependence. So I you know Imagine gave me the result this morning for this round, but he wasn't able to tell me what he put into that formula for Kappa Tilde. But in order to get the result that he got, Kappa Tilde would have to be proportional to 1 minus the porosity. And none of the results that I showed earlier has that property. So I'd love to get the estimates for Kappa Tilda from your numerical results from Neutronian fluid and Plugium in here. Pronuncium through it and plug them in here and see what that gives. Because I think that would be a very interesting comparison. Unfortunately, I didn't have results of that type when I looked at these results. I had these empirical results by very old results and then results for periodic media, which are kind of special. Okay, so let me tell you a little bit about this variational formulation. It goes back to homogenization. It goes back to homogenization. I don't know how familiar you are with this notion of homogenization, but you do a two-scale analysis of the PDEs and you get an estimate for the effective permeability of the Newtonian fluid, flowing through some periodic distribution of obstacles, right? You can generalize this for random microstructures. So here's what we call an R DE, representative volume element, that has some microstructure that is maybe described in terms of the porosity, but also in terms of additional statistical measures like the pair correlation functions and things like that. Then, what you can do, then the problem you have to solve, right, is one where it's the usual equations: strain rate, velocity, mutation. This is the equilibrium equation in terms of the pressure, and the betaic stress and compressibility is assumed, right? And this is the considerative relation for this yield stress fluid. And then you have boundary condition, right? Boundary condition, right? As an interface to the solvent and material. It has been shown that you can estimate the macroscopic behavior by defining this macroscopic dissipation potential. This basically tells you as the fluid flows through the medium, how much energy is dissipating. It's a concept that is used, for example, Is used, for example, in Arabic models for suspensions controls. So you can also use it here. The thing is a little bit different is that the trial fields that you have to use have to satisfy some slightly strange boundary conditions. In particular, this condition on the average velocity, right? So the average velocity, triangle velocity field, has to satisfy the. Has to satisfy this relation. Be that as it may, well, you can also write it in terms of an integral over the whole volume, right, provided that you define the potential, the dissipation potential of the rigid phase to be zero. That changes a little bit the form of the admissibility conditions on the trial fields, but otherwise it's the same thing. Is the same thing, but taking a cue from results that go back to Hill and Mandel in the context of composites, you can generate the microscopic relation between the pressure gradient and the superficial velocity by differentiating this thing, which obviously depends on B bar, which is prescribed. Superficial velocity. So instead of trying to get directly Instead of trying to get directly what this relation is, we're going to try to estimate what the dissipation potential is. And by the way, there's a dual formulation, right, where you work with a complementary stress potential, right? This guy here. And it has also a similar form. There are some technicalities that were resolved by Ferryman and Milton, but And Milton, but you can, by making use of this dual potential, you can convert the pressure-gradient velocity equation. So when the fluid is Newtonian, this potential, I used L here for linear, has to be quadratic in the superficial velocity. And there's a constant, which is, if you fight to round the viscosity of the fluid, that constant is the perimeter. That constant is the permeability tensor, and you can check that if you differentiate this thing with respect to V-bar, you get a generalized Darcy's law where kappa tilde could be a tensor. We will also make use of this mobility tensor, which is what Kappa Tilda decided what we discussed. Alright, so as I said, we know a lot of results, we don't know everything. Results. We don't know everything, but we know a lot of results for Newtonian fluids. The flow of Newtonian fluids to the porous media. And there are these results of Alfaris and Pinder and McKinley that suggests that you should be able to use those estimates for the permeability to generate corresponding estimates for the Is nice for the nonlinear variability or mobility of these yield stress fluids. So, the idea, this goes back to something that we did some time back for viscoplastic composites, is to introduce a comparison medium. So, now we're talking about yield stress fluids, and I gave some examples of the potentials of these things, spatial potentials. Spatial potentials. I'm going to introduce a linear comparison medium with some viscosity that I don't know. So this is the dissipation for this isotropic Newtonian fluid. And I'm going to define this function v of that unknown viscosity. Basically, I look at the difference between these two things. Between these two things, if W1 is subquadratic, that corresponds to shear thinning behavior, then this function has a maximum and I solve for D, I plug it in, and I get a function of eta. Then I can show that the potential of the nonlinear fluid, of the yield stress fluid, can be recovered from the potential for the linear comparison fluid, the Newtonian fluid. Fluid, the Newtonian fluid, plus this function v over eta, if I optimize with respect to eta. The optimality conditions, by the way, the thing that solves this thing here is precisely the secant condition. And if you want to invert this thing, well, inversion is given by this relation in terms of the function. This should look like Like a Legendre transformation of sorts, and it is, but it's a Legendre transformation on a modified variable. The modified variable here is instead of the usual strain rate tensor, it would be this quantity squared. The nice thing about that result is that I can take it and plug it into the definition for W tilde. When I do that, I have a problem with two minima. With two minima. One minimum is the standard sort of minimum over the trial fields for the dissipation of this fluid flow problem. And the other one is this minimum over the comparison viscosity. Property of minima is that they can be interchanged. And if I do that, I generate I generate this estimate for the effective dissipation potential of the yield stress fluid in terms of the effective dissipation potential of this comparison Newtonian fluid, right? Which I know how to, presumably I know how to do it. I know how to estimate this gamma tilde tensor. So if I know that, I plug that back in here, and I just have a simple non-linear optimization problem for this. Optimization rather than this quantity theta. And okay, you can use the properties of this sort of modified Loudander transformation to show that the solution of this problem is actually the secant viscosity function evaluated at d hat, where d hat is basically this quantity here. 1 over the porosity, right, times this quadratic. Right, times this quadratic form on the inverse of the permeability tension. And that gives you this result that provides the bound that I mentioned earlier on the dissipation potential of your viscoplastic composite or viscoplastic yield stress fluid in terms of the porosity and the permeability of your linear. Of your linear comparison. And okay, you could write this in various ways. By the way, this equivalent quantity that appears here, right, actually corresponds, one can show, to the second moments of the fields in the fluid phase. So this thing is incorporating information on the field fluctuations, and that's crucial in terms of capturing. And that's crucial in terms of capturing, right? This fact that when you get this pressure threshold, not all the channels open up at the same time. You can write it in terms of the effective potential. In that case, you get some similar results. Let me quickly, in the time that I have left, if I have any, just show the application of these results for Herschel bottling fluid. And so the result. And so the result can be written in various ways. For an anisotropic medium, you get something that you could call a yield surface for the pressure gradient. This phi tilde. So it's this result here, which says that nothing happens, the velocity of the fluid is zero, until the pressure gradient is such that this quantity becomes greater than zero. And then And then, when that happens, the superficial velocity is related to the pressure gradient through this relation here. And it's right. They don't need to be aligned if gamma tilde is anisotropic. If you specialize this further to the isotropic case, you get this ground that I mentioned on the dissipation potential in terms of these things that basically depend on the porosity and the variability of the remote comparison medium. Remote comparison medium. And if you specialize to Herschel bulkly, sorry, if you write it in terms of the pressure gradient, the average pressure gradient in terms of the superficial velocity, you get this result, which I mentioned earlier. And it's very similar to the one that Althares and Winder proposed years ago for For this Herschel-Balkan fluid. But, you know, the result that I've given earlier can be applied for any type of yield stress fluid. Carot, you can choose your favorite, you plug it in, and you get results. I want to show some some just some quickly some results here. This is the average pressure gradient normalized in an appropriate way as a function of the pingham number. As a function of the pingham number. And the results look like this. Again, for the permeability of the comparison medium, we're using this VCK formula, right? Which Alferis and Winder used in their work. And their result is in these dashed blue lines. Our result is the red continuous line, which Line, which in this kind of plot correspond to a rigorous upper bound on this point. And what you can see is that, well, the first thing is that the results are very, very close. And the second one is that the results of Alfaris and Binder actually violate the bound. Of course, the bound is a mathematical result. The results of Alfaris. The results of Alphaires and Pinder were based on experimental results, right? And so I'm not trying to say that the results are wrong. The results were chosen to fit something that was not necessarily exactly Herschel-Baltry figure. But there's no fitting here, right? So I think it's pretty impressive the similarity in the results. And then we looked at periodic porous media, and we have this comparison here. And we have this comparison here for flow transverse to rigid fibers. Here we have some numerical results from this paper Charlestari and McKinley compared with the bounds, red lines, and some estimates that they gave based also on the permeability of the Newtonian fluid. Of the Newtonian fluid. But in addition, they had another estimate for this thing that I call the DE hat, right? That I said corresponds to the second moments of the fluids. They obtained a fit for that function with their numerical results and generated a result, which again is pretty close. It depends on the porosity. For large porosities, you can see that their result is much closer to the numerical results than the bound. Than the bound for high porosities. In fact, you find that their result actually violates the bound, and our result is a little bit closer to the numerical results. Yeah, so this is just to say that, right, you know, here there's no yield stress. When you look at the yield stress fluid, you get these widget blocks that people talked about this morning. Lots that we talked about this morning, and you see that, yeah, the flows are very different, but the result that we get for this microscopic response is actually not too bad. And that's, you know, that's one of the things that happens when you average things, right? I'll finish with just one more result because I think I've run out of time. And this is now considering an anisotropic medium. I need to press something. Are I need to press something here?
