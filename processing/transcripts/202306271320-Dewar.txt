Sean Deever will talk about introducing genericity to convex body packings. So he's from the University of Bristol. Hi, so. Sorry. Thanks for having me. And apologies for not being able to make it to the Institute. So okay, so I'll just get started now. Okay, so I'll just get started now. You've probably heard all these definitions multiple times so far. I've just put them on the board just in case. So I'm going to be talking about convex bodies. So just compact, convex sets with a non-empty interior. So you don't have anything kind of one dimension too low or something like this. Central symmetry. I think this is sometimes called like zero symmetry. Think this is sometimes called like zero symmetry instead. But I just mean that if you have a point in your set, you also have its negative. Or you can alternatively think about it as you can kind of, if you multiply the whole set by minus one, you get exactly the same set sort of thing. Okay, so these sort of centrally symmetric convex bodies are quite nice because they have a one-to-one correspondence with norms for finite dimensional spaces via their unit balls, which I'll go into. Unit balls, which I'll go into a bit more detail later. Okay, and the main thing I'm interested in studying at the moment is what we call homothetic packings of convex bodies. So it'll be a homothetic packing of C or a C packing. I'll just call it for short. Is you take homothetic copies of your fixed convex body C, which means you can translate them and scale. Which means you can translate them and scale them. You'll have a set of them, say N, and the rule is they can overlap, but they can only overlap on the boundary. So they can't overlap on the interiors. And I've got two kind of boring examples down here because they're both just kind of translate packings. So the scaling has been one each time. But you can see that what I have here is a load of disks, and I've done it. And I've translated them nice. But this sort of pattern can also be read. But this sort of pattern can also be reproduced with something like the L4 unit ball or the squirkle, it's sometimes called, though it's not really unique. So anyway, some more interesting versions. So here is a one homothetic packing of squares. So you can see I've got different size squares. They're in contact, but they don't overlap. And I've translated them around. But over here, I don't have a homothetic. But over here, I don't have a homothetic packing because one of them has been rotated and these two overlap. So this is bad, this is good. Okay. So once you've got your C packing, you're going to want to talk about a few different things. So the first thing is every single copy, and I'm going to index my set of copies by V, because effectively that's later on going to be my vertex. Because effectively, that's later on going to be my vertex set for a graph. So every single homothetic copy has been scaled by some positive scalar Rv and translated by some vector PV. And you can just strap these together into two maps. And this is effectively like the map of the centers. So it takes, it tells you how much they've been translated, but you can also think about it as the exact center. You can also think about it as the exact center of your convex body if you want. And this makes sense because I'm usually going to be dealing with centrally symmetric. So it is a good idea to think about. And you also have your scaling, which is going to be what I think of as the radii of the C packing. And from my C packing, with this information, I can basically construct a contact graph. So this is a graph with vertex V, which is the index set for my packing. Which is the index set for my packing, and an edge if and only if two convex bodies are intersecting. Remember, they can only intersect on the boundary because it's a C packing. So they can't overlap, they have to touch the boundary. And I've got like a picture here of a C packing. I'm usually going to denote them by a triple, so GPR. And you've got like a nice picture here of a nice square C packing. And you've got You've got various edges between them, but what you'll notice is I'm usually drawing them as straight line embeddings, which is the nicest way of doing it. But the square is actually the one example where you kind of run into issues because you can have four meter a corner, so you can have two cross. But actually, this is really the only bad example. So, as long as you don't have parallelograms, you're going to avoid this thing. The straight line embedding that you get from your CPACing. That you get from your C packing is always going to be planar. Okay. Right. Now, I'm mostly interested in the contact graph and their behavior. And there's a quite a nice theorem about this for disks. So if you have a disk packing, or in my language, I guess, a D packing, then it's going to have a contact. It's going to have a contact graph, it's going to be a planar graph. But likewise, if you have a planar graph, you can get a disk packing for the contact graph. Okay, now I put this as the Kobe-Andriev-Thurston theorem. There's kind of debatable. There's a million different versions of this theorem. I'm not going to quibble. If someone says that I've got it wrong, that's fine. There is about a million different versions of this result. But this is the version I want. So this is kind of nice if and only if. It's kind of nice if and only if. Okay. What you should kind of notice is I've got three big disks, and the choice of my middle disk is completely fixed. Okay? There is only one radii that will fit for this set of disks. So to keep that in mind for later. Now, there's a version of this done by Shrem, who effectively did basically the same thing, except Effectively did basically the same thing, except with smooth convex bodies. So I've just got the definitions up here. Strictly convex just means effectively no flat sides, but there's a technical definition on the thing. And smooth is also like no pointy corners. You're all definitely familiar with this sort of language. I don't need to go into it too much. In any case, Schramm in his thesis proved that if you have a smooth convex body in the A smooth convex body in the plane, and you have a planar graph, then you can make a C packing with that contact graph. Okay, so that's what he proved. It's basically the extremely more complicated version of the Kobi-Andriv-Thurston cat theorem that I mentioned previously. He actually did it for a much larger set of domains. I'm not sure what he called them in the thesis, I can't remember now, but he did it for a much larger. Now, but he did it for a much larger class, but we can apply it to kind of just smooth convex bodies. I've also pointed out that actually he doesn't need central symmetry at all for his results. It's just something that will become easier for me later on. The result is also not true if we drop smooth, and you can just kind of think of square packings. That's kind of the counterexample. And there's a few other things you can do like that. Okay. Okay. So getting back to disk packings, I'm going to say a generic set of numbers is going to be a set of real numbers. I want them all to be distinct. And generic just means that they're algebraically independent over the rational numbers. You can kind of think of this as like a random choice of numbers. They should behave like this. There's also a type of graph I have to explain very quickly. So it's a 2K sparse graph. K is going to be either. k sparse graph k is going to be either two or three throughout and it effectively means that for each subgraph with at least one edge you have at least you have at most that many edges as described on the board okay so it's a sparsity condition for subgraphs on your graph it's quite linked to you may have heard of stuff called lemang graphs or minimally rigid graphs and stuff like this that's usually when that's when k is equal to three and you these are the correct Is equal to three, and you these are the correct graphs to kind of look at for these things. Okay, um, on that note, um, as I mentioned previously, when you have the three disks, the center one is completely constrained on what size it can be. So, what happens if you want them to be kind of unconstrained? Well, the actual number of contacts completely drops. So, this was proved by Connelly Galtler and Thoran not too long ago when you have. And Thuran, not too long ago, only a few years ago, that if you have a disk packing and you've chosen the radii in advance to be generic, then the contact graph has to be a 2,3 sparse planar graph. So it needs to be planar because there's a disk packing. The surprising result, I guess, is the 2,3 sparsity, because it means that the number of contacts has dropped from a potential 3m minus 6, because you can always do a triangulation, that can always be realized as a disk cracking. We realize there's a disc cracking, and you've completely dropped it to 2n minus 3. So the number has completely dropped. And this is just because you're not allowing these kind of special position disks to exist anymore. That makes sense. And I've given in layman's terms, someone pointed out it's not very layman, but regardless. If I give you n circular coins and the And the radii have been chosen randomly, and you put them on the table and you slide them around as much as you want, then you're never going to be able to beat two and minus three contacts between the coins. And this is quite a nice trick you can pull in the pub. If you've got some coins in the pocket, you can just throw them on the table. And randomness should mean that this should work. So it's quite a nice trick you can pull. Right. You said math's not interesting. Right. So, why do we have a Runate. So, why do we have a sudden count drop? So, like I said before, the contact graph previously is completely constrained here. So, no matter what I pick, there's only ever one choice here. So this means generic radii are not going to work at all. Okay. And in fact, a kind of equivalent condition to having generic radii, and I'm not really going to go into the details, but it is the effect that if you have your disk package. The effect that if you have your disk packing, you can take any disk and just increase it or decrease it just ever so slightly and maintain all the contacts, have the same contact graph, not gain any extra edges. It's kind of the same thing. There's a lot of stuff you have to do to kind of prove it, but it kind of makes sense that this is true. And what does this mean? It means that you don't kind of have all your contacts are kind of independent. They don't have any dependencies going on between them. And if you've ever heard anything about And if you've ever heard anything about like Maxwell, James Clerk Maxwell, and his argument about stresses, this next argument is exactly that. You do a counting argument. You say, okay, I have, what are the number of constraints I have between? So this will be the edges of my contact graph. Well, that's going to be the number of degrees of freedom of a disk. Well, a disk with fixed radii only has two degrees of freedom. It can translate. That's it. And It and you subtract the degrees of freedom of the whole packing. Okay. Well, we don't know what that number is, but we know that it's going to be less than or equal to the degrees of freedom of the disk minus the degrees of freedom of the rigid disk packing, where you just take it and you translate it or you rotate it. So we know that for definite. And that's how we get the number basically. You just do some counting, you throw the numbers around, and you get the correct number out. And you get the correct number out. Now, this is not a proof, but this is kind of the ethos of why the proof works. You basically said that generic radii force you to have independent contacts, and this is why it works. And if you're thinking this sounds hokey, it is. If you go to higher dimensions, this argument is not known to be correct, but you can kind of make the same argument. So it's, you know, the devil is definitely in the details here. Right, regardless. Right, regardless, moving on. My previous work a few years ago was generalizing this result to these C packings, and specifically C packings where you have something that is centrally symmetric, strictly convex, and smooth. And if you have that, then for almost all choices of radii, so you have your You have your picked C pack, your picked C, you've picked some index set V, I guess, so how many copies you want. Then, for almost all choices of scalings, when you put them down and kind of slide them around on the table, you're going to have a planar to too sparse contact graph. Okay? And this is described in this layman's terms. So you describe any CS symmetric convex body that has no corners, no flat edge. That has no corners, no flat edges. So that's the condition I gave. So you give me any of them. I'm just going to randomly pick some radii for you. So I just pick a set. I now give you n coins, and each one has been scaled by that RI. And with the restriction that they have to have the same orientation, you have the same thing. You put them on the table, you slide them around, you see how many contacts you can get. And you can never beat 2M minus 2 contacts. Okay. Okay. So, any questions on that, I guess why is it almost all? You can never get all. So, kind of the idea would be: you can pick special. You can pick special position ones, right? So you could have, we know from SRAM that if you give me a contact graph with a planar graph, say a triangulation with 20 vertices, it's going to have way too many contacts for this result. But we know for a fact that you can find a C packing that realizes as a contact graph. But it will require at some point things to be overly constrained. So the generation. Overly constrained. So the genericity is not going to work. And this is kind of this idea previously. I mean, imagine a very, very large triangulation. And every time you have a triangle, you're fitting in a convex body. Well, only a very specific size convex body is going to work every time. So by doing the almost all, this is kind of this idea of like random in some sense. So random choices. The moral being random choices give you low amounts of content. Random choices give you low amounts of contacts. Does that make sense? Yes. Brilliant. Okay. So it was 2, 3 before is 2, 2 now. Basically, the idea is when I did the whole proof before, it was Euclidean. This is kind of non-Euclidean, non-Euclidean norms. So the difference here now is that. Here now is that previously when you had your packing, you could rotate the whole thing. But that doesn't really make sense when you have a homothetic packing of convex bodies, if they're non-spherical, non-disc-like, right? Because it's just with the disc when you rotate it, it looks the same. But when you rotate these things, well, they're going to have to maintain the same orientation. So they all kind of like shift around, but they'll all stay in the same direction. So it doesn't make any sense. So this is kind of what's Sense. So this is kind of what's kind of going on here in some sense. It's like this thing has shifted around and the sort of thing, and this thing's shifted up. While previously that would have been a rotation, well, here it's not a rotation. It's a literal movement of the bodies. And because of that, they have to change size to remain, maintain the contacts. So you can get kind of weird stuff like this, which, you know, you have your four and you put one in the center where you'd be thinking, but he just says, like, if But he just says: like, if you put one in the center, its size is constrained by the ones on the outside. Ah, yes, but I can rotate them around and actually increase the size of the space in the middle. That's not something you can do with disks, right? So if you have a triangle of disks and you rotate them around, the size in the center just stays the same. But if you have convex bodies, the size in the center will actually increase and decrease while you do it. And this is kind of why it works. This is why you can gain an extra degree of freedom. Extra degree of freedom. It's also worth mentioning that this result still works for disks. It's just a poorer result in some sense because every 2,3 sparse graph is 2,2-sparse. So I don't need to separate it out into cases. It's just the disk has a more specific, special version of this result. Okay. Now there's a converse to this, which is conjectured that It's conjectured that so if I have a generic radii disk packing, I can find it how this contact graph is a 2,3 sparse planar graph. The converse is if I have a 2,3 sparse planar graph, there exists a generic radii dispacking with that graph as the contact graph. Now you can find a dispacking with that graph as the contact graph. With that graph as the contact graph for definite by cat. But you can't guarantee that that graph has generic radii, and it seems to be kind of a hard problem. So, and you can say it's true for certain types of graphs, but in general, it's still unknown. It's conjectured to be very true, though. And nicely with disks, you can kind of get around with a convex body, you can kind of get around this by basically saying, okay, basically, if I Basically, if I have a bad convex body, I just pick a different convex body and do a different one. So, what this result here says is there is a Comega set of centrally symmetric convex bodies in the plane. So, a couple of quibblers on this about topology and stuff like this, but you can create a set, you can create a nice topological space of centrally symmetric convex bodies in the plane using the Hausdorff distance metric. Hausdorff distance metric. And Comega, you can just kind of think of it as almost all in this setting. It's stronger than dense. So it's why it's basically kind of nice because it means the intersection of two Co-Miger sets is still Co-Mega in the setting. So everything's super nice. You can't end up with some sort of dense set intersecting a dense set and you get nothing. So that's kind of why Co-Mega is here, regardless. So So, this basically says that there exists a set, which is basically almost all centrally symmetric convex bodies, where the following are equivalent. The graph is 2,2, plane or sparse, and there is a positive measure set of radii such that I can get my packing using those radii, which is a bit of a confusing way of wording it, but we don't have the words generic anymore. We have to be a bit careful on how. Anymore, we have to be a bit careful on how we word things because generic is a very algebraic thing, how it was previously defined. Um, so we have to be a little bit careful here. So, instead, it's the way to get around it is to just say there is a positive measure set where this is true, okay? But yeah, this basically says that the can, and this will be true for any graph. So, once I have my convex body, it's just true for any graph. Oh, um. Um ah, there's a mistake here. So C should be in D, and that should just say D. Regardless. So G here just is D. It's just this set D. So apologies about that. Any questions on this theorem? Because it's a bit weird how it's written, but it effectively just means the conjecture above basically almost always works. Basically, almost always works no matter what shape you have. Okay. Right. So I do rigidity theory as my area. So this problem is linked to rigidity theory. And the way to link it is via turning this problem into a norm space problem and then doing norm space rigidity. So I mentioned. Rigidity. So I mentioned before: if you have a centrally symmetric convex body, that gives you a norm. And that's done by this Minkowski functional here. You've probably all seen it. We can redefine our words for like smooth and strictly convex as now properties of the norm. So smooth just means differentiable except at zero. Strictly convex just means it's a strictly convex function. So that's all quite nice. But we can even redefine what it means to be. Redefine what it means to be a C packing. A C packing is going to be a triple GPR with the condition that if we take two points, if we take two vertices V and W that are distinct, then P V minus P W in our norm, dependent on our convex body, is going to be greater than or equal to Rv plus Rw. So it just means. Rw. So it just means, and when you look at this as equations, it just says that the two convex bodies don't overlap on the interior. And we say there is equality if and only if they're in contact, which is exactly when they're an edge. So if it's equals, it means that they are exactly equals. So this is a nice, this is a nice thing you can do with centrally symmetric ones. This statement is true. It's not true if you don't have the central symmetry. You have to work a lot. Central symmetry, you have to work a lot harder, but it's true for central symmetric things. Okay, so if I have my centrally symmetric convex body is smooth, then for every point I can fix what I call the support functional, which is the derivative of your Minkowski functional squared and then divided by two, just to get rid of this two-factor value. This two-factor evaluated at point x. What you can think of this is if x has size one in your Minkowski functional norm space, it is exactly the unit, it is the normal to the tangent to that point on your convex body. Because x will lie on the boundary of your convex body. There'll be a hyperplane going through it, and because it's smooth, it's unique. And this functional will be the unique unit distance. Unique unit distance normal to it, and then you just scale by however large hex is. Now, with this, we have something, I've defined this because we have something called the equilibrium stress of your packing, and it's a map with this kind of equality going on. So, it's any map edge labeling such that when you do this summation over all the vertices, it's equal to zero. Is equal to zero. And this is just a graph theory thing. It just means any vertex that's adjacent to V in your graph. But when you sum over it, you get zero, importantly. And you're said to be stress-free if and only if every stress, the only equilibrium stress is the zero map. So it's the map that sends every edge to zero. Now, if you want to, this comes from, this terminology comes from bar joint framework rigidity and statics and all this, where it is literally a Or this, where it is literally a stress on your building or scaffolding or whatever. This is the way to define it. It's usually done where C is the Euclidean norm. So this then just becomes P V minus Pw because the tangent to a point on the sphere is just the same vector. And then you would just scale. So it's just always the same. Okay, so with this idea of stress-free C-packings, then. Packings, then we can basically make a proposition proving this. So it's saying that if you have a stress-free packing, so if you can find, for your centrally symmetric smooth convex body, you can find a stress-free packing, then there's a nice open set of radii, which gives another C packing. So it's like you can perturb the radii and get another C packing with exactly the same contact graph. And this is kind of. And this is kind of the idea behind all these results, in some sense. Is you don't look at generic, you look at kind of this stress-free condition, which gives you generic. So it's a stronger condition, but it gives you generic, it gives you everything you want. So this is the stuff you go for. And this is why when I was saying independent constraints, it was all true. So that's basically kind of the this is the idea behind it is using rigidity theory techniques about stress Using rigidity theory techniques about stress-free properties and stuff like this, and applying them to packing problems. Okay. So I've mentioned loads of other things, but everything I've done so far previously has been, or mostly has been, it has to be strictly convex and smooth, as well as essentially symmetric. But there's an obvious one, which is squares. What happens with squares? Well, actually, the Is well, actually, the contact graph property is still true if you have like generic radii squares. And in fact, you can actually improve this massively. You can specify what the correct type of generic is in this case. So with squares, you can create this condition. It's a very simple linear condition with just very basic linear coefficients. And if your radii satisfies Satisfy this condition, that's an if and only if basically getting the same result with squares. Okay, so squares are like in some ways more horrible because you can't determine what the contact graphs are very nicely, but you know that if you have a square packing with very weak version of genericity, then you will have this 2n minus 2 contacts as a maximum. Okay, um, now this higher dimensional. Now, there's higher-dimensional analogs you can do for cubes, and they're not actually true. So, the kind of one to think about is to take a load of cubes, pick their sizes randomly, and clump them up into groups of eight. So, they're all sharing a vertex. So they're all sharing a corner. Sorry, to be careful. They're all sharing a corner in groups of eight. And then you can maybe clump them together so they've got some extra contacts. It doesn't really matter. But the point is, if you do this, If you do this, you end up with quite a few contacts. But what you would expect in three dimensions is a three and minus three contacts by the same argument I gave previously. So this just doesn't work. So cubes just behave really bizarrely. And hypercubes and so on and so forth, none of this sort of stuff seems to work with them. So that's something to think about. They behave. To think about, they behave bizarrely when it comes to packings, but squares are fine, so it's a bit weird. Okay, so I'm going to finish off with some ongoing research. I mentioned previously everything has been centrally symmetric. Well, what happens if we drop that? So, the whole point of the norm was to kind of tell you when two things are in contact with each other in a nice way that's all nice. In a nice way that's all nice, and there's loads of functional convex analysis that tells you what's going on. But you can't use the same trick anymore with if they're not centrally symmetric. So instead, what we look at is something called the support functional, which kind of is dual to the Minkowski functional, not exactly, but regardless, it's this functional here. So instead of before, when we were doing the infemum and stuff like this, this is a supremum and it's a bit. This is a supremum, and it's a bit more complicated. Um, but it does have some properties that you can say, and these properties-I'm not going to go through them, but they kind of say that this function can detect when convex bodies are in contact with each other. You just kind of have to include some extra vector u, which makes things a bit more difficult, but it's not so bad. Um, so we can turn this problem into kind of a functional problem, and when we can turn it to a function problem. And when we can turn it to a function problem, we can start doing differentiation and all sorts of stuff that we want to do. I put theorem. This has been proved on my computer. It still needs to be fully fleshed out, but the proof is basically there. So, this is a bit more complicated. You're taking a set of convex bodies, each with positive curvature. So, each one has a So each one has a is going to be strictly convex and smooth. Its boundary is also going to be second-order differentiable and also have positive curvature. So it's a lot of conditions now. But we don't have to have central symmetry anymore. And if you notice, these can be different convex bodies. So I could have an ellipse and then I could have like a squirrel and so on and so forth. Okay. Then for almost all choices of Then, for almost all choices of radii, I can then create a packing like so, where I translate them however I want, but I multiply them by this fixed radii and then just translate them around. This will have a planar 2,2 sparse contact graph also. Okay, and like I said, you can do this with multiple different convex bodies. Because if you noticed previously, the kind of this function, these conditions, you can do. These conditions you can do for two different sets A and B. So you can make it a bit more general. Okay, so there's some upsides, like I said, and we can have mixed packings. We have multiple different types of convex bodies. Downsides, it requires positive curvature. So it requires at some point you have to do second-order differentiation and look into it. And your second-order derivative has to have some nice properties, which are equivalent. Some nice properties, which are equivalent to it being positive curvature. So, this kind of touches in this point I was saying about that you have this extra vector U you kind of need to keep track of. And this is the issue. And this is not great because strictly convex and smooth convex bodies are almost all convex bodies in this Ko-Miger way of saying things. While positive curvature convex bodies are not, they're a dense set, but they're not almost all. Most convex bodies. But they're not almost all. Most convex bodies are not, do not have positive curvature. So you kind of start losing a lot of niceness with that, but you can start, you know, you can do some other things with it. So there's strengths and weaknesses. Okay. One final point I'm going to say. Big open problem. I mentioned the planar disk version. If you do the generic radii. If you do the generic radii D-dimensional ballpacking version of this, that's completely open. So, if I was to take a load of spheres, say, and I was just to make them not spheres, 3D balls, and was to give them generic radii and put them in contact with each other. We believe this should be stress-free, and because of that, should have three n minus six contacts at most, but it is completely. Most, but it is completely unknown. It's open. And in fact, this is kind of the version of the result that's often used in science literature about colloidal matter and stuff. It's just assumed to be true. But there is no proof. There's nothing saying that this is true. So this is an open problem. You can do heuristic proofs to kind of prove it to yourself, but they're not proofs. There needs to be an actual proof. So it's known to be true for. So it's known to be true for dimensions one and two, but it's open for higher dimensions. And I have a sort of recent-ish result. It still needs some work, which says that as long as you make the assumption that two of the, if you do the 3D version of the problem and you assume two of the balls are in contact with each other and every other homothetic copy, I guess it's just going to be a copy. Then you can guarantee the stress-free property. And this is if you've ever seen anything about this kind of idea of doing Mobius transforms to go down to two-dimensional penny graphs is kind of that. But I won't go into that because I think I've taken up enough of your time. But if you want to take anything away from this week, it's this conjecture is completely open and I would love to see a solution to it. Okay. Right. And I think that. Right, and I think that is me. So thank you for listening. And here's a list of the references for the talk. Any question? So, online participants? Okay, then I do have a question. So, you consider only packings, I mean, contact graphs of packings. Does it make any difference? Does it matter if we don't permit overlaps? If you permit overlaps. Yes, so this would be more like and you consider only external attaching pairs. Consider only external attaching pairs. Okay, so this would be more like when you do circle packings and you allow some like global overlaps are allowed to happen, but local ones are banned. Yes, but you circle together the contact graph. So in terms of normal planes, I mean, you set it up as a distance problem. So you don't care about the inequalities, only the equalities. Equalities okay, so in that case, I was told not too long ago that the um so I've not looked into the convex body version, but I was told that where is it? This conjecture at the top, if you allow the if you change the disks to be circles and you just look at tangencies of circles and you allow overlaps and stuff like this, um, I I believe that this is false, I believe, but I would not be 100% on it. But I think you can run into issues, which is kind of strange. So I think there are issues that happen if you allow this sort of thing. I'm not 100%, but I think there can be issues. I imagine. Yeah. It's similar to kind of like there's results about the chromatic number of. Results about the chromatic number of circle packings. If you allow circles to go inside each other and intersect and somewhat do what you want, and I think the chromatic number can be arbitrarily high. Well, here it would be kind of bounded. And if you consider only families in which no circle is entirely contained in an outer circle. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'm not so sure, but these are interesting questions. So sure, but these are interesting questions. I don't know. I don't think they've been looked into in this setting. So, yeah. Yes, nice question. I don't know. Okay, thank you. So, and maybe one more time. Any question? Okay, then we thank the speaker again. Thank you, Mario.
