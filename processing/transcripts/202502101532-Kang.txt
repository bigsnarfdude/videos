So, today I'm going to really access this really a quantum nature of things that we can do. So, both like quantum field theory and quantum gravity can be understood from the quantum correction perspective. And from that way, I'm going to use geometry to actually utilize the symmetry or the concepts that we can do. But geometry is actually not that good enough to actually give us a computable physical quantities like correlation functions or entanglement, which is where operator algebra is going to really. Where operator algebra is going to really come at play. So that from that perspective, I will be able to then probe into the quantum corrections of gravity along with the quantum aspect of field theory at the same time. So while I'm not going to actually talk about operator algebra, everything in the building block is done from that perspective. And all the manipulation will be done there from the computational toolkit. So from there, I'm going to probe into this. This is the 80. Probe into this. This is the ADS CFD that's actually taken in the museum in my hometown in Korea. So, how you should think of this ADS CFD is that there is something, a complicated metric spaces of gravity in the bulk that's a dimension higher than the projection, which is a dimension lower. That is a quantum field theory that living there, and that would be a conformal field theory. And from that perspective, we can also then utilize the toolkit as a lattice model with a quantum field. As a lattice model with a quantum error correcting type of paradigm, which will be actually eventually the quantum circuits of the day. And we can access them directly with operators because of the lattice model perspective as well. So then what is actually like an ADS-C of T? So ADS-C of T then represents, as I was just mentioning, a gravity theory and the boundary conformal field theory. So then what is the physical object that's really dual to one another? So this side will be like ADS101. This side will be like ADS101. So, what it really says is that, like, the interactions as a correlation function, so that these are all the operators. That this is a conformal field theory side, and that's identical to that of things that you can do inside the gravity theory, which is in the metric space. So that in turn, what it really brings rise to is geodesics. So, then that would be the classical gravity we can understand about a dimension higher gravity space. And from here, so this side will be what I'm going to more or less focus on. What I'm going to more or less focus on today. This is like ADS CFT 102. So, what we can really think of to now actually understand the quantum nature of gravity, what we have to utilize is something as quantum information of the boundary theory. That would be entanglement entropy. So it'll be the entanglement between the quantum states living on the boundary to probe into something quantum geometry of the bulk inside. So this is actually a picture from original paper Wheeler in the late 60s. Wheeler in the late 60s, which he first envisioned that something like individual bits of the black hole surrounding can be proved in from for the inside. And this is basically an aspect that we've been a modern way understanding from more like 2010 and onwards. So then, how and why this gravity and space-time in the bulk really emerged from this quantum field theory, specifically conformal field theory? So the entangling and So, the entanglement entropy was really the measure that we are using from the conformal field theory. So, what is entanglement entropy? That we are very familiar with it as a von Neumann entropy of a given subsystem. And von Neumann entropy we learned in undergrad as trace minus trace rho log rho. So that why it's an entanglement is that it's really zero for a pure state. So that when you're looking into two systems, I'm going to put one as purple and one in yellow, because they're actually my two favorite colors. My two favorite colors. Then we can consider like A and B as a system, as overall that's individually giving rise to it. So then by looking into a state living in here as a subsystem, we trace out the degrees of freedom of B. So that in turn can write as an entanglement of this. So another way that we can really see that this is an entanglement entropy is that when the state is separable, so it can write to be a factorized with respect to A and B, so that this black line is really rigid, so they are actually completely separate. Really rigid, so they are actually completely separate types of system. Then, from linear algebra, we know that this reduced state in A is actually a pure state, so that in turn it gives rise to zero. So when they're separated, there's no entanglement. It makes sense. So let's envision this and how we can do this in space-time perspective with gravity. So this is basically a similar picture on dope. So I'm going to now put a space-time with a boundary, and this boundary is where conformal field theory lives. And this boundary is where conformal field theory lives. And then I'm going to put that into two systems as A and B. So same purple and yellow. So without loss of generality, let's assume that the universe is empty. So T mu nu is zero. But this will work when T mu nu is full as well. So when this subsystem and this system of purple and yellow becomes reduced, so the entanglement is getting smaller and smaller, then the space will get pinched and pinched to one another. When they're separable, so the They're separable, so there are completely no entanglement between the two, you already know that it has to be separated. So, what that means is that it will be completely splitted into two. So, then from this natural way to thinking about it, one way we can learn is that entanglement is really necessary for the bulk space to exist. Then, how do you really manipulate that together? Because what that means is that the bulk space-time and gravity really emerge from this conformal field theory as a more fundamental. This conformal field theory as a more fundamental paradigm. So, this is more of an explicit manipulation, what we can find about the bulk gravity theory. So, what that can be then succinctly given as, is that what is the bulk dual, the boundary sub-region, because entanglement requires a sub-region. So, this is an ADS-CFT, so it's like a soup can. So, the soup inside is an ADS gravity, and the tin is the S CFT boundary. So, then I'm going to put this section as the A. Put this section as the A so that we have a time-symmetric diamond region, and the boundary is green, and that's going to be our sub-region. Then, understanding the dual inside of the gravity is really then giving rise to this, what the quantum gravity does. And this can be understood from the quantum extremal surface formula. So, there's a Bekenstein-Hawking entropy that we learned is an area law, that the entropy is proportional to area. So, what we really get is the exact general. So, what we really get is an exact generalization of that. So, this is a boundary entanglement entropy of this A as a subregion, and we can write that as this area proportional term, whereas now this minimal surface is homologous to this A, and then we extremize it. And if there is more than one extremum, we minimize it with respect to this surface. So, that in turn, with the domain of dependence that we can fill in, we actually get this red. In, we actually get this red wedge that we find. And this is so-called entanglement wedge, meaning it's a wedge that entanglement is contained within. So then what it really resort to be understood with is that what is this extremum? So it's an extremization problem. So if you're looking into like this classical gravity and the space-time geometry, we can use focusing theorem like things. And this was understood to give rise to a maximum, type of maximum formula. min type of maximum formula. Of course, there's a min max that's a relation and all those are also work in progress by many people. I'm not going to talk about that today. So one of the direct things that we actually noticed from this is that this is a boundary entanglement entropy giving rise to this bulk area. And this is how we got this. But clearly, when area goes up, it diverges, so that in turn, it's UV divergent and continuum theories as it reaches the infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. We choose the infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. And we know conformal field theory is a continuum theory, so that's a real problem. This will explicitly diverge. So, another way to capture that is that there is a problem with understanding more microstate contributions that are more quantum. So, by the end of the talk, I'm going to now build quantum gravity using this ADS-CFT as a lattice model so that in the context to resolve this tension that can be arising from. So, to then really understand it. To then really understand it explicitly, we have to really go to the infinite dimensional paradigm. The real reason that was difficult was that the area law that we're applying with is fundamentally finite dimensional. So then we can approach in the two different ways. One is that we already know that the entanglement entropy of to some notion is exactly identical between the two. And another way to capture that is we can see coming from boundary, we can reconstruct this bulk region. This bulk region. So, then in that way, any bulk observable supported in this red entanglement wedge can be really represented as just any operators living in this boundary control field theory region A. So that in turn, we can use all this operators because a control field theory can write as all the local operators that can be re-capsulating all the operators or observables that can have in this metric space inside because of metric space operators are not necessarily. Because of metric space, operators are not necessarily local, it has to be smeared with the kernels to actually fill in the metric space. So, in turn, exact states or operators are really difficult to approach, but one way to then understand their relation is utilizing then algebra as a structure. And from those, we can now systematically develop that how they are actually equivalent of a notion by regressively framing an operator algebra. So, that's really great. And one of the really different And one of the really direct things that we learn from this very naive-looking description is very striking. So, earlier I was putting in just a bipartite region, but let's say we can put in the tripartite region. So, this is the ADS at fixed time. So, time is coming at you. The cylinder is coming front. So, from this region, then we can write the entanglement which we construct a small region A, B, and C accordingly from individual region. And if you do that, Region. And if you do that, we will never be able to recover from just separately considering this red region in the middle. But if you're considering a union of the two regions, like AB, BC, or CA, you will redundantly encode this striped region. So another way to say that is that the quantum corrections of gravity is redundantly encoded from the different ways of capturing from the boundary control field theory, so that in turn, the quantum corrections of the above gravity. Quantum corrections of the bulk gravity is really like a quantum error correction of the map coming from the boundary conformal field theory. So, then what we learned thus far is that the quantum entanglement is kind of like that glue that holds this bulk space-time together. So, then we should be able to build something like a holographic universe using the quantum error correction type of perspective, as the error correction is happening between the Balkan boundary theories. So then, So, then to do that, let's see how error correction worked back in the days. So, back in the days, we had just bits in classical error correction. So, when we hit cosmic rays, it changes a bit. So, we can have to try to correct them by just repeating the bits. So, with this three-bit repetition code, it's really just stupid. You just repeat it. The top row can be hit, but you can just correct it by copying from the below when it's unhit. So, can we? So, can we do something like that for qubits? Now, this is really hard because physical qubits are very sensitive as they're in superpositions of zeros and one states, and we do not want to collapse them. The whole point of using this entanglement to be utilized to probe into this quantum properties, so then we have to correct without collapsing these wave functions. So, then what we can do without really being worried about no cloning theorem is that we actually. Theorem is that we actually encode the entangled pairs of things as states together, and that encoding is more of a set together. So that in turn, we can have like a L number of logical qubits and a knowledge of the P number of physical qubits. And the way to then phrase that is then, can we really look into this a bulk reconstruction as ADSC of T in this quantum error correction paradigm? And a lot of people have worked on this. And the way to really capture it is the following. Capture is the following. So, a quantum error correcting code encodes then the L number of logical qubits and p number of physical qubits. If this logical qubit can represent the bulk into the setter space, and if the physical qubits can give rise as a boundary control field theory, then the mission is complete, that we will get exactly bulk reconstruction that recover the bulk qubits from the knowledge of boundary qubits. So, then a way to really build it is then try to To really build it, is then try to utilize this approach in the ADF CFT without killing Lorentz invariants to be in the continuum description in the end, because otherwise you will not actually get a genuine CFT or genuine gravity theory that would actually access as a correct theory. So I'm going to borrow certain information we learned from finite dimensional approach into this way, but with a much more utilizing and the correct continuum limit in this fashion. Continuum limit in this fashion. So let's actually build an explicit holographic universe using quantum error correction as a lattice model. So this is in the fixed time first, so that when you have the slice, I can tile up with the pentagons. The reason why it's pentagon is because if it's square or rectangle, you will have a sphere packing problem. So that there's no unique way to fill in the hyperbolic disk because it has to be closed. A disk because it has to be closed. But if you do a pentagon, it's up to Z5 rotation, it's unique, so that you can actually fill up a uniform way to do it this way. So it's one of the easiest thing, the first thing you can try to do. And this is something that was originally called happy code in the finite setting, but I'm going to reassemble them and take it to the infinite regime correctly. So from here, what I'm filling in is the first level is the central node, and then I'm going to take it as a perfect tensor. And then I'm going to take it as a perfect tensor to give rise to five ways. So that it's like an EPR pair, but spits in five different ways. And it is very important I keep this way because I get to have a bulk node, whereas hexagon, I will lose the bulk node because it can only be up to six. So the next level will be then from the from the bulk to next, I'll be selecting all the things that chairs the edges and the vertex. So you can see it recreates the pentagon as overall shape. The pentagon as overall shape, and the overall boundary node is the one then touching the edges, like we did here. That's 25 of them, so it's 11 bulk and 25 bulk. Boundary is the next level we get, and continuing up. So, this current thing that you're seeing is actually repeated 24 times. It's blue, yellow, green, red, and we repeated it six times. And you can see it really fills in the hyperbolic disk as it goes to infinite. To infinite. And from there, the first thing we need to check is: does it really have any chance to converge? Because if it diverged, there was really no point to really consider them. And one of which the first that we can see is we can actually write the Hilbert space dimensions from them. They explicitly converge. We can even write that as a polynomial degrees of freedom. And from there, then, we need to get the isometry as a map between the bulk and boundary theory. And how we're going to get them is through the commutative diagrams. Is through the commutative diagrams of algebras decorating on individual Hilbert spaces. It's like how we did the conformal mapping overall, like in this fashion. This is also by the same artist from the same museum in my hometown. So what we're really doing is that we're doing this as like an individual packets in and out, so that this is a boundary and this is the next level pushing. And it's called commutative if this and this route give the same way. So we can show that actually this is explicit commutative using operator algebra. Commutative using operator algebra. And you can actually take it to infinity, and this is how you're going to get all the algebraic relations to actually give rise to convergence. So that another easy way to say that is it's a type of infinity we know how to resolve. So first thing that we need to check is that this is actually indeed a quantum error correcting code. So that, like, does it really do as a bulk and boundary to give rise to logical and physical qubits? So you can write them as a stabilizer code. As a stabilizer code description at every level that we can write. So this was level two. So we can actually check that this works very precisely at every level, and then we can push it to infinity. Now from here, I'm going to now cut this open and then put it outwards and flatten it out because it's difficult to draw more than two layers to be next leveled. And if I just now cut open and flatten it out, this is going to be the radius going downward, right? That's exactly the renewal. Downward, right? That's exactly the renormalization group flow coming from every level to outwardly and then hit the boundary at infinity. And the thing that we need to check is what is a good local Hamiltonian to use to give enough dynamics to actually describe a good enough lattice system to model this. So we're going to do something exactly like a lattice model, but we're going to have the nearest spin together. So there's eight of them. So we're going to have an Ising-like model by interacting. Have an Ising-like model by interacting this eight neighboring qubits, and it looks like a trapeze looking at this. So, I'm going to call it Trapeze Hamiltonian. We need to know this is actually good enough to induce dynamics. So, we can apply the mean field theory and check indeed it does exhibit phase transition. So it's actually good enough of a Hamiltonian to use. Now, applying this, so like for example, in this context, we get this yy pattern with all the ones filled. Y pattern with all the ones filling in. So if I write nothing, there's identities. They're ones. And then if you do more, you can see for this, we get yxxy and yy sporadically separated with identities. And whatever you do, you'll get this from a level two and beyond. And we can actually compute exact the fractal distances apart, and we'll get really complete fractal structure coming out of it. So then what we get is that the resulting operators are indeed scale invariant, so that in turn at infinity, So that in turn, at infinity, we hit to be a conformal field theory limit. So it's really the IR limit of the renormalization group flow. So indeed, we will actually get a continuum conformal field theory. In fact, we can even do better. So with this, we can actually write the fractal distances. And what it gave rise to is we actually get a power law decaying correlation, which is a signature to have for the conformal field theory. And for that to happen, we can check the LD. And for that to happen, we can check the all the Hamiltonians of the trapezes that it piles up about. And that has to be actually the fattened up lines that it has to follow. And that's a bulk geodesic that we are supposed to have found. And this is, if you remember, the ADS 101. So this is actually the first ever model that have achieved a property like this. So it's really a first genuine holographic model we could have. And in fact, can do the reverse engineering and do the bulk recreation as well. Recreation as well. So, if you want to understand a quantum correction, we have to really go further on. So, we really need to then consider a space-time, and but that was for the fixed time, of course, we slice in it. So, then we should actually go beyond to actually find the emergent space-time and check the entanglement entropy and see what we can learn coming from there about. So, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to now put it like, think of it like the following: we tile up individually. Following, we tile up individually and then we link all the bulks together. But it's a fundamental building block is so that we have two different pentagons and linking together. And how it links together is through stabilizer code. So we have a in the middle as a ZXZ, so that this is a fundamental block localized everywhere surrounding. And then we're taking this level between the two as epsilon going to zero so that we will hit the continuum limit again. Hit the continuum limit again, just like space and time separately. And in this way, what we're really getting is a quantum circuit where the circuit of input is coming at some t0 as a state, and output is a t and the output state. So that if you write actually stabilizer code description, before in the fixed time looked like this, whereas in space-time will look like this additional thing. So one way to really think about it is really inducing. Really, think about is really inducing slightly more long-range phenomena to give rise to a chance to have something like a time flow. In fact, we need to understand how this really looked like. So, before we had the Hamiltonian analysis as a trapeze Hamiltonian. So, for here, we're going to have now double layers of those. So, what it means is that from here, let's put it like this. And then we'll have a next level slice that's going to give rise. Next level slice that's going to give rise as a next slot. And it's going to look like this as the fundamental looking type of Hamiltonian. It looks like a prism, so I'm going to call it a prism Hamiltonian. And from here, we can also do the mean field theory analysis, and it'll actually recreate all this dynamics we needed to have like before. So in turn, what we really then can get as a commutative diagram that we need to demonstrate is something in the every single way. So like earlier, we had this. Way. So, like earlier, we had this, and now we need to consider in the next time slice, and we had to know how to give this as a time evolution. And showing this individual commutative diagram is actually really hard to prove. So instead, I'm going to collapse it. So, what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to direct sum at time slice and the next level time slice and then sum them up. And it's okay to do this because, as a direct sum, you don't need to worry about the redundancy because it'll be equally. Redundancy because it'll be equally redundant everywhere, and just direct summing does not worry about that. So, in that way, we're going to now access the bilayer information using this paradigm. And in that way, what we need to now show is coming from this isometry that we're actually going to able to recreate this. And how we did that is now a sliced commutative diagram to be commuting. We can actually prove that very precisely. And demonstrating this is indeed the time flow, meaning this is the only. Time flow, meaning this is the only one continuous parameter that demonstrates as the only thing that can be time. So, what we really did is we really achieved that this is indeed really the case. So, you can actually get the unitary time flow with this bulk Hamiltonian. So, let me explain that in a more quick way possible. So, we learned in the quantum field theory 101 that we can access unitary transformation through scattering matrix. Transformation through scattering matrix. So, what we can do is that we write the scattering matrix without associated to our prism Hamiltonian. Originally, that would give rise to a unitarity, so it's a unitary transform. And we need to now edit the density of interactions individually. So we include this as additional function and modify that. So from here, it's going to become a function that added it onto, which is basically weighted in the interval 0 to 1. And the whole point. And the whole point of doing the lattice model is that we can actually compute so that we can compute through the direct sums of the individual intervals that we can do. And then we can now take the continuum limit. And if we take that, now this is the time segment that we find. And we'll get exactly just combining this notion. And it has to be unitary for this small interval because we're taking continuing limit. And continuum limit, that means we neglect higher order terms so that in turn we. Terms so that in turn we recreate the s to be originally a given s unitary profile. And further on, we can actually demonstrate that this works very correctly with this prism Hamiltonian, that it actually gives rise to as a unitary transformation as a evolution. So in that way, we can actually show that this is really the unitary time flow. And actually more mathematically, we can prove that using operator algebra, this is the only one parameter family of isomorphism it can really admit. Isomorphism it can really admit. So, with that, all a lot of very difficult, complex as a model, it needs to deliver what we wanted to see. So, can you see we can compute entanglement entropy and see the quantum gravity and discover some new features? So, in the original happy code, we could get something like a Yu-Taka-Naki surface through greedy algorithm. It's called greedy because it greedily eats it away. Readily eats it away. And by doing so, it's finding geodesics, is how you should think of it. So, with those algorithms, what we're really doing is that it kind of eats every time and stuff. And so that when it reaches the extremal surface, just a minimal surface, it stops. And this is how it finds it. For our the space-time model, we can actually use as a HRT surface, which is in space-time that stands for Humani Rangamani Takeadagi surface. What it really does is that upon extremization, Does that upon extremization, we actually move additional time slot? So after finding it, we go on time and we find it again and go on time and then repeat it over and over. So this is like one way to find a correct extremization to be resolved in this way. And this actually gives rise to a correct HRT surface that we would expect to find. This is a very non-trivial feature that we couldn't have expected that easily in naive ways. Furthermore, the whole point was that. Furthermore, the whole point was actually to compute what region we get as a block geometry and what would be the entanglement entropy. We can actually compute both of them very precisely. So in order to compute entanglement, we need to separate into bipartite region. So what we can do is we cut this. So it's cutting all the perfect tensors into two disjoint sets. So I'm going to call that P and Q as individually what it resorts into, which in the boundary nodes then will. Which in the boundary nodes then will give rise to the boundary A, and then the rest of the A complement as A bar. So then, this cut, what it does is that it composes into now two tensors, whereas contracted legs would be then lying along the cut. So, this is like a zoomed in because it's hard to demonstrate the full thing. So, these are individual levels and zoomed in part of the space-time model. So, it cuts like space-time, space-time, and continuing like that. Like that. And we know for a fact that from here we can compute such that the boundary of the cut has to match that of the boundary of A. So that in turn, what it gives rise to is the bulk geodesic bounded by this A, so that in turn, it's the cut of the shortest length whose boundary is identical to this boundary A region. So that in turn, it's exactly the bulk entanglement wedge of this lattice model. Now, this is really surprising because we're just cutting it and cutting it through and just naive incision to cut. knife incision to cut, it cuts correctly through the entanglement wedge that we are supposed to actually see. This is really quite remarkable it can do something like that. In fact, with this, we can actually write explicitly the boundary state, but we can get. The boundary state can be written into the two different joints that we have produced from the bulk. So that we can actually write down and compute these very precisely and take it to the infinity regime. And we employ operator algebra and tomato. Employ operator algebra and tomato Takisaki theory to actually be able to deal with this type of infinity. And from there, we can write the density operator pretty precisely. And what is important as an information is its rank. And we know that this rank is bounded by the number of terms that lies in the cut. So that in turn, we can write the maximum von Neumann entropy of this subregion of A. So that in turn, this is an entanglement entropy. That's given as a log of. That's given as a log of rank of this density of states. And this is why the rank was very important to be computed. So that along the cut, we can actually precisely compute this to give rise to this max-min formula. So it's really the maximum that we have seen earlier without considering a quantum consideration, but that's exactly what we're finding, even with the quantumness. And we find an explicit bound so that we actually see that this entanglement entropy is given as a finite value, despite an infinite dimension. Despite an infinite dimension. So, in turn, we resolve the UV divergence for these types of models that we can have. And furthermore, we also compute this very precisely from this perspective. So, it's one way that's actually working in the space-time code that we couldn't have seen before. Let me summarize. So, today I actually took operator algebra as a new approach to really look into a form as a mathematical framework to access not only quantum fields. To access not only quantum field theory, but also to quantum gravity. That's why the operator itself is probably non-local given the space time to be smeared into as a metric space. And from there, I developed the infinite dimensional holography, where we refined a notion coming from the boundary entanglement entropy, giving rise to the bulk geometry. And I defined a notion that we knew from before as entanglement wedge. And then I actually framed them in the operator algebra way to actually demonstrate how that works. How that works. And using these methods altogether, I developed the at the fixed time some hyperbolic tensor network model. That's inspired by the happy code, but correctly rearranged and take it to infinity. And we showed that that was the first genuine holographic code where we can compute correlations and geodesics are exactly dual to one another. And then we took it to the space-time where we could compute entanglement entropy, and it gave rise to entangled wet, which is a correct quantum geometry as a Correct quantum geometry as a maximum formula for the entanglement entropy in the boundary, and we could actually demonstrate the entanglement entropy is indeed finite, so it's actually not crazy and it's doing as a physical expectation of what we imagine. So there are a lot of exciting future direction that follows. One of the first things that comes to my mind is a matching with the gravitational path integral and dealing with their vacuums to be a match to another and understanding its interaction. Interactions, and we have some preliminary results, but we're working more to understand more in details. So, today I talked about correlation functions and the bipartite-based entanglement entropy, but one could also consider tripartite or multipartite entanglement signals. And I saw the first, one of the first talks today was on multipartite entanglement, but in a very different context. So, we devised also signals that one should be able to. Signals that one should be able to compute and try to understand, and understood their properties, that's especially occurring in the context of holography, and the ones occurring in the context beyond the holography in more generic quantum systems. But these measured, this type of signals are actually directly computable in the lattice model. I mean, that was the whole point of having the toy model as a lattice model to begin with. So, I think that would be really exciting to look into as a direction. And all of these toy models are really so that. uh toy models are really so that we hope to be able to compute some dynamical aspect of quantum gravity which is an incredibly difficult problem to do. One of the things that's nice about operator algebra is that we can actually deal with them through the topology changes of the book. And because any continuous deformation of them was basically the topology changes. And for that we can directly be able to compute them and what happens in this lattice model context, especially the operator algebraic analysis part has Algebraic analysis part has been already done in my previous work with my other collaborator. So that in turn, we think at least we should be able to do something more directly computable quantity in this context. And a lot of these are done. Today I talked about mostly analytical methods to do so, but there are a lot of numerical things that one has can try to do and understand. One of the easier things that can be done, that does entanglement, is one relating notions like a complexity. Relating notions like a complexity analysis, like in Krillov complexity or spread complexity, for these types of space-time lattice models or other types of Hamiltonian for lattice models we can utilize with, which are actually working on it at the very moment. And another quantity that is more computable is a fidelity that can really understand about these types of corrections. And we're working on that for the context of holographic map in the preliminary method at the moment. Thank you very much for. Thank you very much for asking. I'll be happy to answer any questions. Hi, Monica. Hey, everyone, I have a question. What is the error that he wants to correct in his consideration? Ah, so while I'm saying it as an error, it's actually the quantum corrections of the gravity. So anything like a one over. Gravity. So anything like a one over G Newton and those type of terms. So that in turn, like not classical part. So while it says quantum error correction, that's a term to put in the quantum error correcting paradigm. The error is non-physically correct, but it's really a quantum correction. The fact that the corrections are now in this green and the bodies are the same. The body so describes feature in your boundary. Ah, so what we're doing can be then understood as a gravity action, which can be then understood from this Riemann terms like order by order, and then they have coefficients, and it can also have the one over G Newton effect. And here, the quantum correction that it really taps onto is the one over G Newton terms. And here I discretize and take it back to the continuum limit. And take it back to the continuum limit. So, what it means is that in the end, what I'm really matching with is a continuum level of the equations of motion from Einstein field equations that we were getting. I actually did not break Lorentz invariance because after discretizing, you do, but because I took it to infinity, I'm only probing into the bulk near the infinity, not like the center area, because that area is too discrete. I actually can't deal with them. And the boundary is explicitly. And the boundary is explicitly in continuum regime, because that's at null infinity is where it lives. Before that, it would not be a conformal field theory, has not hit the IRCFT fixed point. So that in turn, I can only prove in bulk kind of like not too far away from the boundary in this context. The phase transition that you were showing was for what? That was for the mean fill theory. Is that what you're asking? Yeah, like it was somewhere that had. Yeah, like it was somewhere that had a meter, some like it was that's the magnetic magnetization that I take for the five qubits as a pentagon that I can take. Let me go to I think I missed it. This one, right? So this is the five different magnetization that I can take of the trapeze. And then this is the one over temperature, that's beta. So it's like a proof of concept that. So it's like a proof of concept that it's actually doing something non-trivial and showing that to exist as a phase transition. It's a local Hamiltonian. I want to emphasize this is not a global Hamiltonian. A couple of questions. So the first one is related to the first question by Sara. So you find that the entanglement entropy in the bulk region is finite, you need to work in a three-dimensional space. To work in three-dimensional space, that from the direct point of view means that you are describing some regions of the bulk through formal algebra of type one. But then we can correct one thing before I continue. These are not fundamental algebra of type one. These are actually, their sub-regions are generically type three, and you can explicit check that it is. Then it's not completely clear to me how type T algebra is accommodate for finite time. That's why this is a very remarkable result because, well, in Very remarkable result because, well, individually, the sub-region actually explicitly gives rise to a von Neumann algebra of type 3. Actually, you can even hit type 3, 1 in the correct regime of what you can take. I am using the C star algebra to actually generate this as a lattice model and take it to the von Neumann algebra regime. But I can actually bound this and I can actually find the correct bound that give rise to this. And the reason why I can do that is because we are taking with respect to a particular way of writing in this two different formats. Writing in this two different formats, what it really means is that in the overall altogether will be written as some like a type of infinity. We know how to do it more like in the type two way, but we're taking in the C star algebra RAM and coming back to it, if that makes any sense. So that we are really utilizing not only just the reference state in von Neumann algebra structures, but also in the C-star algebra, its relations. And the algebra you actually need to take into here is a CCR type. Another quick question. So, the result you showed about the fact that when you take this constructive procedure in the bug and you go towards the boundary, there is a fractal dimension emerging. But I guess that fractal dimension depends on the explicit way you discretize the bulk. If instead of pentagon, you get some other tiles, that fractal dimension change. So, the question is, how do you interpret this different kind of discretization sets? Discretization sets like different types of holographic models, or something more? I'm actually really glad you asked that. So, one of the things I want to emphasize that here I did uniformly pentagon, and this is uniquely given up to Z5 rotation. In fact, every level you can see that it recreates pentagon. You can actually even see the roughly pentagon that's going to appear here as well. It's like a repeating of pentagon over and over. This is actually a special type that can occur. The reason why this is happening is because. Why is this happening because it's like a topological understanding of this sector? The reason is because it's within only 3D gravity, so that this is guaranteed due to understanding as a topological sector that can fill in in the 3D. Another reason is because 3D is a topological bulk. And we know the representation that it gives to due to tria vehicle is only just that. And you're seeing the manifestation of that here. Now, if you're spreading out with like some hexagons. Starting out with like some hexagons and mixing it together, then that's not uniquely given. And that then represents the fluctuations of the vacuum. This will be very different. That will be not analytically solvable like this cleanly. That one, one would have to rely on numerics, and I can't guarantee it always works. And another thing that I want to emphasize here is that when we bring it in this way of doing so, it's a very uniform way of pushing it through. So that you're only Pushing it through so that you're only getting this correlation function as a geodesics, and only when it's really hitting through the geodesics as a bound. If it's a piling of trapeze and other way around, this does not happen. So, in a way that this explicit duality we're seeing as an ADS CFT is imposed in there somehow and learned from this model, if you push this around, you will never get this type of identity. So, that in turn, you will never get a parallel decaying correlation. Correl decaying correlation if and only if it's not a geodesic route. So it's like a really a path that we get from this model. And if you're asking, if I don't have this uniform way of doing so, do I know and predict what can happen? I actually have no idea. No worries. So in this trap piece Hamiltonian example, do you know what the CFT that's living on the boundary? What it is? What it is. So that's actually something you're working in progress. The main difficulty is that this is up to numbers, actually. So while we can write down the numbers, it's up to a number. So we need to match the vacuum sector coming from equations of motion to make this work, get to determine what's the correct central charge, because up to a number can change everything. We are still working on it. We need to be for certain before I publicly announce it that this is actually. I publicly announce it that this is actually correct. Is there going to be a CFT we know at love, or is it going to be something? So, one of the reasons that I can say about that is before putting into this lattice model an operator algebra context, I needed some particular way to make this work to feed in some particular data as a reference state, as a stabilizing methods of the operator algebraic thing that give rise to goods shuffling this. To because that's the shuffling, this constant term that essentially gives rise to for this distance. And we have worked in specifically the free field bulk, so Klein-Gordon fields bulk, and what that gave rise to as a CFT dual. So we could finally compute this. And this is my work with Jason Cran, who's a mathematician at Carlton. So from that idea, we are now feeding in that information to look into in this way to compute it. I think so. It will work, but we need to double-check a lot of things to claim that this is actually the right thing to get it in the end. It's a work in progress. So I guess one thing that was confusing me is it looked like when you wrote down the Hamiltonian on this piece lattice, it looked like it was like, yeah, it was just a product of Z operator, so no quantumness to the Hamiltonian. Yet you were somehow getting a non-trivial. A non-trivial object on the boundary. So I didn't quite understand how that happened. So I want to say that this is the bulk Hamiltonian that's local. So these are all local Hamiltonians. It's not the global Hamiltonian. Like it's not the gravity action that it gives rise to. If you want to do that, you need to use both the modular Hamiltonian and the local Hamiltonian together. These are just really locally giving rise to it everywhere. And I'm taking to infinity. And I'm taking to infinity. So if I'm doing it in this way, it's like a path of coming in and out that kind of looks classical, but you don't. I'm not imposing one particular maximally entangled reference state to do it. So it can scramble. And that is just prescribed by the operator algebra. This is why I actually go to C star algebra realm to actually do this and return it back to take it a correct completion in the end to give rise to von Neumann description. Because I'm not relying on the one particular Because I'm not relying on one particular mixing in the way, this is where the quantum nest comes in. Thank you. No worries. Okay, yeah. I think we're running a little bit behind time already, so thanks again for your talk. Okay, and
