Equal to this polynomial evaluation. Okay. So actually in the kind of paper that Reiner, Stanton, and White used to define the CSP, they considered cyclic group actions on non-crossing partitions. So one result that they had was that the triple XCX of Q exhibits a CSP. C x of q exhibits a CSP where x is a set of non-crossing partitions of one, two, up through n. The cyclic group Zn acts by rotation, and x of q is this thing, the q-Catalan number. So cyclic sieving for non-crossing partitions. And well, one thing you'll notice, right, is that rotation does not change the number of blocks of a set partition. And we have a question. And we have a corresponding CSP for the Narayana numbers. So if I now look at non-crossing partitions of n with k blocks, still the rotation action, I have a cyclic sieving result where my polynomial is the Q-Nariana polynomial. So I have this kind of Catalan CSP that refines, if you like, to these Narayana CSPs. So let's talk a little bit about sort of two. Bit about sort of two, well, maybe big ways of proving CSPs. So, let's say we have a set X with an action of the cyclic group and a polynomial X of Q. And our goal is to show that this triple exhibits the CSP, while method one is sort of brute force, you know, just straight up enumerate the fixed point sets, evaluate the polynomial roots of unity. And method two, the one I'll kind of be emphasizing today, is representation theoretic. You basically use linear. Theoretic, you basically use linear algebra. So, the idea is we want an algebraic model of the action of C on X. And the way we do that is we're going to find a vector space V that carries the action of a group G. And this vector space should have some very special distinguished basis indexed by the elements of X. So that's kind of my set X. And how do I model the action of little C? Well, I want to. The action of little c? Well, I want a group element little g such that the action of g on the basis element for x is the basis element for c on x. And well, if you have this setup, we can consider the character, chi, of this action and the size of the fixed point set of C to the D. Well, with respect to my distinguished basis, what I have is a permutation representation, right? So that will be the trace on V of G to the D, which is. trace on V of G to the D, which is another way of saying the character of G to the D. So we've traded a problem in enumeration for a problem in character theory. And if your group G is something like a symmetric group or a Lie group, this problem in character theory can be very well studied. So there are several algebraic proofs of the Catalan CSP on all non-crossing partitions, and somehow the key to an algebraic proof is. Somehow, the key to an algebraic proof is you want a representation of the right dimension with a very special basis, right? And we have a few options here. So we could take the Kazjan-Lustig cellular basis, essentially a two-bion rectangle. We could take a basis kind of coming from the theory of temporally Lieb algebras. I worked on this with Kyle Peterson, Pasha Bilyowski. Or you could take a basis Could take a basis which is really arising from type A cluster algebras, and you can think about it as a certain piece of the coordinate ring of the Grassmannian of two planes in n-space, or I guess more precisely, it's affine cone. So kind of a few algebraic proofs here. But for a while, there was this problem: you know, can I find an algebraic proof of this Narayana CSP, this refined thing? So, I'm refining by number of blocks. And the first thing you might think is: well, you know, I have an enumerative situation, the Catalan situation, that's refined by these Narayana situations. So can I correspondingly refine the algebraic picture? Can I take these representations and break them up into pieces? But, well, there's a hurdle here. The modules involved in the Catalan CSP proofs were all irreducible. And they were actually irreducible modules, not for SN, the number of vertices. Modules, not for Sn, the number of vertices, but S2N. So it, you know, wasn't really clear. You can't break them up for S2N, and maybe you have some kind of embedding of Sn inside. It wasn't obvious what to do. And the correct refinement of the Nariana CSP for kind of overcoming this hurdle was discovered by Oliver Pachenek. So what did he do? So he said that, well, we're going to look at K-block non-crossing partitions of N that don't have any. Don't have any singletons. And we'll consider the rotation action. So, well, maybe if you're seeing this for the very first time, you might wonder, well, where is this no singleton condition coming from? Oliver was actually looking at this in terms of a k-theoretic promotion on a two-row rectangle. And he proved that we have a CSP for this triple X C X of Q, where X is K block set partitions, non-crossing of N with no singletons. Non-crossing of n with no singletons, cyclical group of order n x by rotation. And well, x of q is this crazy thing with q factorials, q numbers. And if x of q looks too crazy for you, it's actually an instance of the q hook length formula. So if I take a flag-shaped partition, k 1 to the n minus 2k, take the hook length formula, take every q analog in site, that is x of q here. That is x of q here. So, how are we going to get sort of algebraic proofs of these CSPs? Well, ultimately, you know, we first need a vector space of dimension given by the number of non-crossing partitions of n. So, I'm just going to do sort of the combinatorial thing, right? And say, well, define these non-crossing partitions to be a formal basis. Partitions to be a formal basis, and the question is: how do we define an action of SN on this vector space? Well, we have an action of Sn on the collection of all set partitions of N, crossing or otherwise. And now we get to this example, non-example picture, which I kind of copied and pasted in this slide. But the problem with this action is: well, as you can see, it doesn't preserve the non-crossing property. So, for example, you know, these two partitions will be in the same S in orbit. Will be in the same Sn orbit. So the idea is: well, to get an action of Sn on this vector space, we're going to have to resolve crossings somehow. And that led to this definition of, well, the skein action. So the vector space spanned by non-crossing partitions carries an action of Sn. And I'll tell you the action of an adjacent transposition Si. So if pi is a non-crossing partition, well, Pi is a non-crossing partition. Well, SI acting on pi is negative si of pi. If si of pi is still non-crossing, that might happen. However, if kind of moving the vertices i and i plus one past each other introduced a crossing, well, you have to resolve that crossing somehow. So you resolve it as sort of a linear combination like this, right? So the flavor of the resolution depends on. Flavor of the resolution depends on the sizes of the blocks being crossed. Are they of size two? Are they of size bigger than two? And you might recognize this top stain relation from a number of places, right? So it's this idea that if I have a crossing, I resolve in two ways horizontal, vertical, add them up. It comes up in cluster algebras. It's an example of a Pluka relation. The simplest Pluka relation comes up. Simplest Pluker relation comes up in the theory of temporally Lieb algebras. Things like this come up in knot theory. So you've probably seen this equation before. But well, these bottom two ones were a little bit new. So they kind of were created to have this action. So solutions and other problems. Well, these skein modules that they did give algebraic proofs of the Catalan, Nariana, and Pachinic CSPs on the one hand. China CSPs on the one hand. However, trying to prove representation theoretic properties of the skein modules, these proofs were really, really involved. So like even showing that this action respects the Cox dilations, that involved like all of these sort of miraculous like 16-term identities that magically happen to hold. And it really led to the question: what is going on here in some sense? Going on here in some sense. And to reiterate this feeling of what is going on here, well, where the heck do these bottom two skein relations come from? We have all of these mathematical contexts where the top skein relation occurs. Where do these lower two come from? And well, this question was only really addressed in the last year and actually sort of by two groups independently. So it was me and my student, and also Oliver Pachanik, Jessica Stryker, and Jessica Stryker and Becky Petrius. So I invite you to see Oliver's talk for, I guess, another place where these lower two skein relations appear in the context of invariant theory. Okay, so now we're moving on to something that is seemingly different, the theory of invariance and co-invariance. So we're going to consider the action of Sn on the Going to consider the action of Sn on the polynomial ring and n variables given by variable permutation. So, as you guys know, elements of the associated invariant subring are called symmetric polynomials. And Isaac Newton says that this invariant subring is generated by the elementary symmetric polynomials, E1 up through EN. Brendan, can I just ask a question about the previous slide? Certainly. How hard is it to describe the How hard is it to describe the basis of this ring that gives you these CSPs? I mean, the basis of these modules? The basis is by definition the non-crossing partitions. So what I'm doing is I'm literally taking this set of non-crossing partitions, forming the vector space that has it as a formal basis. Oh, I see. And then saying, oh, I'm combinatorially doing this. And one little remark: there's a little bit of historical revisionism here. Provisionism here. This sign convention was a little bit different. If you look at my original paper, this is actually the correct sign convention, and the correct sign convention became clear throughout the course of this project. Okay, I see. And the cyclic action just preserved. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Of course. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Any questions, feel free to interrupt. I have a question as well, Brendan. Yes. So the Krever's compliment. So, the Creverous complement is kind of like a square root of rotation. Are you able to get that as well? So, Creverus complement changes the number of blocks, of course. It complements the number of blocks. So, in this direct picture, it's not so obvious how to get this. When we move to the world of fermions, there may be some slight hope, but it seems a little harder. It seems a little harder. So stay tuned. Okay. So symmetric polynomials. Well, they're very interesting objects, of course, for us as mathematicians, but from the point of the symmetric group, they're a little boring, right? I mean, the symmetric group cannot change a symmetric polynomial by acting on it. So we have this representation of the symmetric group acting on a polynomial ring, and the idea is. On a polynomial ring. And the idea is we're going to kill off the boring part, so to speak. So the invariant ideal I is generated by those SN invariants. And I don't want one in an ideal. So I'm going to look at the ones with vanishing constant terms. And by Newton's theorem, that's the ideal generated by E1, E2 up through EN. And the coinvariant ring is the corresponding quotient ring of my polynomials. And this will be a graded SN module. And And this is a module that's like hugely important in algebraic combinatorics. So, for example, Chevrolet showed using Galois theory that as an ungraded module, this co-invariant ring is isomorphic to the regular representation of SN. So, it's a graded refinement of the regular representation. Lustig-Stanley gave a beautiful combinatorial formula for its graded SN isomorphism type. Borel showed it presents the cohomology of the type A flag manifold, and so on and so forth. Manifold and so on and so forth. So now we move along to a story that started at UC San Diego, maybe around 30 or so years ago. So we're going to consider now not one, but two sets of variables. So we have x variables and y variables in of each, and we have a diagonal action of Sn on this ring, right? Where W. This ring, right, where w is simultaneously permuting the x's and the y's, and to form the diagonal co-invariant ring. Well, we play the same game. We take the ring, we mod out by the ideal generated by SN invariance with vanishing constant term, and now this is going to be a bi-graded SN module. We have a grading coming from the x's and a grading coming from the y's. And Heyman used a deep algebraic geometry to prove that, well, what's the To prove that, well, what's the ungraded structure of this thing? Well, it's not permutations anymore, but now we have these size in parking functions, right? So we essentially have the permutation action of SN on size in parking functions, and we twist by sign. Okay, so co-invariance, diagonal coinvariance. Well, how are we going to get a new twist on this story? Well, starting in, I guess I would say. Well, starting in, I guess I would say 2019, roughly, a lot of people started looking at, well, actions of SN on superspace. So this had been considered by, from a combinatorial point of view, by people like Luc LaPont for a while. So what's a superspace? Well, now the idea is we have n commuting variables. We'll call these commuting variables x's. And n anti-commuting variables. We'll call these anti-commuting variables thetas. Anti-commuting variables thetas. And formally, superspace of rank n is the well-tensor product of the polynomial ring in the x's with the exterior algebra over the thetas. So these are the relations satisfied in this ring. And again, we have a diagonal action of Sn by subscript permutation. And a little bit of physics. The commuting variables, the x's, are often called a bosonic. So we kind of think. So we kind of think of like xi squared as being two indistinguishable bosons in state i. And the anti-commuting variables are called fermionic. So like theta i squared, I guess that's always zero. And that corresponds to the Pauli exclusion principle. I'm not allowed to have two electrons. I'm not allowed to have two fermions in state I. And there's a still open conjecture by the combinatorics group at the Fields Institute. Institute that the superspace co-invariant ring that I would get by well taking this object and modding out by the invariance with vanishing constant term, at least as an ungraded SN module, is the sine twist of the action of Sn on, well, this is my notation for all ordered set partitions of the set one up through n. So this is dimension given by an ordered bell number. So we had two sets of. So, we had two sets of commuting variables. We had a set of commuting, a set of anti-commuting. And now we're going to have two sets of anti-commuting. So, my convention here is that I guess a Latin letter corresponds to commuting variables. A Greek letter means anti-commuting. So, I have now theta and xi representing two sets of n anti-commuting variables. And the fermionic diagonal coefficient. The fermionic diagonal coinvariance are what you get by taking this exterior algebra over these two n generators and modding out by all the invariants with vanishing constant term. And this, again, is a bigraded SN module. And just one remark. So I worked on this with Zhong Wong Kim, who's a student of Jim Haglund's at UPenn. And my graduate student is Jesse Kim at UCSD. So their last names are both Kim. Their first names both start with Jay. Names both start with J. So Zhang Wong Kim and Jesse Kim, that's perhaps the most efficient way I can refer to them both effectively. So Zhang Wong Kim and I showed that the vector space dimension of this thing is a binomial coefficient, 2n minus 1 choose n. This proved a conjecture of Zabraki. And you might wonder about the bigraded structure. And yes, about that bigraded the FDRN. The FDRN, the thetas and the size now commute. No, no, no, they all anti-commute. So it's just actually just a big list of 2n anti-commuting variables. If you like, yes. Yes. Okay. So what about the bi-graded structure? Well, the IJ piece. The ij piece, so theta degree i xi degree j of f dr n is actually going to be zero unless i plus j is less than n. These are rings that live in triangles. And when i plus j is less than n, we have an explicit expression for the isomorphism type encoded as a symmetric function for Banius image in terms of well-chronic products of Hookshire functions or a difference thereof. So here's an example. Thereof. So here's an example. The bi-graded isomorphism type of FDR4, right? So this is a bi-graded module over S4, looks something like this. And we see this nice triangular structure. Okay, so what does this have to do with non-crossing partitions? Well, let's look at the bigraded Hilbert series of FDR4. So now I'm just encoding, well, not bi-graded isomorphism type, but bi-graded. Not bigrated isomorphism type, but bigrated vector space dimension. So now I have a triangle of numbers. And along this diagonal, we see 1, 6, 6, 1. And 1 plus 6 plus 6 plus 1 is 14. That's the fourth Catalan number. And well, 1, 6, 6, and 1 are the four Nariana numbers for n equal 4. And there's a theorem that I proved with now Jesse Chem that for values of k between 1 and n, this gain action now on k block non-kin. On K-block non-crossing partitions of N is isomorphic to, well, the relevant extreme bi-degree component of FDRN as an SN module. So we have this connection between the combinatorics of the stain action and the algebra of fermionic diagonal coinvariance. And this isn't just an abstract isomorphism. We'll be able to make this, in fact, very precise. So, to do that, I need to talk to you a little bit about how do you. I need to talk to you a little bit about how do you do calculus with anti-commuting variables? How do we take derivatives with anti-commuting variables? So let's say we have a list of fermionic variables. I'll just call them omegas, let's say. So we have an action, which I call differentiation, you might call it contraction, of this exterior algebra on itself. And here it is. Well, if I have an exterior monomial, right? monomial, right? So these indices j1 up through jr have to be distinct. And if I act on it by omega i, well, what omega i does is it tries to look for itself. It looks for the index i inside this monomial. And if it finds it, it throws it out. And that'll cost you a sign corresponding to the position of that index. And if it doesn't find it, you get zero. So here are some examples. I have this monomial omega 3, omega 1. monomial omega 3, omega 1, omega 4. If I hit it with omega 3, I return omega 1, omega 4. Hit it with omega 1, that costs me a sign. Hit it with omega 2, I get zero. So anti-symmetric differentiation. And really, this was a brilliant insight of Jesse. We can use anti-symmetric differentiation to attach fermions to set partitions. Fermions to set partitions. So, how does this work? Well, the key definition is this notion of a block operator. So, we're going to let b be a non-empty subset of the integers between 1 and n. And we're going to define a block operator, which will be a linear operator on this fermionic diagonal coinvariant, the thing upstairs, sorry, the fermionic ring. And here's what it does. Here's what it does. So, if B is a block of size at least 2, rho B applied to F will be this thing. So, I kind of sum up over all distinct pairs of elements in B. I hit F with a theta j by contraction, and then I multiply by xi i. And kind of a degenerate case, if you like, if b is a singleton, i, you just hit f with theta i, multiply by psi i. And a fact about these block operators is that they actually commute. So, rho A, rho B equals rho B rho A for all subsets A and B. And due to this fact, right, we can actually extend these block operators from sets to set partitions. Well, sets to set partitions. So I'm going to let pi be a set partition of the numbers between 1 and n, any set partition, doesn't have to be non-crossing. If pi is blocks b1 up through bk, I can define a fermion, capital F pi, by taking the product of all the thetas, theta 1, theta 2 up through theta n, and applying the operators corresponding to the blocks of pi. And due to this commutative, Pi and due to this commutativity fact, it's immaterial which order I apply them in. And there's also going to be sort of a little friend to this fermion, a related fermion, that I just get by taking the capital F and applying as a contraction operator the sum of the xi's. That's going to be called little fπ. So here's an example: the set partition of three given by one, three, then two. 1, 3, then 2. So if I want to compute capital F, I have theta 1, theta 2, theta 3. Well, I hit it with row 2, and well, up to sine, row 2 wants to take out a theta 2 and add a psi 2, and that's what it does. And now I hit it with row 1, 3. So row 1, 3 is, well, now looking at distinct pairs, 1, 3, and 3, 1. And again, taking out a theta, putting in a xi. out a theta, putting in a xi. And for little f, I just take that and I apply xi one plus xi two plus psi three. And well, sort of one observation here is that, well, what do these block operators do? They turn thetas into xi's. If pi has k blocks, well, then the capital F thing will have bi degree n minus k, and the little f thing will have bi degree n minus k minus one. And well, I wonder. Minus one. And well, one remark for people who've kind of looked at co-invariant and harmonic theory. There seems to be some similarity between these row operators and the polarization operators that appear there. There are these operators that somehow turn X variables into Y variables. They really are quite important. And I kind of wonder if these block operators might be useful in more generality. Okay. Okay, so what can we prove about these guys, these fermions for set partitions? Well, if pi is a non-crossing partition of n, and if I take f pi and if I act on it by si, well, what I get satisfies the skein relations, right? So I get negative si f s i pi. negative si f s i pi if s i pi is non-crossing and well what i get is something i'm writing like this so this is really a sum of two three or four terms depending if si of pi was crossing and uh this block operator formulation really lets you see that in some sense this bottom thing is the only skein relation and these top two things are in some sense degenerations of that and if you look at the proof it really just kind of pops out and Out. And the same goes for the little f's. So what do these set partition fermions have to do with fermionic diagonal coinvariance? Well, if I let k be between 1 and n, well, the set of not the capital F's, but the little f's, that's just for degree reasons. They descend to a basis of F Dr in this extreme bi-degree m minus k k minus one, if I only consider those little f's corresponding to non-crossing partitions, right? So this is kind of describing the extremal bi-degrees of these diagonal coinvariants in a combinatorial way. And just to remark, in forthcoming solo work, Jesse was able to find a sort of skein-like basis of the other by. Of skein-like basis of the other bi-degrees as well, the ones that aren't necessarily in the boundary. So, if you like symmetric functions, you might want to know, well, what is the Frobenius image of this thing? So I guess the skein action, it preserves not just the number of blocks, but also the number of singleton blocks, if you think about it. So if I let NCNKM be the, oh boy, non-crossing partition. Be the oh boy, non-crossing partitions of n with k blocks and in singletons, these uh vector space direct sums are actually direct sums of SN modules. So I can kind of break up my SN module in a somewhat immediate way to these pieces in C and K M. And well, those pieces themselves are, as it turns out, induction products. So it's a, what's the Frobenius image? I have like a flag-shaped sure function times a column. A picture function times a column. So, what else can we do with these skein relations? Well, one thing is crossing resolution. So, this is, well, sort of an object you guys might have seen in the context of matching. So, if you consider a matching M, doesn't have to be a perfect matching, you can resolve the crossings in M with repeated applications of this move. So, I can take an X and resolve it in both. So I can take an x and resolve it in both possible ways. And for example, if I look at the asterisk of order four, and if I resolve it, well, I get a combination of these, well, 14 terms, and I have some kind of interesting coefficients that appear. So you might do this resolution representation theory. You might do it in geometry. You might just kind of appreciate it for combinatorial purposes. But how do we move beyond matchings? How might we incorporate larger blocks? Incorporate larger blocks. Well, fermions let you do this. So as it turns out, the space spanned by, well, say all the capital F's corresponding to set partitions, these capital F's are linearly dependent. If I want to extract a basis, a basis is obtained by looking at the capital F's for non-crossing set partitions. So what does that mean? Well, for any set partition pi of n, I can take I can take this capital F and expand in my basis. And as it turns out, it's not too hard to see that these coefficients that appear in the expansion will be integers. And along with Jesse Chem, I define the crossing resolution of pi, this potentially crossing set partition, well, to be the corresponding linear combination of non-crossing partitions, right? So it's kind of popping out at you. So this is what it might look like. So, this is what it might look like. So, here's a crossing, a very crossing, set partition of one through eight. And if I apply this crossing resolution, I get this. So, we see some plus signs, we see some minus signs. Let me first remark that this agrees with the matching case, at least up to a global sign. And also, there is a purely combinatorial way to do this resolution. You don't actually have to look at these fermions kind of expand in terms of a basis. Kind of expand in terms of a basis. We have a combinatorial way to describe it. I'm not talking about it here, but it's in the paper. So what else can we show about this resolution? Well, it satisfies a nice equivariance property. So I'm going to let pi n be the family of all set partitions of one up through n, crossing or otherwise. And I'm going to give the vector space spanned by pi n, well, By pi n, well, this star s n action. So, this is, well, the permutation action of s n, but I'm twisting by the sine representation. So, w star pi is the sine of w times, well, the set partition I get by applying w to pi. And the theorem here is that this crossing resolution, right, from the things spanned by all set partitions to the things banned by non-crossing set partitions. Things spanned by non-crossing set partitions is actually well, it's a projection, so it fixes the non-crossing guys, and it's an SN equivariant projection. So it's a homomorphism of SN modules. And well, one corollary to this is that if pi is non-crossing and w is a permutation such that w of pi is also non-crossing, so I can somehow go from non-crossing to non-crossing. Well, then if I take pi and if I apply w to And if I apply W to it with this gain action, what I get is the sine of W times, well, the image of pi under W. So let's have an example to see like what this is saying. So here's a non-crossing partition of six, and let's apply, well, this interesting element, the rotation to it, right? So this is the long cycle in S6. It certainly sends any non-crossing particular. Certainly sends any non-crossing partition to a non-crossing partition. And well, if I want to use the skein action naively, I would factor this thing in terms of SIs, right? So I start with this, and I want to apply S5. So five and six are in the same block, so I just get a formal negation. Next up, I want to apply S4. Now, if I apply S4, right, the five and the four are going to introduce a crossing, so I better resolve. Crossing, so I better resolve it. And now I have a linear combination of three terms. Now, to apply S3, I swap the three and the four. As it turns out, this doesn't introduce any crossings. Sorry about the compression here. Next up, I have to swap the two and the three. So I guess it kind of does different sorts of things to these three different non-crossing partitions. So we have a linear combination of five things. Linear combination of five things, but if you'll notice, we have a little bit of cancellation there to make our lives easier. And now we have to swap the one and the two. And this might look crazy. We have a linear combination of seven things, but six of them cancel. And we're left with one thing. And if you look at the remaining thing, well, it's the image of the first thing, but rotated by one notch. And we picked up a minus sign, which is. And we picked up a minus sign, which is also the sign of the permutation c. And this was predicted by equivariance, right? So this is something that is not so obvious on the level of this gain action, but equivariance says it must happen. So kind of future directions, you might wonder, what about other reflection groups? Well, if W is a complex reflection group acting irreducibly on its reflection representation V, you can do You can do a similar setup to the fermionic diagonal coinvariance. So, w axon, well, not just v, but also the dual space v dual, and the direct sum of v with v dual, and the exterior algebra over this direct sum. And well, this exterior algebra is a doubly graded W module. You would put V in one grading and V dual in the other. And Zhang Wan and I can. And Zhang Wan and I considered the W fermionic coinvariant ring to be the quotient of this exterior algebra by, well, the ideal generated by W invariants with vanishing constant terms. So we kind of copy and paste the definition. And the behavior here is actually, well, considerably different from the behavior in the commuting case. So whenever the dimension of w is v minus one, well, one well these bi-degrees vanish right unless i plus j is less than n and when i plus j equals n well this extremal bi degree piece has dimension given by the type a nariana number so it's not like the type w catalan type w nariana type w type w nariana we're always getting these uh type a objects so we have an action of w Of w on a vector space given by the type A Catalan number, which refines into submodules of Narayana dimension. And well, a question you might ask is, is there a combinatorial way to describe this module? Type W acting on type A. And with that, I would like to thank you all for listening. Okay, let's thank Brendan. Okay, let's thank Brendan. And are there any questions? I have a question. Hey, thank you. Hey, Brendan. It was cool stuff, Brennan. Really, really neat, this whole story. Maybe I have two, but I'll start with one. I think it's related to what Sam Hopkins was asking about the Creb Rust complement. So in your... So, in your diagonal, the fermionic diagonal coinvariance along the diagonal there of the triangle, you could swap the theta and the xi variables and it would give you a symmetry. So does that on some level relate to the Kreboros complement? That was what I was hoping. And I'm sorry I didn't get back to you, Sam, about that. But yeah, you do have this beta xi swap. It's not coverist complement. And I'm actually not sure. And I'm actually not sure how to sort of understand that in terms of these non-crossing partitions, but yeah. Can I ask one more? Sure. So you had your equivariant map from the space of set partitions to the non-crossings. If you don't try to tie that at all to the fermionic, you know, diagonal co-invariant picture, but just look at this, is there Look at this. Is there a, you know, like a Basis, Garside monoid generalization to finite Coxeter groups where you have the intersection lattice, the flats, and the non-crossing flats, and like an equivariant. That's another excellent question. So the fermionic world does seem kind of tied to type A in some sense, but that's a very natural thing to look at. And yeah, I'm not sure. Great. Great. Thanks. Other questions? This was sort of asked already, but what is known about the case when you have two fermionic sets, but they commute among each other? Actually, it's the same. So, you know, if you look at the bi-graded SN module structure of the coinvariance in that case, you get exactly the same structure there. So it doesn't matter in some sense. I think Rosa raised her hand at some point. I think Rosa raised her hand at some point. Is there some way to put a cue into things and maybe get a braid group action on the not-crossing partition, sort of upgrade your symmetric group action? Well, I mean, you can do the boring thing right inflate, but yeah, so. Yeah, so I'm not really sure if there's like sort of an interesting Q analog, like a Heckey action or a zero-heckey action. I mean, abstractly, there has to be, since the Hecke algebra for generic parameter is isomorphic to the symmetric group algebra, but I'm not quite sure how this would look. My question may be just a lowbrow version of Nathan's question, but going back to the prehistory of skein relations back in Knott Theory in the 80s, is there any story analogous to your theory that has a story that is? Analogous to your theory that is a story that is undercrossings and overcrossings? I'm all ears. You know, if you can sort of imagine these blocks as being like little sheets, right, that might cross under or over each other. Well, number one, does it kind of correspond to something else topologically, right? And can we make sense of this resolution that way in general? I mean, sort of a connection between this resolution and other areas of mathematics. I'm really excited that this. I'm really excited that this group of people found a connection with invariant theory. But any place you see that basic crossing, uncrossing relation, if you can generalize that, that'd be terrific. It looks like we have three other questions. So we still have a little bit of time. I don't know. Jinxal? Yeah, thank you. Thank you for the great talk. And when you describe the way you expand the set partition in, Expand the set partition into non-crossing ones. Are there cases when positivity comes up? For example, for matching, it expands as a positive sum of non-crossing matchings. That's correct. And here it'll actually be positive or purely negative. I'm not sure. I haven't really looked at that if there are other cases that you happen to get positivity. But that's a good question. Okay, thank you. Jean? Jean, did you have a question? Hi, yeah. I was thinking, going back to this double fermionic picture, where you have these contraction and multiplication operators. I think there's actually an SL2 action there on this big exterior algebra where you can take a, choose a. can take a choose a anti-symmetric form on these you know between these two n variables and you can create a kind of degree two element of this Grassmann algebra and multiplication by it is you know implementing the E operator of SL2 and then can kind of there's a contraction operator which implements F and I'm just wondering if you've thought about Just wondering if you've thought about how this action of SL2, the interplay of that with what's going on here with your... Well, so it does in fact show up already in this bigrated isomorphism type. So if you'll notice, like if I look at any isotypic component, we have this kind of diagonal axis of symmetry. So these various isotopic components, so to speak, come in strings. Components, so to speak, come in strings. And the reason why they come in strings is you have this commuting action of SL2 that's sort of swapping your two sets of variables. If you like, if you have a two-bion matrix of variables, you have SN acting on the columns and SL2 acting on the rows. Ah, okay. This is how you're going to. Okay.
