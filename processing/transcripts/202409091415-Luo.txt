Um, so I did um TDDFT in my PhD, and Michele once was on the thesis committee. And in the in the question section, he asked me about the orbital-free DFT. Why do you need a conscious? Why do you need a Kong Shan, right? At that time, I wasn't able to answer precisely. I don't know if Michele remembers. But then I have that question in mind and then really think about my understanding of DFT. Probably that was a dilemma for me. But then I moved to Cornell. To Cornell for an unsuccessful year in postdoc, but then I moved to Florida working with Sam Tricky. So I really started to understand of the free DFT. So we had some progress in the pseudo density based scheme. Scheme where we can treat solids. Now, the work I'm talking about here is about electron density. So the focus here is to see how good our current semi-local kinetic energy functionals behave for our electron systems. Here, the atoms and the diagonal. And the die atoms. So here is a little bit of background. So I assume that everybody knows this pretty well. But anyway, I want to point that the first equation is the usual definition of the kinetic energy density. And for the ground case purpose, we have the occupation number to be Occupation number to be two, and the number of orbitals is the number of electrons divided by two. And this quantity is not a positive definite, so we have another quantity which we call tau plus, which is a semi-positive definite. So these two kinetic energy density is identical. Kinetic energy density is identical with a difference up to Laplacian of the density. And our approximation here, we're focusing on the semi-local functional. So the form usually writes in the form of equation four, where we have an enhancement factor f which can depend on the density. Depends on the density itself, the gradient, and the Laplacian. The tau Tf is the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy density with the Thomas constant here. So inspired by the exchange correlation functional development, we have the enhancement factor written in terms of the dimensionless variable S and Q, where S is a Where S depends on the gradient and the Q depends on the Laplacian. So here the F, we assume, so because we're trying to compare the reference, which is the Cohen-Shan system, and our approximation. So we have to compare both positive quantities. Quantities. So we want to understand those semi-local functionals. So we need to come up with some performance indicators. So the first quantity, without thinking too much, is the kinetic energy because we're trying to approximate it. So we define the local difference. Local difference as in the equation 8, tau approximate minus tau reference, and integrated over the whole space. And that gives our the first indicator. But as we know, that some in some regions you probably overestimate, or some regions you underestimate. So it's probably a cancellation of errors make you a good indicator delta. Indicator delta. So we naturally define the second indicator, which is taking the absolute value of the kinetic energy differences and sum it up. So, those two indicators are the main things I'm going to talk about later. But since because But since because the kinetic energy scales roughly to the z, I don't remember the exact power, but so in order to compare different systems, different systems with different nuclear charge, Z, so we define the relative difference so that we can compare. So that we can compare different systems across different Z. So we define the small delta in equation 8. So that's the difference divided by the constraint reference. And then we have another 11, which takes the absolute value of delta. Because delta could be either positive or negative. Positive or negative. So the way the equation 11 is to make sure that we only compare the absolute value. So to continue our study, we have to use some numerical codes. So what we use is a two-dimensional Hartree-Falk program, which can do computation. Can do computation in both Hartree Falk and DFT. There's something good about this because this is purely numerical. All the codes are the grid-based. So here is a sample grid where you can, so this is, you can only change, treat two nucleus as. Nucleus as a diatom di diatom. So there's a in the in the region around minus one and plus one, there are two nucleus. And in the case of a single atom, you can leave the right hand side empty. So in this way, we have the numeral code where we can do the Laplacian very accurately. So our goal is simple, right? We want to evaluate all the semi-local functionals we know. And so there's a list of semi-local functionals which we have in our paper. We have grouped them according to whether it's local, then it's Thomas-Fermi, then GGA type, where it depends the S variable. The S variable and also the Laplacian dependent, the Q dependence. We group them according to the chronological time they appear. So we evaluate those functionals on these systems. These systems are mostly the closed share systems. And we see how they behave, how those functions behave. So, in a three-category, the LDA is the Thomas Fermi. If we look at this plot, and it shows the percentage error, whereas the x-coordinate is a delta absolute, and that's Absolute, and that's what well, the name. You know what I'm talking. So if we so the message I want to show you is that this is the whole general picture. And I want to show you is that the lower corner where I place a box here is called Purdue. Box here is called Purdue-Constantine, which has been mentioned previously. It has the lowest delta ABS, the vertical axis. So something we can observe is that for Thomas Fermi, the quantity, the integrated quantity, has a misleadingly low percentage. So the So the yellow one, and if you look at its axis, it's about 10%, right? But if you look at the with without considering the error of cancellation, it's actually about 40 to 60%. So some GGAs have quite good behavior. Good behavior for electrons less than 10 and then decreases to 40 to 20. And then some GGAs have actually performs better than the meta GGAs. So there's no trend that you can say that meta GGA behaves better than the GGAs. So the take-home message is that the Proto-Count standing is consistently superior with the Delta ABS below 10%. So here are some more detailed examples of how each functional behaves. So for the best one, I think it's the Best one, I think, it's the it's a m magenta one. It's a GDS08. So this is GGA. And then for the meta GGAs, so you can see the lowest value on the left is actually the PC ones. And the meta GAs can have also very Can have also very large errors, 60%. So here are some data for some typical systems where we can compare those indicators, delta and delta ABS. And we can see that the Purdue constant in PC functional have the lowest Relative percentage error. For example, for helium, it's 5.6. Of course, for VW, it's exact, so the percentage is zero. But for example, for the krypton, you can see that if you look at the delta, the delta, this column, the PC gives 8.94, which is pretty good, right? But if you look But if you look at the delta ABS without the cancellation error, that's 233, and the percentage error is within 10%, 8.5. So those are some data. So that leads us to investigate more about the P C functional. So the P C functional, as mentioned before, it has a uh defined in terms of the z variable. Z variable, which is a modified GA4. And then there is a transition function f which starts from 0 and then transits into 1. So the parameters are fitted here with the A's and B's. So let's look at how the PC functional works for Functional works for the atoms. So, first, we, because for atoms, it's easier to visualize. So, we plot the spherically integrated kinetic energy density. And we can see that for the blue ones is a reference conchian, and the PC always overestimates the intermediate density, and it has a quite good. Has a quite good representation close to the nucleus. And for the dye atoms, because the energies are very in very different scale, so we won't be able to visualize them quick easily in terms of the kinetic energy density. So instead, we choose. So instead, we choose the enhancement factor to compare. So the Kung Shan Fs Kung Shan enhancement factor is defined as the kinetic energy of Kung Shan divided by the Thomas Fermi kinetic energy. And we can see that in between the In between the bonding area, you see that it shows like yellow to green orange scale, where we focus, since we are focusing more on the molecule. So we want to see if we are able to reduce those regions, the different. Regions, the difference. And we also did some visualization of the variable z. And you see that the scale is from 0 to 0.5. I remember it's 5389, the parameter which transitions. The parameter which transits from zero to one to one, there's a parameter A. That's the scale we are looking at. And you can see in the whole region, most of the region are very close to one. So our observation is that those regions, you transit too quickly from the VW functional to the GEA4M. So that's why. EA4M. So that's why it overestimates the kinetic energy. And this is a reference, and you see that if we look at the poly component from the Kongshan, so in the middle, and you see most region, it's blue, so it's quite close to zero. That means those energies, those poly functional are Polyfunctional are, sorry, the reference is very close to the V Vw functional. So our observation is that the premature up for transition of Z the Z variable to the GA4M is the main source of the overestimation. Source of the overestimation. So, what we are trying to do is then to look at some iso-orbital indicators to see if we can modify or improve this PC function. So, we have tried different iso-orbital indicators, like the single exponential decay detector, the density overlap. Overlap region indicator and RII interaction region indicator. However, those quantities are mainly designed for the visualization purpose, which quickly depends on the ISO value you set. So we could not use these quantities effectively, but in principle, you But in principle, you might find a way. So then we look at some other quantities, for example, the Q we mentioned before. We see that for the atoms, I believe this is a krypton atom, the poly enhancement factor look quite similar to the Quantity Q. And you see that the structure are very similar. So we believe that with some combination of S variable and Q, you should be able to construct something, you construct from Q and you should be able to map F theta. But that map we don't find, we cannot find it easily, right? So our first So our first naive attempt is that we can change the transition function by some simple Q. But in principle, it can depend on S and Q. So we test this form and on this select of closed share atoms, and we see that the dashed line is for the For the deciseful quantity delta, small delta, right? If that is used, then you should choose the alpha, which is about 0.3 or something. But then the two quantity we should choose is without the area of cancellation, is the red curve and the blue curve. So the minimum. Blue curve. So the minimum is around 0.6. So that's what we choose. So with that, we have been able to construct a functional which we called a variant of a PC functional called var PC. But that didn't improve much for the PC functional. Then we look at, because in Then we look at, because eventually we're going to look at the Born-Oppenheimer forces. So we're asking whether those functions are able to predict stable molecules. So we look at those simple systems and see how the energy curves behave. So for example, the Kung Shan is a black, which has a minimum around two, which is around Has around 2.2.1.13. And then if you look at the PC, they didn't give a bond molecule. But if you look at the var PC we attempt, it also doesn't give a bond molecule. So this plot gives us the hint that, okay, probably our naive question, naive trial. Question: Naive trial should combine these two, right? Then you can probably get a stable molecule. So that's what we did, right? So we construct a linear, simple linear mixing of this, the PC and the var PC, and call it Aug PC, but augmented PC. So those coefficients, well, this is a, don't, don't. This is a don't take it seriously because there's the numbers you can vary, right? But roughly half, half you can get a pretty good already. So if we combine this two, actually we did pretty good with the energies. For example, the those the delta which we should is the the right right is the column to the right. Right is the column to the right. It doesn't sabotage the original PC energies, and sometimes it gives a lower percentage error than the original PC. But there are more systems in the material, but I cannot list them in the slide. So what we have have we achieved? Have we achieved? So, from the difference of the enhancement factor, we can see that we managed to reduce the color of the intermediate region by only a little bit. But it's able to so, but it's able the most important thing is that it's able to predict. Is that it's able to predict a stable molecule? That is for the CO molecule, but we also tested for hydrogen molecule and also nitrogen molecule. The three cases we tested work pretty well. So, our message here is PC from our analysis currently is the best semi-line. Best semi-local functionals, but it's not able to predict a stable molecule. But the one that we have adapted is able to predict the close energetics, but also give reasonable bond lengths for those time molecules. And we believe that with the analysis we have conducted in this work, with a better With a better crafted region selection scheme, we can come up with a better functional than the PC.
