Okay, sorry. Right. Okay, so Alex, the stage is all yours, please. Wonderful. Thank you, Akeem. So, first, let me thank Flaminia, Rob, and Lucien for putting this on. It's been great to be reminded of how fun it is to be participating in a conference and getting excited hearing everyone's talk. So thank you for that. I want to talk to you about some work I did with Media Mari at the University of Santa Clara, Kaspar Debski, Andre Dragon, and Piotr Kochowski at the University of Gorchowski at the University of Warsaw, Philip Huhn at the Okinawa Institute of Technology, and Maximilian Locke at the University of Vienna. And what I want to tell you about today is this relational dynamics, which is a way to formulate quantum mechanics without any background temporal structure. And instead, that comes out by defining a relational dynamics between some system you're interested in and a reference frame that's functioning as a clock. And then I want to use this. As a clock. And then I want to use this formalism to talk about this thing that we call quantum time dilation, basically asking what does one clock, what's the proper time read by one clock when another clock reads a different proper time? And how does that probability and moments of that probability distribution depend on the motion of that clock? So to begin with, I think we can all agree that quantum gravity requires a new dynamical paradigm. So the way we So, the way we did physics before general relativity was that we would suppose there was this background space-time structure that we would use to construct our theories. So, if you think of Newton's law as F equals MA, there's some background time relative to which the dynamics of matter unfolds. The same thing in quantum mechanics, right? There's some background time that the Schrodinger equation is referring to that we make use of. So, usually, when we're constructing our theories, we have this. Constructing our theories, we have this crutch of this background space-time structure that we can make use of. However, we know from general relativity that space-time itself is a dynamical thing. It interacts with matter. And so when we go to quantize this theory, well, first, we can't make use of a background structure to carry out the quantization. And we should quantize both space-time and matter simultaneously and on the same footing, because they're both dynamical entities. Because they're both dynamical entities. So, how might we go about doing that? Well, the first thing, well, one way you might do it is formulate the theory in a canonical form. So, you need a phase space. And so, when we talk about space-time geometry, one choice of a phase space and canonical variables would be the three metric of three geometries and its conjugate momenta. So this phase space is what... Phase space is what Wheeler called superspace, and you can so you can think of it as this football here. And each point in that superspace corresponds to a different three-geometry. And then what you can do is take general relativity and apply it in a canonical form, or express it in a canonical form. And you find that the Hamiltonian for the theory looks something like this. So here we have these first two terms. These first two terms describe the Hamiltonian for the geometry. So you can think of this as a kinetic term, it's quadratic in this momenta here, and there's some potential that depends on the three metric. And then if we have some matter degrees of freedom in our universe, the stress energy density of the matter here couples to the gravitational degrees of freedom. And we find that the Hamiltonian is constrained to vanish. So, okay, we have our theory in a canonical form. Our theory in a canonical form, we can now try and quantize that. And one way we might go about doing that is a Dirac or canonical quantization procedure. So, how does that work is when we have a constraint, like a classical constraint like this, what we do, how we impose that in the quantum theory is we say that our physical states of our theory that are now going to describe both this geometry and the matter sector are annihilated by the constraint. And then the second thing is we need to. And then the second thing is we need to impose some dynamics. So we have a Hamiltonian. Why don't we postulate the Schrödinger equation? And so we would say, well, okay, the way that our physical state of geometry and matter evolves, well, is equal to the Hamiltonian times the physical state. But because the physical state is constrained to vanish, actually our physical state of geometry and matter doesn't evolve. And so we're left with this frozen state of matter and geometry, and we're immediately. Geometry, and we're immediately confronted with the question of: well, how do we recover the usual notion of dynamics that we see around us in this quantum theory? And if you think, why does the Hamiltonian vanish and why is it like this? Well, if it wasn't like this, it would be weird, right? Because if this wasn't equal to zero, then the Hamiltonian of GR would define some evolution with respect to a preferred time, right? And so we know that one of the main lessons of general relativity is that there isn't some. General relativity isn't that there isn't some preferred absolute time structure. So that's really the origin of this constraint. But now we're tasked with: well, okay, we need to give an explanation of how we can get a notion of dynamics from this frozen state psi. So one proposal was known as the Page and Wooters formalism, or also known as the conditional probability interpretation, put forward in the early 80s. And so we're going to consider a simpler system, not GR, it's a little too complicated. GR, it's a little too complicated. But let's just suppose we have a clock system, we can associate it with a Hilbert space. And let's suppose we have some other system. This could be a particle or it could be a whole collection of particles, everything else we want to group into this system. And so that the joint Hilbert space is this tensor product of both of them. And the next thing we can do is we can impose a Hamiltonian constraint similar to that of GR, but a little nicer, where we say that. Nicer, where we say that the Hamiltonian of the clock, so this HC here, plus the Hamiltonian of our system, annihilate the physical state here, psi, which is going to describe both the clock and the system. And so again, we have a frozen state, so the problem is very similar. And the question is, well, can we recover a relational notion of dynamics between this system and clock? I just want to make a kind of technical subtle point is that it may be that you can only solve this constraint. Can only solve this constraint as a distribution. So maybe it turns out in some cases that the solutions to this constraint are like the position eigenkets, right? That they're not actually proper quantum states, that they're not normalized in the inner product on the kinematical Hilbert space. So what one has to do is actually take the solution space of this constraint, form a new Hilbert space by introducing a new inner product and completing it appropriately. So just to say that we get Just to say that we get potentially, depending on the form of this constraint, a different physical Hilbert space that these states live in. All right. And the next step is we need to construct a time observable because what we're going to be interested in is basically making statements of what is the system doing when the clock reads a particular time. So, how are we going to define our time observable? Well, we're going to appeal to this. Well, we're going to appeal to this notion of an observable as a positive operator-valued measure, and it's going to have certain properties in how it relates to this clock ample. So, what is a POVM? Well, it describes a measurement with measurement outcomes in some set G here. I'm going to take this to be a one-dimensional group in a second. And what it is, is basically a map from the measurement outcomes to these effect operators. And I'm going to take these effect operators to be one-dimensional projectors. Projectors that are associated with the clock reading a particular time t. And so, if you wanted to calculate probabilities, maybe you take the state of the clock and take, you know, multiply it by this effect operator and take the trace, and that would give you probability of the clock remote. But now, what makes Tc a time observable? Well, let's just suppose you have some state of the clock rho, right? What does the clock Hamiltonian do? Now I'm just thinking in standard quantum mechanics for a second to mode. In standard quantum mechanics, for a second, to motivate this time observable, well, the function of this Hamiltonian is to unitarily encode the elapsed time into this state rho. And so what would a good time observable be? Well, it would be an observable that best estimates this parameter t. And in order to do that, you can make that precise. It turns out that these clock states have to be covariant with respect to the group generated by the clock Hamiltonian. So what does that mean? Is that these clock states are connected. That these clock states are connected to one another by the unitary generated by the clock Hamiltonian. So, just to have a concrete example in your mind, maybe your clock is like a particle on a line, and the different times read by the clock correspond to different position eigencetts, and the Hamiltonian in this case would be the momentum, which generates translation. So, that could be one example of a clock. All right, so we have our time observable. We have our time observable on our clock system. We have our constraint. And now, what I want you to consider is some observable on the system. Okay, so maybe we can describe it by these effect operators with associated with different outcomes, A, and the set of all possible outcomes. So we have an observable on our clock and observable on our system. And the way dynamics arises here, and why it was originally called this conditional probability interpretation, is that dynamics arises from conditional. Arises from conditional probabilities that look something like this. So we can ask, well, what's the probability of outcome A of this system observable when the clock reads the time t? And so we can construct this. Here are our states, our physical states. In the numerator here, this is something like the probability of the clock reading T and getting outcome A. And then we're going to divide that by the probability getting finding. Getting finding the clock return t. And so, how does the dynamics arise? Well, or how can we sort of reconcile this or recover our standard picture of dynamics? Well, if we define this conditional state of the system, right, so we can take our physical state and condition it on one in which the clock reads the time t, then we can express this probability as this standard probability amplitude that we would expect from. Amplitude that we would expect from orthodox quantum mechanics. And moreover, this conditional state here satisfies the Schrödinger equation. So in this way, by looking at these conditional probabilities and making this specific identification here, namely that this conditional state is the standard state in orthodox quantum mechanics in the Schrodinger picture, then we've succeeded at recovering a notion of relational dynamics. A notion of relational dynamics from this constraint. So it's all good. We solved the problem of time. That's the end of the talk, but no, that's not actually the case. What happened is after this proposal was put out, Carl Kukash, who is a really influential figure in the quantum gravity community, raised a pretty serious criticism against the approach. So this is an excerpt he said from a conference in 91 after Don Page. After Don Page had given a talk on the topic, he said to Don, he said, You never apply the conditional probability formula to answering the fundamental dynamical question of the internal Schrödinger interpretation or this conditional probability interpretation, namely, if one finds the particle at A at the time t1, what is the probability of finding it at B at the time t2? So what he's saying is, let's suppose we have our state, we make some measurement, we get outcome A, and then things go. And then things go forward, and then at some later time, indicated by the clock, we make another measurement and get outcome B. We can associate these events with these effect operators here associated with the clock reading T1 and getting outcome A and T2 and outcome B. And then what Kukash was really saying in this, he says, is, well, you should really be looking at conditional probabilities that look something like this, namely what's the probability of B when the clock reads T2 conditioned on A. Conditioned on A when T1. And so if you do this conditional probability, this is something that looks a little like Luter's rule here, right? You find that you get something proportional to the delta function squared. So that should make you nervous. But the only time it's non-zero is when T1 equals T2. And the important point is that you don't recover what you would expect in standard quantum theory, namely that, you know, if you find the outcome A at T1, well, you should expect the probability of getting out. Well, you should expect the probability of getting outcome B at T2 is basically just this probability amplitude squared here, where this is the unitary generated by the system Hamiltonian. So, okay, so here was Kukash's criticism. He said, in brief, your interpretation prohibits the time to flow and the system to move. For me, this virtually amounts to a reducto ad absurdum of the conditional probability proposal. So, Don in the question period fired back. He said, only quantities at a single instant of time. Only quantities at a single instant of time are directly accessible. And so one cannot directly test the two-time probabilities you discussed. One could instead, at one time, test the conditional probability that the particle is at B, given that the time is T2, and that this time there is a record indicating that the particle was at A at the time T1. So he's saying, really, the only thing we can, you know, we're only have access to the world at one instant of time. So these conditions. At one instant of time, so these conditional probabilities that Kukash was talking about, they're not really physically accessible, so let's not worry about them. And Kukash says, Don, you're the first person I met who simultaneously believes in the existence of many worlds and is a solo cyst of an instant. So I like the way he worded that. And then Don goes on to reply, he says, well, really, you know, you should be looking at correlations and memories, sort of rephrasing what he said here. So let's just look at a history of the citations to the original page readers. The citations to the original Page Wooters article. So Don Page put it out in 84. There was Wooters wrote a follow-up article. Not much happened for a couple of years. And then Don wrote a few more articles. But this is when Kukash's criticism came. First at this conference, this NATO conference. And then second in 92, when he wrote this seminal review on time and interpretations of quantum gravity. And he basically went through a long And he basically went through a long laundry list of all possible ways of solving this problem of time and just said none of them work, including this conditional probability interpretation. So then nobody really worked on it. So we kind of entered this dark ages period. And then in 2004, there were two papers put out. There was one by Carl Bolvey that was just posted on the archive and didn't really receive much attention. It was never published, but it started to address Kukash's criticism. And then there was also a modification to the proposal put forward by. To the proposal put forward by Gambini, Porto, and Pulin that really pushed the program, or they made a modification, but then they wrote several follow-up articles and got some, made some progress in that direction. But then the interest kind of died out again until 2015, when Giovanetti, Lloyd, and Macone wrote this nice article called Quantum Time. And again, they addressed Kukash's criticism. And the way they addressed it was exactly how Way they addressed it was exactly how Don described. They introduced some memories and they introduced some coupling of some von Neumann measurement model to couple the memory to the system at a particular time. And then they could write this conditional probability exactly in the way Don describes in his comment. But I think more importantly, what they did is they recast this whole thing in a language that was accessible to those in the quantum information community. And from there, there were lots of interest in it and developments. And I would bet by the end of the year. And developments. And I would bet by the end of the year that this point is probably going to be somewhere up here. So that's the history of it. And so I think for this reason, there's still lots to be done and lots of questions to explore in this conversation. I want to talk about another way to get over Kukash's criticism. So I'll say that Giovanni, Lauderdale Macron, they gave a resolution that was sort of sympathetic to what Don was saying. But you can also resolve Kukash's criticism in the way he liked or the way he wanted to. In the way he liked, or the way he wanted to, in terms of making sense of these two time-conditional probabilities. And the way to do that is to define these so-called relational Dirac observables. And we've already seen these sort of written in different notation yesterday and today. But basically, what we do is we define these relational Dirac observables on the physical Hilbert space that we associate with this proposition, or maybe if I want to be provocative, this event when the system reads, you know, has a system reads, you know, has outcome A when the clock reads at time T. And what you do is basically you take these effect operators associated with these, tensor them together, and then do this so-called G twirl over the group generated by that constraint. And what this does is, because you're averaging over this group, is this this observable is manifestly invariant under a gauge transformation generated by this constraint. And so what is its role or why can we interpret it to be associated with this proposition? Interpreted to be associated with this proposition. Well, you can show that if you take the expectation value of this observable in the physical inner product that I introduced before, so I've kind of suppressed, but all of the inner products we've been looking at before are ones on the kinematical Hilbert space. But if you formulate this physical observable on the physical Hilbert space and take its expectation in the physical inner product, you recover this Page-Wooter's conditional state and the standard time L. State and the standard time evolution in quantum mechanics. So that's the role of these relational Dirac observables. But then now, if you answer Kukash's, you can answer Kukash's question exactly in the way he wanted, but you need to make sure you're using these relational Dirac observables and taking the physical inner product here, and you can recover the correct propagator here. So you can resolve it. I mean, so this controversy that I think stalled progress on this proposal, you can. On this proposal, you can resolve it either the way Kukash wanted to or the way Don wanted to. You have your choice. So, before I go on to talk about this quantum time dilation, I just want to mention briefly how this fits into this bigger picture. I talked about this Page and Wooter's picture that results in this relational Schrödinger picture and this notion of dynamics in terms of these relational Dirac observables. And it turns out that these are, in fact, equivalent. And there's another framework that we also. And there's another framework that we also heard a little bit about, this perspective neutral framework, that is also been shown in a different context to be equivalent to these relational Dirac observables. And so in some of the models we've been looking at so far, it turns out that, again, this relational Schrodinger picture and this perspective neutral framework are also equivalent for the models we've looked at. And I will just say, I think one of the exciting things is that these reference frame transformations that we've Transformations that we've heard a lot about so far can actually be embedded within this formalism. So this paper, Esteban, Feminia, Alessio, and Chaslov, they used the page and Worders formalism and they showed that within that, if you wanted to change clock reference frames within the page orders formalism, the frame transformations are exactly as you would expect from the previous work. Alex, this is the 20 minutes mark. Perfect. Thank you. Perfect, thank you. Okay, so the last part isn't nearly as long, but what I want to do is use this formalism to ask this question. What is the time dilation of one clock relative to another? And how I want to make sense of this question is using these conditional probabilities I spoke about. I want to ask, what's the probability that clock A here reads the proper time tau A when this other clock over here reads the proper time? This other clock over here reads the proper time τ b. And we want to compute this such that the motion of these clocks can be non-classical, namely it could be moving in a superposition of two momentum wave packets. So just to quickly describe the model, we have some action, and this action is describing a relativistic particle. So here's the proper time, and this first part is a contribution. First part is a contribution proportional to the rest mass of the particle. And then the second part describes an internal degree of freedom of the clock that evolves with respect to the proper time along this clock. So this whole bit here is the Lagrangian. You can write it in a canonical form and you again get a constraint just like I described before, except now that we have this internal degree of freedom, instead of getting the standard relativistic dispersion relation, this m is replaced by this mass operator here, which is a combination of this rest mass plus this. Of this rest mass plus this dynamical mass that's being associated with the Hamiltonian that's generating this evolution of the internal clock degree of freedom. You can factorize this. This is a quadratic equation. You can factorize it into two parts that commute, C plus and C minus. And so what we're going to do is actually just restrict to C plus as our constraint, something like this for simplicity. And you find that your physical states. And you find that your physical states look something like this, where this is the momentum conjugate to the temporal degree of freedom of the particle, and this looks like the relativistic Hamiltonian of that particle. You can again define a conditional state when the temporal degree of freedom of the particle is associated with some time t. And that's going to give you a conditional state of the center of mass degrees of freedom of the clock plus this internal clock degree of freedom state. And you can show that. State, and you can show that again this satisfies the relativistic Schrödinger equation. So, coming back to this question, you can formulate this probability, this conditional probability, in terms of something that looks a little bit like this. So we're asking, what's the probability of tau A when clock reads tau B? And you can consider the case where this clock A is now moving in a momentum superposition of two momentum wave packets and ask, well, if I compute the average of this distribution, what do I get? Distribution, what do I get? And it looks something like this. The average proper time read off clock A, conditioned on clock B reading a particular time tau B looks something like this, where we have what I'm going to call this classical gamma factor and this quantum gamma factor. So what are these? Well, this first part is just a statistical mixture of the time dilation we would expect if If this clock particle was moving with a speed associated with this average momenta here of this wave packet, weighted by cosine squared. And similarly for PA bar prime. So this is just an average of these classical time durations. But here, this quantum contribution depends on the relative phase and is a consequence of the coherence between these wave packets. And so when it's this contribution. When it's this contribution that we say leads to this quantum time dilation, you can plot this, and I mean, I don't think its shape is too important, but what I want to put, so I'm plotting it here as a function of the difference in momenta of the wave packet. But what I want to point out is that there's an optimal separation in the average momenta of these wave packets that maximizes this effect. So, yeah. So, yeah. All right. So, that was this quantum time dilation effect within this conditional probability framework. But the question we wanted to ask is: well, if I had, say, an atomic clock built on the spontaneous emission rate of an atom, is it going to see the same quantum time dilation? Alex, this is the 25 minutes mark. Okay, I'll be just one more minute and then we can go to questions. So, you can set up a model where you have your atom. Model where you have your atom coupled to the electromagnetic field, and you can do a similar calculation. The punchline is that you get the same result if you compare the spontaneous emission rate of an atom moving in a statistical mixture of different momentum wave packets versus a genuine quantum superposition. So, here we have two different clock models and two different frameworks, and we get the same quantum time dilation effect. I'll just point out it also affects the emission spectrum or the shape. Affects the emission spectrum or the shape of the emission spectrum as well. So the big question is: is this effect observable? And I'll just say we've observed time dilation for clocks moving on the order of several meters per second. And we've also been able to create momentum superpositions that are separated by several meters per second. So if you put things in, and you get the order of magnitude of this contribution is approximately 10 to the minus 15, which is on the same order of magnitude of the time dilation effect that was observed in this experiment. So maybe if we can combine. This experiment. So, maybe if we can combine these two things, that this effect is actually observable. So, with that, I'll end there and save a few minutes for questions. So, thank you. Thanks, Alex. Yes, so we still have a few minutes for discussion. Questions, please. Familia, maybe if you go first. Oh, you just actually. I was just clapping. Okay, so then I see. Edu has a question. A question also clapping. Also, what? Also, clapping. Oh, clapping. I see. Oh, this was all clapping. I see. All right. I think, well, if anybody has a question, you don't need to raise your hand. Oh, Tim, there you are. Tim, please. Hi, thanks, Alex. Nice talk. Can you say a little bit about the effect? Little bit about the effect of this quantum correction. Presumably, it's like it can lead to destructive and constructive interference type things. So do you, under certain circumstances, do you get more time dilation and other circumstances less? Is that yeah, yeah, yeah. That's exactly that's exactly it. Is that depending, sorry, I went over this a little bit quick, but that this gamma Q can be both positive. That this gamma q can be both positive and negative. And so your clock on average can take a little quicker or a little slower, depending on how you engineer this superposition. So can it ever like complete, do you ever get a null? Like, can you cancel the classical bit? Well, there are on the same order of magnitude. So actually, I think I remember a long time ago, I think I looked at this, and I think maybe. Time ago, I think I looked at this, and I think maybe potentially you can because these contributions are the same order of magnitude. And so I think you might be able to choose parameters such that you could. But Alex, aren't they all positive? No, there's a negative here. Oh, down there, there's negative. Yeah, yeah. And then this, I mean, yeah. And then I think, well, these can be negative too. Do you have an intuition for when it is? Intuition for when it is constructive, when it is destructive? In terms of when is it positive here and when is it negative here? Yes. Other than saying it depends on the relative phase and the weighting. No, I don't. I don't. Okay. And you have a paper out on that. Did you give the reference for it? Yeah, yeah, right at the end there. Okay. I think great. Maybe Magdalena has a question or she has her hand up. Yeah, now. Oh, Martelina, yes. Is that your hand up? Yeah. Can you hear me? Yep. Can you hear me? Yep, okay, great. Um, so you just um, maybe question or suggestion because, uh, I mean, obviously, um, we've been interested in the same formalism, so quantum clocks that are described by some dynamical Hamiltonian with the describing degrees of freedom. Um, so what we uh recently um found with the with Caroline is that if you want to describe the semi-classical motion of a Describe the semi-classical motion of a clock, which kind of I would infer from just the cartoons that you've drawn, then these are not states that are Gaussian states with some distribution of momentum. And this comes from the fact that if you have system with quantized mass, essentially, as you've been pointing out, and as we all understand mass-energy equivalence, then states that have semi-classical trajectories are not those that have semi-classical momentum because kinematic. Because kinematic, so the coordinate configuration space and phase space are related with this quantized mass. And so I wonder whether some of the effects that we see can come because if you describe a propagating quantum clock that has initially some semi-classical distribution of momenta, it actually dynamically will spread out because there will be different propagations in configuration space, and this would contribute to some effects that might not. Contribute to some effects that might not be related to the quantum time dilation per se. I mean, they would be related because it's all part of the framework, but they would come also from the delocalization of the different mass-energy components of the clock. Magdalena, can we please hold that thought and Alex? Because we are already eating into Edu's time. Okay, maybe we will have to. Okay, I just want to say one thing is that you can, with the Gaussian wave packet, you do recover the class. The Gaussian wave packet, you do recover the classical time dilation formula. But I did read your abstract, so maybe we can talk a little bit about that after a team session. Let's come back to that. I think it's a great question, but we have to move on to Edu now. Edu, are you ready to share?
