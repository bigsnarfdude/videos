The first talk about the minute by Daniel Albright from Toronto and he'll talk about tissue delegation performance plus on the outside. So thanks for the invitation and let me just the goal of this talk is just to describe a couple of examples. Explain them in the context of this shiftless interaction. Sorry? Sorry? Okay. So let me. Well, the first goal is to explain the integration of Poisson homogeneous spaces, and the second goal is to explain how Poisson geometry fits into this image. So let me just remind you of what I'm talking about. So we have a mini triple of E algebras, and you can Triple of Lie algebras, and you consider this simply connected integration of each of these Lie algebras. And suppose that you consider another Lagrangian Lie sub-algebra of the double. And out of this data, you can produce under certain mild conditions what is called a Poisson homogeneous plane given by this coefficient as well. So it was a natural question to integrate. It was a natural question to integrate these Poisson homogeneous cases. And well, it turns out that this integration can be achieved by performing two constructions. The first one is to integrate a certain DIAC structure on the Blue group. The second step is to reduce this Dirac structure by an action. And well, and it turns out that the This step is actually the first one, in a sense. Why is that? Because there is a possible construction for this integration of this Dirac structure. First of all, what Arique and David and Jean-Du did was the following. They integrated this algebra associated to the pressing action of the Populo and the Library. Group and then define a certain two form on this Li group, which is neither multiplicative nor closed, but has a certain magical property. Whenever we choose a Lagrangian subgroup of D, we can obtain a quasi-symplectic group that integrates the corresponding Dirac structure by using an appropriate subgroup with. using a a an appropriate subgroup of of of p of d. So it was a a bit mysterious of why what's the reason behind this disintegration. Because some geometry people are not used to finding these kind of two forms which are not predictable. So it was a natural question to ask why why does that work? I mean if it works because the proof shows that it It works because the proof shows that it works, but what's the general principle behind it? Sorry, could could you uh explain again? What is G of L? G of D? G of L. G of L. I haven't told you yet, but I will tell you in a minute. A construction, but you're talking about an instruction of G of L. Do you really think it's integration of a DRAX structure with L. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean I haven't told you I mean so far this this would be a self-sufficient of G. Would be a certain support of but I'm going to be explaining in a few points. Oh, by the way, if you have your mask on, you can roll it. We can hear you a little bit better. So, I mean, this integration of G of D is quite easy. It's just a direct product of a peripheral point of G times the Q of the middle. So I will tell you who G of L is. But then let me just tell you what's the second question that we asked ourselves. So, what is a quasi-Poisson manifold? So, if we consider a Lie group with a quadratic Lie algebra, according to Saffordov, a quasi-Hamiltonian G-space is a one-shifted Lagrangian structure on a band on a certain Lie group with morphism with targeted action group of conjugation. Of back conjugation. So it was natural, since quasi-possent manifolds are generalized, quasi-Hamilton and G-spaces, it's natural to ask how do they fit into this context. And another natural question is to follow. What is the meaning of the integration of Plasseng manifolds that was performed by Ms. Blan at the was a bit mysterious what that integration. Mysterious what that integration. So let me just remind you a couple of definitions. Get has already defined this object, so I'm just going to be quite brief. So if you consider a library, where we're going to denote our uh cablet, it's enough, okay? And we're going to consider the bot human top context. The bottom and total complex. For us, an M shifted n form is going to be a collection of forms that constitute an element of total degree, n plus n, in the total context. With the property that each of its components is a form of degree greater or equal to n. A closed form is one which is closed by n. Which is closed by the total differential. So, whenever we have this information, we can produce an infinitesimal object attached to this, to a closed two point defined by these formulas. I can talk with the general formula which was uh introduced by Getzler and the and on these particular cases it's quite simple to know what that is. Simple to know what that is. So, the definition that he has already given is of symplectic n-shift group points is this follow. If this infinitesimal two form that we attach to a cluster form induces an isomorphism in homology, then we have Then we have synthetic. These are the complexes that we are relevant for us. This is a called tangent complex. And in this case, it is shifted by one. And in this case, this is shifted by two. He has already given up a few examples, I'm just going to remind you that I'm just going to remind you that so one the most important examples for us are one shift and two shifted symplectic reports are quasi-symplectic reports for two shifted symplectic reports we can see that agro has to be subjective so micro will consider videos very nice construction uh very nice uh construction that um groupword which was given essentially by by Weistens and my code. In that case the forms of the variable is this case we can see that the infinitesimal object as a shift with this two form is variable, which is done generates. So what's really important for us is the following kind of object. Lagrangian morphisms. We have an n-shift symplectic group of Library positomorphism with source X. Isotropic structure is a Isotropic structure is a potential for the pullback of the end shift that's infected structure along this map. And that structure is like rancher. If it induces an isomorphism, the homology is complex. So this definition is quite uh complicated and we only care about what happens if n is n is equal to 2, we have this diagram Lagrangian condition for shift. And we can see that this quasi isomorphism condition boils down to more much uh more understanding More much more understandable description, which is just a sequence. Morphisms in user quota is a morphism, if and only if this sequence is exact. And this sequence shows that the Lie algebra of this source group point has to be embedded by these maps as a Lagrangian sub-bundle. Actually the isotropic condition implies that this embedding preserves brackets. Because this object in the middle is a graph algebra, the sum of the canonical one and the scene is a so our definition are actually So our definition actually just works down to the following. I'll two-shift the Lagrangian group in K with a pathologically algebra. It's just a Libra polymorphism equipped with an isotropic structure with the property that these maps embed with the algebra shows as a direct structure and this sum. This sum. Remember that an isotropic structure in this case has two components: a two-form and a three-form. The three-form is closed. This three-form is used to twist its coil. The best examples that we can consider are, well, the easiest example if k is zero, you see that this diagram is just It's just this guy over here. Uh uh push it to Lagrangian group if we target a point. It's just a quasi-simplect. Another family of examples is given by Lagrange groups. Okay. Here comes the explanation, or part of the explanation for the for this real problem. This G of D happens to be Happens to be two ships of the Lacranjin group, but I haven't talked to the form, but here's the formula for that form. Form is given by the corresponding three form is zero, and it's given by spherical hierarchical time forms. And still well. And still, well, I mean, I can tell you why is this object to shift Lagrangian in the first place? This will become clear. So why do we care about these objects? The thing is that we can use this shift symplectic geometry story to produce manifolds in a systematic way. way. So the there is a in shift one there there have been a lot lots of papers explaining how can we obtain, how can we interpret, for example, Marisen-Weinstein. Of course you have to reduction in terms of this language. So depending on what target is uh we can then uh a way of producing Way of producing new simplicity manifolds. But what we really care about is what happens in shift. So the general principle is that the fiber product of two n-shifted Lagrangians is n minus one shifted simpleton. This principle applied to n-shift two. We consider two shifted grammar groups, with target and D group, then this target group was a symplectic group. If one tries to interpret this in classical language, we we can see that at the infinitesimal level it is essentially quantum production. It's essentially what happens with the coach. It's a budget. A view of how to answer question one. So the reason why G of D contains integrations of this real-defined direct structure is because it distituates the Lagrangian. So if we assume that this map is distit to the lag. If you think that this guy is this two-shift to the grand gem, they w we can take a fiber product with with any other uh two-shift to the grand gem and obtain a fiber product which is uh one shift that's inflated. This is the GL that I was talking about. The government will be given by the fiber product of phi and for L equal to For L equal to G start what we get is the two wise and simple active group that integrates. So what happens is that this GLD is a special case of a general search. We can consider this consider a common Consider a compact oriented surface with non-empty boundary. The property is that each of its components has an empty boundary, and has some points boundary. There is a distinguished two form that can be defined on top of this space of representations. But well in its most general version was introduced by Vibra. It turns out that if we take a surface with these properties and we cut it in half, and we consider this small representation space, what we get is a groupwood structure here. And this group would happens to be a two-shift technology group to target number of couples of objects structured group. Structured what this map is. This morphism is given by technical representation to its values along these green edges here. These edges are the edges that go from one of the halves of this surface to the other. And well the proper like the proper structure is given by this. But this canonical two-form. P-form on the base is given by the pullback of a number of copies of the cancer three-fourth using the values of a representation among these blue pages. That happens that this group with this structure is two-shaped like a going to give you a sketch of why this is. Let me just give you an example. A very particular example of this is given by by the disk with full market. By the disk with four marked points. So, in this case, the group point that we get is what is usually called the group point of commutative squares in K. It's a bit silly to compute like this since we are in a group, but in this case we can give a an easy description of the protocol from this decentralized. What happens is that actually, I mean, we can prove by hand that this is two-shifted Lagrangian k squared. The general case reduces to this case. The principle that we can take the fabric product of the Granger Akrangian structures and get a new one. But in this situation, what we do is the following. We take a surface, we cut this part in the middle, this tube, together with this. So if we remove this part in the middle, what we get is those two disconnected substances. This this part, not this part. Base of representations corresponding to surface. It's just a pebble point. So this thing, well, this is from the homological viewpoint, this is trigger. This is a point. So this is to shift the Lagrangian then in particular when we take the product of this of a point o and a very good point. And a very good point. On the other hand, we have this thing, which is the non-trivial part of the surface. So each of these tubes, the representation space associated to each of these tubes corresponds to the LMA group. Each of these squares corresponds to what I described before, the groupwidth of cognitive squares. So this whole group that we get here is a This co-group that we get here is the five-wheeled product of these mechanisms, but by these maps. And these maps are the values of the representation along the brain. So by product of these two Lagrangian group is going to be a Lagrangian in the product of a point four copies of k. This is the pre this is the reason why the subjects are so the particular case that we have is given by decorate a group of arrows. So we start with a group of arrows and we we can perform this a sequence of operations which are just packet products and spatial maps. Um spatial maps that uh that allow us to to obtain G of D as target product of separate uh sh Legal engines. And that's the reason why the final result is to shift Legal engine. Let me just remind you that we're looking at the quality of maybe this maybe this And what I'm trying to say is that the last example we can deconstruct, because we can use this construction by the bulge of efficient spaces, and we can just do the same thing, attach surfaces and produce as many examples as we want. That's a question that I have before. Let me just see. Let me just tell you that there is a variance of linear Lagrangian intersection principle. Like the Fullman's version of derived intersections. And in this case, there's what is called a commodity fighting problem. Take two shift to a badge group points, we can We can the amount of the fiber product is the usual fiber product of this product and this group with and so this is let's move on to the second for that I'm going to describe what I'm going to describe what a bit more what are the shit Lagrangian groups at the infinitesimal level. Let me just define these things. First of all, we can define what an infinitesimal is a traffic structure. So Lie algebra as a source and quadratic Lie algebra as a topic. So if you look at this. So if if you look at these equations, they are very similar to the equations that define uh infinitesimal multiplicative two forms, except for this part here, right? Case of infinitesimal multiplicative two forms is a difference. What turns out is that out of this lambda and this uh lambda is so this vector quantum at freeform we can produce a primitive for this pullback in the way logic of a we can use this finest theorem of integration decimalize it I mean I mean assuming that this Lie algebra is integral. If you apply this observation to positive manifolds, then we can answer the question. What are the globally? I'm going to use a tricky definition because I think this definition is clear what the answer is. If we take a minimum of the algebra, Take a manifold of G algebras. A posi-poissan DG manifold. It's actually a manifold equipped with a certain Dirac structure, defining the product of its canological current algebra D has some property. We see that so if this dirt structure happens to be integrable, not surprising that it should. It's not surprising that it should integrate to a two-shifted Lagrangian group, right? Because what I told you before is that two-shifted Lagrangian group will target a Lie group, has a property that its Lie algebra embeds the direct structure in this product. So this is the answer. What are the percent DG manifolds globally? There are special two shifts of Lagrange groups. They're characterized by. They're characterized by this property. The topic structure has zero as its freeform component and the kernel of the infinitesimal two formats shift to on the general support. My particular case was the one that was started by Devan, which they considered a special case of finding data. In this case they they said they they realized that there is that um but this direct structure that I can find here that I introduced. Well I introduce it. That structure splits as a semi-group product of the cotangent. And what they integrated was just this part, cotangent functor of the base. So what their integration is, is the following. They find a quasi-human. They define a quasi-Hamiltonian grouppool as a Li-group, which is a quasi-Hamiltonian G-space equipped with a multiplicative moment. Satisfies this property. So if we want to produce two shifts with Lagrangian out of a quasi-Hamilton group, we simply have to define the problem, right? And assume that the the this infinitesimal g-action integrated integrated g-action by tomorrow we can define this semi-trick products. And if we define and if we define this map and we modify the two-form in this way, we get this up to shift telegrams with that. Maybe it is natural to ask, well, we know that one-shifted sorry, quasi-return G spaces are one-shifted branch. So if we want to put all this information together, what we get is this diagram. So if you take a quasi-Hamiltonian group, this is a multiplicative quasi-discrimination, right? What it defines is a morphism of topology group ones. And the targeting AMN group, which happens to be a double group with it. So this direction is the conjugation, yeah, action group with a conjugation structure. Other direction is a Li group bubble structure. So these double these two double groups are very special. They have what's called the vacant surface. Vacant. So in this case, this guy happens to be a league group of this over the phase. And the same thing happens in this case. We study this, we analyze this group of structures, what we get is exactly what we expected according to what I told you before. Diagonal group on this center of product. Diagonal group on this The general principle, but whenever we have a multiplicative Lagrangian, we can produce an n plus one that are on a very important time examples of preservation manifolds, which are present. which are representation the metal groups of surfaces. In this case we can produce quasi-Hamiltonian space, a quasi-Hamiltonian group without integrates these objects. And then we can consider the two shifts of Lagrangian, essentially. It is natural to study well what happens if we study what happens if we if we take the uh hybrid product at least the shift of the engine is the diagram. This should be somehow the integration of this object. If we do that in the naive way, we get something similar in general. So maybe the best way to do that is taking this homotopy function. Taking this homotopy fibrous product. But the thing is that there is no, I don't have any. Let me just mention that there's a nice correspondence between Hamilton G spaces and a class of Hamiltonian energy spaces. Nice paper of Bernie M. Shu that that explains how this group, this impacted group of views, this measurement group. Ellen and Chichen have found is that they have more or less explained the analysis of that phenomenon, but in shape. Now we know but in shift two. So in that case what you did is a to group here to group here, which is kind of the two group. There is you can expect that there is a similar correspondence between two shifted Lagrangian group weights. The shifted Lagrangian W group weights. Questions? Any questions? Go back to the beginning of your all of your slides. Questions? Yeah. Go to the next one. Just briefly sketch again the relationship between G of L and G of D what these were. I I I didn't really understand the main point of the integration of L versus D. L versus D. Yeah, the whole point is there is this larger integration of G of D, which integrates with this action behind the toy. This integration is given by just this direct product. A paper point and G star. So what kind of an object is GOD? GOD is a integration of the d of the double, right? I mean, it is a integration of of an action beyond. Of an action beyond the Word reacting on the group by the dress match. And that happens to be two shifts of the Klangian. What? Indeed. Maybe we'll quickly explain it. So here is a map. There's a natural map. So there is a map, there's a natural map that we wrote, you know, that appears. Yeah, let me just from G of D to D. Let me just put this. This is the mic. This Mac is works. Could the people on Zoom please turn their microphones on? Thank you. Thank you. No. Hello. Yeah, microphone. So GeoPen is a fibro. This map and the inclusion of a present. Let me try to add something to this answer. So you have this Lie algebra, which is a bubble, right, acting by the dressing action of the group. And this action produces a current algebra, an action current algebra. And you can choose Lagrangian, you know, for each Lagrangian sub algebra, you choose. You know, bridge like Running Setology choosing there, you have a Direct structure. This action current out the word is actually exact, so it gives you a Dirac structure on the group. You don't integrate that Direct structure. So what this construction is telling you is that you can actually integrate the D, not just the Dirac structure. You can integrate the whole thing and you get it. What you get there is something that is neither multiplicative. Is neither multiplicative nor closed. Everything fails. But whenever you pick your DRAX structure and you restrict this form that doesn't satisfy anything to it, it becomes the quasi-symplectic or pre-symplectic integration that you want. And the puzzling thing is: like, what is this universal gigger object that doesn't satisfy anything? But once you restrict, you know, to You know, to like range and separate one, then it becomes a nice multiplicative closed blah blah blah. Yeah, I mean, it is not like it doesn't satisfy anything. Yeah, well, that's right. It doesn't seem to satisfy anything, but it does satisfy the properties of a two-shifted Lagrangian. And the reason why, you know, so basically this construction is taking this product of a two-shifted Lagrangian, which is TT, with another one. T with another one which is your choice of Dirac structure. And then you combine them, and this results that intersections or products of Lagrangians is n minus 1 shifted symplectic to produce, which will tell you why the result of that is a quasi-symplectic repoid. So if the mystery was like the nature of this weaker object, so why is it? So why is it that G of D, which is true, and G of L, which is also true to be magic, why is it that one of them was clearly, you knew what it was and the other one you didn't, if they were both of the same type? No, no, no, no. G of L is a one shifted symplectic. It's the result of two two shifted Lagrangians being combined. Yeah, I'm sorry, I used the wrong term. I'm talking about those two two shifted Lagrangians. Two shifted over angles. Yeah. So, in your previous work, one of those appeared and was very mysterious. What about the other one? I don't know. What is the other one? So, you're telling me that there are two, there's a pair of two shifted Lagrangians that intersect in the integration you want, right? So, what are those two things that you start on? Okay, so one is just the choice of the Lagrangian. The choice of the Lagrangian sub-algebra of this double. This is what gives you a direct structure. That's what you want to integrate. That's one of the magnetic. That's very simple. And the other one is the mysterious object. That seems to be some kind of universal integration. You know, all the integrations of all the Lagrangian sub-algebras live in there somehow. Um in the work of uh Safronov, Pantev and others, shifted Lagrangians aren't just stacks, they're derived stacks which cannot be presented by group points, but by higher group points of of G G manifolds or whatever. So I'm puzzled as to why you are able to get away with just ordinary group points. Away with just ordinary group ones. Because we're studying a very special situation. A very, very special situation, a very special kind of target, right? Our targets are just Lie groups with a quadratic Lie algorithm. That's why we are able to describe the Lagrangian. I mean, we are not studying an arbitrary to shift the Lagrangian, to shift the symplectic target. That all the Lagrangians on VT are of this type. Yeah, we are not even saying that. Yes, we are two special two-shift Lagrangians. That we are calling two-shifted Lagrangian group points. So it's a very specific thing. These are not the most general two-shift of Lagrangian at all. You have VG and you ask when a group point with a map to VG becomes Lagrangian. So when a stack presented by a group point, so the group point is. Presented by a loophole, so the loophole is wrong. Thank you. The stacks are underived Art and 1 stacks, so then you have presentations. Another way of thinking of these objects is like, you know, shifting, you know, just like quasi-Hamiltonian spaces with group value moment maps, according to Selfrana, or one shift of Lagrangian. These are the, you know, next shift. In the same way that when you, you know, quasi-Hamilton reduction can be seen as, right, I mean, intersecting one shifted Lagrangians to give you a zero-symplectic plane. When two shifted Lagrangians, two shifted Lagrangians intersect, they give you back a pre-symplectic or quasi-symplectic duplicate. That's the construction at the next level. Which is like if you want to produce. Which is like if you want to produce symplectic group points by reduction, these are the inputs you need. And even for these examples of one shift at Lagrangian, the actual examples are very simple. They are represented by action groups. As you motivate spaces are represented by action. And in the point is that you can produce the integrations of this for some homogeneous spaces this way. And maybe comment that once you have two Lagrangians here, we are not able always to produce a quasi-simplectric group way. We have transversality. Yeah, but it's also the Homotop-Fago product, which always works in the nature. Are there more questions? What does this, I mean, what do you think that this implies for integration of minute triples? I mean, in other words, let's say the double symplectic group. I don't think this implies much in that regard, but Because you can think that the each of the, you know, when you have a double sympathetic groupoid over these other two side groupoids, these are Poisson groupoids, so they're one shifted, and then that's simplectic, so it's zero shift. Everything comes from a different algebra, which is two shifted. Yeah, in that case, there is a there is a special construction by Russian. There's a special construction that allows you to produce out of a double symplectic group point, right, a local litig group point that we can think as a local integration of the associated group. But that's a different story, right? It's also not complete because in general it only gives a local integration.  Oh, sorry. I thought I'm saying that.  I can do this um Can I do this uh this function G or I think I know some of the chipped? I would change the Because I I would change something like that.  I mean, claim that this is zero. Well, that would give me a contradiction like the detections. So I think first of all, this machine. That makes it a classic. And I'm first progressing the premium. And cling that these words. But he's a bit frustrated because he's taking correctly.  That's the aspect. To bring the slides to another one? That's auto video. That's switching slides. No. No, definitely. Are you going to press the element? I'm not sure. This works. So x is this button.  What about this isn't cosmetic? I like soft H is with sort of HTML.  Basically, though, in the very constructive and not targeted job. And why do you why do you want to why do I want quite a time which on the diagonal marks once on the once activated one diagonal such that it goes with the flow lines such that The rebel can be small height. Then after you do all the completions this time therefore might want to be left.
