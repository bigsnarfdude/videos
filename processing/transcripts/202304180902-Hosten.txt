Again, I'd like to start thanking the organizers, Greg and Paul and Sonia, to organize this conference. Yesterday was the first day, it was a fantastic day. It's amazing, you know. I'm kind of new to this kind of ideas, and in every talk, I learned something new. So those are great ideas. So my talk is on random. Is on random commutative algebra. It's not random algebraic geometry. And my talk is based on work before it. So you have to first go back and then it it and then it goes forward, okay? Oh no, the back button is actually the forward button. Okay. Back, but it is actually the forward button. I see. Okay, so this is joint work with Jesus de Loeira, Robert Kron, and Linda Silverstein. And this work has already been published. It's been a few years. In fact, when the organizers asked me whether I'd like to give a talk, it was very tempting to say, I don't have anything new to say. So that I could just sit back and then look at this box. But then I thought I should talk about this because the work we've done was just before COVID and there was a in Leipzig, you know, in MPI Leipzig, there was a school, right? And then a two-day short workshop, I think, after that. And that was the only place I was able to talk about this. Place I was able to talk about this, and this is a broader audience. And I thought, okay, I'll talk about it. So that's that's the reason I'm talking about that. Okay, so that's your work. Okay, so here is the motivating question, or one of the motivating questions of our work. So if I somehow generate a random monomial ideal in a polynomial ring with n variables, With n variables, what can you say about the projective dimension of this monomial ideal? I.e., what can you say about the length of the minimum free resolution for this monomial ideal? Now, we know that Hilbert-Ssyzygy's theorem, maybe you don't even have to apply that particular theorem, but Since the Theorem, but says that the length of the free resolution, minimum of resolution, if you count the number of steps in your free resolution, if you compute by Mocha 2, is going to be at most n, the number of errors. And this is true for any homogeneous ideal in this ring. That's just for monomial ideals. At most n. But again, what will be sort of the more average behavior? If I talk about the random monomer, of course. Talk about the random monomial. Of course, we need to talk about what it means to be random. Many ways of thinking about monomial ideas are random monomial ideas. But that's one thing. And there's sort of a folklore out there when you talk to computer algebraists and say, hey, if I generate, if I give you a random monomial ideal, whatever that means, what would you expect? What would be the length of the resolution? And the answer is usually as long as it can. Usually, as long as it can be. And you can do it yourself. Like, you know, you actually pick some your own way, random monomial ideals, and then see what happens. So we want to sort of justify this response, let's put that. It's one of the reasons. Is that good? Yeah. So think about it as a motivating question. Okay. So let's talk about what does it mean? So let's talk about what it means for a monomal ideal to be a random monomeral ideal. And there are again, as I said, there are many ways. One way is to generate such monomal ideals is through an sort of Adish Rangin type of process that comes from generating random graphs. And this work, at least this way of generating monomial ideas randomly, was pioneered by Jesus and Sonia and Lily Silverstein. Despina, Stasi, and then Wilburn in a paper from 2017. It's called Random Monomial Ideas. So we're basing also generation of random monomerial ideas on this type of work. So how do you do that? So I'm going to fix a positive integer d, and we're going to make a generating set for our monomial ideal by picking monomial. By picking monomials in this ring, they up to degree D. And the probability of picking any one particular monomial is going to be a fixed probability p. So you think about like a coin, bias coin, the head comes with probability p. For every monomial, you flip the coin. If it comes head, you include it in your generating set. If it tails, you don't. And then you look at the monomial ideal that you have. That good? Yeah, that's how I'm going to generate, or how Sonia and company decided to generate their monomial ideals. As you can, you know, if you're at all familiar with this Adversary Randyu model for generating random graphs, it's inspired by that. So remember, you know, how that works. So if you want to generate a random graph on n vertices, A graph on n vertices, n is fixed. You again pick a p between 0 and 1. That's the probability of picking an edge. And for each edge, you flip a coin. If it comes head, you include the edge. If not, you don't. So that's how you generate a random graph, one way of generating a random graph. And then you can ask questions like: is this graph connected? Or how many connected components does it have? Connected component does it have? What is the largest cycle you can get? What is the maximal click, the number of nodes and the maximum click you can have? And people have worked and answered these kind of questions for a while now. You're viewing these as edges, so what are the vertices? So for the graph case, you have vertices. You fix your vertices. Oh, yeah, I know the graph. I'm familiar with the graph one, so you're saying. The graph one, so you're saying that view the monomials as edges because you're sampling those. There are no vertices. So I'm just inspired by that kind of process. Inspired by it, okay. I guess what's different is that the graph like the edges are all pretty equal versus my old ones are not. Yes, yes. But in this case, every monomial has the same probability to be included. Their practice is definitely full. Yes, exactly. Definitely. Yes, exactly. Yeah? The point. So, of course, you know, we're trying to create a generating set. I didn't say minimal generating set. When you include monomials, you could have some redundant monomials. And that's an important thing to think about. Note something here. If I say, if I sort of stick to this generation idea for monomial ideas, and I say I'm going to allow myself only pick square-free monomials through the standard risk. Yeah, through the standard Reisner correspondence, that means I'm generating random simplical complexes. Okay, again, there are other ways of generating random simplicity complexes as well, but this is one way of doing that too. Okay, so that's kind of the model. Whoops, I'm back here. So now I'd like to present to you a result. There are many results in Sonia's In Sonia's paper, but this one particular one I'd like to show you because it also goes with a nice graphic that I lifted from their paper that explains, you know, one of, or at least it motivates one of the type of results I'm going to give you. So we can call this sort of a threshold behavior for the dimension of the monomial ideal. And the theorem says that if you fix t between 0 and n, And if you let your probability, the P, it's going to depend on D, because we're going to fix N but draw D. If probability D is a way, you know, it's bigger or grows faster than D to the minus T plus one, but it grows slower than D to the minus T, somewhere in between, then the dimension of your The dimension of your monomial is going to be equal to t, almost surely. So if you pick your probability in between, you're expected to get a dimension t monomial id. So maybe in pitch, as I said, I allow this diagram here. So you see at the bottom here, the probability you can pick from between 0 and 1. And there are these marks, the threshold. Are these marks are the threshold marks for different values of t and it's just saying that for instance if I pick my p between 0 and d to the minus n, you're not going to get any generator at all. But if you're in the next step, if your P is somewhere in between here, then your monormulo is going to have dimension n minus 1. Have a dimension n minus one, okay? Etc. So, as the p increases, the dimension goes up, and then we know what exactly this transition is happening. No, it's not about the minimal generating set, I'm just talking about the dimension of the monomial idea. So, again, so there are other results in this paper. For instance, there were For instance, they were able to compute the probability of generating a particular monomial ideal. You give me a monomial ideal whose genetics are at most degree D, and you say, what is the probability that I can generate probability of genetics monomial ideal? And they have a precise answer for this that involves the Hilbert function of your monomial ideal. Okay? So, but this, I call it, they call it, and I call it sort of a threshold behavior of any mean. Behavior of any invariant you can think of. This is for dimension. Okay, so I should also mention other things, you know, other work, and I'm sure I'm missing things, but these are things that I know about. Just briefly, so Daniel and Jay is one of the people sort of who picked this design. Sort of who picked these ideas up. And one of their papers, they looked at what's called random flag complexes. So here, what you do is it's a bit different. Here, what they do is that they do generate a random graph. Okay? Imagine the monomial ideal. Once you generate a random graph, you have the clique complex of your graph. Of your graph. And that's a nice simplicial complex, it's a flat complex. And they consider what happens to the syzygies of this kind of monomial ideal. I think Jay briefly flashed it in his five-minute pitch yesterday. They have results about the number of non-zero Bitten numbers in the case in a fixed row of. In a fixed row of their beta tables, designers. So, what happens asymptotically without? That's one of them. In another paper, Jay, Daniel, and I don't know, the person, they also looked at this very interesting question that's been always around: that we know that the free resolutions of ideals do depend on the characteristic of the field. Of the field. If you change the crackers of the field, you can get different resolutions. And they tackle this for random monomial ideals. And the setup was the same. They generate their monomial ideals as random flat complexes. And they used results coming from sort of random graphs that says that banging genetic things randomly. When you generate things randomly, you can always find that sort of a sub-complex that has torsion in your simplicity complex. And that helps to show that the CDC of random monomials do depend, almost surely, on the characteristic of the field. It's not like a fringe behavior. It happens all the time. And the third thing here I should also mention, again, J is involved in this work too. In this work, the monomal ideas, when I say random monomal ideals, the monomalizers are generated via the Arbish-Ranyu process that Sonia and Ko-Authus have introduced. So in that case, they looked at what happens to the degree of such a monormalite, and they're able to show that if you give me If you give me parameters or k, I can pick a probability such that the degree of your monomial ideal will be sort of sandwiched between two very closely related functions. Pretty precisely they can tell what the degree is going to be in those cases. So it's a great, great, great paper. And finally, this is a more recent result, and I'm not going to talk much about that. This is about H ideals of. This is about H ideals of random graphs. So in this case, again, what's generated randomly is a graph through the Average Randy model. Once you have a graph, you can associate another ideal for each edge. So for each vertex, you have a variable and x1 through xn. And for each edge, you make a generator, let's say xi, if the edge is ij, you make the monomial generator xi times xj. Generated xi times xj. So you look at that monomial ideal, and you can ask questions about different resolutions and homological properties. And this paper deals with that. So it's just like some summary about what has been done for this kind of randomly generated monormalizers and the kind of questions people look at. Okay, so let's start with our thing. I'll briefly summarize one more time: you know, how over time, you know, how we generate our random, how we generate randomly our monomial ideals. So we're going to generate random monomial ideas in n variables. One difference is going to be that we are going to say that our ideals are generated in a single degree. Now fixed degree, all minimum generation is going to be in that degree. Which is really nice because that results the problem of whether I have redundant generators or not. Everything I generate is a minimal generator from this point of Generator from this point of view. Okay, and then the idea is the same. I pick a fixed probability for each monomial, yeah, and you know, I flip my coin for each monomial of that degree. If it comes head, I include it. If not, I don't. Right? So that's my monomerite. Some, my monomers are going to generate. Very good. Okay, so if I generate my monomerite in this form, no, I'm going to sort of use this note. No, I'm going to sort of use this notation. This is coming from the class of monomials generated in this way with the parameter P. Okay. All right, so let me tell you our sort of a main result, or one of the main results that answers the motivated question. So if I generate my monomial ideal in this way, and my probability P is going to depend on D. The probability P is going to depend on D. I'll fix N, the number of variables, but I let the D grow. So then the P is equal to D to the minus N plus 1 is a threshold for the projective dimension, which means the following. If your P is away smaller and away from D to the minus M plus 1, asymptotic that almost surely, as D grows to infinity, the projective dimension is zero. Projective dimension is zero. It's the zero ideal. If it's bigger than that, that's away from these three, minus f plus one, then that's literally the threshold for getting no precisely. Exactly. It's not at all. You can't find a non-omial or yes. But if it's it, even you know, but if it grows faster than that, even just a little bit, then your projective resolution is going to. Your projective resolution is going to have the longest length. There's nothing in between. So, the fault or what Pino said was right. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yeah. That was one of the observations. Yes, we're able to say that in this model at least. So, that's the main result. I'll tell you a little bit more about how we got this. But as a corollary, this was also motivated by a conjecture in the By a conjecture in the paper by Sonny and others. So they conjectured that randomly gentlemen orders should never be como-coli, and that confirms that. So if you get either length zero resolution or length n resolution, the only way you can have a Kolm-Ma-Colli ideal is if your ideal is zero-dimensional. In order to get a zero-dimensional ideal where the minimal genetics are all at degree D, Are all at degree D, you have to simultaneously pick the generators that are pure powers of that degree, and there are very few of them. It's very hard to pick all of them at the same time. That's why you never get a zero-dimensional ideal. So it's never a combo code, almost never a combo code. That was my counterpart, and now I'll previously. May I take a question now? You say p less, less than something. It means the force is something that's not. Yes, so that means exactly. So P. Exactly. So p, the quotient of p divided by this other function, s d goes to infinity, grows to zero. Exactly. You can't say anything when it's of that order or that. But exactly that? Exactly order or order by log factors or by constant? No, no. Nothing like that. This was exciting enough at the moment. Okay. Is that good? So that's the main result. If you take, when I take any. That's the main result. If you want to take anything out of the stock, maybe that's it. So it's rare. The creator destroyed the subject and so you can't. No. Of course we're interested in nice cases, right? Okay, he says nice cases are rare, but we are interested in nice cases. Let it go. It doesn't kill anything. What if we get to G and that any bro? Very good question. Very good question. So, again, this is something that Sonia's and other papers looked at. They looked at other variants. We didn't know. So, this is, I'm going to go fixed and my objects. It's kind of complicated. That's why. I don't know. So, I don't know the answer. Yeah, what happens? Might want to stick with quadratic generator because the analysis. So, okay, how do you prove such a result? Yeah, and I don't want to read all of the details of two proves. I was looking, so recently, and I started thinking about the talk, and I had to go back to the paper, and I was like, what? How did we prove that? It's one of those moments, you know. But anyway, so this is a... But so, but again, I like to tell you one thing that's our results based on. This is important, I think. This is a result by Alessandro in 2007. By Alessandro in 2017, it just came out. So it was very interesting. So we were, Seuss and others, we were at MSRI fall of 2017. There was a combinatoric semester and we're talking about this particular problem. And they were thinking, like, I said, like, if there were such a result, I'll tell you what the result is. It would be really nice, yeah? And then, like, the next day on archive was a patent paper telling this result. You did it, yeah? I was like, oh, wow, that's great. You did it leave, yeah. I was like, oh wow, that's great. So, what's the result? This is the result that tells you a certificate that there will be a syzygy for your monomial ideal at the highest homological degree, at n. So, how does this happen? Okay, so it happens, the project device is going to be equal to n if and only if there is a subset of your minimal generators called L. generators are called L with three properties. Three properties. So L is called dominant if every minimal generator in your set, in L, has a variable whose exponent is the biggest one among all of the minimal generators in that variable. A unique one. It has to It has to be n of them, they have to be n minimal generators, not more. And then finally, no other minimal generator should divide the least common multiple of your monomials strongly, meaning the exponent vectors, the exponent vector of your minimal generator, if you look at each the the power of each variable, has to be slightly smaller. Yeah? Or cannot be slightly that's what I say. Or cannot be simpler, for our sake. There should not be such a such a guy. So no minimal generator has a property that in each variable is the exponent is strictly smaller than the exponent of the LCM. Okay, this comes from, if you're familiar with genericity and scarf complexes, etc. I'll talk about that at the end, a little bit more. Okay, so so if so when L is a s set of uh monomies that satisfies these conditions, yeah, um I'm gonna say that L witnesses the projective dimension being equal to N. It's like a certificate that you have something in the system in the highest homological degree, and then we say L is a witness set, and the corresponding L C M of them are called a witness L C May I'll show you Maybe, I'll show you a picture here. So, how do you get such a set? So, you have to see here is monomials in three variables of a certain degree. And I picked an exponent vector, alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3. And let's say, how can I get a witness set with this LCM? Because LCM is this monomial. You have to focus on. Okay, you have to focus on generators in this triangle, then. And the interior of the triangle is out of bounds. So if you have a minimal generator in there, then this cannot be a witness set because then it will divide, you know, strictly. It will be a strong division, I guess. And what you need to do is you need to pick monomers on the Do is you have to pick monomers on the boundary, on the facet of the simplex. So, like these guys, and you have to pick only three of them, you only have to pick three of them, which means that, like in this picture, if these were my minimal generators, there are four ways of getting this LCM. You can pick any one of the two on this side and any one of the two on this side, and that will give you. Yeah, and that will give you a witness set. Right? Am I making sense? Yeah. I have to pick that one. Well, for every five seconds, you have to pick exactly one. Okay. So that's what we said. Okay, again, how do I. So I have time. So how do I prove such a thing? So it is the idea. It's really a sketch. Really sketch. So let's look at the case where p is on one side of the threshold, it's smaller. So then we can look at the probability that it's at least one minimoduler. Ideal is like the zero ideal. This is, and of course it goes to infinity, this is bounded above by the expected number of generators. This is like a, what is it called? The Markov. What is it called? The Markov, Markov, and you call it, yeah? Expected number of minimums changes. So, this binomial coefficient is the number of monomials of the degree d in n variables, right? Therefore, the expectation of the number is going to be multiplied with t. But this binomial coefficient is a polynomial of degree in d of degree n minus 1. So, if you pick something smaller, Something smaller, yeah, and d goes to infinity, that goes to zero. Okay? So that's the easy case. Okay, that comes a little more complicated. So these are, yeah, I'm not going into details. So what you have to do is you need to compute, you need to compute or estimate the expected number of witness sets. Okay? So here, W alpha is an indicator variable, which is one if there is a witness set. If there is a witness set with L C M whose exponent vector is alpha, zero otherwise, okay. Do not worry too much about what this A is, it's sort of telling you up to which degree you can expect to get a witness set if your generators are at degree D. So you have to sort of add this up, it's work zero and one, and take the expectation, and you show that this is close to infinity, it becomes infinite, so i.e. It becomes infinite. So, i.e., there is no limit to the number of witness sets as d grows to infinity. So, that's one thing you have to do. The other thing you have to do, and this uses the Chebyshev inequality now. So, W here is a random variable that counts the number of witness sets. And I like to say that. And I'd like to say that the probability that there is no witness set, there's no CG in the highest homological degree, is followed by this ratio. The variance of your random variable divided by the square of the expectation. So I just told you that the expectation is going to go to infinity. So if I can show it to you that the variance doesn't grow. Is doesn't grow faster than the square of the expectation, then this is going to be zero. The limits go off to polytheum is zero. So that's what you do. And that's the result. So therefore, the probability there is a witness set, the witness bigger than zero, is going to is approached one as d goes to infinity. Okay? So again, this is a very sort of Sort of bird's eye view of the result. And then, yeah, I already told you about comogans. It's almost never zero dimension. So without going into much details, how do you do this? The first part is this one is not so difficult, although you have to estimate the probability of W alpha, being equal to one. You have to understand the order of that. But then, That. But then, in order to do this, we have to bound the variance. And the variance is bounded by the expectation plus the sum of the covariances of the W alpha's. So some of the pictures that go with that is like this. So suppose I have two witness sets, one blue, one green. You ask yourself, you know, what is the covariance between the witnesses? Between those? Huh? It's red. What do I say? Blue and red. Thank you. Blue and red. So then that means that they could be witness heads independently of each other. They don't interact at all. So the coherence will be zero. Actually, you can allow only one carbon minimum generator as well. But the sort of other extreme cases. But the sort of other extreme cases that, so if one witness set is sort of inside the other one, the triangles in this case, that means that they cannot be witness sets at the same time. So they are negatively correlated with each other. And then you have to look at more general cases, of course. So what happens if they overlap partially, etc.? And that requires, as I said, quite a bit of trickery. Which I'm not going to be good at. That's why we had. Which I'm not really good at. That's why we had people like Lil Silversley and then Robert Krona in the team. Okay. All right, so that's it. So again, it's an overview of what kind of thing to expect if you decide to read the paper. So let me turn around and tell you the second thing, and this is about scarfness and genericity. Genericity. Okay. So I'll say that a monomial ideal is scarf. If its scarf complex gives a minimum of free resolution of the monomial ideal. Again, I don't know how many of you are familiar with the sort of the scarf resolutions for monomial ideals, but this was sort of work done in mid to late nineties by Dave Bayer. The empire, Irene Payeva and Pan Stunfels. And they were able to construct a simplicial complex where the vertices are the generator, minimal generals of your monomial ideal. And this simplicial complex gives you, if you look at the, what do you call the boundary complex of the symbols? Of the simulation complex, in certain cases, it supports a minimum fair resolution. And one case this happens is that, so I'm not going into details, but how do you construct this simplicity complex? Well, you say you pick a subset of the minimal generators and look at the LCM of the generators in that set. If that LCM is If that LCM is uniquely obtained by any subset of the generators, it's just only that one, then that becomes a phase. So if that's the case, and the corresponding simplest complex, the scarf complex, gives you a minimal free resolution, I'm going to call my monomer ideal scarf. It's a very nice way of getting a combinatorial, a very common way of minimal free resolution of your ideal. Not every monomial ideal scarf. Not every monorail is a scarf, yeah? But that's if you did a scarf, that's great, yeah? So is that scarf the economist? Yes, Herbert's scarf, yes, yeah. It's based inspired, you know, on Herbert's work. Okay, so here's our theorem. Again, there's sort of a sort of a traditional result. It says that if the probability grows faster than this particular thing, so you should pay attention. So you should pay attention. This is d to the minus n plus to minus a little less. Then m is not scarf. So the scarf complex does not support a minimal free resolution. So I'll tell you why I'm interested in this in a second. And moreover, so there's another notion that's the second word in my title of the Of the slide, it's called genericity. There's also a notion of a generic monomial ideal. And this sounds strongly generic, but let me just talk about generic monomial ideal. So if monomial ideal is generic, if you take any two monomials, any two monomials, take their LCN, then there exists no minimal generator which strictly divides. Strictly divides that L C n. Such a monomial idea is called generic monomial ideal. And it's in the fundamental paper, you know, Barrent and Irena and Dave showed that if a monomerite is generic, it has to be scarfed. It's not the commerce not true. A monomer could be scarfed without being generic. But generic grantees scarfness. And this is our threshold as well for genericity. Our threshold was for genericity. So if p is small, slower than d to the minus n plus 3 over 2, which is very close to this, but smaller than that, then your ideal is generic. Otherwise, it's not. So there's a gap between. There is a little bit of a gap. I know, but you know about scarfing gap. Hmm? What do you know about scarfing systemic gaps? What do you know about scarfing and gaps? Um, I don't know much about scarfness in the gap. Do you know about the gap then? I don't, yes. I don't know what happens in there, but I'll tell you this as a picture. Okay? So this is a result of some experiments we've done. In the horizontal axis, you have various variables of P, the probability you pick your generators. And then in the vertical one is the D, the degree. Yeah, so we're generating. So we're generating monomial ideals and we're looking whether they are square or generic. So when you see a square that is gray, completely gray, that means that everything in there, or almost surely, is generic handscarf. How many data do you compute each? Um I don't know, it's like um ten to the five or more, I think. I I Or more, I think. I have to look, yeah? But a lot, yeah. But they're roughly equally sampled. Yes, yeah. Whatever that means, yes. So if in a square, you see something black, yeah, that tells the proportion of those monomial ideals, that happened to be scarf, but not generic. Okay, so the more black you see, or the less gray you see, okay, that means you are. C, that means you are, you do get scarf, but all the ideals, they are, they are, you know, they get their minimum free resolutions from the complex, but they're not generic. And then white means not scarf. Okay? So as you can see, there's kind of a twilight zone. And you sort of go from always generic and scarf to not scarf. And there's a transition there happens. There's a transition in there happening, but the blacks where scarf button generic is happening. This is interesting because, and we know exactly, like I told you in this result, right? We know when you start having normal ideals and up to where you can generate, you know, almost surely generic ones. Yeah? So you know exactly where the difference is, yeah, in this in-between zone, where it could be, or could be, could be. So therefore, Could be. So therefore, you know, if you want to generate a scarf but not generic monomial ideal, you could think about it. You can try to find one by thinking. Or you can pick your N and D. You pick the appropriate P in that sort of twilight zone and just randomly generate some guys and see what happens. Happens. So that's what we did in our experiments. Yes, that's it. Yes, that's the twilight zone. And for instance, here is one ideal you find in there. It's one of the randomly generated monomial ideals with the corresponding parameters. I believe we have 10 variables here. Yes, 10 variables. I forgot about the peak is p, yeah? But this, yeah, this monomial. This monomial ideal is scarf but not generate. And there are many more like this in that dialogue. Okay, I think I'm going to finish it early. Thank you very much. So you talked about how these techniques can be used to How these techniques can be used to kind of validate or understand folklore in a different way. And I wanted on that previous slide, we see this transition. And if I understand right, the kind of at the left hand we're getting sparser monomial ideals. And at the right hand, there's fewer monomials in them. As P is smaller. P is smaller, you have fewer minimal generals. That's true. But so is the intuition. I mean, I'm wondering, does this alter our intuition? I'm wondering, does this alter our intuition of kind of scarf? Is it suggesting something like, I don't know, sparser monomial ideals with fewer monomial ideals tend to be scarf and generic, whereas denser ones tend to be the opposite. Yes, yes. I think that's the intuition, right? And you can think about it like back in the, so maybe I'll show you the back to pictures, right? Let's go back. You remember the LCM? I mean, so like these pictures. So such a picture with one L. So, such a picture with when Al, this is a witness set, tells you that the corresponding facet of your scarf complex gives you a last CG in the higher isomology. So, for that kind of thing to happen, as you can see, it cannot be too dense, right? If you had two male generators, they're going to be generated inside here. And this will never be, they will be generic or scaled. That's great. Yes, Yes. Do you have any sense for what extent these random unreal ideals I should think of as also indicating behavior of other ideals, like just ideals in general? Are these a good model for that? Because they are initial ideals of a very good question. I don't know. I think that Mac can go in different ways. You can say if I generate a random monomial ideal. If I generate a random monomial ideal, could this be an initial ideal of some class of monomial ideals? Yeah, that's one thing. Or you can go the other way. You can say, I'm going to generate some other class of monomial ideals, like binomial ideals, randomly and look at the initial ideals if you pick, let's say, a reverse lexicographic term or something like that. I don't know. I'm not sure. Maybe something to say? Something to say? No, well, the question. Okay, no, sorry. The answer is no. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. What happens? Yes. No, no, no, it's okay. You mentioned the initial ideas. I mean, if you make a general change of polynomials, you get formally stable ideas, at least in crypto zero. So you could ask what happens if you just restrict to generic formula-stage ideas. Have you looked at this? This is the place to talk about those things. One more question? There were plenty of questions right there. Yes. Okay. Then I guess this uh thing that kind of so we have a little bit of offer time and Have a little bit of buffer time and then a coffee break until 10:30. So, obviously, there's only one of the things that I'm going to do. Excuse me. Sorry, I was saying.
