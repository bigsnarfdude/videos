The photo indoors or outdoors? Oh, you don't know yet. Probably outdoors. Okay, thanks. And first of all, let me just thank the organizers for organizing this conference and for inviting me. It's lovely to be back on them. So I will speak about, I will give a survey of different aspects of what rational homotopy theory can say about classifying spaces of vibrations with a fixed function. With a fixed finite CW complex as fiber. And this talk will have two parts. In the first part, I will talk about a general structure theorem that I proved together with my former colleague, Dr. Tom Tiaman. And in the second part, I will talk about a method of constructing characteristic classes for vibrations with very double fiber that are associated to homology classes in Konsevich's Lie graph context. So the basic setup is the following. So we have a finite complex X and for most of the talk it will be simply connected and later it will be a proprietary complex. And my notation out of x will be the space of homotopy covalences. Semifomato equivalences. It's a topological monoid, and so it has a classifying space, and that classifying space classifies vibrations with fiber X. So the set of homotopy classes of maps from a given CW convex B to the classifying space of this topological monoid is in natural bijection with equivalence classes of Equivalence classes of vibrations with fiber X, fiber homotope equivalent to X, and with base P and up to a suitable notion of equivalence, final wise notion of equivalence. And the basic problem that this talk will address is what can we say about characteristic classes of Characteristic classes of vibrations. And that is to say, what is the co-monitoring of this classified space? The basic problem is to compute this, which is the ring of characteristic classes of vibrations of this type. Okay. And um I I will use Q coefficients throughout the talk without writing it out necessarily. Without writing it out necessarily. So, to build up to the first theorem, let me recall some classical results. And in fact, one of the first, some deep applications of Sullivan's rational homogeneity theory is the following, which was also proved independently by Wilkerson. So, this is from the 70s or so. And here, importantly, we assume that x is simply connected. So, if this is the case, then we can say something about the fundamental group of this classifying space, which is the same as the space of components, or the group of components of the space of social frequencies. This is an This is an arithmetic note. I'll remind you what this means in a minute, but in particular it means that this group cannot be any abstract group. This is in particular a strong finiteness property. In particular, this group will be finitely present, but it's more than that. And a basic example to sort of illustrate. To sort of illustrate what kind of groups can appear, and also to illustrate why this condition is necessary, is if we take just a wedge of spheres in the same dimension, and then this group of homotropy classes of homotopy self-equivalences, so an n-fold wedge of a d-dimensional sphere when d is greater than 1. When d is greater than 1, this is just isomorphic to G L and Z, which is like a prototypical example of an arithmetic group. But when D is equal to 1, well, then we leave the realm of simply connectivity, you know, just get a bouquet of circles, and then in this case, we get the outer automorphism group of a free group on n generators. And this is certainly not an arithmetic group when n is at least 3. So, this illustrates necessary. And let me just remind you what it means to be an arithmetic group. So, this is defined in terms of linear algebraic groups over Q. So, let me first recall what that means. So, engineering A linear algebraic group over Q is this, but you know, you can take as a definition. It's just a subgroup of, well it's a group of matrices, it's a subgroup of G and N Q for some N that is defined by polynomial equations in the entries of the matrices. So it's a subgroup cut out by This is something cut out by some polynomial equations. Is it obvious that out of n is not a correct? No, that's not obvious, but it's true. Well, for n equals two, I think it's arithmetic, but for n equals three, it's not. Yes, so linear algebraic groups are just, you know, matrix groups cut out defined by polynomial equations, SLNQ defined by the equation of determinant that's equal to 1, etc. And an arithmetic subgroup, such a thing. Well, if you have a linear algebraic group, to the algebraic subgroup of that. Except that means the following. So this means that when you intersect gamma with the integer points here, this has finite index in both in both gamma and in GZ, which G z, which by definition is the sort of the integer solutions to the equations that define that G. And just to say one, I mean, I will not, I mean, it will take too much time to explain. I mean, it will take too much time to explain the proof of this, but the idea is: I mean, this is Sullivan's proof is, you know, you use the Sullivan's minimal model, this commuter differential-breathed algebra, and the algebraic group in question will be the group of automorphisms of the minimal model modulo, those that are homotopic to identity. And then, you know, that's manifestly an algebraic group. And that's a starting point for provenance. Uh okay. Um questions so far? So this gives us information about the well this is a pi-zero statement about the space of self-recoordines. And the idea of this, this work that I will talk about here is we wanted to prove like We wanted to prove like a space-level statement. And what you might try to do is: well, this is the fundamental group of this space, and you might try to investigate the universal cover of this classifying space together with the action of the fundamental group, and maybe try to say something about that universal cover. So it turns out that that's, well, that's a good idea, but you can do even better if you do not restrict. Even better, if you do not restrict yourself to the universal cover, but you consider other covers. So the main theorem of our work with Xiamen is the following. So here, I want distributed again. It's the following. So this classifying space admits a, you know, there's a There's a particular cover that has very good properties. Sometimes it is the universal cover, but sometimes it's odd. There's a normal cover, which I'll call b odd u x. And then it denotes the back transformation group. So this will be some quotient of the fundamental group here. Of the fundamental group here. Let me call that gamma. Such that the following holds. So first of all, gamma also enjoys this nice property of being arithmetic. But more than that, gamma is an arithmetic subgroup of a particularly nice old breakgroup. Particularly nice old background. Maybe a reductive algebraic group and different ways of defining reductive, but a quick way is to say that the category of algebraic. Algebraic representations, rational representations of this affine group scheme is a semi-symmetric category. All short exact sequences split. So that's in characteristic zero, this is equivalent to other definitions of reductive. In characteristic P you need to be careful about these different notions of reductive. Right. Right, so that's the first property, and then secondly discover the u of x, which is now a space with an action of gamma. Is first of all virtually a complete space, meaning that it is a finite. Meaning that it has a finite cover, which is impotent in the sense of homotopy theory. Maybe we have the fundamental group, it's an important group that acts impotently on the higher homotopy groups. So this is virtually impotent, and that means that this space is amenable to the techniques of rational homotopy theory. I mean, rational homotopy theory, Salt Master Quidditch says, works best for inequality spaces. I mean, this space, the fold space here, will not be inevotent in general. Will not be an important in general, so the traditional methods of rational homotopy theory do not apply. This example shows that, because JL and Z is not an important group. It's far from important. So the idea is that we pass to this cover, and that can be dealt with using traditional methods, but then we just have to keep track of the action of this leg transformation group. And we're in the fortunate situation where we not only can we make the cover repotent, we can also make this group to have very nice. To have very nice representation theory. So, right, so this is virtually important and it has equivalent model. I mean, virtually in Pokémon spaces are in equivalence theory modeled by input and differential gradient Lie algebras. There is a DGD algebra, alcohol G. And importantly, this is not only just a DG Lie algebra, but it carries an action, an algebraic action of the ambient algebraic group. So if you like, this is a Lie algebra object in the category of chain complexes of representations of G. So we have this. So we have this equivalent object now, such that the code chains, or if you will, I mean Solomon's commutative version of code chains and Solomon's polynomial differential forms on this important space. This is gamma equivarially. Weakly equivalent to the Chevalier algebra co-chains of this DGD algebra as commutative differential graded algebras. So it means that, and I mean this is in Sonoma's theory, the rational homotopy type of an important space is represented by this commuter differential grid algebra. So this not only captures So, this not only captures the rational homotopy type of the space, but it also captures it as a gamma space. It retains the action of gamma. And the point here is that this thing, well, it carries an action of gamma, but there's a priori no reason to expect that this action should be induced by an algebraic action of the ambient algebraic group. So that's the sort of main content here, is that we can find such a DGD algebra in this category. In this category. And this has a quite striking corollary, which I think is probably the main outcome of this work, which basically reduces the computation of the commodity of this classifying space to the computation of the commodity arithmetic groups. So the main corrobory is the following. Is the following. And this corollary heavily uses semi-simplicity of this category. So it's, I guess it's in theory if possible to, you know, you could study other covers, for instance the universal cover, and you might be able to prove a similar statement. But the problem with the if you take the fundamental group here instead of gamma, uh it will generally not be an arithmetic subgroup of a reductive group. So you will not have as good control of the representation theory as the group here. And you wouldn't And you wouldn't get this corollary. So the corollary says that the homology with rational coefficients, as always, in this talk, is isomorphic as an algebra to the cohort of gamma with coefficients in the Chevalier algebra cohomodity of this differentiated Lie algebra. So, this remark to make here is that this in particular implies, but it's actually much stronger than the collapse of the of the spectral sequence. Oh, the s the spectral signals. Associated to this cover. So we have this normal cover, and then we get a homotopy fiber sequence like this. And the right-hand side here is essentially the each. Is essentially the E2 page of the spectral sequence. Collapse of the spectral sequence would imply an isomorphism like this, but after passing to associated graded algebra for infiltration. So the claim here is that this isomorphism holds only nose without any filtration issues. And in particular, the commodity ring here is bigraded because the right-hand side is. So this gives you some extra structure on this ring. Structure on this ring of characteristic clauses. Okay. Yes. Do you know how much that bigrading depends on the choice of reductive quotient that you use? Well, this will be the maximal reduction quotient. And this is sort of the best you can do in this sense. I don't we don't have a like a uniqueness statement, but I suspect there is one can formulate some form of uniqueness statement where like this is the only group that will have this next property something along those lines. Along those lines. So it's kind of really the only thing that does this for you. Is gamma constructive? I mean, yes, yes, this is my next point. Yes. So this is really concrete, actually. So often gamma, this is going to be like, you know, this is like the Torrelli subgroup. This is a good thing to keep in mind as a model for this thing. Defined as a model for this thing. Often, gamma will exactly be the image of H, which I will define, and this classifying space, this will actually be a classifying space of a certain sub-monoid, and that sub-monoid will be precisely this sort of Turelli sub-monoid, if you will. So this will be the kernel of the homonoid representation. So H is going to be the map of monoids from this topological monoid to this topological. From this topological monoid to this discrete monoid of the rational model space. And this is very computable. And also the DGD algebra you can also express in very computable terms, in terms of like the important radical of the DGD algebra derivations or the minimal Sullivan model and things like this. And in the paper we carry out, like, we have this whole series of computations for illustrate that part. But I will not have time. But I will not have time to get into those limitations today because, well, actually, I'll mention one example. Yeah, and I said what this map was, but I forgot to write it out, so you send F to the index map in the model, of course. That's all it's So here's an example. So Alexander, what was the answer to? Is gamma a well-defined thing associated to X or? Yes. I mean it's it's the you could say it's the image You could say it's the image, so there are different ways of saying it. Gamma is the image of pi zero what x inside the maximum reductive quotient of. So this, if you pass the algebraic groups, I alluded to this, but the algebraic group is the space of, excuse me, the group of homotopy classes of self-reportances of the rationalization. That's a linear algebraic group, and that That's a linear algebraic group, and that has a maximum reductive quotient. And that's how you define counter. So, and often it will be this, not always, but often. Okay, in this case it will. And G in this case, this anti-par group, well, excuse me, I forgot to state which case I'm studying. So X is going to be the enfold product of S D. And just, I mean, we do the computation for all D, but let's just, I don't want to do a sort of. I don't want to do a sort of case division, so let me just do the case when D is odd and different from 17. And in this case, this G would just be G and M. This gamma would actually be an interesting congruence subgroup. And this stands for the subgroup of G and NZ. And you look at those, I mean, so you look at And you look at those, I mean, so you look at the map that reduces mod2, okay? So we have this homomorphism of groups. And inside GNN of F2, we have the permutation matrices. So we have the permutation group, sigma n, going. This is no group here. And this is the pullback. So it's those invertible n by n integer matrices whose reduction mode 2 is a permutation matrix. Okay, so it's an interesting congruence of who. Okay, so it's an interesting congruence I'll go here. And uh the Lie algebra turns out to be really easy in this case. This is not always going to be the case, but in this case it is. So you just get, I mean as a representation of this algebraic group, it's a dual of the standard representation, and then you put it in degree minus d. And it's a DGD algebra, but there's no room for any differential or any d brackets, because it's concentrated in a single dimension. In a single dimension. This is just a very easy algebra. And this, I mean, if we spell out what this says in this case, we just get the following. So the chromology of this classifying space is isomorphic, again, as an algebra, to the chromology of this GM, this common subgroup. And with the coefficients in the Chevalianum recommended. But the Chevalian recommended with a B and the algebra is a polynomial polynomial ring. D is odd, so that's why you get a polynomial ring instead of an exterior algebra. I mean, we're working with graded here. Let's see. So, yeah, so this will just be a polynomial rings in generators x1 up to xn, and these will be in colonological. these would be in colonological degree d plus one. So now this is a very sort of understandable. I mean the gradients here are quite understandable. I mean told you what the group is and this is a very easy representation of the symmetric powers of the standard representations. However computation of commodity arithmetic groups is in general quite a difficult thing. So while this theorem in a sense reduces the computation of these random characteristic classes to you know Characteristic classes to co-order your variability groups. But we don't really understand this well enough to be able to see that we've now completely computed this thing. But in some cases, you can say things. And for instance, for n equals 2 here, the right-hand side is by the Eichmachine Moore isomorphism. You can express this in terms of modular force, which is sort of kind of Which is sort of kind of surprising that that would make an appearance when studying characteristic classes of vibrations, at least to me. So what you end up getting is something like this. And then you put it in some funny cohomological degree. And this here is the space of And this here is the space of this is the space of weight k casped on modular forms on this congruence subgroup of SC2Z. And that's the thing you can compute the dimensions of these things. I mean these kinds of objects have been well studied by number theorists, and you can see a lot about them. But yeah, so we can say this when equals 2, but for n. For the for n greater than three, I mean unstable computations of you know common G and Z with with with coefficients and alpha like computation, that's generally not known. So sorry, where is N? Sorry. Where is N? N is here, okay. And then for N equals 2, I get a 2 instead of N. So while this does not give a complete computation, because we don't know what collaborative mathematic groups is in general, it sort of suggests certain problems here. I mean, so no one, right? We've been asked to post problems. No, I we've been asked to sort of pose problems, so I have I've been trying to do my homework of uh suggesting problems for for the consideration here. So uh I mean in this formula that I erased, so speaking about that so given x, we could both subgroup, and and the first question is, you know. And and the the first question is, you know, could this be used to understand commodity arithmetic? I mean, could this isomorphism be used backwards somehow to study these objects? And then you led to the question of what arithmetic groups can appear here, and also what representations can appear. And if you go back, I mean, Sandemann. If you go back, I mean, Sunderman has some results in his infinitesimal computations that basically imply that any commensurability class of arithmetic groups can appear. So up to finite index subgroups, you can have any arithmetic group appearing in the right-hand side. But that doesn't tell you that this specific uh finite index subgroup uh will appear. So there's a further problem in in in in in extending Solomon's realizability result to Realizability result to like what arithmetic group specifically can appear, not just at the commensurate. And secondly, I mean, see, there are, you know, for GL2Z and for other groups, you can define commodity classes or arithmetic groups in terms of things like monitor reforms or generalizations of them. Them. So, and it's not clear at the moment what the geometric meaning of these classes were. So, what is the meaning of the characteristic classes of vibrations that you can associate to known? To known sources for combinative arithmetic groups, such as automorphic forms. And furthermore, I mean, one can ask, you know, just study spaces of self-equivalences, but what about similar results for other classifying spaces? So, what about About the classified space for the diffimorphism group, if X is a smooth manifold, is there any chance we can expect something along these lines, like being able to decompose this space in a similar way? Where have you used the D not equal to one three seven? Oh, if you remove if you take the order if you take the one of these, just remove sigma. Just remove sigma. And that has to do with the fact. I mean, that's the age space in dimensions, and that's basically the reason. I mean, if you have a answer, I mean, you'll only be looking at the homology, the isomorphism, the self-isomorphisms of the homology that are realizable by a self-equivalence. And so you're immediately run into. Okay, so that concludes the first part. So that concludes the first part of this talk. And the next thing I want to talk about is... Excuse me, but Emilium was about finite complexes, this pancreaduality, or just... This is for arbitrary finite, simply connected complexes. So now we're going to move to punctured complexes. So there's something beautiful that happens when punctured reality enters the picture. So there's this way of actually producing characteristic classes here. Classes here using conservative graph complexes. So that's what I'll talk about next. And I'm afraid some of this is. And I'm afraid some of this is, some of you have heard me talk about these things before, and some of these things are still to appear. I'm afraid, I apologize for being slow in getting this out. But anyway. So I'm going to use a particular technical tool to define these causes. There might be other ways of getting them, but this is my variant. My variety in there. So I'm going to fix R and augmented the commutative differentially graded algebra over Q. So this will be my base ring, if you like. This will be like a model for the base of the vibrations that we study. Now we can talk about relative pocket validity models, meaning sort of pocket-ready validity models for vibrations. And the algebraic candidate I will use to The algebraic guide that I will use to model these things is the following. So, this is just a definition. Conquer duality, C infinity algebra, or commutative A infinity algebra, if you like, of dimension M over R is the following. So it's first of all a finitely general. First of all, a finitely generated free, or well, semi-free. It's a differential created thing, so it's not literally free, but it's underlying, if you forget the differential, it's free over R. So DG R molecule A with two structures. First, it has a C-infinity alpha structure. Do these things have the same homotopy as E infinity algebras? Sorry, do these things have the same homotopy theory as E infinity algebra? Yes. So a C infinity algebra structure which that amounts to Which that amounts to having a sequence of maps mu n from a tensor over r n times 2a and these maps have a certain degree. So this indicates the degree shift. And we have one of those for n equals 2, 3, 4, etc. So this is, and I mean I will just remind you in words what an infinity undergrads. So you have a multiplication, mu2. Multiplication, μ2, and maybe it's associative, but in general it need not be. However, μ3 gives you a specific homotopy that exhibits μ2 as a homotopy, associated operation. And then commutativity just means that we require mu2 to be strictly commutative, and then there are similar commutativity constraints on the higher new ones. Okay? So I have an R-linear. So I have an R linear C infinity algebra. And then I have, I mean, the pop-up reality sort of where I have a non-degenerate symmetric R bilinear form. And here is where the dimension comes in. It's in the degree shift, I mean, the degree of this binary form. Okay, so you have this. And to tie these two structures together, you require, I mean the axiom is that the following operation of mu hat. Is this visible to everyone? Yes? Okay, great. So mu hat n plus 1. So this is an operational error to n plus 1. And it's what you get when you pair a0 with mu n applied to a1 to a n. Okay? This is an operation in a 0 up to a n, and it's required that this is invariant. Unrecyclic permutations of the inputs, A0 up to a sign which I've not specified. Okay? So these are familiar things. I mean this thing has been studied under the name of Frobenius Infinite. Name of Frobenius C infinity algebra bus or symplexic C infinity algebra or cyclic C infinity altogether. This thing has many names. I prefer the word conquer duality because I care about concern spaces. But it's most often considered in the case when R is just some field. So now we're taking this and making this the same definition, but just over the augmented differential fielded algebra. Sorry, Alex. So the new Sorry, Alex, so the the um mu n doesn't have to be commutative when n is bigger than switch around. Well n no, it has to be commutative, but in the sense that the the the what you I mean mu n is supposed to vanish on the shuffles. It's simply about putting the A0 into the not oh sorry cyclic permutation. Yeah, so this is just about cyclic permutation out of all different permissions. And then the non-degenerate form is genuine. Non-degenerate form is genuinely non-degenerate or just a homology? No, it's like strictly. This is an important point actually. It's like strictly non-degenerate. So this is like a homotopy version of a concrete duality algebra, but we're only relaxing the associativity part, not the bilinear form part. Sorry, I suppose the great. Yeah, I mean in the you know in the applications this this would be like uh the the there aren't forms of on some space so it's non-negatively graded and you will probably assume that it's connected so it says like h0 is q but I mean you can make the definition without right and then some terminology We call that we say that A is I mean an example of this kind of thing is when all the mu n's are zero except mu two and then we just get back the notion of a commutative concrete duality algebra over R. So and we call that the strict C infinity algebra. So if mu n is zero So if mu n is 0 for n greater than equal to 3, so this just means that A is a concrete value algebra over R in the in the yeah. And then we say that A is, on the other hand, this is sort of an autonomous notion, so A is we say that A is minimal if the induced differential Differential on this on the fiber is zero. So it just has trigger differentially. I mean R is assumed to be augmented, so Q is in particular module everywhere. And the main theorem here is that this kind of Is that this kind of gadget can be used to model vibrations with Poincaré fibers? So now if X is an M-dimensional, simply connected concerned gravity complex, then for every oriented vibration Uh fiber X there you can construct this kind of gadget. So there is a C D J or and in fact a minimum minimal conquer duality C infinity algebra A of dimension M over R such that the pair R comma A so the pair of a C D J together with the C infinity algebra over it With the C infinity algebra over it is equivalent to the pair of the differential forms on B and differential forms on the total space, where this is made into a module over that by the by this. So it means that in particular it means that the commodity of R is equal to the commodity of B and the commodity of A is this commodity of B. Yes, I Come on, good. Yes, I have a question. So, in Solomon's theory, don't you need a simplicial structure on E and B to make sense of the forms? Well, no, in modern accounts, you don't know. I mean, sure, influencing computations, you should have triangulated spaces, et cetera. So, what do you mean by the forms on E? Oh, well, this thing called APL that people have used. I mean, so you choose some visual model, like some visual sets, weak equipment, whose realization is weak equipment. Whose realization is weakly equivalent to the space you're interested in? Okay. And then you just use that. Yes, that's the theorem. So a special case of this theorem, you can think of as a parameterized version of the As a parameterized version of the following, which is an observation that goes back to Stasher. Namely, that if you have a concrete energy space, the cohomology of that space, it always carries a C-infinity algebra structure. This is something that Kadesh maybe showed. But when you have a concrete energy space, you get a concrete C-infinity algebra structure on cohomology in this sense. But this is really the case when R is equal to Q, and this is like a parameterized version of. A parametrized version of that theorem, if you like. P need to be finite? Sorry? Does P need to be finite for that sort? No. Non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, if they're positively negatively graded. How do you make it uh non-degenerate? Well, just the adjoint map is an isomorphism. Also, the target was R shifted if you agree M. The target was shifted. Yeah, the targets are shifted by M here. I don't know if that clarifies anything. No, I mean, I mean, it's very elementary. I mean, it's a biological. So if we have the binary form, and if it has an adjustment, a non-degenerative, non-degeneracy And non-degenerative non-degeneracy simply means by definition that this is an isomorphism on the nose. But see that if A is negatively graded, then the adjoint is going to be also bounded from the other side. Yeah, but this is not an issue. We can talk later, perhaps. So this having this type of models allows us to do This type of models allow us to define these characteristic classes. And so, this is, I'll let me sketch how that goes. But now we get to this graph complex. So, let me give you try. I mean, I'm not going to state a formal definition because that will take forever. So, let me just try to give you the idea. So, now if I have a concrete value, So now, if I have a functory, C infinity algebra over R, at least one of those things, and then I can make sense of, like if I have a graph, for instance, this tree, I can make sense of evaluating this graph on elements of this infinity, excuse me, C infinity algorithm. Here I can make the choice of I take this new 3 operation and I apply it to A and C and I get an A and C, and I get an element of R. And the basic idea is to just extend this to graphs. For instance, by following this graph with one vertex and one loop and two labeled pairs like this, the idea is I use the co-evaluation map whenever I see an edge like this. So here I'll be summing with a certain sign. I mean, with a certain sign of here, it's a four-valent vertex, so I put in u four at. And then for this edge, I sum over the basis for A over R and the dual basis. So EI and EI dual. And then I have a so here, EI is an argument basis for A, and it A and it's strictly non-degenerate, so I have a dual basis. So this is typical basis. And you can easily imagine how to, you know, you can write more complicated graphs and you can make sense of what it needs to evaluate on one element or A. And this is basically the idea you need in order to arrive at the definition of conservatives graph complex. So this basic idea gives idea gives you in the end a chain map from this thing that we call g m n comma s. This is conservative's graph complex and this is spanned by By connecting graphs of rank n, so the rank meaning the first beta number. So here the rank is 0, n is equal to 0. Here the rank is 1 because I have a loop here. So rank n graphs and s is the number of inputs. Or hairs. And then, well, there's certain orientation data, and this M here is just recording the parity of the dimension. So there's an odd version of the graph complex, and there's an even version of the graph complex. Yeah, I'm only talking about C-infinity algorithms here. But you can be Leo. Yeah, I'll mention what this is in language that you might be familiar with. In language that you might be familiar with. So, and then, yeah, there's orientation data in order to make sense of the signs here, but I will suppress that for now. And you see, you really need non-degeneracy in order to be able to write down this this thing. I mean, strict non-degeneracy. Genesis. So, this thing has many names. This is Koncelvich's version. In his original paper, he considered a version where you didn't have any hairs like this. You sort of connected up all the loops. So this is in the terminology of Getzer and Capranov, this is also called the Cobor construction or they use the terminology Feynman transform of the Lie operad. So the tree part of this complex is just the ordinary The free part of this complex is just the ordinary cobar construction in the sense of Gilesburg and Carno on the Lie operator. And the only thing you do to get this more fancy version is you allow yourself self-funding, like adding loops and such. But the surprising thing is that this graph complex has a very complicated homology, and it's not known what it is in general still. So there's a theorem of conservation. Continuature in the even case, and the last or a boring of the odd case is that the homology of this graph complex is isomorphic to, let me just state it for the vacuum case when you have no inputs. But there's a similar statement when you have more than zero inputs. And this recovers the homology about RFM. Recovers the homology of out Fl, I mean the group of outer automorphisms of F L, which makes a second appearance here, but for an entirely different reason, with coefficients in the mth power determinant representation. So this is the trivial representation of M is E. Okay. Now the corollary of this observation that you get this chain map and the theorem that I stated is the following. Is the following. So there is a map. I mean, now again, retain the notation from before. So this is now a concrete reality fibration with X a simply connected concrete reality complex. Then you get the map from the homology of the graph complex and so Yeah, so the commodity of the top of the space S times and to the commodity of the base shifted by this amount. And I use suggested notation for this map. So if alpha is a graph commodity class, and if I have an S common tensor product of commodity classes in the total space. I map these things. I use this notation. This is supposed to remind you of fiber integration. But this is just suggestive notation. So there's a way of producing commodity classes in the base from full graph commodity classes. In particular, when s is equal to zero, We get lots of homogeneity classes from just sort of these faction graph classes, that is to say, from homogeneity classes here. As soon as you have a concrete duality fiber, this is quite amazing. I mean, if you have a vibration with concrete duality fiber, you suddenly have all these characteristic processes. Oh, well, yeah. Okay. Any questions then before I race? So, I mean, obviously, Lee is coming up because it's causing people to call. Yes. Uh i is there an explanation, like, I can I start attaching the extra stuff? Like, is this related to the the the point create duality condition? Poincaré duality condition? Well, the Poincaré duality comes when you want when you need to make sense of evaluating a graph. What do you expect as well? So I guess I'm wondering if there's like some kind of causal duality for like, I don't know, cyclic like Leopard or something that's causal dual governs these algebras. Yeah, yeah. I mean, what you say sounds reasonable, yes. But what is the question, maybe? I guess it's like just a. Yeah. Yeah, is there a Kuzul duality which its target is types of? So I can say this. You can certainly generalize this to other Kuzul dual pairs of cyclic operators. That's certainly something you can use. You would have a similar situation for the associative versus the associative operator, et cetera. So talk about something similar for, I guess, Poncurio already, the associative, the infinity other versus serial community. And then you will get the associative. And then you get associated graph complexes. Okay, okay, thanks. So now we have these clauses, and I basically just wanted to end with. Oh, another feature of this map is that I can show is that, well, the construction dependent on the choice of this model, this situation. Of the choice of this model, this concrete algebra, C infinity algebra, but you can check that this is actually independent of that choice. So let's see, I have more than I can say. Let me just make a choice here. Is there a sense in which this is really integrational on the fibers, this map? Well, yeah, okay. So then that thank you for helping me making the choice. So in particular, so this gives us ways of defining. So I mean, yes. So suppose I, our vibration, has more structure. Suppose it, for instance, is a smooth bundle, and then it has a stable tandem bundle. So if this has, and all I need is a stable function. So if this has a fine. This is a stable function. So, if this has a fiberwise tiny bundle, let's call it Ti. And this, for instance, if I is a smooth manifold bundle, presupposing that X is a smooth manifold, or even or less uh or more generally, like a a block bundle is enough in order to have a stable In order to table a stable fiberwise tandem bundle, then we can define something which is along the lines of, well, we have the classical million-wheeler moment process, which is this kappa C, which is integration of all the fiber of Of C evaluated at the vertical tangent bundle for C, a characteristic class of stable bundles, commodity class of BO. So this is now literally an integration bundle fiber. So this gives us a commodity class in the base. And you can do something similar using these things. So you can show that for the generator, so E n E 0, S, a generator. As a generator, this is, yeah, this will just be this tree. So this is a generator for the zero tomology of G0 comma S. We have that this guy literally just recovers integration among the fiber of the product of these classes. These clauses. So, this construction generalizes intuition of the fiber. And we can define a generalization of the Middle-World-Munford clauses using this inspired by this, we can define. Inspired by this, we can define kappa alpha of C1 up to Cs to be integration along this graph class, whatever that means, of C1 applied to the fibrous tilt bundle, etc. CS. And this will give us now new characteristic classes of manifold buttons or block. Of manifold buttons or block buttons. So and let me just end by stating sort of one of the main problems in my mind about these classes. So Am I about to continue despite the space now? At least it was not a firearm. So I recall two computations, which is which is... First is this computation by Galatius and Landry Williams, but the stable commodity of the morphism groups of certain highly connected manifolds. So we have the commodity of So we have the homology of B diff relative to a disk of this manifold WG, which is this gene from connected sum of SD processed. And D is now, I guess, to be safe, let's say 3 or above. And this, as G goes to infinity, the commodity here, rational commodity was computed by Ganatius and Randall Williams. It's namely freely generated. It's namely freely generated. It's a polynomial ring in certain of these miller rhythm of the classes. And this is an isomorphism stately, meaning as G goes to infinity. So this is Galatius Williams. Now what we so what you can do now is you can factor this map. We can include this into, I'll just put circle here, you can be precise about exactly what. Here, you can be precise about exactly what classes you need, but I don't have the time to spell that out. Earlier work by myself and Ed Matson showed that if you try to do the same thing for the block diffeomorphism group, you see all these graph classes appearing. So there's a similar statement, again stately, and this is myself from Nutson. Plus the Plus, you need to work to relate the classes that I find today to the classes that I and I considered in our paper. I mean, it's a completely different construction from the classes, but you can show that they're the same. So, this stable commodity of the property geomorphism group is given by these graph kappa clauses. And here, all alphas are here. All non-trivial. And then, well, you have them in the diffeimorphism group maps to the prop diffimorphism groups, you have a map in the other direction here. And so this begs the question: this indicates that, well, to generate this, we only need these sort of graph classes associated to zero-dimensional homogeneity. But here we need all of them. But this seems to indicate that the map from block to I mean this map imposes lots of algebraic relations among these. There's lots of algebraic relations among these graph kappa classes. So, something interesting must be happening when you move from proper diffimorphists to diffimorphists to these classes. So, I'll end the talk with this basic question is what happens to these kappa alpha these generalized well these graph kappa classes for for smooth uh line. And a naive guess could be that they're just up to zero. But we don't know that yet. You were thinking unstable. Even stably. I mean, the question makes sense stably. Even more, I mean, if we can answer it unstably, that would be better. I'm not you know, that's certainly harder, but but this question is is already interesting, stably. Already zero for positive graph has a positive group. Graph class is supposed to be okay. I have a question about the bike rating and the gamer PHP. Uh if I remember correctly the group gamma. group gamma it acts on uh G but you need to see but you need to s to choose uh Levy decomposition of uh that algebraic group right that's right but that's unique up to conjugacy in the bottom group so it's up to homotopy additional choices so this bi-graded like this this biged like this uh this bigrated algebra does not depend on or cannot depend on on this choice of the algebraic And we have our picture now, and then there's a long discussion break and then
