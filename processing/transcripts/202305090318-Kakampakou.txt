All right, so the next talk is by Lydia Hegampaku. Not sure if I say it correctly, but and the talk after that will be by Silius. Okay, so get the training. So hello, I'm Lydia. I thought I would start this presentation by introducing myself. Maybe this is my first talk as a PhD student. So I'm a first-year PhD student at Lancaster under the supervision of Dr. Jenny Watsworth. And Dr. Jenny Watsworth. I am working on spatial exchange at the moment, and what I'm going to be presenting is joint work with Dr. Emerson's UCL. So, objectives and motivation of the project. Basically, the motivation is climate change, and we know that climate change has been affecting marginal trends and how these change over time. But is the same thing happening in the extremal spatial extremal dependence in Canada? Spatial extremal dependence, and how can we identify such changes of these spatial extremal dependence over time? So, this was our goal in this project. And we want to try and develop both diagnostic tools to try and identify those changes, if there are any, and then try and extend over statistical models in order to be able to quantify those changes. And we wanted to do that using a conditional framework. Wants to do that using a conditional framework of what's working on, basically to take advantage of its nice properties when it comes to high-dimensional inference and flexible genome-dependent structures. So we started by exploring this by a Chi-Measure that Rafael introduced yesterday. And this was giving evidence. This was giving evidence of the defendants changing, but because we had to consider a lot of pairwise, the information was very noisy. So we thought we would try and introduce an averaging scheme to sort of tune down this noise we were observing. So basically what we did was for our conditioning location as J, we would consider all pairwise combinations with that conditioning location. With that conditioning location, compute the pairwise chi, and then just average over those and then have a single chi measure for this location. And you can do that for all of the conditioning locations available in your data set, and you can also do that using a chunk of your data in a time period. So then, if you could compute the average type for, say, a chunk of the data in the beginning of the data set and then a chunk of the data at the end of the data set, you have a means of comparing is the dependent change. Is dependent changing over time. So we also consider the differences in here, the differences in chi's for a chunk in the beginning of the data and another time interval at the end of the data set. Putting this into context, here is an application. One of the data sets we looked at was the daily sea surface temperature from the Red Sea that Raphael and a lot of other people have already talked about. So the plot on the left is average price for the years. Is average chi for the years 1985 to 1989. And the plot on the right is average chi estimates for the years 2011 to 2015. And we can see the colour of the block of the left being darker than that of the block of the right, showing some suggesting there is a weakening spatial eternal dependence going on there. This is also the case for the plot. Also, the case for the plot of the differences between these two time intervals. So, the differences being almost everywhere positive, apart from maybe this region and this region here, also suggests a weakening extremal dependence. So, okay, we have this encouraging result, and then we want to try and use the model and extend that to be able to allow for changing defender structure. So, this is the conditional extremes model of Waldsworth-Meton. Model of Wolfforce Metal. I'm not gonna go into the details of that too much because I don't have to, and also because a lot of people already know what that is about. I'm just gonna say that the first step we took into trying to extend this model to allow for this non-stationarity in the dependent structure was allow this A function here, so this function here to depend over time. So, this is the functional form we considered. This is the same from the Watsworth-Enton paper, and we basically On paper, and we basically allowed as a first step this lambda parameter here to vary over time. And we want to use the data to simulate the functional form we're going to use for this lambda here. So we're not just guessing a functional form. We're trying to use the patterns in the data to motivate that. This is a very short version of my other was very long list, like to do list for the future, and it's here mainly to emphasize that this is very much. Emphasize that this is very much ongoing work and there's a lot of things that need to be done. But yeah, some references in. Thank you very much.
