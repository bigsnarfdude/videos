And first of all, we want to define what do we mean by a principal minor map. What is a principal minor? A principal minor is the determinant of a submatrix that's indexed by the same set of rows and columns. And the principal minor map is a map that takes an n by n complex, or if you prefer real matrices, and it gives us two to the power n vectors of that whose components are just the That whose components are just the principal minors of the matrix A. So the first component is going to be one, and then we will have the one-dimensional principal minors, the diagonal entries, and then the two by two minors, principal minors, and at the end we have the n dimensional principal minor, which is just a determinant of the matrix. As an example, suppose we have this 3 by 3 matrix. The image of this matrix under this map is 2 to the power 3. Is a two to the power three vector again. First component is one, and then we have the diagonal entries, and then we have the two by two principal minors where we choose the first, for example, a1, two, we choose the first row, second row, first column, second column, and we compute the corresponding principal minor, and so on, so forth until we reach the determinant. What we are interested in today, we are interested in characterizing the image of the principal minor map. In other words, if you are given a 2 to the power n factor, how can you The power n vector, how can you tell if its components are the principal minors of some matrix? The easiest case is the case n equals 2. Suppose I have 2 to the power 2 vector, which is 1 components, and we want to know if it's coming from a 2 by 2 matrix. Then we will end up having four equations. The first one should be 1, and then this is the first diagonal. This is the second diagonal entry. This is the determinant. In the case n equals 2, not too much to be said, it's overdetermined. Be said it's over determined, it's just characterized by the first component being equal to one now. For the case n equals three, it's similar, also it's overdetermined. The image is going to be full dimensional in the vector space where the first component is one. It starts to be more interesting for the case n equals four. Here one can prove that the image is not four-dimensional and by looking at the generic point and the dimension of the fiber. And the question is. And the question is: How can we characterize this image? What are the equations and inequalities that characterize this image? The image of the principal minor map over the real and over the complex numbers? And what if I want to restrict the map to the subspace of symmetric matrices or of Hermitian matrices? What can we say? A quick historical background of this problem: Holzen Stromfields in 2006 considered this problem over considering. This problem over considered this map restricted to the subspace of symmetric matrices. They proved that the image is closed. They also proved that it's invariant under the action of this group, especially linear group, in our product, the symmetric group. And they conjectured that the ideal in the general case is going to be generated by this nice degree 4 polynomial. This is the 2x2x2 hyperdeterminantal polynomial, and all its images are. Polynomial and all its images under the action of this group. Oding in 2011 solved this conjecture satiologically. He proved that reality, the variety, is cut out by satiologically by equation by the hyperdeterminantal polynomial and all its equations and all its images under the action of this group. We will see this polynomial later. This work was done in the symmetric case. For the general case, so if we look at the image of the n by n general Of the n by n general matrices. All this was over the complex numbers. Also, Lin and Stromfies in 2008 considered this map. They proved that it's closed. They also give a general, this is the case n equals four that we were talking about. They give an explicit list of the minimal generators of the ideal. And it was generated by degree 12 polynomials. And they conjectured that for any n. That for any n the variety is cut out by equations of degree 12. What I'm gonna do today, I'm gonna show a solution for this conjecture set theoretically over the complex numbers. And we will prove that additional inequality will characterize the image over the real numbers. Also, we're gonna give a um we're gonna find that if finding equations and inequalities in the symmetric and the Hermitian cases. To achieve these goals, we used what is called determinant. We use what is called determinant, multi-affine determinantal polynomial. Multi-affine just have been mentioned right now. Multi-affine is a polynomial whose highest degree, the degree of each variable is at most one. We say it's determinantal if it can be written multi-affine determinantal. It means that it can be written as a determinant where the variables is on the diagonal plus some matrix. If one compute this determinant, we will notice that the coefficients here are just the principal minors of A. A. We will say throughout, we will say that f is the symmetric determinantal if the matrix A is symmetric. We will say that F is Rermitian determinantal if A is Rermitian. As an example of such a polynomial, suppose I have this 2 by 2 matrix, we just add x1 and x2 to its diagonal, and we compute its determinant. As promised, the coefficients are going to be the principal minus of our matrix A, and it's a multi-affine polynomial. And it's a multi-affine polynomial degree at most one in each variable. Another notion we want to use also, it has been mentioned before in the previous talks, it's the Rayleigh differences. This is the delta ij, which is of a polynomial. It's the derivative of f with respect to xi, derivative of f with respect to xj minus the second derivative of f with respect to both of them, multiplied by f. If f is multi-affine, we can see that this is multi-quadratic degree at most two in each variable. Degree at most two in each variable, and it's going to be independent of xi and xj. As an example, if we consider the schematic polynomial of degree two in three variables and we compute this delta one two, for example, we will notice that it's a quadratic independent of x1 and x2. The really differences have been used before, for example, by Brandon in order to characterize multi-affine stable polynomials. He proved that a real multi-affine polynomial is a Riemann of the affine polynomial is stable found only if delta ij is positive for all i and j. Also, it was used before by Humer, Plumman, and Venzand in 2013 to characterize semantic determinantal polynomial, multi-affine polynomial. A real multi-affine polynomial is semantic determinantal if and only if delta ij is a square. Okay, this theorem was the main motivation of this project. Why and why do Why and why do we want to relate the Rayleigh differences to the principal minor map problem? A simple example: we will start with n equals 3. And suppose I have 2 to the power 3 vector, and I want to know if it lies in the image or not. I'm going to assign to this vector a multi-affine polynomial by assigning the components to the coefficients of this vector, of this polynomial. And using their theorem, the theorem said if f is symmetric determinantal, if and only if delta ij. Determinantal if and only if delta ij is a square for each i and j. Let's try to compute delta 1, 2, for example. Computing delta 1, 2, as we said before, this is going to be a quadratic independent of x1 and x2. Here, just I replace the a i's by the c i's in order to simplify the equation. And we want to know when this quadratic is a square. Well, a quadratic is a square if and only if its discriminant is zero. And since we are working over r, we need Since we are working over R, we need some additional inequalities. Computing the determinant, this is C1 squared minus 4, C0, C2, plus some additional inequalities. And here is the magic of the whole story, and here is the secret relation between the two, between the Rayleigh differences and the principal minor map. If we replace this by the AIs, what we are going to get is just the hyperdeterminantal polynomial that you have mentioned before and two additional inequalities. And two additional inequalities. In this case, we can see for the case unequality, we have characterized the image of the principal minor map. So if the vector is in the image, if and only if it satisfies these equations and some additional inequalities. What will happen over C? I will get rid of from these inequalities. So over C, if we could generalize the rule, because the theorem was given for R, if we could generalize it over C, then we're going to Then we're gonna get also a generalization of the image of the principal minor map in the case n equals three. In reality, we have done that, we have generalized this over not only the complex numbers, we have generalized it over any unique factorization domain. And we were able to recover Odding result over the complex numbers and we characterize the image of the principal minor map over the reals, where we get some additional inequalities. Where we get some additional inequalities. This is a paper already on the archive. And what is our aim is to move from symmetric determinantal to Hermitian determinantal and more generally to determinantal representation when a multi-affine polynomial has determined representation. One can think that if semantic determinantal representation corresponds to gij squared to the Rayleigh difference being a squared, then Hermitian determinants. Square, then Hermitian determinant representation might correspond to here having a product of two conjugates. And a general determinant representation if I have a product of two polynomials that are multi-affine. And the expectations turned out to be true. And the theorem is f is determinantal if and only if the really difference factor into two multi-affine polynomial and Hermitian determinantal if and only if the really difference factors into two conjugates. Conjugates. Well, I don't have time to give the proof, but now the question becomes: when the really difference factors into two multi-affine polynomials. So one in multi-quadratic polynomial, G factors into two multi-affine polynomials or two conjugates. And in this case, what are the relations imposed on the factor? To answer this question, so one ematic paradigm polynomial. So, one emotic paradigm polynomial factors and two moti are fine. If you look at the n equals one over the complex number, this is an algebraically closed field. Nothing is important. We are going to start with at least the case n equals two and try to see a multi-quadratic degree at most two in each variable. One does it factor into two multi-affine polynomials. Using any algebra software, one can see that this happens if and only if 39 polynomials, the coefficients of g satisfy 39 equipment. G satisfies 39 equations of degree 6. And if the polynomial happens to be real and we want to see when it does it factor into two conjugates, then we can specialize x2 to be zero. What we're going to get is quadratic. And the question number one, a quadratic factors into two conjugates. And then this relies also on the discriminant. We want the discriminant to be non-positive. And if I wanted to split into two multi-affine polynomials, but over the reals. Polynomials, but over the reals, then again, specializing over x2 equals zero, I want it to split into two reals, which tells us that the discrepancy is just positive. And this gives us a characterization. Reality, this is just for n equals two for two variables. We got the generalization for any n um so for any n, it uh multi-quadratic polynomial factors into two multi-affine. Into two multi-fine if and only if its coefficient should say some equations of degree six. It factors into two conjugates if and only it says 39 equations of degree six plus the orbit of the 39 equations of degree six plus some inequalities. And over the reals it factors into two real polynomial multi-affine polynomial also with the if it if and only if it satisfies some 39 equations plus some inequalities. And using all this, we got the final result. This we got the final result which gives a characterization of the image of the principal minor map. So a vector lies in the image if and only if it's a 539 equations of degree 12. And in the Hermitian case, it lies in the image of the Hermitian subspace if and only if A and all its images satisfy 39 equations of degree 12 plus some additional inequalities that corresponds as before to the discriminant. And it lies in the image in general. And it lies in the image in general if and only if A and all its images satisfy the general equations of degree 12 plus some inequalities. Yeah, these were the basic results. And just to relate it to maybe our audience more interested in stable polynomials, to relate to the stable polynomials. Well, a multi-affine polynomial, the corollary of what you have done, is a multi-affine polynomial that has terminated representation. It's stable if and only if it has Hermitian. If and only if it has Hermitian determinant representation for some Hermitian matrix, yeah, and I believe my time is over, right? Yeah, thank you, thank you for stopping. Very interesting. We'll hear more about this in the near future, I guess.
