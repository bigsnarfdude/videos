Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the last day of the conference. So, we start with the talk by Marta Pieropan, who will talk to us about points of bounded height on certain sub-varieties of Tauric varieties. Thank you very much. Thank you to the organizers for inviting me to give a talk here. I will tell you about points abundant height on certain sub-varieties of toric. At height on certain sub-varieties of Toric varieties, and all of this is joint work with the Marie Schindler. I want to start with some motivation. Why am I interested in the problem that I'm going to tell you about, the white Tauric varieties? So, I will start with the conjecture by Manning and other people. By Manning and other people about counting points of bandit height on Fanovarieties, we have seen this conjecture already. This week, if V is a smooth final variety over a number field, I call it K. And if we assume that there are enough rational points on V, so V of K is. V. So V of K is a risky dense, but also let's assume that it is not thin. And if we choose a line bundle L, which is big, so that we could can define a height starting from L. Then there exists possibly. There exists possibly an exceptional set Z, which is a subset of the set of rational points and is small enough, meaning it's thin, and hence the non-thinness assumption here, such that if we consider the let's change board, if we consider the cardinality of the set of points of banded height on V, points that don't lie in the exceptional set Z. Don't lie in the exceptional set Z, and here the height. I write HL for the height defined by L. I'm not going to go into specifics of how this is defined. Think of your favorite example. Then this cardinality at B grows, grows asymptotically like a constant times B to some power A of L times log B to some power B of L minus one, where A of L and B of L. Where A of L and B of L are geometric, are invariants of the line bundle L on my variety V. A of L in particular is the smallest rational number such that if we take P times L plus the canonical divisor of V, then this is effective. It's an ifimum if you. It's an infimum if you ask for effectiveness, it's a minimum if you ask for pseudo-effective. In any case, in principle, that's a real number. As Shaw told us a couple of days ago, if L is big enough, that's actually a rational number. And in most examples that we work with, it is an integer. It ends up being an integer. V of L can also be computed in terms of effective divisor. It's the codimension. Of the minimal phase of the effective cone of X of V, sorry, that's actually the pseudo effective cone to be precise, that contains the adjoint divisor A L plus A of L times L, that's my notation for today, plus the canonical of V. So once we Canonical of V. So once we compute A, we can compute B. We first have to compute A. Anyway, this conjecture is here only for motivation right now. So that's what I've been working on since my PhD or starting in my PhD if you want. And what I want to do now is to try to motivate why, if we want to look and try to understand this conjecture, it makes sense to look at Tauric varieties. Sense to look at toric varieties. So why toric varieties? If V is smooth and fanal, like in the conjecture, then the theory of cox rings tells us that we can find at least one split toric variety, proper split. Tauric variety over the same field, such that two things hold. The first one is that our funo variety V is a sub-variety of X, so it's a close sub-variety of X. And if I call this inclusion I for inclusion, then I can look at the Picard group of X. I can take pullback of divisors to Take pullback of divisors to V. And I can choose X such that this is an isomorphism. And even more, I can assume that under this isomorphism, the effective cone of X is mapped into the effective cone of V. Okay. Okay, let's look at these, and if you want, these in principle become real, but whatever. So, the reason why I tell you this is that if we choose such an embedding with these properties, then in principle, we can compute the invariants A and B for V on X. So that's my way of saying that's the right embedding to consider. If you want, for example, to do the universal torso method or what better the split orsor method. This is a way to go about it. And since every most mood final variety is a sub-variety of centuric varieties, now the next question is going to be: well, forget about the final variety that we start with. Can we find With, can we find asymptotic formulas for counting points of bandit height? L also will come from x because of this property. Can we count points of bandit height on subvarieties of toric varieties in general? So the setting for today is the following X will be a smooth value. A smooth proper split Toric variety. And for today, I will work over Q because I want to use the hyperbola method to count points, and that is only known over the rational numbers. And I will call T inside X the open torus. And I will give later a more explicit description of T in terms of coordinates. And I will have to fix the coordinate ring or the Cox ring of X. I will denote it by Q of X I J. So this is always a polynomial ring. And I will write my variables as X ij. Variables as x ij's for i from 1 to s and j from 1 to and i. Now the cox ring is a ring, polynomial ring, sometimes a quotient of a polynomial ring, in this case only polynomial ring, with a gradient which is given by the Picard group. I'm not going to explain how it is constructed, that's not relevant, but we are going to use the fact that the gradient is given by the Picard group. So the name of the variables come from the gradient that I'm going to specify. I say that. I say that the degree of the variable xij is a divisor class di in the Picard group of X. So what I'm doing, I am just taking this polynomial ring, which I know is my coordinate ring. I am looking at the grading of the variables. I'm looking at the degrees. And then I just group together with the index J all the variables that have a given. All the variables that have a given degree di. And that's how I partition my variable in here. And that's because it's going to be relevant for how I count later on. So that's just some way of describing this. Can always do this. And in particular, the I's will be in the end generators for the Picard group, but they don't need to form a basis. All right. Now we have V inside axes of a writing. Subvariety. And now you see why I care about the cocktail. It's because every closed sub-variety of X is going to be, well, like any sub-variety of any variety, it can be described as an intersection of hypersurfaces. Hypersurfaces are effective divisors, and effective divisors are defined by equations in this ring. So V is always cut out or defined by By pick X homogeneous polynomials in this coordinate ring. I call these polynomials G1 up to GT in the ring that I just introduced. And I can actually always choose them to be. Always choose them to be with coefficients in z just by multiplying, since I'm only going to be interested in zeros of these polynomials. All right, so this is the setting we start with. Now, if we look at the universal torso of X, Of X because X is splitted, that's very simple. It's going to be an open subset of the affine space defined by this ring. And inside there, I have the torus, the pre-image of the torus. So I can describe the points on the torus T that I defined earlier as follows: parametrized by coordinates x, i, j, integers. Integers, non-zero integers, with the property that, well, somehow these points need to live in the torso, which I didn't describe. It's an open set, so it's going to be defined by some GCD condition, which I'm not going to make precise because it's not the point of this talk. So there's going to be some coprimality conditions, which I call now here GCD. And this is up to, okay, let's write a little bit more. Up to okay, let's write a little bit smaller. Up to the action of the torus dual to the Picard group. So, in the end, this is action of units in Z plus minus one, which make a group when we take to rank of the Picard group of X, and which act, well, not just by multiplication. There's a way to describe what the action looks like, depends on the Picard group and the degrees of the Xi J's in the Picard group. Degrees of the Xijs in the Picard group, but there's an action of this group. It's a transitive action. All right. So that's a bijection as a set with a map between the two of them. Okay, we're almost done with the setting. So, what do we want to do? We want to count points of band at height, so we need a height. At height, so we need a height. I am going to call L a big line bundle on X. And then I am going to look at the counting function n of B of points in the subvariety V. So this is the cardinality of the set of points in V intersecting with the torus. You can ask, is it necessary to restrict to the open subset the torus? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. It's easier to count if we restrict to the torus. And it does not matter for the Manning's conjecture. We can only throw away a closed subset. So this is my choice. And then no banded height. So the height given by the land bundle L needs to be at most B. And then we ask what happens when B goes to infinity. What is the asymptotic behavior of this function? Function. So, what I'm going to do now is to rewrite this a number of times so that it looks like something that we can handle with the hyperbola method and then with techniques that we already know for projective spaces. So, the first thing I'm going to do, I'm going to use this parametrization. So, we're counting some points that lie in particular in T of Q, then we're That lie in particular in T of Q, then we can use this. And so we're going to mod out by the action of this group that we can do because this set here is a torso over T. So we can write this as one over two times the rank of the Picard group of X, because every time that we count in this set, then we count this many times the points in this set. Set. So, this is a standard thing to do. And what remains? Now I'm going to write down explicitly in terms of the data that we have. So we have points with coordinates x, i, j's that are non-zero integers. And then what do we have? Well, we have all the conditions coming from being in the torso of the torus. So the GCD conditions, which I'm not going to make explicit, as I said. Then we have other. Then we have other information v, the variety v, which is defined by polynomials in the coordinate xij. So we get g1 equal to g t need to vanish because we want our point to be the variety. And then we have the height. What does the height look like? So I'm going to tell you what it looks like explicitly. So that's of the form, conditions of the form. Conditions of the form. Well, I suppose I can write it as just one condition over sigma maximal cone of the firm of X. If you know what a toric variety is, then it has some meaning. So it's indexed, this maximum is indexed over this. Otherwise, you just think of some indices that it's a finite set. And then inside, we have things of the form product i from one to s. product I from one to S of maximum over J absolute value of X I J to some non-negative exponent alpha I sigma and all of this which defines my height of the point this is required to be at most p so So, after you use the structure of torsor over the toric variety and this choice of the coordinates, well, you can do some computation and end up showing that the height looks like this. And this alpha i sigma really can be computed explicitly in terms of the line bundle L. All right, so I'm going to call for later this condition here, the height condition, so I don't have to repeat writing. So that's a height condition. And this set without the one over two to the rank of Picard group in front, I'm going to call n prime b, since now it's enough to find an asymptotic for n prime b. Are there any questions so far? That's really using cock strings. So, one way to see this: the fact is that fano varieties are more dream spaces, they have fanatically generated cockstrings, so cockstrings. Have finitely generated cogstrings. So, cockstring can be written as a quotient of a polynomial ring, infinitely many variables. Now, intuitively, that polynomial ring is the polynomial ring of a toric variety with the same pico group. This is not a proof. This is just the idea. And then, quotienting by some relations, that's taking the GIs here. The reason why this. The reason why this can be done, that's work of Berchtall and Hausen. They've written a couple of papers about this. Berktall and Hausen, they work on cockstrings and geometric side of the fact that you can do this over fields that are not algebraically closed. Then, well, that's my claim. But I have a whole theory, and if you want to. They have a whole theory, and if you want to know where to find this in the book Cocksprings, there's a whole chapter about this stuff. So these are called neat embeddings. In particular, they have this property. And they are not unique in principle. All right. Um joke. So now we want to count this set. Now, for a while, it will be very standard. We first get rid of the GCD condition, then we get rid of the heights. So getting rid of the GCD condition is standard. I'm going to mention it anyway because the Mervius inversion that we do, because of this choice of the names of the coordinates and the grouping and so on, is different than what is already in the literature. Not by much. Not by much, but enough so that what we do actually ends up working in the application and what was already in the literature was not flexible enough. So now my notation is that the natural numbers don't have zero, just for simplicity of writing down the following. So there exists a Maybius-like function from n to the s to z, the integers. The integers, such that the following holds. This n prime b that we want to compute can be written by maybe using version with this function. I'm not telling you all the properties, but this function is going to be defined and starting with the characteristic function of the GCT condition, which I didn't make explicit. And in particular, then we can write our n prime. write our n prime b as sum over d as tuples of natural numbers non-zero then mu tilde to the d of d and then cardinality of the same set where instead of having the gisting dec condition now we have the visibility conditions. So here the So here the conditions are di divides xij for every i and for every j. And then we still have the equations and we have the height, which is just as before, didn't do anything there yet. And I'm going to come back to this baby's function later. It is similar to the one that was constructed by Salberger, but he. One that was constructed by Salberger, but here he would have put dij one for each of the coordinates, and now instead I am putting di one for each of the degrees of the coordinate appearing in this counter problem. In particular, if you take this mu tilde in the case of the projective space that we're all very familiar with, then this mu tilde becomes the usual classical Mobius function. Okay, so this can be done. It's no problem. And now the thing I want to focus a little bit more on is the next step, which is dealing with the height using the hyperbola method. Okay, so for the hyperbola method, we are going to hmm. Let's see, I'm writing the next word. We're going to write the We are going to write the following quantities. We are going to define the function fd of y1 up to ys. These yi's are going to be natural numbers. And this is going to be the cardinality of the set of coordinates xij, like before. We're now Where now we keep the conditions, all the conditions except for the height. So di divides xij for every i and j. And then g1 and gt are zero, the equations. And then in place of the height, I am going to fix the value of this. I am going to I am going to just look at those points with coordinates x, i, j such that that gives me value yi coming from here. So I'm just selecting the points such that the maximum of these absolute values of xij is equal to yi, maximum over j. And this needs to be true for every i. So this is an auxiliary function that we're going to use. And now we are also, what we are going to do. So, what we are going to do is the perbola method does the following: says, Oh, you have a complicated height, which is given by, forget about this maximum, and we have a bunch of conditions instead of just one. And then it's given by a product of powers of certain things. So, it's given by monomials bonded by B, monomials in the Yi's now. So, well, great. Then we can use the hyperbola method. That's a hyperbolic. Can use the hyperbola method, that's a hyperbolic shape function. What are we going to do? We are going to just subdivide this region into boxes. We are going to count over each of the boxes. We are going to put together these counts over boxes and get the main term and the narrow term. I'm not going to do everything today on the board. I'm going to give you a theorem for that. But this is the auxiliary function that tells me what the values of these are. And now we're going to count this function of the boxes. So the next function, fd is Ft is for box lengths b1 up to bs, one for each of the yi's, and it's going to be just the sum of this function fd y1 to ys, where now yi's are positive integers. Each yi is bounded by the corresponding bi. This is the function count over the box with sidelines B1 up to BS. Now, a height like this is very natural on Tauric varieties, and it's also very natural in the special case of products or projective spaces that you might have seen. That you might have seen, then it really ends up looking like this. And the hyperbola method was originally developed by Valentin Bloman and Jorg Bruden for products of projective spaces. And then it was generalized a little bit by the Marie Schindler and eventually we decided to generalize further to Tauric varieties to be able to do certain counting problems on Tauric varieties, which I'm going to explain later. So, the theorem that we got, and some of you And some of you may have seen us talking about this already. So now the theory we have is a little bit more general. This is 2024 because it's published as of January. So it's all available right now. And the theorem says that if we understand well enough these counts of the boxes, then we can get an asymptotic formula for geode. Guide an asymptotic formula for your regional counting problem in our case, it would be this. So, this I will call n double prime of b later. So, if this countable boxes f d of b one up to b s satisfies an asymptotic formula of the form product. The form product i from one to s of b i to some positive exponents pi i with some leading constant c which can depend on d. m stays for stays for main term here, it's just a notation and some error term with some constant that may depend on d and the explicit dependent on d I'm keeping because later on I want to sum over d so that's what. Later on, I want to sum over these, so that's why I'm keeping it with some saving, which is a power saving and power saving in the smallest of the BI's. So I write it like this, delta can be very small, but positive. So if we have something like this with all the exponents by i's positive and And the polytope that we can define using the height. So here there's no height involved yet. So I have to bring back the height. That will be given by looking at the following polytope in a weird vector space of dimension s, defined by the height condition somehow. So this is going to be given by coordinates, u i at least zero for every. u i at least zero for every i and sum i from one to s of alpha i sigma u i bounded by one for every sigma which was our index from before. So here these exponents here for each of the monomials they're going to define one uh condition, half space condition to define my polytope. To define my polytope, and we want that this polytope here is non-degenerate, so bounded and non-degenerate. And we also want that somehow this polytope interplays very well with this asymptotic formula, meaning the following. The phase, which I'm going to call f, of this polytope P L, where a certain function takes maximal value. And the function is sum i from 1 to s of this pi u i here, these exponents appear in the symptomatic formula over the boxes. This has maximum value, which I call. Which I called AL. And the face where the function has maximal value AL is not contained in a coordinate hyperplane of the vector space. These are all the assumptions we have. I'm going to come back to them in a moment. First, I want to write down what the result looks like. I'm going to erase this now. So, if all of these are satisfied, this is not too difficult to check if you have a concrete problem. If you have a concrete problem at hand, then our counting functions, which in this specific case looks like this, then can be written as or satisfies the following formula. So, order of growth is B. Of growth is B to the power AL. These maximal values of this function coming from the boxes over the polytop that encodes the height. So that's the significance of this number AL. And then there's a parallel of log sometimes, which is the dimension of the phase F, where the maximal value AL is attained. So again, we first have to understand what the maximal value is, and then we What the maximal value is, and then we can determine what the power block is. And then, okay, there's going to be a leading constant, which looks like s minus one minus dimension of f factorial. This is because of how we normalize the problem. There is a constant CPL that comes from the polytope, and then there is the constant CMD from the counting problem of the boxes. This appears just like this, unchanged. Like this, unchanged. And then there is an error term where we are going to keep track of the dependence on D, which is the same as over the boxes. And the saving is of the type log B to the minus one times, then it's a little bit less than that. So there's a log log B here. If you don't like log log, then you can think of log B to the minus one and then plus epsilon, plus non small epsilon. All right, so this is what the asymptotic formula looks like when we apply the black box of the hyperbolic method. A couple of remarks. The first one is: in previous The first one is in previous talks given by Bionta Maris, we had the same theorem with an additional technical condition on the polytope, which now is not there anymore. And the goal of this talk is to show that this version, without that condition, is somewhat easy to apply to concrete counting problems. And in here, I am not going to write down the formula for this because it's about one line or so, but that's some limit taken. Some limit taken using this hyperplane here equal to AL minus delta intersect with the polytope, take delta, that goes to zero. And then the leading term of that asymptotic formula, that's what that constant is. So it's somehow remembering a volume of the polytope intersecting with this condition. It's very explicit. And it can be computed. Second remark about the assumptions. So The assumptions. So the assumptions on the polytope hold, for example. If so, if L, the line bundle is not just big, but it's a semi-ample, so some power is globally generated, then the bounded and non-degenerate is no problem. That's always going to be true. The condition on the face is a little bit more tricky. So, to make sure that both conditions hold, I am going to apply the theorem here only in the case where L is of the form sum i from 1 to s of this pi i d i and it is ample. So, under this condition, which are somewhat restrictive, then this condition can be checked, it always holds. But it's not the only case. But it's not the only case. And this condition you have to think of as L is the anti-canonical line bundle for the counting problem. Now, here I didn't specify exactly what the counting problem is. If we are doing Manning's conjecture, then this will denote the anti-canonical of V, the sub-variety, as we see in the example. So this is the hyperbola method way of saying that's the right line bundle to use to count points. And if we don't want to have this condition on the face, so the fact that it's not. On the phase, so the fact that it's not containing coordinate hyperplanes of the vector space, in principle, it's possible to remove it. We have not done it yet, it's one of the next stages of the project. And the idea is to use some vibration techniques to actually be able to handle that case. All right. So So I am probably going to skip a little technical thing here. So let's just look at it for a moment. We have this formula here. Now, if we want to get an asymptotic formula, then we have to go back here. We need an asymptotic formula for this. So we need to be able to sum that formula for that. Formula or that expression over this sum. So we need to be able to do the sum over this of mu tilde d with the things that depend on this. So this constant and this constant. And in the paper that we have, and which is not the paper about the applications, which is not out on archive yet, it's almost ready, but will probably be out in one or two months. There, we actually give conditions. There, we actually give conditions for this to hold, and this condition, somewhat surprisingly, they either are satisfied by trivial reasons or they are going to be satisfied by geometric reasons. And both can happen. I am going to just write down an example, and so we can see it there. So perhaps I can leave this board up and this board down. And okay, before we go to the example, let me also mention the following: so heuristics and gain applications. We show the thing that probably most of you are wondering: which is, is the compatibility compatible with Manning's conjecture? And yes, it is. So we heuristically show and in We heuristically show, and in all the applications, it also holds the fact that if L is ample, at least if L is ample, then this exponent A L coming from the hyperbola method is the same as this A of L from the Manning's conjecture. So that's the right exponent. And the dimension of the phase F is equal to B of L minus one. Minus one. So it is the exponent of log b in minus conjecture as well. And the way we show that these two are the same, which is the main thing, is by looking at the fact that this A L here is a maximization problem. It's the result of a maximization. It's the maximal value of a certain function of a polytope. So it's a linear programming problem with a maximization problem. A of L was the infimum of T such that T L plus Kx was effective. That is a minimization problem. A minimization problem, also linear programming problem, and these two are dual to each other, they are strongly dual to each other, and that's the reason why they have the same answer. The two numbers are the same. And one can really show geometrically on toric varieties that these are dual to each other specifically. And then the rest follows just by looking at what this means, what this phase is. Are there any questions so far? They're not going to say anything about projective space. I'm going to write down now their first application, you will see. To write down now the first application, you will see immediately what type of result we can do. What's the question? Yes. Yeah, that's a very good question. So, that's another avenue of research. We are holding up a little bit because there's a student population. Holding up a little bit because there's a student of Jorg Bruden who is doing something very similar. So he has been doing this for the case of product or projective spaces of the Perbolomethod of Blomer and Bruden. And yes, we expect that it can be done also this and also with just even lower sort of savings, just arbitrary saving of some type in the asymptotic web boxes. So the expectation is: yes, it can be done. Eventually, it will be done. Will be done. Okay, so let's go to some to these certain sub-varieties. So we remove the suspense about what the applications are. That's of course the question. So the first type of result that we're going to give may look silly, but it was not known before. It was not possible to do it before. Possible to do it before. So we are going to look at a case where G1 to GT, the polynomials in the cox-ring coordinate in coordinate ring defining the variety are linear in the usual sense. Some of A, I, J, X, I, J's, but also picard graded. And plus some assumptions such that we always are going to assume that, like, the intersection with the torus is non-empty, and the dimension of the variety we want to count is positive, otherwise, there's nothing. We want to count is positive, otherwise, there's nothing to count, nothing interesting to count. And for this condition, that's not a restrictive condition. If this is not true, then V is contained in a small rhetoric variety, so we can work with that one instead. So if we have this linearity, then, okay, let's say the V is Fano, then Manning conjecture holds. For V with the anti-canonical I height. And that's the only reason why I asked for Fano here, otherwise, we could do also more general. And the main remark is the following. So what is special about these linear forms? Not so much that they are linear, but the fact that they are linear implies the following. That for every choice of one of these linear forms, so for every L between 1 and T, for each of these polynomial, Each of these polynomials, there exists I in 1s. So some degree such that G L only contains variables of degree di. So it's actually a polynomial in the subring given by x11 x, sorry, i1 up to xi and i. And okay, this I call RI in case I need this later. So we have this strong condition that each of the polynomials actually live in a sub-polynomial ring that contains variables only in one of the groups that I chose. So these polynomials are in separation of the groups of variables, if that makes any sense to you. That's a simplification. So if the polynomials are linear, then this comes from the linear. Are linear, then this comes from the linearity and the Picard grading directly because they also need to be Picard homogeneous and linear. So this is automatic. And so we can do all of them. And then because they are linear, when we write down the counting function, because of the separation, let's see where I can write. Let's keep this one here. Anyway, that's not important. So Perhaps I'm erasing the wrong thing, but that's okay. So, the function that counts over boxes, the one that needs to satisfy the thing that I just erased, so the right asymptotic formula over boxes, becomes a product. Because of the separation of the variables, this can be written as a product i from 1 to s, cardinal. From one to s cardinality of, and now we just have this variable variables in a smaller set with the same conditions. And now the height condition looks like max of xij up to be i, max over j, and then we will have g. And then we will have G L equals zero if G L is in the right degree Ri, this polynomial ring that I wrote down. So this is probably the last big formula I write on the board. The reason why I want to write this formula is because if you look at this, well now this is something that you can recognize. This is what you need to do if you can't find the projective. Do if you can't fancy the projective space with these equations and the usual bale height. So, if you have polynomials that separate the variables into the right groups, then if you know the asymptotic formula for the same problem in projective space for the right choice of the equations, then you can take the product to get an asymptotic formula with a box. And if that formula has the right shape, If that formula has the right shape, as it was on the board before, then you can apply the hyperbola method and get a result. And if the GI is a linear, this is automatic. And in the last few minutes, I can tell you also some other applications of the same flavor that we have. So this is the first application. All linear sub-varieties of Toric varieties, well, at least if they follow, then they satisfy Manny's conjecture. The second type of results that I have is going to be similar, but it has to do with the fact that we can also count uh not just uh uh rational points, we can count component points. Rational points, we can count company points. So, I'm not going to define company points, I don't have the time, it's not the goal of this talk. But if you have seen me given talks, you know that's something I care a lot about. So, one result that I'm just going to write down here. So, if the Gi's are of a certain shape, C I1 XI1 to the E1, so they are diagonal forms in the group of variables corresponding to degree I. For every i that we care about, and we choose m i j's company parameters for every choice of i's and j's coordinates. And if the n i's for which we have a gi, then these are large in terms of In terms of EI and the Mijs, I'm not going to make this explicit, that's a long formula, and so on. Then we can prove the Manning-type conjecture conjecture for company points on V with the right divisor defined by the MIJs and the divisors defining so. And the devices defining so this is going to be sum over i one over one over m i j and then x i j equals zero. I chose m i for all of them. So this is a sum of all of them. So that's going to be the divisor. And there's a whole bunch of things that one needs to do here. And I just write log anti-canonical height for the same reason as before. For the same reason as before, that we were choosing the anti-canonical height. And if you want to do this, then, well, look, I suppose I'm just going to modify what I have here on the board. So you can still write the function over boxes in the same way, except that here we have this gi equals zero. We have one for each. And we have the additional condition xij is xij is m ij full. And that's the company condition somehow. So that's what it looks like. And this counting problem here now with this specific thing, this has been done by Browning and Yamagishin for degree equal to one, degree of the equation equal to one, and in collaboration with Francesco Balestrieri, Julia Brandes, Mirian. Brandis, Miriana Kaisberg, Judith Orthbund, and Rosa Winter, we extend it to the case where the exponent is bigger than one. So we have, well, there are preliminary counting for the same problem in projective space. And what I do in this application is I take that, I put it into the machinery of the hyperbola method, and I get as a result counting for the same type of question on toric varieties. On toric varieties. All right, and just as a highlight, we also have a third application which instead takes bi-homogeneous equations, so work of the Mary Schindler, where she counts rational points of banded height on sub-varieties of products of projective spaces, two projective spaces defined by bi-homogeneous equations. So we can also do the same here. And what happens is that we insert. We insert that countable boxes, and what happens is that instead of being then a product like this, it becomes a product where there is an extra factor where we fix the bi-homogeneous. So I call it D1 and D2 case. And then here the remaining stuff is just whatever it is. So for example, the rest. And then we can apply count of the boxes for this part from this paper by the Maris. And so we get also a certain bi-homogeneous. Get also certain bi-homogeneous sub-varieties of toric varieties as a result. And if you want, you can just choose whatever you want. You like burgers polynomials, you take toric varieties that have plenty of variables of given degrees, which exist, for example, certain blow-ups of projective spaces, product of projective spaces, and things like that. And then you use results already known for projective space and a piperbola method, and you get results there. So there's plenty of application that one can do. We just choose three to highlight what. Three to highlight what can be done. All right, that's my talk. Thank you very much. Questions or comments? So, okay, you've been looking at sub-varieties of split toric varieties. Does it make in kick? Does it make can you count points on subvarieties of non-split soil varieties as well? So it's a good question. You can think in two ways. One way, let's try and do it. We've not tried, so we don't know what the answer is. The other way is, if this machinery were to work ideally, you don't need to do that. Because even a non-splitary variety, it is a variety and then it has a phallidcock string, and that's the As a phallet cock string, and that's the condition that you need to be able to embed it into a split toric variety corresponding to the Picard group of it, except that now that cocks ring is probably going to be complicated, not a polymer meringue any longer. And that's the reason why it may make sense to actually try non-split Toric rights. We have not tried yet, but it's a very good thing to try. Yeah. What is the main obstacle to doing this over number fields? Is it just technicalities or are there serious problems? The height. The height doesn't look like what we want any longer. It's a product of a places of suprema absolute values of monomials. We can do absolute values, we can do. Absolute values of we can do monomials. We can do then products of maxima in this case. If we can do the maximum separately, now we have two products and the maximum in the middle. That's the main obstacle. How do we see this? In which vector space do we actually work? That's the question that comes up. I, from time to time, I think about it and I put it there on the side and I think. About it, and I put it there on the side, and I think about it, and I put it there on the side. I mean, one could try to count, but then you count over all the completion at infinite places at the same time. And then you have to understand what type of lattice you are actually working with. So it's not just technical, it's if you want technicality about the definitions first, then of course there will be the rest of the technicalities about the counting and how to actually, but also how to set up this. To set up this, but it's something that I want to do sometime in the future. If you have any ideas, please talk to me. I remember Emmanuel Per was always interested in the case where you take projective space and you blow it up in one point and you ask about Mannon's conjecture for a smooth hypersurface inside that torch. Smooth hypersurface inside that toric variety. So, does that follow more or less automatically from no, so that's the next step, that and more general of that. So, the interest, the really interesting case. So, these are direct applications. The hypervolumeto works nicely, that's great. But then, in principle, we don't have this factorization, and that's an interesting case. So, just a smooth, or if you want, general sub-varieties of toric varieties of a given degree. Of toric varieties of a given degree, or if you choose your specific sub-varieties, the smooth sub-varieties of blow-up in one point, and so on. I'm not trying to write it down. I don't know if that one can be just be done because it's a simple toric varieties in some sense. But that's the next avenue of work. So, there is a work of Teddy Mignot about certain smooth sub-varieties of Tauric varieties of final type, where he counts rational points. And our expectation, and something I will try to do at some point, is. At some point, is that with this version of the hyperbola method, which he didn't have available, and the height created lots of problems in his papers, then with this version, we should be able to simplify a lot and possibly very much improve the range of applicability. So that's something to be done. Yeah. I mean, for instance, if you want to look at well, first of all. To look at, well, first of all, this kind of theorem implies that the variety you look at, the rational points are, there are many rational points than them. Yeah. So, is it could be obvious? I mean, without going into all these estimates about the condition, that if you put this condition G1, GT is linear, that the rational points are Zariski dense on the variety you look at. So, just check it by hand, you mean? Yeah. I think it should be possible, yes. Just checking Zariski density should be possible. Because the only proven that we have here somehow is that. Problem that we have here somehow is that the height is complicated if we want to count. But if we don't care about the height, we just look at qualitative question. I'm not tried, but yeah, I think so. As soon as you have that the minimum conditions that give you positive dimension are there, because the Turkic variety is split, I would expect so. I'm not right. I can think about it. Yeah. But then there was this question before about cubic hypersurfaces. So there's there is are there some cubic hypersurfaces to which this matter? Are there some cubic hypersurfaces to which this method would apply? Yes. Smooth, I mean, smooth cubic hyper surfaces. I mean, if you take your toric variety with enough variables of a given degree, and then you put your cubic equation on those variables, like you take a projective space of very high dimension or sufficiently high dimension, depending on what the bound is that you want to use for which you know how to count points. So the idea is that with what I just presented here. With what I just presented here today, we don't do any better than what is already known from the projective space. But we can take a result from the projective space, we take a projective space of dimension one or two higher, we blow up a point, and then we can have a cubic hypersurface in this neutric variety with the right number of variables such that the counting in this step from the projective space still applies. And then we deduce also for this qubit. And then we did use also for this cubic hypersurface avataric variety. So that would be the type of application. I don't know if it's very interesting for you, but yeah, that would work.
