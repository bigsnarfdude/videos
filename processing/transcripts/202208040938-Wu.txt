The speed of my map. Okay. And now it's my pleasure to have a chance to attend the workshop online, giving online lecture. And thank you for his invitation and the hard work organizing committee. It's a pity for me to not able to go to the bank to attend the doc. To attend the workshop in person. Anyway, it's a pleasure for me to have a chance to give a talk here online. And it's a joint work with my former doctoral student, Haojiang, and he just obtained PhD this summer. And it's also a joint work with Professor Xin Hoa from Hokkaido University. And I'm sorry that I just use my computer, so I can't write on. Computer, so I can't write. It's not convenient to write, so I just read. Okay, and the model I should talk about is a SKT computation model. It's a nonlinear diffusion, and it's also a cross-diffusion model. And the model was first proposed in 1979, and three Japanese mathematical. Japanese biomathematician proposed more general computation model with the shelf and the cross diffusion. And here, the nonlinear diffusion term and the parameter low one and low two is called a random diffusion. And the gamma one, gamma two across diffusion. For the computation model, and the gamma, gamma two is non-negative. Okay, usually it. Non-negative okay. Usually it is positive, it's a cross-diffusion, okay. And uh, and all the other parameters are positive, okay. So, and uh and I think some most of the experts are familiar with the modeling of the nonlinear diffusion. And here, just give a very brief introduction. And from the macroscopic point of view, and the nonlinear or the rand or the linear diffusion. random or the linear diffusion and depends on the selection of the transition property. For example, for the SKT type of nonlinear diffusion, for example, just the Laplace, this nonlinear by bilinear term, and it's obtained from the selection of transition probability for you. When the gem probability probability is a linear combination. Is a linear combination of the U, species U, and V, and also random diffusion and in scale parabolic scale. Okay. And anyway, if choose other types of transition probability, for example, if the species can detect the difference of another species, for example, the new trend, and then the nonlinear term, it's linear term it's uh in this form is a chemotactic term here the chemotactic term and minus one minus is uh called a positive chemotactic but for the skt computation i'm sorry okay what's wrong and uh for the skt type of cross diffusion term it's a la plus u times v this type is called a negative This type is called the negative taxes. For the various types of chemotex term is in the minors. So it's the little difference, but all these are cross-diffusion terms. And such type of cross-diffusion models has been widely and deeply invested in recent several decades for including the math modeling and also the theoretical and the numerical analysis on the PD. Analysis on the PD model, and especially for the aggregation phenomena, new wave phenomena, and other new pattern formation and the finite here. And for example, just for the SKT model. And if there is no self-diffusion and cross-diffusion, it is obvious that the SKT computation model is just a lot of a terror computation model with random diffusion. And it is well known that the symptomic behavior solution for logo computation. solution followed the terracomputer with random behaviors is nearly the same as the ordinary differential logical terra computation model except the strong computation cases here i just skip the details okay i'm sorry okay and in the following i should just focus on the planar wave phenomenon On the planar wave phenomenon. And first, I shall give some brief review about the existability of a wave for the classical logical terracommitting model, just with random diffusion. And yesterday, Professor Chang Hong also give some review under the random local terracomputation model. And for here, just consider the trailing waves. And for the trailing waves, there are a lot of And for the trendways, there are a lot of cases. For example, weak competition cases, strong competition cases, and some other cases, for example, Horizon obtained the transistors chain with certainly connecting the two semi-trivial steady state here under some parameter restriction and for with infinite speed. And for the strong competition case, for example, this case, and it is also interesting for the child waves with unit. A channelist with unique speed, and usually it is close-related and repulsive of the computation exclusive. Okay. And for these cases, and there are some well-known works, for example, Garner and Kenyong and Qingfang, they obtain the existence and the stability of the triangle waves connecting these two semi-trivial steady states. And especially for Professor Yong Ken-Yong, they also obtained the monotone dependence of wave-some parameter. For example, how about the speed of the wave, positive, negative, or zero? And also write several papers here. And I have to say that for the random diffusion cases for the lotka material, especially for this case. cover especially for this case strong computation case the existential trend with unique speed and when d1 is very small until now it is not clear if the trend wave has fast low structure and the no results about the limit of speed and when c of speed of c as d tends to zero and also i have to say that the proof existence stability for the classical operator computation model Classical of the pair computation model based on comparison principle and substuple and spectral analysis and are not valid for the SKTK model with cross-diffusion. So in the following, I just talk about the existence stability of waves with transition with the cross-diffusion. And for the singular perturbed SKT computation model with cross-diffusion, for example, here, the U species U is with very small diffusion. Very small diffusion, take the strategy, move very slowly. Another species, and the random view is not small, but he has the ability to prevent the species U with the cross-diffusion, gamma 2. Here, gamma 2 is not small. And for these cases, and many years ago, my students and I have obtained the existence of child with transition. With transition layers when epsilon is very small, but gamma 2 is not small, and connecting the two semi-trivial steady state and with a unique slowly speed. The speed is in the order of epsilon and both a fossil structure of the tranways. Structure of the trend waves. And here you had transition layer and the V and of the transformation V is a change to the combination of W how to say it's Psi. Then Pussi has the how to say it's a slow and slow scale. Okay. And here, but the speed is in order of Ipsu. Not to say that there exists just the value for gamma 2. It's just the valid for gamma two is very large. But gamma two is zero, gamma two is small, and the such existence is not valid. Okay, and the structure of this triangle waves may be different. Okay, and so this is an unsolved problem. And for the stability of triangle waves, using the topological index method and the n-function and spectral analysis, it can be proved that the triangle waves with transient layers. waves with changing layers with the slow speed obtained in the existence can are symptomatically stable and it's also spectrally stable when the epsilon is very small. So this is stability theorem okay when gamma 2 is very large larger than some constant. But in fact the result stability independent of the selection gamma gamma 2. If there exists a transmit then it is stable and if there is wave then it is stable and if this the channel waves had a fossil structure and the similar structure then it is it is always stable but it's spectrally stable okay and the um based on the spectral stability of trend waves with the transient layer and also because the speed is very slow when you can consider the interaction The interaction, the two waves with very slow speed. Because just a few years ago, I met Professor A from Hokkaid University. He is an expert on working on the interaction of waves. And he told me that if the waves, two waves are very, the speed very small or just zero, then it is possible to consider the interaction of wave. So here, I just give a brief introduction about the interaction of the waves. Of the waves. And after transformation, for example, transformation, we can rewrite the equation in this form. And because our spectrum, we obtain spectroscopy to waves, and so we consider the symptom behavior of the interaction two waves. And the initial data, when the initial data is a small perturbation of the combusted two waves, for example, and here is a U and this U front and this is. Front, and this is the combination of two fronts. And this is where I'm sorry, I can't write because I just use the computer and not adopt the main idea in the proof of the abstract series on the waves established by many mathematics, including Professor A. And we can consider the interaction of the waves, two waves. The waves, two wakes, because it maybe has some biological meaning about the interacting of two waves. And also, it is also interesting to consider the more pattern formation, not just a phenomenon, but it's a combination of two ways. And because there are a lot of work on the classical for the classical models, and here just Give some results about the object theories for the classical reaction diffusion. For example, this classical reaction diffusion model equation or system. And consider the reaction two waves. And the initial data is the small perturbation of the combination two waves. And when the two waves stay far away, okay, initially. And it's interesting to consider if the solution. You consider the if the solution is still a small perturbation of the combination of two waves, and here the shift may be and may not is not constant, it depends on t moves with and here the shift L T and H T it's corresponding to the how to say the shift to the left. The shift to the left and the distance of waves, something like distance two waves, something like that. And here, and the object results, just closely related with spectral speed of child wave one wave. And it is required that object result requires the spectral speed of wave. For our cases, the child waves are stable and it's also spectrally stable. So we can try to approach the Obtain the detailed estimate for the how to say the interaction of waves. We can try to get the asymptotic speed of the shift of the two waves. The shift is just the projection of the two profiles. Okay. And for example, for the classical reaction diffusion model, if they consider reduction too standing wave, there are some objective results. For example, in Professor A. Seroux paper. In the professor A's paper, and he gives some objective results. Okay, and for the classical one, he can give the shift of L key and the L and H at the O D okay, so you can get the, how to say, abstract or integral of some functions, okay. You can give the sign of the integral, then we can we can how to say we can get the How to say, we can get the how to say the speed, okay? How to move, okay. For example, is it repulsive or attractive? The two waves, Jakin? I'm sorry, okay. Can you hear me? And here, I'm sorry, Justin, stop. And there are a lot of works on the interaction with, for example, Kizuna Gumo systems and consider interaction trend waves possible structure. Trendways possible structure and are more complicated. Okay. And also the two specific Lagnote computation model. Okay. The interaction of two standing friends, for example. And they can prove that the speed of distance function is non-zero. So the charity wave is standing is zero, but the interaction of two waves, the distance function is non-zero, and t tends to infinite. So it is maybe implies some interesting phenomena. Imply some interesting phenomena, okay. And the other, some I should skip the details, okay. There are other works, and for our cases, we try to get the simple behavior of the spreading speed of two shifts. And for our cases, it's fast loss jacket channels. So, when we need to get detailed information about the equation of the, especially for the Of the especially for the higher-order faster solo structure of the channeling waves. And also, we need to get the how to say the expansion, expression of the adjoint operator, of especially the zero eigenvalue and the eigenfunction of the joint operator. So, here, and so we can find our higher-order expansion waves and using analytic singular perturbation method. And our older work. Method. Our old work is using the geometry method, just it's easier to obtain the existence. But for the considering interaction, we need to get higher-order expansion. So we use the analytic single-point method. So we can get the expansion, okay, the detailed expansion. Okay, so this is the expansion for the two species after some transformation. Here, skip the details. Then it is very important to get the Is very important to get the detailed structure. Later, we can get the symptomic two-scale tension of the waves. And the trend waves, which can consider the two cases or three cases. And before getting the structure of the syntactic speed of the expansion of two waves, we first need to get the structure of kernel of joint linear operator. Of joint linear opera. So, this is different from the classical reaction diffusion equipment because it's strongly coupled. So, it's too complicated to get. And also, it's a single, and it's also with a transition layer. So, need to take a long time, take a complicated computation on the getting the expression. Okay, so here, this is a joint operator. Okay, we can get the Fascinal structure of the higher order expansion of the, how to say, the eigenfunction corresponding to the zero eigenvalue of the joint operator. Okay. So this is the temporal detention of kernel of joint operator. So you can get this is the structure. Okay. So there is the, sorry, this is the main term 1080, but this is just slow and this is. Just slow, and this is higher-order extension. Okay, so this is very important for later investigation. Now we can consider the inflection to trend waves. We first obtain the formula for this special model. So we can get because the speed C may be not maybe not zero. Okay, so consider the C is not zero, but it's a small slow speed. For example, speed is larger than zero. So we can get the formula. So here, Formula. So here, when the speed is larger, but it's very small in the order epsilon. So you can get the formula. So the left shift and how to say the right shift, we can get the formula. So it's a little different from the because there are speed C. Anyway, you can find that H0 is a higher order epsilon. So when speed C is larger than zero, the how to say. the the the uh how to say the perturbation is a higher order so the uh how to say that it's repulsive is still it keeps repulsive okay and for the cases when the the uh the two waves are zero the speed are zero or standing wave we can also get the spreading speed of the left shift and the distant function speed Distant function, speed of distance function, l and h. And this is more interesting, maybe. Okay, but here you can get the speed of distance function is positive. Okay, and here, I'm sorry, I can't write, I can't draw the figure. And U is how to say it's a and can to zero. No, I'm sorry, it's a um two front, like combination two front. And anyway, we can prove. Anyway, we can prove that the two standing waves are repulsive, which means that the tarot species U shrinks, while the territory V spans eventually. It depends on the initial data. If the initial data U is the combination of two waves, because, for example, the standing wave tends to zero at two ends, but how to say. But how to say? No, u tends to zero or close to zero in some compact set. But v tends to zero outside the compact set. Okay. And but it tends to constant in some compact set. Okay. Then the u will okay say shrinks and then we extend the inventory. But if in the Expand the inventory, but if in other initial selection, then it may be different. Okay, anyway, it means that for the cross diffusion, V has a cross diffusion, V can V, even though the spreading speed is the Chinese wave is zero, but the interaction two waves, the speed is not zero. Okay, I'm sorry. It's just some okay, for time reason, okay. For time reasons. Okay. I'm sorry. Okay. Anyway, I just stopped here. I'm sorry. There's a lot of problems about my website and also my computer and I can't write. Thank you. Thank you for the last talk. So, what is what is the main gift project? What is the main difficulty when you have a cost diffusion? We started the linearizer operator. Yeah, just obtain, for example, just obtaining the impression of the, how to say, the eigenfunction of the zero eigenvalue for the adjoined operator. Because we changed the layer, because the channel wave changes the layer, so it's a little complicated. And also, it's not a special difficulty, but just special difficulty but uh just complicated i i mean because it's uh we just uh try to uh how to say follow the idea just several years ago so it's uh and maybe we are not quite familiar with the related works yeah just in recent years we try to apply the method to our model first i try to exercise but later find it's a little complex Side, but later, find it's a little complicated. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Any thoughts? Okay, let's thank the professor over again. Yes, thank you for your attention. Do you want to resume 10 certified half hour?
