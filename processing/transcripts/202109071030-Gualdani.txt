I would first like to thank Matteo, Pedro, Matteo, Bruno for organizing this event and inviting me. Thank you very much. So I will present a very recent result, myself and Nesso Guyen on a regularity of solutions to a Of solutions to a toy model derived by from the Landau equation and its connection to the classical Hardy inequality. So, what is the Landau equation? So, I will focus on the homogeneous Landau equation. This model was derived by Lev Landau in 1936, and his goal was to formulate a mathematical model that could describe that could describe collisions of particles that have very high that collide at very high velocity but opposite. So in this type of collisions there is the post-collisional velocity. So the velocity that the particles have after collisions is has changed minimally. And this smallness in the change In the change of momentum during the collision, across the collision, across the event, somehow suggested to Landau to write the equation using a Foker-Planck type of operator. And then the process could be described as a diffusion process. So the homogeneous Lambda equation is nothing but a Nothing but a parabolic equation in divergence form non-linear and non-local. And the non-locality is in the coefficients of the equation. So for example, let's start with the elliptic coefficient, which I denoted with a capital A, which is the convolution of F. Convolution of F with a kernel of exponent gamma plus two. I will say in a moment what all the values of gamma are. And then we have a matrix in front. The matrix is the projection matrix that projects any vector to the space orthogonal to y. So this is the elliptic elliptic coefficient. So then the other one I denote it with small a. Then the other one I denoted with small a is just the convolution of f with a kernel of exponent negative gamma negative two. So it's also, I mean, you can interpret as the inverse Laplacian to some power of f. The exponent gamma, here we today we will consider being between negative three and zero. F is the unknown. F is the unknown, is the particle density, is a function which is non-negative, lives in the whole space because we are in the velocity space. So V is the variable in R3. All what I say can be generalized in Rd. And gamma is the key factor somehow in the equation and the value can The value can be anywhere between negative three in three dimensions, negative d in d dimension, and zero. So, I want to make a small comment on the derivation. So, Landau derived this equation for gamma equal to negative three in three dimensions. So, this is, in my understanding, the only physical situation. Now, since Now, since this equation is out of reach until now, then mathematicians have thought: okay, so let's try to somehow modify or make the kernel less singular and see what is going on. And maybe once we understand what is happening for better kernels, we can try to lower the The value of gamma until negative three. This is why this equation has been studied when gamma is above negative three. But this is, I think, just a mathematical manipulation. If you look at the derivation of lambda, there is really nothing that can justify a value greater than three for gamma. So, what we know about the solution to that equation is actually it depends very much. Is actually it depends very much on the value of on the singularity of the kernel. So when gamma is above negative two, we are in the moderate soft potential range. We know that the solutions exist. They are smooth, well-behaved, unique, and they converge exponentially fast in time to the equilibrium. To the equilibrium function, which is the Maxwellian, which is the Gaussian function. When gamma is below negative two, things are not so clear. So we know that we have existence of smooth solutions when initial data are near the equilibrium solutions and near the Maxwellian in some high Sobolef norms. We know that weak solutions exist for. Solutions exist for all times. And we also know that those weak solutions converge in L1 norm to the equilibrium function, to the Maxwellian, as the time increases. Now, because we haven't understood yet if regular solutions exist and what is actually going on. Is actually going on. So, how to fill the gap between weak solutions and irregular and smoothness. So, what we know is actually what is not happening. So, let me first say that. So, what we know is that the house of dimension of the set of singular times, it is almost one half. Okay, so if something bad happens, then this is basically the upper bound on the dimension. Dimension of the singular of the set of singular times. So, what we know is that we don't have blow-up if our function f is belongs to some LP with p strictly greater than this number, 3 over 5 plus gamma, uniformly in time. So, if we can show that f is in this is in This is integrable, belongs to some L P, P high enough, then we know that actually F is in L infinity. So what we know is that we do not have type 1 cell similar blow-up. Okay, so type 1 means that the blow-up rate is determined by the scaling invariance of the scaling symmetry of. Of the scaling symmetry of the equation, and we know that as is very common in kinetic equations, the Lambda equation has a two-parameter scaling, anyway. So, we don't have this type of solutions that blow up. And also, we know that whatever happens, blow up or not, in what norm you might are interested in, after a finite time solution. Finite time, solutions become smooth again. Okay. So, when I am mentioning blow up, I'm thinking about blow up in L infinity, so functions becoming unbounded. And why am I saying that? So, if let me explain to you why this idea of blow-up comes from. So, if we now rewrite our Landau column. Rewrite our Landau collision operator in non-divergence form. So if I integrate and I distribute the divergence to the terms inside the operator, then I get then the Landau collision operator can be rewritten in two terms. The first one is a second order, non-local, non-linear, elliptic term. The first one, and the second one is the non-linearity. Now, let's see we're at Now let's see what are the form of the nonlinearity. In the worst case scenario, so when gamma is negative 3, my nonlinearity is F square. Okay, so now maybe it's clearer why we talk about blow-up. Okay, so I have a quadratic nonlinearity. When gamma is moving away from negative three, so increasing. So increasing, then my nonlinearity becomes perhaps easier to treat because it's the product of f with an average of f with some type of kernel. But for the Landau equation, so for this model, we don't know at the present time if solutions stay bounded or not when gamma is below. When gamma is below negative two. So, in order to understand what is happening, our approach with Nestor Guyen was to consider, to modify the Landau equation in a way that we know how to do things, then we know how to do somehow. To do somehow, but by keeping the main difficulty intact. So, basically, the idea was: is there a way how to modify this equation so that I know how to treat it, but I'm not touching the non-linearity? Because this is the hard part. And we did that by making the following adjustment. So, the Landau equation can be rewritten in different forms. Can be rewritten in different forms. So the first one that I presented in the slide number one is the one that I like to work with, but you can work in non-divergence form or in the original form proposed by Landa, which is this one. So which is this one. So now I'm doing the following. So I said, well, this matrix kind of Kind of gave us trouble. So we said, okay, can we replace it and just kill it by putting a trace? So I consider now a kind of a modified model where my diffusion coefficients becomes, doesn't have the matrix anymore, so becomes basically little A. And little A was the is the Is the convolution with the f with the kernel of exponent negative one, negative two? Remember that here in the original lambda, I have a similar diffusion, but here I had the matrix, okay, in this, and now I don't have it anymore. So we call this this isotropic version of the Landau equation because now my diffusion is not killed. Doesn't it's not killed in some directions as in contrary to what happens in the original lambda, right? So I have some direction of the gradient for which this that might belong to the kernel of the projection matrix. And now I don't have that anymore. So that's why we call it an isotropic version of the Lambda equation. So this method was introduced by Krieger and Strain in Uh, Krieger and Strain in 2012, and they gave some preliminary regularity results on solution to model one, but they added a little small constant in front of F here. Okay, so if we consider the somehow the full model, so this one here, myself and Escobouyen showed that So Guyen showed that model one has regular and smooth and bounded solutions for all time when the initial data are radially symmetric for the worst case scenario for gamma equal to negative three. So where this term here is really F square. Okay, so this is, I think, one of the few or maybe the only Maybe the only equation that I know that has a pure quadratic nonlinearity in resolutions, at least radially symmetric solution, are known to stay smooth and bounded for all time. We still have to see what happens for general solutions, so for non radial data. On radial data. This is a case which is still open. And today I'm going to present that I'm going to show you that actually model one with a general initial data for some range of very soft potential. So when gamma is below negative two until a certain value which is close to negative 2.5. So this model has regular small Regular smooth and bounded solutions for general initial data. So here is the theorem. So we have our isotropic lambda. The coefficients little A are defined as the F convolved with the kernel y to negative 2, negative gamma. And now my gamma is in the range between Gamma is in the range between negative 2.5 and negative 2. So, if we consider initial data in L1 and in Lp for some P greater than this magic number, initial data, but not small, not close to equilibrium, nothing, not close to zero, nothing. So, just general, they can be in fact unbounded. Okay. Then this system here has smooth. Here has smooth bounded solutions. And the proof of that actually is a very simple consequence of Hardy's inequality and the Moser iteration to show then L infinity. The proof of the is very easy. It's extremely easy and we were a little bit Easy, and we were a little bit unsure if it was correct. So, we paused for some time to let it sink. And maybe we thought, okay, now we find the mistake. So, we haven't found it yet. So, this is I'm here today to show it to you. So, what is the one of the main, say, stopping point that hard points in the analysis? Points for in the analysis of the Landau equation. Somehow, the inability to show any LP, boundness of any LP norm when P is strictly greater than one. Now, L1 is for free given by the divergent structure of the operator. For P is strictly greater than one, somehow for the real Landau has been impossible, okay, for very soft potential. So when gamma. Very soft potential. So when gamma is negative 3 and between negative 3 and negative 2. Impossible. So let's see why. Now, if I, let's see, let's do the classical LP estimate. I take a FP minus 1, assume that everything is smooth and everything, what I do is, of course, I'm allowed to do everything, integrate by parts, and so on. So now, if I look at the structure of my LP estimate. Structure of my LP estimate, I see then on the right-hand side, I have two terms: the good elliptic term and the non-linearity. Now, this elliptic term is good, actually is very good if you think about it because the matrix, so this coefficient A is strictly positive, is bounded below by a polynomial of, so little A is greater than equal. So little a is greater or equal than 1 over 1 plus v. So it's bad for large velocities. But for any bounded domain, we have a strictly ellipticity, uniform ellipticity. And moreover, you see that if F is to become big, the A grows as well. So I have a term that is reacting on how big F is. So the bigger F is, Is. So the bigger F is, the bigger my diffusion is. So which is a good thing. So this is a very good elliptic term. And the other one, on the other term, I have the nonlinearity, which in the worst case scenario is f to the p plus 1. If I'm not in the in my worst case scenario, so if I'm bigger than negative 3, then my nonlinearity is f to the p times my h of f. times my h of f and h of f is f convolved with the kernel of power negative gamma so and oops sorry uh so what happens is that now the hope is that this cursive term can bound the non-linear term and our idea was to start uh to to see well can we prove some high or some We prove some type of weighted Poincaré inequality. And the inequality then I show you here is a new inequality than we just proved. So that if we have any f in L1, so now forget about f is not the solution to Land equation. It's a function which is non-negative if in L1. Okay. If we have f in L1 and F is such that can define H. Such that can define H and A, then this weighted Poincaré inequality holds. So we have a number, three plus gamma. So obviously gamma has to be strictly greater for this inequality to be useful. Then we have the phi square, the L2 norm of phi weighted with H is less or equal than 4 times the H1 norm of phi weighted with little A for any phi. With little A for any phi, but simplicity now say C1 and in and bounded compactly supported. So let me show you how this inequality can be proven. So this is in my next slide. And so here at the very beginning, I recall the definition of H and definition of the little A. And this is the inequality that we had in the previous slides. So we started with the class. So, we started with the classical Hardy inequality. And maybe here you already see where I am aiming at, because you already see that I have the same, then we have the same singularities and the same coefficients that we have in our weights. So, how now do we connect the dot? Well, since the classical hard inequality, this one holds for Equality, this one holds for any fee. I am allowed to make a shift. Right? I'm allowed to make a shift. And now I am allowed to multiply both sides by f because f is non-negative. I'm allowed to do that. And I'm allowed to then integrate in dw. This is what I'm doing here. I'm multiplied by F, I'm integrating in DW. And now I say. The W and now I substitute carefully what H is and what A is, and the value of those constants now matters, so we know exactly what those are. We plug them in, and now we reverse the order of integration, and this is, and we get this inequality. Now, how does this inequality help in my previous LP estimates? Because now I use it. We use it to bound the non-linear terms and we get so I group them together using hard, I use this one I use Hardy, the previous inequality, and we group them together. And so this inequality is somehow useful if this coefficient in is the coefficient inside of the square uh parenthesis is n ne uh positive. Is positive. And it's positive if p is anywhere between one and this new number, three plus gamma over negative two, negative gamma. And since this quotient here has to be greater than one, this restricts the value of gamma then we are considering. So the gamma can be between negative and anywhere between negative two and negative five over two. So, can we do better? Maybe, maybe with other methods, but not with that one, because the Hardy inequality that we started with has sharp coefficients. So that was the starting point. And so now, if we recall what I said at the beginning, that we know already that we are Already, that we are going say if we are integrable in a certain LP and P greater than three over strictly greater than P over three over P greater than three over five plus gamma, then we are an infinity. Then I am asking myself if this coefficient here is greater than the minimum integrability I need. And it is. It is, in fact, if I just subtract a little. If I just subtract a little bit from the five-half, but this is just a little bit. Okay. So then I have a set of very soft potential for which my Hardy inequality provides the sufficient integrability to go to L infinity. So, how to go from Lp P greater than this magic number, say to L infinity? Well, there are several ways. One was presented. Ways. One was presented by Luis Silvestre in 2016 and a different one by myself and Nestor Guyen in 2019. So, if I have two minutes, I would like to present this result here. So, how to go from Lp to L infinity. The proof involves another inequality. So, once Hardy gave us that minimum Lp. Minimum LP. Actually, I can get much more. Once I have that LP, I can get what we call this epsilon Poincaré inequality. So I even better weighted Poincaré inequality in the sense that my nonlinear term, so the L2 norm weighted with H, can be bounded by the norm of the gradient where it will A. Gradient where it will eat all A, but with a coefficient in front, which is as small as I wish. So, and a penalty term. Of course, a penalty term. So, how did we show that? Well, the proof of this inequality actually starts from a known result by, I think. I think this was. There are many papers in the literature dealing with weighted Poincaré and Sobolev inequality, but the one that we use, and I think it's the clearest one, is one by Soy and Whedon in 1992, in which they show that if you have your favorite weights omega 1 and omega 2, inequalities of this kind hold. If you can bound, you can show that the Can show that the constant sigma defined in this way is bounded. Okay. For any phi, which are so the functions here, phi are either compactly supported in Q or have zero mean in Q. So once, so then once we have that, so once that we have the result, we thought, okay, but can we, what happens if instead of omega one, I plug in Omega 1, I plug in my H, omega 2, I plug in my little A, and I see what is going on. Well, the nice thing is that if you do that, and if you substitute H and little A, you can show that this constant sigma is less than a constant and depends on F, and the dependent on F depends on this norm, okay, times the size of Q to a power eta. To a power eta, and theta is strictly greater than zero. So now, what did we do? Well, we took Q very small of size epsilon and we did a covering argument in R3 or Rt. And the covering argument does not kill or ruin this constant here. So, then this is how we got. So then, this is how we got the epsilon, okay, the smallness in front of the gradients, and we got a penalty term, but it's of lower order, so that does not damage anything. So, how do we use this? Well, how we use that is by in the MOSAR approach to go from Lp to L infinity. So, the Mozar approach. So the Mozart approach is based on estimating a certain LP, LP norm and letting P to infinity so that we measure the L infinity norm, right? So then we start by doing by defining a functional E n, I call it, which is the L P n L P n norm of F, and then we let P n go to infinity. How do we so this estimate basically How do we so this estimate basically always goes through computing the LPN norm as I did before? And now through the epsilon Poincaré, I can do this for any Pn, because remember, I had the coefficient epsilon that can be as small as I want. So I can take Pn, Pn big enough, going to infinity, and this will result in the bound of Uh, bound of the L infinity norm of f okay, in a ball, and of course, this bound deteriorates when t goes to zero because I'm not assuming L infinity initial data. And with this one, I can conclude. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your nice talk.
