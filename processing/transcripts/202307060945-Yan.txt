For inviting me to this amazing workshop. My name is Sitin Yang from Yale School of Medicine. Today I'm going to talk about the spatial punching method, considering proper effects removal, sparsity, and spatial information that we have developed banded as a stepper. So currently there are two main types of spatial transcriptomic technology. The first type is the in-sci-choo methods, and the second one is the spatial barcoding-based methods. So the first category methods So, the first category method basically provides an expression level at the single cell resolution or even the cellular resolution. However, it only detects a limited number of genes. For the second category, the methods are supposed to provide unbiased and high-scale gene expression data, but it does not have a single cell resolution. Therefore, for the spatial barcode-based, For the spatial barcode-based spot data, we need to do this cell type deconvolution to inform the cell type composition for each capturing spot. And a common and straightforward way to do this is to use the previously measured single cyan-seq data from the same type of tissue as reference data to provide the features for those cell types in the spatial data. And then, based on the cell type-specific expression profile, we can estimate the proportion of. Profile to estimate the proportion of different cell types in the spot data. However, we observed a few challenges in this task. First is what Dr. Gierteri already demonstrated and described as the platform effect, which is the seismic difference between the reference single cell and receipt data and the spot data, which means that if you measure, if you use both technology to measure even exactly the same cell, if you can do so, the data you're going to get will be different. And the second challenge is the sparsity. Challenges the sparsity. So, compared to all the total number of cell types existing in the tissue, usually because of the small size of the capturing spot, the total number of cell types per spot is actually very limited. So it's very sparse. So we call this sparsity, but it's not really sparsity, but it's basically the total number of cell types present per spot is very small. And the third one is the spatial correlation, which means that the neighboring spot tends to. So, which means that the neighboring spot tend to have similar cell type composition just because the tissue usually has continuously changing consistency instead of completely randomly distributed cell types. So, despite those challenges, multiple methods have already been developed, which can probably be divided into five categories. Machine learning type, regression-based methods, statistical modeling-based data mapping-based method. They're also reference-free methods that does not really use. Method does not really use any reference data. However, those methods have been shown by previous benchmarking studies to have a little lower performance because they don't really have accurate estimation of the cell type specific features. So although these methods, so many methods have already been developed, we found that the challenges described before have not been well addressed. So first, only RCTD and DAS VI and Cyruscope explicitly consider plastic. Scope explicitly consider a platform effect. Well, actually, some of them also consider it as a fixed effect, so I haven't updated this, as either a fixed effect or a random effect. And then, however, the previous benchmarking study have shown that they have comparable performance compared to those approaches without consideration of platform effects. So, this indicates either the platform defect does not exist, or which I'm going to show. Exist, or which I'm going to show that is not correct, what has already been shown, or the plasma effect cannot be really effectively handled by those methods. So second, no method has explicitly considered the sparsity of cell types in each spot, except SVI, which really just put a rough hard pressure on the cell type portion estimation. And the third lead, there's no method that considers spatial correlation between neighbors. The spatial correlation between neighbors' spots on the T2 slide, and of course, lastly, there's no method that samulting this addresses all three challenges. So, we have developed this new method called STEPR. Here's the workflow. So, there's basically two key components of our method. One component is the CBAE, the other component is called the GLRM. So, basically, we take the single-cell reference single-cell RNC data and generate the pseudo-SPAC data, which for which we know the under-true. Which for which we know the under true cell type proportion. And then the reference single cell-seq data, the pseudo-spot data, and the spatial trisodermic data, we take them all into the CBAD, the conditional variation auto-encoder to remove the possible effects. And after that, we fit this basically a generalized regression model with LASU regularization and the graph. Last two regularization and the graph of parsing regularization to consider sparsity and the spatial correlation. So here are some details of the model. Basically, we build upon the Dr. Erik's Irish model. So this is exactly the same model, except that we already have the Pathwin effect here, gamma, because we kind of handled that by the CBA already. So, this is the objective function that we have. So, this is likely by the likelihood from the base model I just described. And then those two terms actually represent the local adaptive LASU regularization and also this represents the global graph LaPassion regularization based on the spot proximity graph. So, based on the estimated cell type proportion, So, based on the estimated cell type proportion, we can also impute the cell type composition and gene expression of our measured spatial locations on an intensive resolution map of the tissue using this one-step nearest neighbor random walk. The transition matrix of this random walk is defined based on this kernel, Gaussian kernel, which captures the spatial distances between every two spots on the higher resolution map. Basically, what we did is that with the initial line. What we did is that we initialized the cell type composition using the nearest possible original resolution, and then we take this one-step random war based on M to impute for the cell type composition and the GB expression. So to evaluate the performance, we simulate data using this core screening strategy. Basically, we download this data called this star map data, which is a statistical data with single-cell resolution. So we divide the tissue size of this data into pseudo-parts. side of this data into pseudo spots and then we take the average of the expression profile of our cells that fall into the same pseudo spot and calculate it and also calculate the ground tues of the cell type equations. By doing this, we were able to generate data with ground tues, but at the same time we were able to preserve the natural variation and data distribution in the real data. The evaluation criteria that we use is basically include Use space include our RMSC, Jensen-Shannon divergence, Corregation quotation, and possibly scalar rate. We also use the existing real spatial data with annotation based on the physiological staining image, and we basically compare our estimation to the annotation using the purity and the ARI. So here's a table showing all the real data sets that we have used for this study, including the star map that we use for the core screening simulation. Screening simulation. So you can see that we have applied the methods to data sets from different species, different types of tissues, and different types of spatial technologies. So when we apply each method to the coarse-main data, we have two choices of the reference singles RNA-seq data. One is to use an independent external single-sRNA-seq data denoted as the RAF SCRNA here. And then the other choice is to use the original star map data that was used to generate the course-brain simulated data. Core-morning simulated data and here denoted as the ref spatial here. So under the ref spatial case, there's no platform effect because they were coming from exactly the same protocol and data sample. And then under the other case, however, the platform effect could exist. So now, if we're looking at the results, I just want to point out three things. First, no matter whether they are platforms. First, no matter whether they are platform effects or not, our method, Stepper, always achieved the smallest RMSC and highest Pearson correlation, of course. And the JSD and the FDR of our method is also one of the best. And second, if you compare the RMSE and Pearson correlation between the RAF SCRNA-seq and RAF spatial, then you can see that almost for all the methods, when there is a platform effect under this case, the performance is significantly. Performance is significantly worse. So, which means that the performance effect does exist and they do affect the performance of those methods. However, again, our method is pretty robust represented here in red. As you can see, the change rate is pretty small. And then the second is that if you, third point is that when we compare. Point is that when we compare, we also run this other version of Stepper, our method, without the CVAE component, which means there's no platform effect adjustment. So we call it as GLRN. So if we compare its performance of stepper versus GLRN, when there is no platform effect, actually stepper has slightly worse performance, indicating that the CVAE component can introduce voice when there's no platform effect. So here are the So, here are the heat maps showing the true and estimated cell type proportion of a given cell type in this data set across all the pseudo spots we created on the GC slide. So you can see that our method actually can resemble the true cell type proportion that S. And in addition, we also simulated two other scenarios, scenario number two and number three. So in number two, we simulate scenarios when we have one missing cell type in this reference single type. Cell type in this reference single-to-RNA seq data, which does exist in the spatial data. The other scenario is that we simulate this one irrelevant cell types in the single-to-RNA seq data, which does not exist in the spatial data, so that you can assess how robust the result is when your reference data is not really that accurate. So, now let's come to the real data applications. The first data that I'm going to use is the mouse olfactory bulb data. The teacher slide. Data. The TC slide was seen and annotated as a different layer shown here. And in the original paper, marker genes of the major cell types in each layer also show similar shape for each layer. On the right, we demonstrate the annotation of the tissue slide based on the dominant cell types identified by our different methods. And here are the pie charts showing the actual estimated cell type portions per spot across different methods. So you already see. So, you already see just by looking at the shapes, actually, our methods can resemble the annotation based on the histology pretty well. And also, if we assess the similarity using ARI and purity, we also have the best values. So, in this slide, I'm showing the imputation results. On the left, I'm showing the imputed expression of marker genes for each layer. On the right, I'm showing how representative is the imputed expression of those genes for each layer. Imputed expression of those genes for each corresponding layer. So you can see all the diagonals, they're all red. That's a good thing. It means that they can separate. So this marker is for this layer. This marker is for this layer. And this basically shows how specific that marker, the imputed expression of that marker is specific for that layer. So the redder it is, the more specific it is. So you can see that the implicit expression by our method actually has a better. By our method, actually has a better representation of the corresponding layer, annotated layer, better than CARD, which is developed by Dr. Samjo's group. So same logic, same evaluation method. We also use three other data sets. Well, I'm going to just go through very quickly. My normal data sets, same thing. Data sets, same thing, we have the best similarity. And then, you know, imputation is all red on the diagonal. Breast cancer data will have very similar shape, and the diagonal is also red. And here's the IPF data. That's the last data set. This is probably the first data set from human whole lung data that used to demonstrate the cell type of deconvolution results. Convolution results because, in the human lung, it's very challenging to generate this spatial profiling data. So, basically, we have the annotation by the pathologist on the TC slide. So, the blue ones are the blood vessels, and the red ones areas is the respiratory airways. So, we know that those two compartments have a lot of smooth muscle cells, and the city A cells shown here. So, and here on the top, we're showing the marker genes for those two cell types. The marker genes for those two cell types. So you can see that based on the expression of those marker genes, actually, they are actually, you know, they're consistent without mutation. And here, those are the heat maps showing the estimated cell type proportion for the corresponding cell type. And you can also, across different methods, so this is from our method. So you can kind of see that we have the best result to the amutation regarding where those cell types should be. And we also look into 81 and 82. And we also look into AT1 and AT2 cells, and the market gene expression are shown here. And they are the two most important cell types in human, probably the two most important in the human lung for IPF because they're highly relevant to the disease proctogenesis. And they're supposed to be co-localized. They're supposed to be in this, you know, they're all in the alveoli. So you can see, you know, by our method, we do show that they co-localize in this area, but by the other method, In this area, but by the other methods, they kind of either miss the 81 cells or they become very non-specific for the 82 cells. Last thing is the correlation matrix between the cell type proportion between all the cell types. So with the collaborators how we divide all the cell types into different compartments, three components, airway, alveoli, and vascular. So within the same compartments, those cell types are supposed to co-localize. So we're supposed to see higher correlation regarding their. Correlation regarding their activated cell type proportion. So, these are all the matrix by different methods. So, you can kind of see all of those methods become non-specific. They have very non-specific co-localization. But this is the results by our method. Actually, spatial DWRS is pretty good under this case as well. But they're missing the co-localization of A1 and AB2 cells. Again, those are the most important cell types for IPF. So, in sum, so this is summary. I guess I don't have. This is a summary. I guess I don't have to say it. I hope you get my message. And then this is a reading point slide. I just want to, so this project was co-led by myself and Anila Wang, who's also sitting in the audience. I want to thank all the collaborators, the Ameri and Dr. Tari, and all my team members for the hard work. And members from Community Ski Lab for providing the data and the results of interpretation with a little funny. I want to especially thank. I want to especially thank my family members for their support, represented by my second daughter, feeding my youngest one, who's only two months old right now. Without their support, it's impossible for me to be here. So our method, so the manuscript will be posted. Right, so wait. I'll stop there. So the manuscript is coming also. So there's a quick question, Michitin. While Ken actually tries to set up, that would be fantastic. Mr. Data, I am Esther. Is that all Estee? I'm sorry.
