Opportunity to speak in this workshop. So, this is the first time to join this workshop for me. So, please let me introduce myself a bit. So, I got a PhD at Kyushu University under the supervision of Yo Iwasa. And after that, I became a postdoc at Penn State. Postdoc at Penn State and also Princeton University, where Simon kindly hosted me. Then I became a group leader at the Institute of ETH, Switzerland. Then finally, I returned to Japan in Hokkaid University. And currently, I'm leading a group of mathematical biology in Kyushu University. And my hobby is this winter sports. Winter sports. I enjoyed skiing and snowboarding in Switzerland, Colorado, and Niseko in Hokkaido. And this online meeting is wonderful, but I actually really looking forward to the next on-site meeting because, you know, Banf is famous for many wonderful mountains, good for winter sports. So, anyway, although my hobby is winter sports, my scientific interest is My scientific interest is reproductive phenology in tropical rainforests. So, flowering phenology in Southeast Asia is very interesting, so different from aseasonal, so seasonal environment like Japan, Canada. So, in this aseasonal humid forest in Southeast Asia, the flowering event occurs irregularly and synchronously. And synchronously between more than 80 species. So, a current growing concern is the impact of recent global climate change on this community-wide mass flowering event critical for forest regeneration. And recently, we developed a predictive model and forecasted future phenology in this tropical rainforest, and more than 80%. And more than 80% loss of the mass flowering events was predicted until 2100 and the continuous CO2 emission compared to low emission scenario because of decreased availability of low temperature that trigger flowering. So this is a serious problem. And in addition to the climate And in addition to the climate change, another threat to tropical rainforest is deforestation. The still conversion of forested land to agricultural land is ongoing. So when we look at the statistics for forest cover change at the worldwide scale, the forest cover decreased like this. And at the regional scale, forest cover decreased in Forest cover decreased in South America and Africa, but when we look at Europe, it is increased. So this is a map showing where forest cover is decreasing or increasing. So decreasing trend is highlighted in tropical region and in Europe, in China, the frest carbon is increasing. The forest cover is increasing. But even in Europe, where forest cover is increasing, it experienced the phase of decreasing of forest cover in the past, like this. And most of society has experienced the decrease of forest cover in the past, but the trend shifted from decreasing to increasing at To increasing at some point. Europe and the United States both experienced forest transition during the 80s to 90th century. And now this transition appears to be emerging in other places such as South Korea, Puerto Rico, and India. So this historical generalization about forest cover change in which Cover change in which lapid deforestation gives way over time to forest restoration is called forest transition. And about 10 years ago, there was no models to describe this interesting phenomena. So we developed a model that integrates the deforestation and forest recovery processes to explain forest transition. Transition. And deforestation is based on the socio-economic decision by landowners, while forest recovery is natural ecological processes. So the model integrates these processes as a coupled social and ecological systems. Okay, so in the model, we assume that a society is composed of n language. Society is composed of n land parcels, each of which is managed by a landowner. And we consider three land use states, forested, agriculture, and abandoned land. And forested parcel is converted to agricultural land following the landowner's decision. And the decision about land conversion is made. About land conversion is made by probability R. That is a function of the net gain of land conversion from F forested land to agricultural land. I will explain how to formalize this process later. And agricultural land changes to abandoned land with probability eta per year. And abandoned land after abandoned After abandonment of agricultural land results in a growth of secondary vegetation. So the rate of forest recovery is denoted by mu. These are parameter of the model. So what is the model? So we model land use change at the level of individual parcel. We also need to focus on the We also need to focus on the aggregated level of individual decision in order to project larger scale forest transition. So here, let X and Y be the fraction of forested land and that of agricultural land at aggregate level. And the flux of abandoned land is given as 1 minus x minus y. And landscape And landscape dynamics at an aggregate level are given by these two equations. The forest cover increase by forest recovery, but it decreased by deforestation. And why here? The agricultural land increases by agricultural expansion, but decrease by abandonment. So based on this So based on this mobile, we can derive equilibrium and analyze the stability of the equilibrium. And by doing that, we can answer the question like which state will society converge in future and is the forest-rich equilibrium stable. Okay, so next I explain I explain detail about how to determine the deforestation rate R. So each landowner who manages forested parcel makes a binary decision about whether or not to cut trees each year. So this decision is influenced by the net expected gain of deforestation. So here we define the snapshot utility of Utility of forest management as BX. So X is a forest cover at aggregate level. So the B is a function of forest cover at aggregate level. So this B comes from the forest products or substitute from government. And snapshot utility of agricultural land is C that comes from That comes from crop production. So, based on B and C and projection, based on the projection to future land use change, landowner make a decision whether or not to cut tree. So, based on this snapshot utility, and each landowner evaluates the expected utility obtained from the decision of Obtained from the decision of forest conservation or deforestation. And that includes all of the possible land state changes that will occur in future. And expected utility is calculated as BF and BA for forest conservation and deforestation, respectively. And because future utility is discounted by Is discounted by the discount factor omega. The expected utility is given by the current snapshot utility plus the discounted utility that will be received in the future. Okay, so based on this expected utility, the deforestation rate R is given by the logit function of the net gain of deforestation defined as the expected defined as the expected utility received from forest deforestation from deforestation minus that of forest lost to through lost through the deforestation okay so this is a definition of deforestation rate so we also added another complexity to the model that is a feedback from aggregate level two the To the individual decision making. So we assume that the snapshot forest value B is a function of forest cover. So to formalize this relationship, we here considered two scenarios. The one is forest scarcity scenario, in which forest value increases as forest cover decreases. As forest cover decreases. So, this is based on microeconomics, demand-supply balance. So, this is the first scenario. And second is ecosystem service scenario in which forest value decreases as forest cover decrease because of degradation of ecological processes such as nutrient cycling. Nutrient cycling and increase of soil erosion or forestophya. So, for each scenario, we derive the equilibrium of landscape dynamics and analyze the stability of equilibrium. So, in the case of forest scarcity scenario, so we found that forest cover at equilibrium is an increase. Is an increasing function of discount factor omega. So when omega is small, the landowners only consider short-term return from deforestation due to heavy discounting of the future utility. Thereby, landowners are likely to deforest their land for agriculture, which first leads to the decline of unforested. Of forested land, and then yields an increase of agricultural land. But agricultural land are abandoned constantly, which causes a gradual increase of abandoned land. So if the forest recovery rate is small, so it is smaller than abandonment rate, a society eventually accumulates abandoned lands that produce no utility. So we call this So we call this the abandoned landscape. But in contrast, if forest recovery is larger than abandonment rate, the abandoned landscape is replaced by the landscape where the society is dominated by agricultural land. So this is called agricultural landscape. So this is a result when omega is small. But when Small. But when the omega discount factor is sufficiently large, after deforestation, the forest value rises due to the forest scarcity mechanism, leading landowner to protect regenerated forest. So consequently, the extent of forest cover gradually increase like this, and eventually a society establish a forest-rich landscape. Rich landscape. So we call this the forested landscape. Since the forest value rises more rapidly due to forest scarcity, the creation of this forest-rich landscape becomes more likely, implying that the forest scarcity mechanism contributes to the conservation of regenerated forest after forest transition. The stability of this forested landscape depends on the forest recovery rate. So we plot the equilibrium along the discount factor and forest recovery rate. When forest recovers slowly, regenerated forests are managed sustainably, like this. But when forest recovers quickly, the equilibrium is The equilibrium is destabilized and forested landscape becomes unstable, revealing the cycle of deforestation, agricultural expansion, and abandonment and forest recovery. So this cycle is repeated forever. So from these results, we can conclude that for sustainable management, the forest The forest recovery rate needs to be slow. Okay, so this is a result from the forest scarcity scenario. So what happens in the ecosystem service scenario? So there are the same and different prediction between forest scarcity and ecosystem service scenario. The same prediction is that the different The deforestation landscape. So, abandoned or agricultural landscape emerges when the discount factor is small, but the forested landscape emerge when the discount factor is large. That is the same prediction. But the different prediction is highlighted by this orange region. That is the biostability of forested. Of forested and agricultural or abundant landscape. So, forest-rich and forest-poor equilibria are both stable. And in between them, there is an unstable equilibrium. So, we call this unstable equilibrium, the magnitude of this unstable equilibrium as the critical level of remaining. Level of remaining forest. This is important. So, when the size of remaining forest after deforestation is above the critical level, the regenerated forests are managed sustainably. But on the contrary, when the size of remaining forest is below the critical level, the idea possible change from foresting Possible change from forested to agriculture or abandoned landscape occurs. And the decrease of the critical level can buffer the disturbance of the system by deforestation. And we found that increase of discount factor contributes to the decrease of the critical level. So, but the effect of forest recovery rate is actually opposite. As forest recovery rate increases, the smaller deforestation can cause catastrophic change. So, this is an opposite discount factor, and forest recovery rate has opposite effect on the level of critical remaining forest. Remaining forest. So, why this happens? So, this is because when forests regenerate fast, the increased incentive of deforestation happens and the fast growing environment. And fast recovery of regenerated forest allows Regenerated forest allows repeated exploitation from natural ecosystem, resulting in an increased deforestation and decreased forest cover. And in ecosystem service scenario, there is a positive feedback from aggregate to individual level, which causes catastrophic change. So, for instance, So, forest value decreases as forest cover decreases. That further increases deforestation and finally most of the forest disappear. So, this is scenario in ecosystem service one. But on the other hand, in forest scarcity scenario, the feedback is negative. The decrease in forest cover increases the forest value. Increase the forest value, which is effective to stop further deforestation. So there is a difference, this kind of a difference between two scenarios, the positive feedback and negative feedback. So these different feedbacks between two scenarios generates different prediction and fast growing Fast-growing forest condition. So, one is unstable society revealing cycles of deforestation and forest recovery. And another is irreversible change from forested to agriculture or abandoned landscape. So, regardless of the different predictions, the two scenarios provided the two common findings. The two common findings. The first is the forest transition is likely when decision makers employ long-term view into the future. And second is that the sustainable management of degenerated forests after forest transition will be successful when forests regenerate slowly. So, these main results from our Main result from our model. And I know that the model presented here today is a minimal model that simplifies the real system. So there are many possibilities to extend the model to understand the complex real world. So any comments and suggestions for the next direction for model improvements? Improvements, very welcome. So, I'm very looking forward to the discussion here. So, this is all of my talk, and thank you very much for your attention. So, I'm open to any question. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, there are already two questions in the chat. So, yeah, we should thank you very much. Ask your question? Yes, I was curious about the transition from agricultural land to abandoned land. Because I was wondering, I'm guessing that the value of agricultural land decreases over time because the soil erodes and the nutrients go away. And so at some point it's abandoned. Is that part of your model or can it be put into your model? Yes. I mean, that would be that the value depends on how long. The value depends on how long the land has been agricultural. Yes, so ether is a parameter that determines the late from agriculture to abandon. So if it is small, it is possible to manage the land as agriculture for a long time. So we consider eater, it's just constant, but it's actually. but it's yeah actually in the previous so yeah today i didn't talk about that but in previous model we included the ether is also um um depending on the landowner's decision and landowner uh make a decision whether or not to abandon their agricultural land based on the value of agriculture or abandoned land. Abundant run. So, such modification is, of course, possible. Okay. Thank you for your question. So, Rebecca, you had a question. Rebecca? Okay, I will read the question. Sorry, sorry. I forgot to unmute. Yeah, at the beginning of your talk, Akiko, you had a slide. Akiko, you had a slide where you showed lots of countries with these turning points where they transitioned from losing forest to gaining forest. I am just wondering, do any of those correspond to the scenarios in your model that lead to increased forest? Or are they simply that these are wealthy countries that have been able to start harvesting buying their wood from other places where forest has less value? Forest has less value. Yes, thank you for your question. So, dialect comparison between our model prediction and related data like this is a bit difficult. Like, as you said, there is connection between different regions, like the import of woods from tropical region to the northern. To the northern Europe or Japan and other northern areas. So we didn't consider such a trade of timber between different regions. So the direct comparison is difficult. But what we can say from the analysis of our model is that the forest, so the area where forest increasing is Forest increasing is occurring is in higher latitude region, so where forest regenerates slowly and still in tropical area deforestation ongoing. So I think in the previous study, the people only consider economic aspect to explain this forest transition, but Forest water transition, but our model can add another insight. The rate of forest recovery is also an important factor to determine the fate of the system, coupled ecological and the social system. So that is one conclusion from our model. Our analysis. Thank you. Alan? Alan? Okay. Alan, you're. Hi, yeah, yeah. I just was muted. So that was a wonderful talk, Pico. I really. Thank you very much. And the way you simplify is important, but you also asked for sort of ideas to add pieces. And it would strike me that somehow thinking about the age structure of the forest rather than assuming. The forest rather than assuming so whether or not you want to look at a structure of individual trees, or but the age of the forest seems like it would have a big impact on the value and also other aspects. Yeah, so yes, so we just consider one state for forest, so this F and age structure not. Structure not included in the model. So it's, yeah, that is a, would be good direction to modify the model. So far, I think we have tried to include such age structure in a model. So it would be a good next direction. And as a matter of fact, I mean, if you really wanted to just see even the direction that would go first, you could even sort of have like. Go first, you could even sort of have like young and old forest as a first step where young forest would transition to old forests, and you could decide to essentially turn either young or old forest. Right. So the younger forest. So young forest. It depends on how we define the forest value for young and old forest. And old forest. And I think in general, the old forest is more variable than young forest. So if we things are banned and they can't immediately turn into old forest. Yeah. Right. So if we include that, I predict that the that forest management would be more difficult because young forest have less value than forest, than older forests. So landowner need to have much longer perspective, long the large omega to make the forest management successful. So that's So that's why in Canada, if you have spontaneously a forest growing out of a field, it's not a valuable forest because you have the trees are too dense. So they cannot grow wide. They will stay very, very thin. So it's not the same quality. So if you want to have a valuable, you really need to make forest management when the forest is growing. Otherwise, you won't have any value. Yeah. So we need. Yeah, so we need to pay some cost to manage. Yeah, if you want to have it, it's not just that you abandon, it's not abandon the land, it's really you invest to get a good forest. That's right, that's right. Mark, you were having a question? Sure. Yeah, thank you for a beautiful talk. I guess it's natural for people to think, what if? What if this? What if that? What if this, what if that, and tried to make things more complicated. And I guess I don't want to do that too much. I had some factors in the chat, but I'm also wondering, like just in Western Canada, there's been this insect outbreak from mountain pine beetle that's essentially driven by climate change. And it's basically restructured the economics of forests by it's Economics of forests by it's completely devastating, right? It's about a third of the forests have disappeared in pine forests in BC and Alberta. And so I was wondering, I don't think that's probably just Western Canada. I was wondering, what about climate change here in your models? I mean, things will change, I guess. So, currently, in my model, no climate change. So, So the way to include the effect of climate change in this model would be like the forest that the forest maybe stock has. The value of forest can decrease in the future because of climate change, like the outbreak of some pest, like you said. Or the forest to recover late, also the decreasing function along time due to climate change. So such modification would be possible, but I really appreciate your idea and suggestion how to do you have any idea to include climate change in this minimum model? This minimum model? Yeah, so absolutely. One, like you say, you could put it into the parameters, the essential parameters in the model and let those depend on the climate situation and sort of look at the sensitivity of the output or the behavior to changes in the climate. And then the other is this idea that there may be some. Is this idea that there may be some transition to a different regime, like forest insect outbreaks or large-scale fires. That is more of a phase transition kind of thing. It wouldn't be from a sensitivity analysis. I think both would be interesting. Yeah, it's very interesting. I also think maybe the human decision making also. Making also depending on the situation of climate change, so that can be included in a model somehow. Thank you for your comments. My pleasure. Thank you. Thank you. Judith, you had a question? Yes, I have the impression that a lot of the historical forest transitions are attributed to industrialization, and I was wondering. And I was wondering if you construct the appropriate utility functions, does this model retro objectively predict those transitions that are attributed to industrialization? Or would it not work out and present a challenge to that idea? Okay, so um So actually, so in a study in economics, so many people explain why this forest transition happened because of the environmental cuisines curve. So as the GDP increase, the deforestation rate first increase, but it decrease. Increase, but it decreases. So, already the relationship between the occurrence of this terrestrial transition and industrialization have been discussed well in economics, the field of economics. But I feel so that kind of argument lacks the ecological perspective. That's why I developed this model that includes both socio-economic decision making. Socio-economic decision-making and the natural ecological processes. So, my answer to your question is that I think the previous study of this forest transition includes a bunch of aspects of industry realization. So, can I answer your question? I think what you're saying means that it might be interesting to try to To try to so have you modeled utility functions that incorporate these existence of alternatives, economic alternatives? And so does that change the does that either support or challenge the notion that various past transitions were associated with industrialization? Yeah, so or it maybe is just another of these wish lists that might be interesting to do. So other sector, so maybe would be possible to incorporate To incorporate other sectors, like not only for the forest management, but also the so I need to think more. Sure, thank you. Yeah, so I got your point. I really think about that. Okay, so thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Hans, you have a question? Put your mic microphone on. Okay, no, I'm unmuted. So thank you very much for this interesting talk. My question is really along the same lines as Alan's. When I was listening, I thought, isn't there a difference? Thought, isn't there a difference or shouldn't there be a difference between old growth and fast-growing commercial forests? That's not in your model, but I think that will affect the results, the answers, your conclusions that you found on the basis of your model. I noticed that most of the loss is currently in the lower latitudes and the gain is in the upper latitude, higher latitudes. So that already. Latitudes. So that already is an indication. Brazil, Indonesia, that's where you find old growth, not in Europe. So your question is about the difference between the commercial forest and the natural? Yes, North Carolina versus Amazon forest, for example. Okay. So from this So, from this model, I can not distinguish these two types of forest because we just formalize the forested state as the one single state. So it includes, so basically this model includes both type of model. But yeah, so it could be improved to consider. To consider more the forestry type processes, like the planting tree and managing the forest and cut tree or the more so basically my intention is to describe more natural process. So I consider this transition, especially for recovery, occur natural process. Occur natural processes, but it can be interpreted as the people plant the new tree and people can regulate the forest recovery rate itself by planting. So, and I think in China actually the very many people now planted a lot of new trees, so that's why. Of new trees. So that's why the forest cover increases because of that, not because of natural recovery. So I think that this forest recovery rate would be one of a critical parameter that distinguishes the forestry or natural growing forest. Thank you. Thank you. Rebecca, you already talked. Maybe I will go to the ones. Talk, maybe I will go to the ones who didn't ask questions and you come back to the discussion. So, Lou, you had a question? Yeah, I apologize, I was teaching a class, but I was wondering if you've looked at any of the data sets. So, for example, we've had students, we have a whole center here in Knoxville of Forest Inventory Analysis, which is very detailed data available across the U.S. on what are called forest inventory analysis plots that have been kept. Analysis plots that have been kept up for decades. And that data set likely would be useful in estimating parameters and the spatial variation in parameters, at least across something like the U.S. I expect that there are similar data sets elsewhere. And I didn't know if you had looked at any of those or you know so far I don't look at the data in detail. The data in detail, but I'm very interested in that. I'll send, I'll post a link to that group in the chat, okay? Thank you very much. Yes, I will look at that. Thank you very much. Sure. Pauline, you have a question? Yeah, so I'm just curious to know if you had a link between the forest and once the forest is cut, then maybe the land can be. Maybe the land is abandoned rather than going into the agriculture, because I think a lot of the forested land is on the mountain hillsides and is not really very suitable for agriculture. Ah, so you mean the transition from forested F to E, the arrow from F to E is possible? Yes, well, I think. Yes, well, I think that would be the case possibility. And so I didn't notice about that. So it would be interesting to compare this model and the new model that include the transition also from forest to abandoned lands. Part of the discussion or debate? Discussion or debate, or even stronger in the part of Canada, British Columbia, because a lot of the forest land is on a very mountainous terrain. And so once it's cut, then certainly agriculture. So I think that might be an interesting link to include in the model. Right. That's right. Mountainous land is good for sheep. Wow. Well not this kind of thing that's a good point. Yeah. Madrid, you said you had a global model of forest transition. Do you want to say a word on it? No, I just wanted to let you know. You can look it up if it's of interest. Frank, you have a question? Yeah, I think my Question? Yeah, I think my question ties in with Pauline's, Hans's, and Mark's earlier comments and questions. In Germany, for example, forest is basically only left on the hillsides, and it has been heavily managed with non-native trees, which grow fast and can be harvested quickly. And due to windfall insects, a couple of Insects, a couple of dwarts that have been occurring increasingly recently, they get abundant. And now the question is: do we replace them by the same kind of trees or by more natural trees which grow much more slowly? So it's not so much a question about forests being replaced by agriculture, but two types of forests, like slow growing and fast-growing, and the slowly growing ones being more prone to. Being more prone to moving to the abandoned class because of global change and so on and so forth. So it's a totally different system, but I was wondering whether your model could be more or easily adapted to that situation. Yeah, so originally I was interested in more natural forest, but as I answer to the previous question, so when we consider mu can. when we consider milk can be regulated by people in service, so we can consider the like planted forest, commercial forest also. So yeah, I so that considering two different types of forest is of course very important and I will think more about that. Yeah, thank you for your comments. You for your comments. So, we have had a first round of questions. We normally have in the program a five-minute break before we start the discussion. Yeah, that sounds great, Christian. Thank you for cheering, and thanks to all the speakers for their talk.
