Pleasure to be here. Thank you for the organizers to invite me, and thank you to Eta and Sarah for my talk because due to personal issues, I can't. So I am particle physics, so I am interested in compute scattering amplitudes. So I am interested in The on-shell methods, but I just want to talk about a tree-level amplitude. But in this case, we are working with massless particles. Okay, I am interested to study the Sura-Kampen effect, which is The supermotiplet contains only one graviton and one gravitin. In this case, both particles are massless. So from little group, we know that to describe massless particles, only we need the eliciting. So in this case, I'm going to use the spinal elicit formalis, but in the modern Model with in the modern notation. And I'm going to show you how to compute in the traditional way, which is using Feynman rules and using the modern approach of constructed approach and BCFW to compute a four-point amplitude. Four point amplitudes and last one: how these ideas, constructed approach, and BCFW can help us to compute massive scattering amplitudes of the top quarton. Okay, so this matrix contains all the processes that can operate. The processes that can occur in the universe. So, from the SMATRICS, an old method is Lehman-Simanski-Fimmer-Simmerman. And from the SM matrix, we can derive Feynman rules. And then using these Feynman rules, we can construct the scattering processes. The scattering processes. And for study scattering processes, we need use the Feynman diagrams, which contains external lines, which are the particles like electrons and bosons, and the internal lines. And the internal lines are the propagators, and vertices is where the scattering occurs. So, an amplitude is composed by the sum of many Feynman diagrams. And we use the amplitude to compute observables. In this case, we're interested in a differential cross-section, but But only are interested here in compute the amplitude at three level of scattering of two particles to two particles. So the theory that I am studying is the Sugran in equal one, D equal four, and this is the Sugran action. P is in terms. P is in terms of biospinners, just to connect with the elicit spinners formalism. And some details about Sugren and particulate quantum gravity was targeted yesterday with the Saramos. But here the supergravity theory that That we are considering is only spin 2 graviton and spin 3 half graviton. So these are the Feynman diagrams that I need to compute the full scattering amplitude. So As I said at first, I'm going to use two ways to compute this total scattering amplitude. The first way is using the traditional method of fine-wind diagrams. But in this case, I am using the context of KLT relations. Of PLT relations. So, as Cesar Ramos said yesterday, there is a relation between amplitude's gravity and Jen-Miles amplitudes. These are the three-point amplitudes in the modern notations, and these are the Jang-Mills amplitudes. Amplitudes. So the KLT relations that we're going to use come from a paper of Berkman and Borg. And this is the KLT relations where we have one gravitino, one graviton, and one gravitino and one graviton in terms of glons and gluinos. So, these are definite rules for gravitinos and gravitons that I am going to use. So, and for gravitons, we have this relations. So, the three point vertexes are in terms of Point vertexes are in terms of coulons and glinons. So I'm going to contract these equations with polarization tensors, which are in terms of nuance and grins. So tensor polarization of Gravitino is in terms of Is in terms of a vector polarization of one gluino and a vector polarization of LON. And the polarization tensors of the graviton field also are in terms of gluons. This is in order to use the well-known results about gluons. So we first start with the four point interaction and here I am contracting the four point which contains two gravitinos and two gravitons with the respective polarization tensors. Here I am rewriting everything in terms of bile spinners and the amplitude that And the amplitude that I am interested in is the elicited configuration of minus, minus, plus, plus. Here is plus, now, sorry. So in this case, the result is zero. So the next one is this Feynman diagram. And here I this polarization. This this polarization tensor is the this corresponds to this gravitino and this vertex corresponds to this one and this is the polarization tensor that corresponds to this gravitin. And then the next term is the propagator, which is the propagator of two gravitons, two gravitinos, sorry. And this is the This is the polarization tensor of the gravitino. Then is the vertex of the two gravitinos, one graviton, and this is the polarization tensor of the gravitons. In this case, constructing everything and doing the algebra, we have that. We have that this amplitude vanish. So the next one is this process is the S12 channel. So again, I use the Feynman rules to or gravitinos and gravitons to compute this scattering amplitude. Scattering amplitude, and the result is this one in terms of bile spinners. Okay, so the other way to compute this scattering amplitude is using the constructed approach and BCFW recursion relations. So, So, in the case of three-point interactions, we have these constraints. And if we choose that the angle contraction is different of zero, we have the squared R zero now. And this contraction is known as holomorphic. And if we choose that the square bile spin, the contraction of bile spinners is different of zero. Bile spinners is different of zero, and we have the angle spinner elicities are zero now. And this now is and this contact is known as antiomorphic. So using these constructions, we have a formula, a general formula to compute three-point interaction. Three-point interactions. So, in the case when the sum of elicities of the particles is less than zero, we have the form of the scattering amplitude is in terms of only angle spinners. So, in the case that is positive, we have We have this form of the amplitudes in terms of square bile spinners. And using the formula, we get this three-point amplitude. So this is for the interaction of two gluignons, one gluon, and this is for. And this is for two gravitinos, three gravitons, and the last one is for two gravitinos, one graviton. And these amplitudes are the only ones that survive. Other configuration of elicities vanished due to the constraints. And well, in order to compute the four-point amplitudes, we use BCFW recursion relations. And in the case of four-point amplitudes, we have a simple pulse that is just one over the kinematic invariant. And in this And in this case, we see that we have this amplitude vanish as we see in the Feynman approach. And this is for diagram B and we see that this result coincides with that of Coincides with that obtained for the traditional Feynman method. And for diagram C, we have this result, and the conclusion here is the Using BCFW program and constructed approach or the results consign. And the final amplitude is this one. So this is our first analysis and this to Ways to compute the total amplitude is a paper itself. So the next step to do with this in sugar-compton amplitude is considered now a massive gravitino using the spin-spinners formalis, which is the massive approach. And we are exploring super Higgs. And we are exploring super Higgs mechanisms in order to do this computation. And the last one is that we want to compute the three level amplitudes necessary to compute TT bar x and next to leading order. And we have this These processes with their corresponding glue amplitudes. So, using the, we want to compute these scattering amplitudes using BCFW recursion relations, spin-spinos formalis, VCJA relations, and some work is done in this direction. So we see We see that supergravity Feynman rules derived by KLT are simpler than results derived from conventional analysis and the results obtained by KLT Feynman rules and constructed approach and BCFW in this case both results coincide and this modern approach of unshared methods are more powerful to compute Are more powerful to compute scattering amplitudes than conventional methods of Feynman rules. So, thank you. Are you saying you get enough managing after you? Saying you'll get enough managing updates with physical momentum. We don't have the character complexity for the whole collinear kinematics. So, helicity conservation is not mathematically possible. I didn't see that. Well, here I am using only the formulas now and but no, I don't know. No, I don't know where. Yeah, you won't be there. Oh, but the observation is similar. But the master continues. That's really good. Um we will see again. Well, we now are exploring all that. So I don't have too much to say on it. So, because this work is almost new now. So, we are now, we are still playing. Now we are still planning now for the breach. Yes, we want to using these ideas because in the traditional way is very complicated to compute these amplitudes. We need a hundred of Python diagrams to get the total amplitude. So I think it's impossible not to. I think it's impossible not to do that with the traditional way. But using these ideas seems that it will be more easy to compute or to get a result. Maybe it's an my question. These these two approaches like uh high size that are so cute. In the in the Marshie case, I I would hope that KLP relations are are like consistently all, but do you have any intuition that the KLP relations and the constructive approach would concise or for not in the constructive approach, as far as I know, is only for massive mass particles if we want to. If we want to study massive, I think spin spinners formalize is the correct way to
