Including Irina, who's one of the organizers, who were former students in PostgreSAP, Master, who benefited from the pandemic in the sense that they have jobs at the Public Health Agency of Canada now, and which are jobs that simply didn't exist before the pandemic. And I think something that has happened is not just receptiveness, but actual action creation positions in the federal public health agency. In the Federal Public Health Agency for modelers. And so, welcome, Mike, and we look forward to your insights from the acquisition. Yeah. Thanks, David, for that introduction. And I promise we did not predict it. The pandemic. All right. So, yeah, it's very good to see everyone. First time in person, I'm a pretty fresh face, so I'm pretty new in the industry. Industry. So today I'm going to talk about a talk that I've covered in 48 hours because I, from the time I submitted my title to the talk to David, I probably have my four version of this. And what I decided to do at the very last minute is basically summarize the four things that I kind of want to talk about today. The title might be a little misleading, but probably the only misleading part is the respiratory part. But everything else is true, is that I want Everything else is true, is that I want to talk about the need to evaluate the existing data resources and knowledge gaps to support future needs for respiratory, not respiratory, for disease surveillance and monolith. So I want to start off by acknowledgement because I cannot be here today, since I'm here to meet you without these four special people. Nate, which is my boss. He is a superstar, a rock star, and really the one who organized. And really, the one who organized, tried to pull us all together, the modelers, and really took it to the next level, really demonstrated the potentials and how powerful Molin could be to support public health, where he brings the results and our work to the highest part of the policymakers and senior management. Gordon Joy, right here, give everyone a wave, who I had a pleasure to spend time with last week. Pleasure to spend time with last week. He organized a very big genomic conference where we actually brought in all the most of the PT map people to really sit down and duke out all the questions. And I hope that I really wanted to tell you that I could answer all the questions in 30 minutes, but I can't. And last but not least, the two people, Ben Bolker and Jonathan Dushaw, I would not be here today. I would not be here today. My original career, I was planning to be a casino game designer. I was a statistician until Ben, I was young and ambitious back then, who said, all the hard and interesting questions are in biology, where we started off doing animal movements and movement ecology. And then after Jonathan brought me to the world of infectious leaks, and that's where I am today. And I also And I also want to acknowledge and thank you, everyone of you here, because it is your work, whether it's throughout the pandemic and also before pandemic, that I have a chance to read over and really study and fall in love with this topic. And of course, you and through the discussions, I really want to communicate and talk to all of you in the next couple of days and also future. Days and also future collaborations so we could work together and figure this out and yeah, support public health. Alright, I was actually planning to freestyle this presentation. So every good freestyle is ask questions because I find that asking the right questions is actually a way to get to our answers. So let's take a memory trip, a trip back to memory. A trip back to memory lane. So let's think about because I'm a lot of time. Let's think about where were you in March 2020? What were the questions that you were asking in 2020? And what do you want to know about that? And what were the data, surveillance tools, and the models that we used in the year 2020? And now, last but not least, just think about with your experiences today. With your experiences today, and if you could time travel back to 2020, does any of your answers change? Because of time, I just want to flash my memory. So from what I learned through this pandemic is that data are much better than past outbreaks. So I've studied different diseases, for example, rabies, HIV, and influenza, and data were never at this level. Level the amount and the volume that we have for the COVID pandemic. And it's not just that data. So there's also a big ramp up and usage of testing and sequencing data with genomics. And it's very happy, I'm very happy to see that large volume that we were able to sequence, able to test in such a short amount of time. And we're also working on it and figuring out how to maintain and And figure out how to maintain and continue this. Wastewater is actually another thing that stepped up during the pandemic. And one of the biggest leaders here, my colleague, Dr. David Sean Berdon, who really did a lot of very good wastewater modeling for all the pandemic. And something that I think is really cool is back then when we started Twitter, we kind of still do, is the ability to share. The ability to share public data and do knowledge exchange. So, we did learn a lot during this pandemic, but we also realized that there are much more to learn. All right, so this is a paper, and I think half of the authors, exactly half the authors, are actually present in this room. So, we wrote a paper back by Robert Caroline, who started the discussion with. Who started the discussion with the Friday morning group that we set up and really think about? I believe this paper was published last year and to think about what are the pieces that we need and what it needs to link genomic surveillance to SARS-CoV-2. And this is a very useful paper, and I read it all the time, not just once, but I find myself read this paper over and over again about like. Over and over again, about like once every three months. And every time I read the paper, I have different perspectives on it, which is really cool. And this is how I know this is a good paper. Just to summarize, I just want to really, the highlight of this is what we call the band of four. It's that you really need information and data in at least four of these pieces. So the genetic data, right? Genetic data on biosequencing, the epidemiological and geographic data, clinical and demographic data, and immunization data. So what this paper is, I strongly recommend if you haven't read it, read it. Not just the power of what these four sets of data pieces of information could tell you, but also tell you what the status quo is. We live in a world that we don't have complete perfect data, and what are the potentials? Data, and what are the potentials that you have these partial data? What you can do and what you cannot do. And Nick, my boss, who cannot be here today, asked me, he's like, Mike, so this, it's been a year from now. We need a part two to this paper. And I've been thinking really hard, what exactly does part two of this paper will be? And I have a lot of ideas and talked to many people, but I want to follow. People, but I want to fall back to this quote that I saw this year, earlier this year. Is that one of the lessons, given that this is a conference where we actually come down, put together, and talk about what are the things that we learn and what we could do in the future. So one of the lessons that we have learned in this pandemic is this recurring situation of saying, if only we have done this X months ago, we would have the data we needed to make good decisions today. To make good decisions today. So, this is a very good quote, I thought. And then, but actually, thinking about this, I have a different perspective after looking at this quote again. And it's the word data. Is it really the data? So, when I actually come back and think about what Nick and the senior managers asked me, they're not asking me, Mike, can you give me the data? They ask me, Mike, can you give me this piece of information? Can you give me this piece of information that I want? So, this is what brings me to think about our focus should be on learning from data and not the actual data itself. So, the key is not sharing data per se, but effective collaboration to obtain information from data. And I really want to point this as data information or data knowledge share. So, for example, do I really So, for example, do I really need a big blindness if I'm just setting up an SIR model? All I really need is a transmission parameter and a recovery parameter for SIR. That's just one thing. All right. So, and surprise, surprise, the quote is actually by me early this year in a podcast, interesting podcast. All right, so, and this is the part that I started thinking of. Then I start thinking. So, based on different levels of expertise, we have different ideas, perspective, and experience up until today. And we kind of ask different questions. And something that I often, something that I learned over the years is that people ask questions and comment on things that they know and they're very experienced in. And if you're lucky, sometimes they ask questions on stuff that. Ask questions on stuff that they don't know. And there's another category of people that they really don't know what they don't know. And last but not least, there's me. I claim that I don't know anything. But that is okay because everyone here and people outside do know something. And this is why we're gathered here to talk about these problems. So we actually see through different lenses and we actually seek answers in different ways. Answers in different ways, whether it's wastewater or the hospital administrators. We could have the same common goal, but we also have different objectives as well. And we also see the value of our need based on different criterias. So that's what brings me here. So, a lot of the hot shots have visions in their sleep, but for me, I have this vision for not sleeping enough. For not sleeping enough. So, this is where I want to sell you the idea that I thought was a really good view is the PrEP vision. So what does it stand for? So the PrEP vision is basically four different streams that I think could work in parallel right now. And if I have the technology to clone myself, I would spend each of my clones to work. Spend each of my clones to work insanely in these four areas. The first one starting with profiling to identify what people, and people here means senior management, policymakers, scientific collaborators, and also healthcare administrators, and the general public. What they want to know, and what the bottlenecks are. And this is a word we use as a software developer, as well as when we develop software. As well as when we develop software, we want to really look at what exactly are the bottlenecks that stop us from this or really slows us down. The original intent of this talk is the idea of reflection, is to really sit down and assess and evaluate the existing resources used during the pandemic and used now to seek answers. Answers. So, how do we know what data we need more data if we don't have a correct assessment or assessment of what we have and what we don't have and what we need? Next is the idea of exploring alternative options. So, there are limitations in what we don't have. So, what can we do to work around these various barriers? We still have to work without the beta bills, and we still want to. Bells, and we still want to serve the public. So, what are other workarounds that we could do? And last but not least, what keeps me excited the most, the fun part, is the idea, the last P for the purpose, the proof of concept, the validation of the ideal world that we all envision. All right, I'm going to go through each one of them in more detail. And what I did here is just And what I did here is just come up with some questions. They're not set in stone. And I'm pretty sure these questions will build up as I talk to more people. And also, these are some answers that I've got when conversing with people. So who are the people that want these answers? So is it public health, public science partners, hospital administrators, or Policy administrators or policymakers. What are the questions that these people want to know, and what are the answers that they are seeking? And what are the small incremental steps to get there? So something that I think talking to people is that because we come from different fields, sometimes the language is a barrier, and sometimes we actually don't know that. And sometimes we actually don't know that the things that we want are actually the same thing. So I think it's very important to really align the separate initiative and really identify the synergies for ad hoc collaboration. And something that came up from last week's meeting with Orden is that the idea of communication, if we actually can communicate with each other and understand what our needs are and where we come from. Needs and where we come from, and really educate each other that this is actually a very good plan forward or piece of information, and it could be similar. And that's what brings us to the big collaboration. All right, reflection. So, what are our existing resources? So, I'm being very vague with resources. This could be data, the knowledge we have with the theoretical aspects. The theoretical aspects and also the tools, for example, MACMAT2.Steve will also talk about later in this conference. What are all of these resources that we have? How much do we know about our resources and what we could do and not do with our existing resources? So, one of the examples that I'm currently working with with Health Canada Adam Diener, I think he's on the call, is the idea. The call. It's the idea of might know dad database. So this is the discharge abstract database, where it's basically a line list of the hospital emissions and discharge. Like, have anyone actually take that piece of data, giant database, and study in detail? What can we learn from that? So something of interest to me is the whole concept of immunity. Concept of immunity. How many times a person have visited the hospital and what are their history, for example? And how sustainable or our resources, whether it's data, knowledge, and tools. We know that tools, through the development of MacPlan 2, we have various versions of MacPlan, and things do improve over time. And in terms of sustainability, you might experience throughout the pandemic. You might experience throughout the pandemic when we first started, we have daily reported data, and now stuff has been backrolled weekly or monthly, and no data at all. And because we, it's very important to do this assessment and evaluation so that we know how to improve the system and improve our resources. And some of the things that were discussed over. Discuss over the past couple months that I think are important to realize is the idea of risk. So there's actually no guarantee that the resources that you have right now or the weekly reporting of reporting actually exists. And something that I really want to bring up and I learned last week in Winnipeg at the big M ⁇ L white building is wastewater. Wastewater we see as a very good tool during the pandemic. Good tool during the pandemic. And from my naive knowledge, I really thought that someone just go to some wastewater treatment plant, take a bucket, bring it back to their lab, and analyze it. But no, someone shut me down immediately. He's like, do you know how much paperwork that we have to go through to actually let the scientists study the wastewater? And it's actually, you're really lucky to have this work because give someone or Someone or a group of people in the public says that no, we don't want this type of analysis, this could get shut down immediately. So, I think, as a researcher, that this is not prior knowledge that I know of. And I think this is important information to share to modelers and scientists that really understand what are the resources and bottlenecks. And really, what this comes to is communication trust, whether it's to the public, but some. Is to the public, with scientists among us, and also with public health people. And we have to know that this trust is very fragile, and it really just takes one small step piece to break that trust and break our resources. Okay, yeah, so something that I kind of also want to chat about is the cost of additional information. So we often talk about it's great to have this data. Often talk about it's great to have this data inside. But there's actually a lot of different initiatives that is actually happening right now. For example, the CNIS, which is the Noso Home Yo surveillance program, the Cento program. And they're really, really useful to say that if we actually talk to them and figure out, they probably have 80% of the answers that you actually want. Maybe the next thing forward is to figure out what is the remaining. is to figure out what is the remainder 20% that they could help you or we could work together to figure out this ideal world for and something that so another thing is the idea of data integration so we have wastewater we have other different ways of reporting data which were for example genomics and stuff how do we effectively use these pieces and we actually need to bring these pieces And we actually need to bring these people down to sit down in a group, in a room, and talk about how to study each piece and how they feed back on each other. And something that I think talking to Ben, Ben mentioned, is the, let's talk about the limitations of what actually held you back in previous analysis. That, what are the limitations? Or I could also go back to a bunch of papers and look at POA, read people's discussion section. Section. So maybe a diverse and handful of such examples can be very persuasive and really think about what are the recipes. Exploring alternative options. So like I said, so if there are no change in the system, for example, with data reporting or capacity to work, what else can you do? You do. If we don't do anything beyond out of the box, we're in a status quo steal. So, something to think about, I think, this board is how do we frame questions that enable maximum use of de-identified data? And we really need to start thinking outside the box. What happened when the resource is not sustained? We still have to work. So, something, this is an idea that I kind of talked. This is the idea that I kind of took home when I was in McMaster working with John Venn and Ben: the idea of collaborating without data. So, this is an underutilized mechanism for doing very detailed analysis while respecting security and private data, if they exist. So, the basic idea is that people with clearance can cooperate with others to run high-resolution analysis and share the results. And share the results inside the data itself. This method can be made more efficient if there is a parallel synthetic data. So we could generate data to really test all these pipelines and allow collaborators without access to real data to test and develop tools before they apply to real data. Almost. And last but not least, I think this is the one that excites me the most. The one that excites me the most is that we often talk about this ideal world where we have perfect linkage, perfect data. So, how can we actually validate our ideal world is worth it? And when I think about ideal world, maybe this ideal world is the model world that we are, modelers, are used to. So, if we could extract appropriate information from this ideal world, Ideal world from data. So we create this ideal world, generate data. Can we extract information from data? Can we package it and use to ensure that the information had great impact? Show people that this is actually worth it and persuade. So we need some kind of validation. And really, I think on the flip side, it's like, would it be understood? Would it be used the way we thought? Be used the way we thought. There's still a lot of uncertainties, even in this world. So it's actually really easy to talk about the ideal world. But once I realized as a data statistician is that after getting the data, there's still way more questions that I cannot think about until I actually seen it. And would it be timely and would it be errors or so? Something that we often talk about is a tabletop exercise that we've A tabletop exercise that we started talking about in the agency. And something that I think is really valuable is the idea of using agent-based models to generate everything. And for example, what happened with the US modeling hub, where they have different models to do. But something that really clicked in when I talked to Gordon last week in the taxi is that maybe we also want to involve the non-modelers. For example, if you're able to generate Able to generate, simulate phylodynamics, epidemic trees, et cetera. Can you get a computer scientist to say that, oh, I could actually identify and make sure that there's no security issues and give this data to a wastewater model, for example, or wastewater. Does this actually look like what you've seen in the wastewater literature? I'm almost done. I know I'm running out of time. So, in conclusion, so this concludes. So, in conclusion, so this is the good slide. So, it's actually important to actually tell this, talk about it in the layman terms. And I really want to describe the prep vision in four lines. For profiling is that we need to talk, we need to talk to each other, figure out the problems. Reflection, we need to walk, we need to really start working on these problems. Start working on these problems. Explore alternative options: is that we need to talk the walk. Really, so really start talking about different ways to work around. And last but not least, we need to walk the talk. We talk about this ideal world, but we need to prove it and validate that this is worth it. And that concludes my presentation. Acknowledgement to the government agents, the Public Health Agency Canada. The Public Health Agency Canada, my team, and other government organizations, but last but not least, the important part: the economic collaborators. I have the opportunity to work with a lot of people across Canada and around the world. Thank you.
