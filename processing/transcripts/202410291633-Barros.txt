After the technical interview, we have the last talk of today. Don't forget that we have posters right after outside. And Ricardo Barroso from Lockborough will tell us about coexistence of internal solidary waves of opposite polarity in three aircraft. Thank you very much. And thank you for the the organizers for the kind invitation. So this will be one more talk on internal wave. On internal waves, not on a two-layer as described by Wui Young, but in a three-layer. So, this is a joint work with Paul, Wu-Young, and also Alex, who's currently a UKRI with Dynamics Research Fellow at PATH. And this is the work that we are trying to finalize. Okay. So bear with me. So these are a few slides on my motivation for this work. Motivation for this work, and these are the faults. So, you take here a two-fluid system as considered by Sunao and Wuyong. Okay, but now here I have a top-free wall, okay, as opposed to the free surface that Wuyong just used. And as we know, this system supports internal waves, okay, and also supports permanent waves, okay, in which, for example, you can have periodic waves, you can have solitary waves, and solitary waves can be of. Solitary waves and solitary waves can be of depression or elevation. For example, as opposed to surface water waves that are always of elevation. So I'm talking about gravity waves. And they were first described by using KDB equation. So you can derive the KDB equation for this interface displacement, zeta. And we'll have here zeta t, c naught, zeta x, and so on. So all these coefficients can be listed here. And what we can see that, of course, these That, of course, this will depend on the parameter that you have. So, constant density row one, constant density row two, and then heights in equilibrium, okay? Or that's h1 and h2, okay? And of course, g, I mean, gravity is not represented here, but we are taking into account. So, what we notice immediately is that, for example, this C2 coefficient there is always positive, and C1 actually may change side. So, this is what will give you different polarities. So, this is what will give you different polarities for the solution. So, what we know is that based on K d D, provided you have a supercritical flow and this quadratic nonlinear coefficient is different from zero, then slaughter solutions exist for the K D B theory. And then they can be of depression, provided you have this inequality, or of elevation. So, this is basically just looking at that guy, the numerator there. What happens when the quadratic non-coefficient vanishes? Well, in that case, if this guy is set to zero, or this, then according to KDB, you don't have internal solar derivatives. The question is, how reliable are these results? Because, for example, you could say, okay, the quadratic non-interactive coefficient vanishes. Maybe I'm missing something. So I go and, for example, Something so I go and, for example, derive the MKDV. Am I capturing something new there or not? But it turns out that these predictions here are as good as it gets because they are the same that can be made for Euler. And this has been proved by Craig and Sternberg back in 92, right? Yeah. So the idea is that now moving up to a three-layer fluid system, so now instead of two, I just So now instead of two, I just add one more layer. Now I have three liquids with constant densities row one, row two, row three. And it has been known, resorting to equilinolinear theory, that in certain cases you may have internal solutary waves of optical. So this is based on this paper by Grimshaw and co-authors. And these are actually solutions for this system. So in this case, all the, for example, All the, for example, the layer depths are fixed, okay? So these are the same as this, this is the same as that, this is the same as that. The wave speed is the same in both cases, but you see the solutions are very different. So here you have solutions of elevation, and here you have solutions of depression. And more recently, Lam has studied actually the interaction of these two things. Now, the goal The goal that I want to set is, for example, understand for which parameters the solutions of opposite polarity can coexist, investigate how reliable the predictions made by the weekly non-linear are, and then finally try to inform experiments. So this is what we want to understand. So I'll start by the very first steps, which is using linear theory. So when you look at this physical system, So when you look at this physical system, what you find is that, for example, there are two modes of propagation, which we call baroclinic modes, because they are slower than the free surface motor waves. So here these are slow waves, but so you have a faster one and a slower one, mode one and mode two. So we can also call first and second baroclinic modes. And when you look at the display And when you look at the dispersion relation, you have basically the B quadratic equation. And in the long wave limit, you, I mean, we have here, we cast the B quadratic equation in such a way that I have a product of two terms giving you one, which means that I can call this something, I call it gamma, and I know that must be gamma minus one. And this gamma will appear because, for example, for linear waves, Because, for example, for linear waves, in the long wave limit, actually, the displacement for the lower layer or lower interface actually is just proportional to the displacement of the first interface. So what is written here with C naught? So basically this will be the linear long wave speeds. And if you want to recover things for the first mode, then you replace C0 by C0 plus or C0 minus, okay? So this is the first. So, this is the faster and this is the slowest. Moreover, this constant gamma here is positive for the mode 1 and it's negative for the mode 2. Now, if I move on to the Wikilinonian theory, I can derive again a K D B equation. So, I I'm I'm only writing the K D B equation for the f the the top interface, okay. I could have derived for the lower interface as well, okay. For the lower interface as well. So I'm keeping up with set of one. And here the coefficients are a little bit more complicated than for the two-layer case. But I mean, it doesn't matter. They can be written. So you see that all these things will depend on that gamma, the gamma that I introduced in the previous slide. And again, this guy, the C2, is always quality. So the particular thing about KDV is that. thing about KDV is that the propagation modes are fully decoupled. So mode 1 and mode 2 solutions are obtained when you replace in the, for example, in the definition of gamma or C naught, you replace by C naught plus or C naught plus C naught minus, depending on which mode you are interested in. And the way we call elevation or depression for that one, provided that the quadratic nonlinear predefination is positive or negative. Or negative, okay? And again, using the K divis theory, when you are at the criticality, which is when the quadratic nonlinearity coefficient vanishes, then you don't have solutions, okay? So this is what we know. Now the question is, so as Wuyang mentioned in his slides as well, in osteographic applications we have a common approximation which we call. Approximation which we call Bussiness approximation, which appears when the density contrasts are very, very small. So, in that case, we can actually neglect all these things, all these contributions from density, unless they are appeared by multiplying by G, the gravity. So, in the particular case, when the density increments across the layers are the same, and you have the top layer. And you have the top layer a sequence of the lower layer or the lowest, then we know that most one-swater waves cannot exist according to the KDB theory. And by the way, this is what you typically call a symmetric configuration. And this is because the quadratic non-linearity coefficient for KdB vanishes. So, and let me just point out that when you consider the DeLucina's approximation, instead, I mean, if I'm looking at the parameter space, I no longer have. Space. I no longer have four parameters, but basically I have only three, which is the ratio between the density increments, h1 over the total depth, and h2 over the total depth. So where h1 and h2 are basically, I mean, those capital guys there, are just the thickness in equilibrium. Okay, that's rest. So I can come here. I know that this vanishes. Yeah, I could emphasize that. Yeah, I could emphasize that that paper, so this kind of validation that they have done, so it only h holds along this line, okay? And they also use not layered fluids, but actually a continuous 35 flow with one more time.  From your applicant, one one starts with the find out of the application, okay? With a finite attitude, okay? You cannot go to zero on this side. So we say that the branch with a KDV polarity starts from the zero amplitude, okay? Always. But the other one doesn't, okay? And moreover, contrary to these, which will limit to a front, here these things just grow without any bounds, okay? Which is bad news because you know we are within rigid leads, so that thing shouldn't go up. Rigid leads, so that thing shouldn't go above the walls, right? But anyway, so this is in general. But I mean, if I specify my Gardner equation for the three-layer system that I'm interested in, okay, then of course C1 and C2 will be the same as for the KDB that I already presented. And we have the cubic non-Niartic coefficient written here. It's a bit messy, but I mean, that doesn't matter. Okay, this is just something proportional to C naught, which is. something proportional to C naught, which is a linear long-wave speed, to C1 and C1 squared. That's, I mean, I won't bother with that. The important thing is that under the BussyNest approximation, the results, by Crotin and all, are recovered. And more importantly, for mode 2, C3 is always less than 0. So you are always in this sector. The only way to have solutions is actually to be in the mode. Is actually to be in the mode one, the first part of the name propagation. And then, once you have those parameters there, I mean, those coefficients written down, you can actually, you know, just do this kind of plots. So, this is basically, so C1 and C3. I adopted this color scheme that I took from the paper by Purtina and co-authors. And basically, you see how, for example, if I set the If I set the delta equals one, I see that, for example, within this bubble, I will have positions of solutions of opposite polarity. Outside, I don't. So the same here, the same there. And also, it is quite remarkable that, for example, when you consider the Bussiness approximation, you won't see much non-Bussiness effects unless, for example, you are specifically delta equals one. In that case, this figure will transform into delta one. This figure will transform into that one. But anyway, so inside of this bubble, you have coexistence of solutions of this polarity, okay? Outside the dot. And again, how reliable are these results? Because as far as we know, nobody actually has checked it. So the only thing people have checked is along this line. And then it's true. The rest we don't know. Okay, now, so I want to move. So, I want to move from the weakly non-linear theory to the strongly non-linear theory. And for that, I will adopt what is now known as the Miatos Rectomaser theory. So, this was developed initially for a two-layer flow, and then it was developed, extended to multi-layer fluids. And for this specific case that I'm looking at, which is the three-layer case, then the only thing I would like you to remind To remind is that it has solitary wave solutions. I mean, we can write down the dynamical system governing the solitary wave solutions. And this is just a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, being the interface displacements for each interface, okay? Z to one and Z to two. And the Hamiltonian will be basically kinetic energy plus a certain potential. I will call that potential. Potential, I will call that potential V, and that depends on Zeta1 and Zeta2, and it's just a rational function. That's all I wanted to remember. So, I'll be very interested in looking at the critical points of that system. And these are basically given by the gradient of V equals zero. Also, the solutions that you'll be finding will all live in this triangle here, because I always have to impose that the Always have to impose that the thickness layers are always positive. And when you do that, because it's a rational function, then this system is equivalent to look at the intersection of two algebraic curves. That I will call C1 and C2. From those, the C, which is the parameter, the wave space parameter, can be eliminated, and you get another algebraic curve that I will call P, which is represented here. E, which is represented here in blue. And what we can do is that we notice immediately that there are two main configurations: okay? One like this, one like that. And when C is close to zero, what you will have in either case, you will have three maxima, three saddles, and one minimum. And then basically, when you start increasing C, you will see these guys moving around. So you start with seven critical points. You start with seven critical points and then they all start moving inwards, with the exception of the origin, because they will always be there. And there are a few rules. For example, a critical point can never pass another. And the other is that, for example, if I call this a branch one, branch two, branch three, they can never do these. They stay on the track. They cannot leave the branch where they are in it. So these are the main rules for these things. Rules for these things. Okay, so this is the setting. Okay, I start increasing the speed from something close to zero and I see what happens. So when they meet, they collide and they disappear because they cannot pass through each other. And now this is a race to see who gets to the origin first. So that guy will win, eventually it will cross to this side, and when it meets with the other guy, they just fail. With the other guy that just finished. So, in the end, there can only be one. Okay? It's like the Highlander. Okay, so when you attain that speed, it means that there are no solutions anymore. Okay, now, so I can start looking at the collision of critical points by focusing on what happens at the origin, okay? So, and if I do that, then I can use Newton's method to look, for example, for an expansion. For an expansion around the origin, okay, so for each one of them, okay, so C1 and C2 are the curves, which is equivalent to partial derivative of the potential with respect to Zeta1 equals 0. Partial derivative with respect to Zeta2 is 0. So this is what I call C1 and C2. And I expand that for Zeta2. So a double collision is precisely when the first, I mean the leading, I mean The linear term would coincide with the first coefficient, okay? And then you recover the linear long wave speeds, C naught and C naught plus and minus. Then you can look at the triple collision. So now you impose that this and that must coincide with the other guy. And then you recover the criticality that we knew already for the KDB. And you can also have a quadruple collision. So now you impose P1 equals P2, Q1 equals Q2, and S. equals Q2 and S1 equals S2. Okay, I won't write what that means for now, but put into perspective this means that when I'm looking at the Gardner, a triple collision happens exactly when this guy is zero, and a quadruple collision is when this is zero and that is zero as well. So we can track this back from the strongly non-linear regime. Okay, now. Okay, now, as we saw in the video, in this video that we have here, there were non-trivial collisions, which means that the points collided at some other point than the origin. So these are the three instances where they collided. And these collisions, in this case, all lead to a decrease of the number of critical points. But here, for example, I have in this plot proposed the zero contour of V for a specific. Of V for a speed close to the Linear long wave speed for the first partlining both. And just looking at the picture, I can tell you that mode 2 waves will be of elevation for Zeta 1 and mode 1 will be of depression for Zeta 1. Now, this is not always the case, because you can have also the situation where out of the blue, you have a creation of critical points. So, for example, at this red point here, there's a creation of points. Point here, there's a creation of a settle and a maximum. And that is actually the key for the existence of the coexistence of the loose. So I will say that if emergent cohesions are present, then they will lead to this feature precisely when you have two local maxima on the first and the third quadrants, exactly that speed at which the the the potential is written zero, okay. Is greater than zero. So if that happens, okay, then you see that as you increase C away from the linear low-way speed, these loops here will start shrinking up to a point. When they get to that point, it is exactly the same as saying this, okay? So V, the partial derivative resp and gradient of V equals zero, which is basically opening the doors for uh front. For front, okay? And it turns out that this is actually equivalent to looking at the conjugate states for the three-layer Euler configuration. And according to Benjamin, two uniform flows are said to be conjugate if all three basic physical conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy will hold. So these were studied by Lamb and Roussus and Glu. And we have proved that this is exactly equivalent to imposing That this is exactly equivalent to imposing this. Okay? Okay. So I will look at the solutions of this, v and gradient of v is 0, and I will do that by fixing, for example, delta, which is the ratio between the density increments. And I will fix also this ratio, okay? H1 over H3. And I will look, I will color these figures, I mean these curves, okay, which are the solutions of this. Curves, which are the solutions of that. So these are the speeds, okay? And I will color them just to tell you not only the speed, but which quadrant basically the critical point occupies. So if it is orange, I'm in the first quadrant. If it is blue, I'm in the third quadrant, and so on. And this is what I see. So these are two main cases I put out there. And what you have is that, for example, tangency, oh, and moreover. Oh, and moreover, so in dash, I have the curves, the c equals e naught plus, this one is c equals e naught minus. The tangencies, which are denote here by crosses, are basically when you have the criticality. And the onset for this feature of having solutions of opposite polarity will be for me to examine when the orange and the blue curves coexist. So it's precisely when H2 is where. So it's precisely when H2 is greater than this, and in this case, it's when H2 is greater than that. Okay, so, but what we also note is that in some cases it's a tendency, and the other is a crossing, okay? Through that linear one-wave filter. So I can track all that. So, for example, if I fix delta equals one, and if I just want to keep track of when the orange and Keep track of when the orange and the blue curve are there? Well, you know, this is the purple bubble of Gardner, which told me that inside of this I have coexistence of solutions of opposite polarity. This is the criticality in blue. But now I have this new guy here, which is basically when you have a crossing. And now my job is to know how to color these things. So basically, we can keep track. We can keep track of this, and we know that here it should be from criticality, then it follows the crossing and criticality again. So in this case, the reason is not so wildly different from what you would get for Gardner. But still, things can get much worse, for example. Here, for example, Gardner will tell you that you always have multiple polarities here, while in reality the situation is very, very different. Is very, very difficult. And in particular, for example, I mean, when you have criticality, according to MKDV, in this case, it will tell me along this side I will have two solutions of opposite polarity and nowhere else. While, for example, in this case, I actually have one branch of solution, here I have none. So there are some details to these things. Now, the question is: is this the whole story? Story? No, it's not, okay? So, what we have been able to identify because we looked at the critical point analysis is that these catch that we know from Garder telling you what happens in one of these quadrants and whatnot, is actually extended in this way. So, these four are basically related to these ones, A, B, C, and D, okay? With the difference that each one of these branches. The difference that each one of these branches actually will go to a front, okay, which is good news. I don't want things to go across the rigid wall, right? But we have identified this new regime and those two new as well. And then if we want to actually describe all these, we can. So if I look at this kind of conjugate flow speed chart, I could also say, for example, from this moment that you have a tip, something will change. Something will change. At this tendency point, something will change. And here, there's another thing that happens. So, here, for example, on this branch, you have solutions that typically bear the resemblance of a mode to wave, but it's actually traveling very, very fast. So, this is how you go. So, here, if H2 is less than this, then you are in this situation. Then you go to F, then you go to A, and then you have A and this guy. And these things can all be colored in this way. So, this is the original picture I had for Garner, and this is what I now can tell. You have to forgive me for my colouring skills of a five-year-old, but this is what I could do yesterday night. So, basically, the thing is the following. So, in each one of these, I've tried to identify in which panel I am. So, above these guys, So above these guys, the the the red line there, I have a quick distance of one of these two plus that uh solution branches, okay? And here, for example, I have the new thing which was not taught until now, which will be panels E and F, which will be this sigma C here. So, I mean, I could do this for other parameters, of course, but I just wanted to tell you that the story is quite new. I just wanted to tell you that the story is quite new at a topic, and I think I'll stop here. Thank you. And here, Ricardo, any questions? Did you bring crayons? No, I uh
