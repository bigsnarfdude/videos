From Bigville University, who will speak about equal relations arising from general Polish contractions. Thank you very much. And thanks for putting this workshop together. I think it's a great idea to have meetings where different crowds can meet and learn their languages and their problems and their theorems. And their theorems. So, my talk is basically going to be about it's going to be an expository talk slash survey. And I'll be using the language that Suavek and Sue and Matt already covered, but I'll go towards the theory of Polish groups and their actions. And their actions, and the equivalence relations induced by such actions. And since this is an expository talk, please do not hesitate to interrupt me anytime you want to ask about something. We have plenty of times, and I don't have very big ambitions during this talk. I'll be basically talking about rather basic stuff. I will include. I will include a couple of proofs, but the proofs will be mostly easy, a couple of lines long. So please do ask any questions that come to your minds during the talk. All right, so let's start. So we'll talk about Polish groups. And a Polish group is simply a topological group whose underlying topological space. Underlying topological space happens to be Polish. So it's a, this means that all the operations, multiplication in the inverse, everything is continuous. There is a metric which makes the group complete and the group is separable. And from a perspective of someone who is not used to these types of groups, you could Of groups, you could think about them as some sort of a far-reaching generalization of Lie groups. Of course, this is a rather far-reaching generalization. It includes groups which are zero-dimensional and are not manifolds themselves at all. But it is also quite a rich theory resembling to some extent the theory of Lie groups. Of course, this. Of Lie groups. Of course, this extent is limited by the fact that the class is much bigger than Lie groups, but there is some structure theory. And I'll talk about the structure a bit at the very beginning of the talk as well. So every Polish group admits a bounded left invariant metric. This is by Kakutani Kakutani, a Birchov Kakutani, as for basically every topological group. Now, such a left-invariant metric might not be the same as the complete metric that we happen to have on the group. And in fact, in many cases, there will be no metric which is both left-indivariant and complete. In some cases, we can have both, but not in general. Not in general. It's actually an interesting class of groups where we can find a metric which is both complete and left invariant. But in the general theory, we will not assume that. But I will be mostly referring to the metric on the group, which is this one, a bounded left-invariant metric. So whenever I mention a metric on a Polish group, it will be the one which is left invariant. So let's see a couple of examples of Polish groups. Well, I'll skip the small ones, like the reals with addition. But the groups we will be mostly interested in today will be groups such as the group of homeomorphisms of a compact metric space. Metric space. So this is a group which is taken with a soup distance. And it is a Polish group whenever X is a compact metric space. It depends what the group might be different depending on what X is. X could be the interval, but X at some point today will be the Hilbert cube. Point today will be the Hilbert cube. Next example, let's suppose we have a Polish metric space. Now, when I say a Polish metric space, I mean by this that it's a Polish space with a fixed metric. So not just a topological group, but a fixed metric space. And then we take the group of all isometries of this space. So much priest of this space. Okay, go ahead. Keep going. On my screen, it says we still have to start recording. Going, sorry. Oh. It's okay now? Everything's good. All right. So we look at the group of isometries of a Polish metric space, which is also a Polish group. Polish group. The metric is the one, the topology is the one by pointwise convergence. So that's another example of a rather, typically a rather big Polish group. One more example is when we take a separable Banach space X and we look at, so this is a Look at so this is a Polish metric space as well. We look at isometries, but we look at those which happen to be linear. So this is the linear isometry group of X, and it's also typically rather big Polish group. And the last example, but probably the closest to the hearts of people working in People working in dynamics is the group of measure-preserving automorphisms of a standard Borel probability space. So, for example, out of mu, where mu is the Lebesgue measure on the unit interval 0, 1. That group is also a topological group. In fact, it can be seen as an example of an isometry group if we If we properly identify measure-preserving automorphisms of the measure space with isometries of the measure algebra. And in the measure algebra, the sets with taking up to measure zero, we take the distance to be the measure of the symmetric difference. That happens to be a Polish metric space, and then this. Polish metric space, and then this induces a metric on the out of mu, but there are also much more concrete ways of making the of inducing the polished topology on this on this loop. Anyways, this is an example we will keep in mind during today's talk. So all these groups are, these four classes of groups are rather large. They happen to be not looking. They happen to be not locally compact, but of course, the class of Polish groups includes lots of locally compact, even compact groups, even finite groups. So the list is not very representative in general, but at least for today's talk, we'll be somehow interested in those examples more than the other. So, just a very, very basic fact to start off. Start off talking about Polish groups. Very general fact. If we have two Polish groups, G and H, they are Polish, and G happens to be a subgroup of H, then G must be closed in H. This is a rather easy fact. Easy fact, and I can give you a two-line proof. Well, maybe more than this is already two lines, and it's not the end of the proof, but a couple of lines long proof. First, recall if you know this already, or and then if not, then I can justify it very briefly. Very briefly. If X and Y, so this goes back to Suavek's talk about polar spaces in general. If X and Y are Polar spaces, not groups, just Polar spaces, and X is a subspace of Y, then X must be G delta subset of X. In the terminology that Swabik was talking about, this is a pi 01. Oh, sorry, pi 02. Yes, that's the typo here. Yes, that's the typo here. Sorry. Which simply means countable intersection of open sets. The reason why this is true is not very deep. It can be deduced from the fact that a theorem by Kuratovsky, I guess, that continuous functions partial. Continuous functions, partial continuous functions on complete metric spaces can be always extended to G-delta sets containing their domain. You just look at the oscillation of the oscillation function and then check where this is zero and it happens to be a G delta set. And then the inclusion, you use this fact for the inclusion of X into Y and then deduce that X must be a G delta subset. Deduce that X must be a G delta subset of Y. And I see, I just spotted another type. Of course, X is a G delta subset in Y, not in X itself. But I guess this is easy to catch. Okay, so there's no groups so far. So now if we have our two groups, G and H, H was the bigger one, G is the smaller one. G is the smaller one. We can always replace H by the closure of G if needed. So we can assume that G is dense in H. And then from this point on, we're done because G is a G dense G delta set in H, but also so is every of its cosets. So we in a Polish space, we can have at most one. have at most one such a I mean disjoint at most one such a density delta set by the by the Berke category theorem so G was a dense G delta set in H every coset is the density delta set in H the the cosets are disjoint so by the Burr category theorem there's only one which means that G is equal to H so G is equal to its closure. Is equal to its closure. And this is the end of this couple of lines proof why a closed, why a Polish subgroup of a Polish group must be closed. So from now on, I'll be talking about Polish subgroups and they will always be closed somehow automatically. All right. So now a Polish group is. Polish group is universal if every other Polish group embeds into it into G as a subgroup, unnecessarily closed. Now, in many classes of groups, universal universal in many classes of objects, not Of objects, not necessary groups, universal objects exist, and it happens to be the case with the class of Polish groups as well. So, this is not a void notion. Universal Polish groups exist. The proof, I think the most natural way to prove it is actually to pinpoint an example. And this might And this might be even historically the first example, but I'm not sure about that. Definitely, this is one of the most well-known examples of a universal Polish group by Uspensky, namely the group of homeomorphisms of the Hilbert cube. That's one of, that was the first example on our list. The Hilbert cube is a compact metric space. Metric space, the group of homeomorphism is a Polish group, and it happens to be a universal one. The proof, I will show you the proof. The proof is actually very nice. It uses one small black box from infinite dimensional topology, but other than that, it's a very natural proof in a way. Away so um so let's see how would one prove uh such a thing um so we want to uh start with a group with a polish group g uh we want to embed it uh into the group of all into the group of homeomorphisms on the hilbert cube so we want to construct an So we want to construct an action of the group on the faithful action on the so embedded into the into homeomorphisms of the Hilbert cube. So we start by looking at the Banach space of all bounded real value functions. Bounded real value functions on G. So G is a rather large object, not necessarily compact, but well, still Polish. And we equip this Banach space with a supnorm. So this is a nice Banach space. Although this is a rather large Banach space, much larger than we would actually want. Larger than we would actually want, um, it's not a separable Banach space, um, and we rather like to stay in the separable realm when talking about Polish groups, but that's not a very big problem because we will just find a separable subspace of this space of bounded real-valued functions, namely. Real-valued functions, namely, we will, so we'll actually embed G into C into this Banach space by taking for every G from the group, the function, which is going to be a bounded real-value function on G, which is computing the distance from various elements from the group. And this is the distance, this is the one, not the complete one, but the. Not the complete one, but the invariant one. So we take these functions, call them fg. Let me see if I can maybe point something on the screen. Right, so this is these are the functions fg. And fg is defined right here. And now these fgs, we can take the We can take the linear, this is linear closure. We take the linear closure of these functions and we get, since G was a separable space, we get a separable Banach space. And I'm going to call this separable Banach subspace of CBX. This is our X. This is our X. Martin, quick question. I may have missed this. You're assuming a bounded metric on G, right? Yes, bounded. Yes, yes. Yes, that's right. Good question. And I will probably use this bounded metric a couple of times more later. But there is always a bounded invariant metric. I mean, once you have an invariant metric, you can do something like there's some standard tricks. You can take the max with one or take. You can take the max with one or take something like d over one plus d. There are ways of turning an invariant metric into a bounded invariant metric, left invariant. Right. And actually, so now G acts on X, on this separable subspace, by isometries, just by Just by shifting the arguments. And it acts by isometries because it's a left invariant metric. So far, we have actually done something interesting because, well, not exactly what we want yet, but we're just one step ahead. We have embedded G, this arbitrary Polish group, into the group of linear. Polish group into the group of linear isometries of X for some separable Banach space X. So, well, at least the class, I mean, we don't know what the separable Banach space is. And actually, we don't want to show that the linear isometries of a separable Banach space are a universal Polish group. We want to aim at the homeomorphism group. But this is already something. It's proving that these linear isometry groups embed. Linear isometry groups in bed that they are, I guess, called final in the class of Polish groups. And now, how to get a compact space out of a separable Banach space? Well, there's a standard trick for doing that. Namely, if we have a separable Banach space, then what would be the compact space? Well, just take the unit ball in the dual space. Ball in the dual space with the weak star topology. So write K for this unit ball, which is compact by Banach Alaoglu. And note that this action by linear isometries on the Banach space X induces an action by homeomorphisms on the unit bowling in the dual space. Unit ball in the dual space. This is a natural transition from linear isometries to homeomorphisms in the dual. Okay, so it seems that we have just embedded the group G into homeomorphism group of some compact space, but it might seem that we have the same problem as before, because we don't know what this before we have some separable Banach space. Uh, separable Banach space. Now we have some compact set. We don't know maybe what this compact set is, but this is exactly where the when where a helpful black box from infinite dimensional topology comes in handy. Namely, it turns out simply that all these unit balls of the duals in infinite dimensional separable Banach spaces, they are all the same. They are simply homeomorphic to the Hilbert Q. Simply homeomorphic to the Hilbert cube. It's probably, I must say that I haven't seen the proof of this theorem, but I can imagine that there is a characterization of the Hilbert cube, a topological characterization, which is useful in showing that some space is homeomorphic to the Hilbert cube. And then the unit. The unit ball and the dual simply satisfies this characterization. And so we are done. This is the end of the proof. So we took our group. We first took the space of bounded real-valued functions. We took a separable subspace. We acted by the group on this Banach space, which induced an action on the dual ball, and then the action on the dual ball simply happens to be the Then the dual ball simply happens to be the Hillibird cube. End of proof. All right, so the corollary is that there exists at least one universal Polish group. Now, in many cases, once we have one universal object, these universal objects are all the same. But it's not the case with But it's not the case with Polish groups. There are actually many other examples of universal Polish groups, and there are perwise non-isomorphic ones. So there can be another universal Polish group, which is not isomorphic, is a topological group, to this group of homeomorphism of the Hilbert group. And I won't give you other examples because I'm mostly interested in this one today. mostly interested in this one today um but there is also uh a nice a nice example of uh isometries of of the so-called horizon space which is also universal polar group and i i think there are also other examples um okay but then uh so we uh so there are many examples um maybe maybe these all these Maybe all these big groups happen to be universal polar groups. So I gave you four examples at the beginning. I guess in many of these classes, you can find universal polish groups. However, and this is probably interesting from the point of view of dynamics, that the group of automatic Dynamics: that the group of automorphisms of the measure out of μ is actually not a universal Polish group. It's not the only one. There are also other examples of Polish groups which are not universal, but this is the only one that we will be talking about today. Now, the reason for that That this is not a universal Polish group. I'm not sure if I know a very, very easy reason why this is the case, but there is a notion of exotic group. I'm not sure if this is a proper picture for the picture for the for the for the exotic probably a tropical island is is not uh maybe not for everybody uh associated with exotic things but at least when i whenever i think about exotic groups i i think about tropical islands um so a group uh is exotic if it does not have any non-trivial unitary representations. So what does it mean? It means that it's It means that it's probably not locally compact, because locally compact groups have plenty of unitary representations. And this property is actually not even saying that the group has few unitary representations, that they don't separate points. It just says that the only unitary representation of the group is the trivial one. Of the group is the trivial one. The only way you can embed it into the unitary group of the Hilbert space is by the trivial map. Well, I probably should mention that the exotic group should be non-trivial because the trivial group is not very exotic. But the point is that such non-trivial exotic groups exist. And this is uh and this is uh this was proved by uh heron heron christensen um they actually constructed uh they actually they didn't construct the group they they proved that certain groups well-known groups uh the so-called uh l0 groups uh happen to be exotic but the the examples they have uh they Examples they have, they are Polish groups. So there exist exotic, non-trivial Polish groups. And then this means that we cannot have that neither out of mu nor the unitary group whose and out of mu is a subgroup of the unitary group via the Koopman representation. Via the Kupman representation cannot be universal because every of its subgroups is a subgroup of the unitary group itself, so cannot be exotic. So you cannot possibly embed any exotic group, the L1, for example, sorry, L0, the Hever-Christensen group, into out of mu or U of H. Of age. All right, so this is this is the very shortened story of Polish groups. Can you say what you said these are L0 groups? I mean L0 taking value into into what L zero. What does it mean L zero? Yeah. This is the convergence in a measure, so called. Measure, the so-called. I think this is for certain measures constructed by Herr and Christensen. Okay, thank you. Yes, I'll have to double check, but I think that they construct certain measures or maybe sub-measures. Um, so so what you're saying is that um universal groups um need to be exotic, yes. Um, so these well, they might have um they cannot be subgroups of um uh of the unitary group. I mean, you can you can possibly, I mean, you you can you can have I mean you you you can you can have you can squeeze something in there but um oh okay so what you're saying is that like the the Goopman representation is too big and universal groups might have smaller non-trivial representations but not as big as the Um, not as big as the Koopman representation. Yes, you cannot embed, you can, they cannot be a sub, they cannot be subgroups of the unitary group. You can possibly have some representation which is trivial on some big chunk of the group, but you cannot embed them into simply embed them into the unitary group. I see, thank you. All right, any other questions? Other questions? Okay, so let's so if not then let's let's pass to discussing actions of Polish groups. And we will be interested in either continuous actions on Polish spaces or even from the point of view of View of complexity theory, even Borel actions on standard Borel spaces. So I'll use this term for a Polish group G. I'll say that I'll call a Pope Borel G space a standard Borel space with a Borel action of G by Borel automorphism. And again, as in the case of Polish groups, we can fixing a group G, we can try to think about universal objects. So we can we call a Borel G space universal if for every If for every other Borel G space, so this one is universal. If for any other Borel G space, but with the same group on another space Y, we can embed Y into X via G invariant embedding, Borel embedding. These are just borel embedding embedding. Borel embedding. These are just borel spaces. So this will be useful later on when we'll talk about Borel complexity and maximal objects in the hierarchy of Borel equivalence relations. But well, this makes sense, even just by thinking about Borel G spaces. The important thing here is. Spaces. The important thing here is that the embedding should actually be G-invariant. So it's not just, if you recall the definition of Borel reduction, this is actually stronger than a Borel reduction because we fix a group and we want the function to be gene variant. We want that if two points are a pair of points is mapped one to the other by an element of the group. By an element of the group gamma, then the same happens on the images. Do you want a gen an H in that definition? Sorry? There is no H. The same G. Okay. Yes, that's exactly the point. So it's always the same G. So from now on, at least for this middle part of the talk, we fix a group G. Well, that's not even true, but I will talk about another. True, but I will talk about another group page in a couple of minutes. But for the next couple of slides, let's fix the group G. And we actually only talk about G spaces. There is no other group for a couple of minutes. And then the theorem that I'll try to explain is that again. Is that again there exists for every Polish group G, there exists a universal Borel G space? And now this is again parametrized by the G. When we change the G, then we'll get a different Borel G space. And here the proof is slightly more abstract than Abstract than the previous one, because we actually, well, the construction is nice and short, at least in the version I'll show you, but it's not exhibiting something very, very natural in a way that the group of homeomorphisms of the Hilbert cube was a natural. So let's try to see how one can prove such. See how one can prove such a thing. And the proof is a couple of lines. And I don't know if this is the most natural one. Maybe there are in some cases, for some groups, there are certainly more natural proofs. For a general group, For a general group G, a fixed general group G, we consider the so-called F-Ross Borel space, which is the F of G. And we take the collection, the set of all closed subsets of G, not subgroups, but just subsets. But just substance. And this set happens to carry a standard Borel space, a standard Borel structure, which is called the FRAS Borel structure or Efras Borel space. I won't define it, but maybe let me say that in case G is compact, then this F of G for compact. F of G for compact set for a compact group, this is just a space of all compact subsets of G and there are very natural. Uh this is very well known. This is so-called the Viatori space. There is a nice metric, the Hausdorff metric between compact subsets of G. Very nice and well understood object for groups which are not necessarily compact. very compact um the this is a slightly more subtle uh to uh to in to to introduce this borel structure but actually this is done by by passing to some compactification and using the uh the houser distance from the compactification but i won't uh actually uh explain that into too much detail uh we'll just and this is not even the the most important there is a uh there is such a set and it happens to be a nice uh Happens to be a nice standard Borel space. And on this set, F of G, we have a natural action. So G acts on the space of all its subsets, in particular closed subsets, by left multiplication. We take a subset, we multiply it by the element of the group. Element of the group from the left, and we get another subset. If the set we started with was closed, then we get a closed set again. So we just move shift subsets around in the group. All right, so this looks very nice, very promising. And I would love to say that this is the And I would love to say that this is the universal Borel G space, but we'll have to be slightly more careful. In some cases of groups, this is the one, but in general, it's not so easy to it's not as easy as this, but a tiny bit more complicated. And the tiny bit of complication is that we have to take the countable power. Complication is that we have to take the countable power of it. So now, and this is the end. This is it. So now consider the countable power. In other words, the set of all sequences of closed subsets of the group. And as a countable power of a standard Borel space, it carries a natural standard Borel structure and it also has a natural action on it, which is the Natural action on it, which is the coordinate-wise action. We take a sequence of closed sets and just shift them, shift the first one, shift the second one, shift the third one, and so on. And we get the sequence of shifted sets, which is what we get by the action. So, in a way, this is not very complicated as a mathematical object. And this is The A universal G space. They might be actually unique, but I don't want to get into this discussion. But let's just show that this actually happens to be a universal G space. Okay, so how do we do that? So it took us a couple of minutes to define what this object is. And now we have to check that this is actually That this is actually universal. So let's recall what we need to show. We need to take an arbitrary Borel G space X. So X is some standard Borel space on which G happens to be acting. And we want to embed X into into into this one into f of g to the power n in a g invariant way so we want to take a point in x and assign to it a sequence of closed sets in such a way that this assignment is one-to-one borel and gene variant and i'm going to And I'm going to here, I'm going to make a slight simplification. In general, the proof is a bit more complicated, but if we allow ourselves for a quite harmless assumption, then it simplifies a bit. So I'm actually going to assume that on this Borel G space here, G acts by homeomorphisms. So it's not actually a Borel space, it's actually a Actually, a Borel space, it's actually a and and um and x is a zero-dimensional polar space. So, x actually has a fixed topology which is also zero-dimensional, and the action is by homeomorphisms. It's not a great loss of generality. It is somewhat a loss of generality, but Of generality, but the proof is very similar to the general one, but much simpler to state. All right, so now we want to find this gene variant map. So we fix the basis of topology on X, U N. So these are basic open sets, which actually happen to be clopped, because we assume. Clopen sense because we assumed we allow ourselves to assume that X is zero-dimensional, so we fix a Kloppen basis for X. And now we want to construct this embedding from our zero-dimensional space into the set of sequences of closed sets. So, what do we want to do? We want to fix a point in the space X. In the space X and assign some subsets of the group, sequence of subsets of group. And this is what we do. So for each X in the space on which the group is acting, and for each number N, we look at the set of elements of the group which have Elements of the group which happen to move X into Un. So if UNs are closed, then these sets are actually closed. And these are subsets of the group, closed subset of the group. And then we take the inverse for some technical reason, but the inverse of a closed subset is a closed set again. inverse of a closed subset is a closed set again and this is it this is the this is the reduction uh so we define f by taking f0 of x f1 of x and so on and now it's a completely routine routine thing to check that this actually works um i um well it is an index well that this works means that this is an injection and this is a gene variant map And this is a gene variant map. Everything that we can imagine here is can only be Borel. So this one is also going to be Borel. It is injective. That's very easy. I'm not going to spend any time on that. This is an injection. The fact that it's gene variant is a very simple computation. And we can. computation and we can we can even do it on on one slide so we we need to we need we need to check that if we if we look at the end position of what we have assigned to x and multiply it by g, then we get what we have assigned at the end position when we multiply x by g. And taking the inverses, so taking inverse to both sides, we get this. So g gets instead of here, here, and then we lose the inverses. And this is a tautology because if I have an age which moves x to un, I multiply it by g inverse, then such an age becomes the old age g inverse, and then g inverse cancels out with g. Cancels out with g and then it works. It's a computation that is one of these tautological ones that it's best to do yourselves. But this is all that remains to prove in, to remains to be checked in this proof. And this is the end of this rather short proof. But as I said, it was under some assumption that the It was under some assumption that the Borel G space is actually a Polish space and is zero-dimensional. In general, a slightly more advanced technology is needed, but the same idea basically works. So what we have just proved? We have proved that universal G spaces exist. For every group G, there exists a universal Borel G space. Okay, so and now what Marl was asking: what if we change the group? So now we change the group. And it's the last portion of the discussion of the structure of these actions. The following question. The following question can be asked. Suppose we have two groups now, G and H. And H is the bigger one. So G is a Polish subgroup of H. And suppose that we have a Borel space, we have an action of G on a space X. So G is action. On a space X. So G is acting somewhere on a space, but G happens to be a subgroup of a larger group. Can we extend the action of G to an action of H? And as stated, this is a very general question. It is interesting even for groups which are not necessarily Polish finite groups, the finite sets, actions of Finite sets, actions of finite groups of finite on finite sets. This is already non-trivial and very interesting. Well, in this way, if the question is stated in this way, then the answer is rather no, because you can typically not extend, well, it depends what we mean by extend. Extend to the whole, to the same space? Same space, or maybe extend to some extended space. Extend to the same space, typically not. But extend to a bigger space, yes. And this is something which is called the Mackie-Hure theorem or the Machi theorem. Jorth had an important input in this version with the polar space, and I'll mention that in a couple of slides. So the Machi-Hjor theorem is this kind of extension theorem. And it says simply that if we are in this situation where we have two groups, the small one G. The small one G and the big one H, and we happen to act with the small one on some space G, and this is a Borel G space, then there is an extension. And by extension, it's a very special extension. I mean, it's an extension with an extra properties. It's an extension, meaning that there is a larger space Y. Space Y, so there on which G is acting, largely meaning that X is a subset of Y. So we can extend the space on which we're acting, but everything is extended in a borel way. It's actually an extension, so these actions agree. But also, the third property, so I'll probably call this one, two, three, the third. The third property, which at this point might seem artificial, but will actually need it later on, is that when we look at g orbits and h orbits, then every H orbit contains exactly one G orbit. So these orbits of the bigger group do not glue together orbits of the smaller group. Of course, if I look at the Group, of course, if I look at the orbit of the big group, then it contains some orbit of the small group, namely, um, sorry, contained in X, of course, contained in X. Well, it contains many orbits, but most of them will not be contained in X. But if you look at those which are contained in the smaller space, then there will be exactly one. Is there any? Is there any question? Okay, if not, then let me try to say a couple of words about this proof. Sorry, I didn't hear the question. G is a subgroup of H, right? You mean the two actions agree on X, right? Is that what you mean to say? Yes, yes, of course. Yes, thank you. They should agree on the same. Yes, of course. And this should be age. And this should be age. Thank you very much. Yes, yes. So this means this is what an extension is. All right, so let's start. Let's try to see this proof. It's not a complicated proof in a way. The proof takes a couple of lines, but it's. But it's a funny proof. It actually has some very nice idea, which, even in the case where everything is finite, is very interesting. And it happens to be that the same proof modulus verification that everything works. Verification that everything works, the same proof happens to work in the Borel setting. So let's see. So we have our small space X and a small group G. So G acts on X. And I will assume for simplicity that, again, the action is by homeomorphisms and the space is Polish. space is polish um and the how how on earth can we extend it to an action of h how can we possibly find a way of multiplying objects by element of the big group h well the solution is actually very easy and just multiply the whole set by h itself and And the second coordinate, and then you can do whatever you want with multiplying by age. You're going to multiply by the second coordinate. And this is basically the proof. But stated like this, it doesn't work. And there is something to be done to make it actually work. So we take our small set X and multiply it simply by the group H. But we have to remember about the. But we have to remember about the group action that we started with. And actually, we will consider somehow an extended action of G on this bigger space. We already had an action of G on X. And there is a natural action of G on H by multiplication because G is a subgroup of H. So we can multiply, we can act by G on such a pair by just multiplying on both. By just multiplying on both coordinates. And this is well defined. And it happens to be that if we take the quotient, so divide by this action, then we get a Polish space. And then for the Polish space X in general, we get a standard Borel space. And this is our Y. This is exactly the space that we want. And from here, everything is really very simple to state because in this bigger space, we divide, we glued some things together. So, I'll just use this notation. I think it's a common notation for this Machi construction. It's a common notation for this Machi construction. For xh, we use this these brackets to denote its class and its image and the quotient. And then what did we need to do? We needed to have an extension. So, first of all, we need to embed the old space into this new one. Into this new one. The embedding is very simple to state. We just put, we map X to the class of XE, whatever this means. But I'll try to make a picture in a couple of minutes, but this is well, this is the only natural embedding. And then we need to also define the action. We need to act. We need to act by H on this big space Y. And the action here just happens to be the action on the second coordinate. It doesn't move the first, well, the things to be checked that this is well defined and so on, but it's the right action on age. And this is all. This is what makes this proof work. Now, I was thinking how to. How to present this proof. It's not an easy proof to explain even in person, let alone on Zoom. And when one sees this for the first time, this is a bit difficult to understand, but I think the following picture might be helpful. I think the following picture might be helpful because this theorem is even interesting in the case in the very easy case. Well, maybe let me before I explain this, maybe let me say that everything here, that this is an extension and that X is a Borel subset of Y. This is very easy. And the crucial third property of the uniqueness of the orbits, it's just that the orbit of XH. Of xh contains the unique orbit contained in the old space, namely that of xe. But one can verify this without too much trouble. I wanted to make the picture, somehow the picture which makes this proof, which shows you what's happening in this proof in a very simple case. If x is really simple, well, if x is one. Well, if X is one point space, then this is maybe too simple because the proof is not that interesting. But if X has two points, if X has two points, these are the points, the red dots. And let's say that our small group is also very, very, very, very simple group. It's actually Z over 2Z. Okay, so two of them. Okay, so two element point space, two element group, and you can imagine what it does. It just exchanges these two points. So a perfectly well-defined action. It's not very representative because it's actually transitive action. So there is only one orbit. And now we have some large group H, which contains this two-element group. This two-element group could be even finite, it could be some even-order group H. So, how does this extension work? This extension is actually in this case easy to visualize because we take just y, our space, we took our x multiplied by h. So this is we just take two copies of h. Take two copies of H, two disjoint copies of H. And we could think about this space before taking the quotient and trying to act by H on this space simply by acting on each of these lines separately. So these two lines are copies of H. On each of them, H acts by multiplication. On the left one and on the right one, we have two copies of H. We have two copies of H, H acting on both of them. And this is a very well-defined action of H, except that it has nothing to do with the old action. The old action was actually exchanging these points. And in H, we still have the involution. So the problem is that if we, let me change the color, if we start, uh-huh, it doesn't work the way I want it. It doesn't work the way I want it. Sorry. Okay, so if we are here and we do the involution, then we may end up here. The image of the second element group in H. But on the other hand, we want it to end up here at this point. So these two points, which are making the thick dots around, should be the same. Should be the same. So, what did Mackey and Fjorth do? Well, they just say, Let's glue these points together. And this is exactly what's happening in the proof. We just glue these points together, and we have a bunch of these glued points, these pairs which are glued together, and this is the quotient. And then the points in the quotient are these. Are these slanted pairs of points? And the action of H on this space is just by moving them up and down. And this is the construction. This is what's happening in the proof. And then there are things to check to actually make it the Borel space that this quotient is actually Borel. This is also a non-trivial part, which I skipped, but basically, this is what this. But basically, this is what the proof is doing. And in general, the picture is just representing a case where the action on X was transitive. There was one orbit only. In general, we might have many orbits. And basically, each orbit will look like this picture here: like this, there might be not two lines, but it might be many lines. Not two lines, but it might be many lines, and then there will be some glued, some families glued together, and we'll just move them up and down using the big group. So, this is a very general idea. I'm not sure if this is the best way of seeing this, of understanding this proof. This is at least one that I like to keep in mind. But let's maybe pass to To pass this proof and start the discussion, which is mostly most connected to Borel complexity. So if the proof was somehow looked strange, then don't worry about it. Looked strange, then don't worry because I'm not going to use that particular proof too much, but I will use the theorem in a couple of minutes. Okay, so let's start talking about orbit equivalence relations. So in this talk, by an orbit equivalence relation, I'll just mean an equivalence relation induced by orbits of an action of a Polish group on a standard Borel space. It seems that this is the most. Is the this is the most uh maybe um especially for people in dynamical systems. This might be the most general uh type of equivalence relations that one can ever want to consider. There are more general classes, but this is already quite a big class of actions of Polish groups. So we orbits of such an action. Of such an action are the equivalence classes of the equivalence ratio. So we have a space, we act on it by some Polish group, might be one of these large groups, and then the orbits of this action are the equivalence classes. And every such orbit equivalence ratio is analytic. This is a routine thing to check. I'm actually not. Thing to check. I'm actually not going to use this fact too much, but Swavek discussed analytic sense, and this is an example of analytic equivalence relation. This is a very special type, in some way special type of analytic equivalence relation. And then for us today, the interesting, so we talked about universal objects in some other contexts. Contexts. And now I'll make a connection to the theory of Borel reducibility of equivalence relations. So we'll say that an orbit equivalence relation is complete or maximal. I'll maybe make a comment on the terminology in a minute. If every orbit equivalence relation can be Borel reduced to this single one. um so um um it's it simply means that it's maximal in the uh with respect to this borel reducibility uh pre-order um i like the the word complete because this is exactly what people mean when they talk about complete uh np complete problems in computational complexity um this is this has some this word has some uh This word has some meaning, which is exactly the same meaning, actually, in computational complexity. And then also complete sets, sigma 1, 1 complete sets, pi 1, 1 complete sets. This is also in the same spirit. There is some reduction to the object, which is supposed to be complete. All right. So again, the good news is that. Good news is that complete orbit equivalence relations exist. And we can just deduce it for free from what we just saw. And the reason is, so there are many ways of justifying this fact. There is somehow the abstract way and the non-abstract way. It's in descriptive set theory. Descriptive set theory, this two way of justifying the existence of complete objects comes very often. There is an abstract way of showing that sigma one one complete sets exists, and then there are concrete or concrete sets which happen to be sigma one one complete. And somehow these two types of arguments have nothing to do with each other. Do with each other. Well, they are similar in the way that they're proving that objects are complete, but somehow they show a rather different side of the same story. So we'll first see the abstract side of the story. And the abstract side of the story is just that we have already seen that there exists a universal polish group G. We even saw what it is. Well, we saw that. It is the well, we saw that the group of homeomorphisms of the Hilbert cube is a universal polish group, so this is actually a very concrete group, and also for such a universal Polish group, there exists a universal G space. And now, I didn't explain maybe too well why in the Mackie-Horth extension, aha, sorry, before that, maybe let me say. So, this already implies that if we look at all orbit equivalence relations induced by Induced by this universal Polish group G, then among those with respect to Borel reducibility, there is a maximal one. And in fact, it holds for every Polish group G. But now we want to consider coincidence induced by different groups. And it turns out that the universal one for the universal group is going to be complete and it's going to work for all polar. And it's going to work for all Polish groups. And this is exactly happening because of the Mackie-Horth extension theorem and exactly by the third point, which seems so weird. But the reason why we want it is that if we have some equivalence relation induced by some group G acting on X, and we have this universal one, homeu. home u of 0 1 to the power n acting on on its universal space y then first we would like to extend this one to an action of first of all g can be embedded into the homeo of uh into the universal polar group so we we can extend it to an action of of the homeo uh of zero one to the power n on some n on some x prime and this extension is actually a borel reduction here it is a borel reduction because of this third point and then from the universality there is a there is a reduction here so this just follows from putting the puzzles together and and using the extension theorem but i want don't want to say too much about this um uh except that it it tells us that such That it tells us that such an object exists, complete universal, complete orbital construction. Now, from the point of view of people doing dynamical systems, this might not be so natural because this is an action on some on sequence of on sequences of closed subsets of the group of homeomorphisms of the Hilbert cube. But actually, we'll see very soon that. But actually, we'll see very soon that there are much more natural examples. And this is exactly what I want to talk about in the last maybe 15 minutes. So there are naturally occurring complete orbit equalance relations. And these are actually very close, well, somewhat close to hopefully to the hearts of people doing dynamics. Dynamics. So, first, let's recall that K of the Hilbert cube will denote the space of all compact subsets of the Hilbert cube. So, this is the hyperspace of the Hilbert cube, which has the natural Viatorist topology, the Hausdorff metric on it. And then every compact metric space embeds into this particular one, into K of the Hilbert cube. This is another universality result that compact spaces, compact metric spaces can be embedded into the Hilbert cube. And then we can consider the homeomorphism relation on this space. So we look at the space of all compact subsets of the Hilbert curve. Of all compact subsets of the Hilbert cube. And then we put them to be equivalent if they happen to be homeomorphic. This is an equivalence relation, it's an analytic equivalence relation. And it happens to be an orbit equivalence relation. I'll justify this maybe in a couple of words, because when you hear this, it doesn't sound like orbit one relation right away. It is homeomorphism relation, so it means. Homeomorphism relation. So it means that there is some homeomorphism, but where is the group? For an orbit equanimous relation, you want to have one fixed group acting on your space and the homeomorphism relation just says that there is some partial homeomorphism between these objects. There's a way of fixing that. And that's exactly what I have here on the slide. It's done by It's done by considering the so-called Z sets. And I won't recall you the actual definition of a Z set, but these are some rather small subsets of the Hilbert cube, which happen to have the following property, that whenever we have a homeomorphism between such two Z sets, so whenever there is a homeomorphism from one Z set K1 to another Z set. To another Z set K2. These are both embedded into the Hilbert cube. Then there is an action, then you can extend this homeomorphism actually to an auto-homeomorphism of the whole Hilbert cube. So in particular, whenever two, sorry, let me not skip. Whenever two such elements are equivalent, then there is a homeomorphism of the Hilbert. That there is a homeomorphism of the Hilbert cube, which witnesses the equivalence. And this is what sounds at least more like a group action. And to make this more precise, one can naturally decompose the Hilbert cube into two copies of itself. This is done very easily. And we can consider just the compact subsets of the first. The compact subsets of the first coordinate. By the first coordinate, I mean that we write the Hilbert cube as a product of two of its copies, and then we fix the point. I guess the sequence of zeros would be enough. And then by subsets of the first coordinates, we mean the subsets which have all these zeros on the second coordinate. And then we can identify the space of all compact subsets of this. All compact subsets of the Hilbert cube with those which are just contained in this first coordinate. And these happen to be all Z sets. So we have embedded the space of all compact subsets of the Hilbert cube into Z subsets of a larger Hilbert cube. And this implies that if we That if we look at the homeomorphism relation on the compact subsets of the Hilbert cube, then using this property of Z sets, this is actually induced by an action of the group of homeomorphisms of this larger copy of the Hilbert cube, namely the full product. So, in other words, we have the group, which is the group of homeomorphisms of the Hilbert cube. The full one acting only on those compact subsets which are which are contained in this first copy. And this space of compact subspace of compact subsets of the Hilbert group contains a representative of all possible compact sets. And the equivalence relation of homeomorphism of homeomorphism is actually induced by the action of the group of homeomorphisms of the group. Of the homeomorphisms of the big cube. So, this is an orbit equivalent relation. Before I tell you why this is a complete one and it is going to be a complete one, let me mention one more type of object, namely Shocker simplices. And I hope this is also quite close to the hearts of people. To the hearts of people doing dynamics because they actually come, do appear naturally associated to dynamical systems. But just to recall, a Schoker simplex is a convex compact set of some locally convex space, but we can think about the Hilbert cube, for instance. Which happens to be, it's not just an arbitrary convex compact set, it is a compact set which looks like the tetrahedron, namely, that every point can be represented as a barycenter, as a convex combination of extreme points in a unique way. So, in a tetrahedron, every point can be represented as a combination of Of the four vertices is only one way, which is not the case, for instance, in the square, which is also a convex compact set. In the square, we can represent the middle as the convex combination of two opposite vertices, but also another pair of two opposite vertices can be used. So vertex, so square would not be a shocker simplex, but the triangle. Shocker simplex, but the triangle would be. And in fact, there is a theorem which is saying that all of these, I'm only going to talk about metrizable Schocher simplices, every Schocher simplex can be represented as a inverse limit in some way of these finite dimensional simplicities. I think in finite dimensions, we don't talk about Schocher simplicities. Dimensions, we don't talk about Shoka simplicities, just simplicity. So, triangle, so we start with an interval, triangle, tetrahedron, and then in higher dimensions we can we can find the simplices and then construct some sort of inverse limit, and it's always going to be a shocker simplex. And every shocker simplex is one of these. So, um, among those shocker simplices, I'm going a lot of them to I'm going a lot about today about universal objects. There is this very somehow surprising Shocker simplex, which for people who see this for the first time seem to not even as something that shouldn't have the right to exist, but it does exist. The so-called poll. The so-called Paulson simplex. So, a Paulson simplex is a very strange kind of Schoker simplex. It's one whose set of extreme points is densenate. Now, this is as far as possible from our intuition of finite-dimensional simplices. I mean, in a triangle, we have three points. There are rather not dense in the whole triangle. And it turns out that And it turns out that if we take the inverse limit of finite dimensional simplicities in a careful way, then we can actually get that at the very end, the extreme points which we keep adding in the inverse limit actually happen to be dense in every possible open set of the inverse limit. But this is maybe how it's one of the reasons why it should exist. One of the reasons why it should exist. Um, it's actually not only existent, but it's unique. There is a unique Shokai simplex like this. And as I said, this is an object close to the hearts of people in dynamics because it is actually the simplex of invariant measures on the full shift. If we take the full shift, all sequences of zeros and ones. Of zeros and ones, the counter set, and then we look at all possible invariant Borel probability measures on this system. Then it's always the case that the set of all invariant probability measures in a topological system is a convex, compact set. It's always going to be a simplex. But for the full shift, it's actually this weird Paulson simplex. uh pulsing simplex um now why did i why did i talk about the pulse and simplex uh because this is the uh not only um uh it's not only only unique but it's actually going to to serve as the uh serve the role of the Hilbert cube so every possible shocker simplex can be finally embedded into this Paulson simplex as a phase a phase A phase of a simplex is a convex set which has the property that whenever we have two points whose convex combination happen to be in the non-trivial convex combination happen to be in the convex in the phase, then they actually must lie in the phase. But this is generalization of what we have in the finite dimensional case. And then the so this similar is in the for the case of the shock Hilbert cube. This allows us to take the space of all proper closed faces of the Paulson simplex as the space of representatives of all possible Schocher simplices, metrizable Schocher simplices. So we're just copying the same picture from the Hilbert cube, closed subsets of the Hilbert cube, but actually those which were contained in the first coordinate. And here we're talking all possible proper phase. Proper faces, so small in a way, subsets which happen to be showcased simplices in this universal guy in the Paulson simplex. And then on this, we consider the relation of a fine homeomorphism. And again, this is going to be this is an equivalence relation. And let me just say why this is a, in one word, why this is an orbit equivalent basically for the same reason. Basically, for the same reason as we had it in the Hilbert cube, that there is the we can the group that's acting previously was the group of homeomorphisms of the Hilbert cube. Now we have, so home automorphisms of the big object. Now the big object is the Paulson simplex, and we take the group of all affine homeomorphisms of the Paul simplex, and it acts on the Simplex and it acts on the faces. And this is why it's and then there's this fact that I just showed is the reason it's the extension theorem, which was the extension theorem for Z sets. Now it's extension theorem for faces. And a homeomorphism, a fine homeomorphism between proper faces can be extended to a global one. And this is why the relation is actually an orbit. Is actually an orbit equal instration. So we have two examples of orbit equal insurrections that we defined and said why they are orbit equal in the homeomorphism of compact sets and the fine homeomorphism of Schoches simply. And these happen to be actually orbit equal to complete orbit equivalence relations. So this first, it actually comes the shocker simply sees come. comes the the shocker simplicities come uh uh come first because the um and i won't tell you anything about the the proof um uh but it happens to be a complete orbit one association but instead of justifying this i can offer uh to show you some elegant applications of of this and among those applications um maybe i won't have time for all of them and some of them i'll put into the them and some of them I'll put into the I'll maybe mention in the question session later today but at least one very elegant application of this is the justification why the homeomorphism of compact spaces, the first equivalence relation that we considered, is also a complete orbit equivalence relation. And this is a very, very nice argument. Very nice argument, very nice theorem as well, due to Joe Zelinsky, who proved exactly this: that homeomorphism of compact matrix spaces is a complete orbit equivalence relation. And the proof is, I think I have two minutes, but the proof, at least the part that I want to show you, can be presented, it's so elegant that it can be presented in two minutes exactly. So for the proof. For the proof of the fact that homeomorphism of compact spaces is a complete orbit equivalent relation, all one needs to do is to reduce something to it when the something we know is already completely complete orbitalization. And this something happens to be the affine homeomorphism of Shock simplicities. Showcase simplicies. And the reduction, this is basically the it's not the whole proof, but but this is the most elegant part of the reduction. So for the reduction of a fine homeomorphism of Schochet simplices to homeomorphism of compact spaces, we need to take a Schochet simplex with its affine structure and everything and And everything, and assign to it a compact space, just naked compact space without any structure. And this is what the function zeta is doing. It takes a partly, it takes a Schocher simplex C, which is right here, and assigns to it something which is almost a compact metric space. It's not exactly, but I will comment on that. Comment on it in a minute. It assigns a compact space, which is the same space as a topological space together with a set of triples, x, y, z. And the triples are exactly those triples for which z is the middle of the interval between x and y. So c is actually a convex set. So we can talk about. Actually, a convex set, so we can talk about these convex combinations. And this zeta is taking a convex compact set, a showcase simplex, and assigning an object which is not exactly a compact space, but almost. It's a compact space K, together with a relation R, where R is a closed ternary relation. And let me just say that. And let me just say that so on these on these pairs, compact set with a ternary closed relation, compact set with a closed ternary relation, we can consider the equivalence relation of homeomorphism of a special kind, which actually maps the relation to the relation. So it's kind of a homeomorphism of structures with a closed terinary relation. Relation. And it is very easy to verify that two Schauke simplicities, C1 and C2, are a finely homeomorphic if and only if these assigned compact spaces with the ternary relations are equivalent in this sense. This is basically saying that the homeomorphism preserves the middles of the intervals, but then it must preserve the 1/4 and the 3. One-fourth and the three-thirds three-fourths, and so on, and the dyadic interrationals, and then you've got all rationals, and then you get all real numbers from the interval 0, 1. And this is not the end. Let me just say, without any proof, that, well, one still has to show that this relation of homeomorphism, keeping the close relations, is actually reducible to just pure homeomorphism. Homeomorphism, and there is an argument needed for that. There exists a Borel reduction of this homeomorphism, keeping the terror relations to just homeomorphism of compact spaces. One takes such a compact space with the ternary relation and just builds around the bigger compact space without any ternary relation, but just somehow remembering the ternary relation. Relation. And then composing such a reduction with zeta gives a reduction of a fine homeomorphism of Schochie simplices to the homeomorphism of compact metric spaces. And I'm basically out of time. I think maybe it's a good idea to stop here. And I have one more example in the spirit of dynamical systems. In the spirit of dynamical systems, namely topological conjugacy of dynamical systems, but it comes with a question. So maybe I will just stop here and I'll pose it as a question together with a question in the question period. So let me stop here and thank you all for your attention. Does anyone have any questions? Anyone online have any questions? Martin, I'm about to email you asking to upload your slides. Maybe if you do that before the product session starts, maybe people. Ah, that, yeah, absolutely. Do I just email you the slides or do I upload it somehow online? Upload it somehow, and I'm going to email you right now. Okay, sounds perfect. Okay, so you'll see also the other part, but I can mention this in the question period. I have a stupid question, the only time I have it. Can you give an example of a Polish group that is not a universal? Not a universal polish group by whose maximal action is the same as the maximal action of the universal polish group? This is a fantastic question. And this is exactly what I was about to ask in the question session. I do not know. And it's an open question is open. I don't know if a group which is not universal can possibly. Which is not universal can possibly induce a maximal orbital concentration. I suspect that it can be the case, and I will state my suspicion more precisely in the question session, but this is a pure suspicion. I don't have any real reason. Conjecture a particular example, but I'll let you talk about those. Yes, but I didn't know if there were any of them, though. No, no, nothing is. No, no, nothing is known. Of course, it could be that there is another conjecture which I'm not which I'm not convinced of, but a complementary conjecture could say that if a group can induce a maximal or apitic transformation, then the group must be universal. It sounds perfectly reasonable. It sounds perfectly reasonable, but again, there is no there is absolutely no way I can imagine this can be proved. And my suspicion is that it's just too nice to be true. But I don't know, really. Thank you. It's still open about whether the unitary group can induce a universal orbit equivalence related. It is wide open. It is wide open. It is wide open. That's certainly a candidate since it's not a universal group. Yes, yes. Any other questions? All right, let's thank March to begin. We have a coffee break. We'll resume at 3.30. Can you turn the sound on? Yeah.
