What I would think is that people uses this pregnancy. And this is a question very philosophical, and depending on what questions have a response to distinct, the person that says that the privacy is working, but I'm entering the privacy management that I've said. In that I ability to control the access, which other people have personal control here. Because if you have the privilege in general, and the rationales because data are comparable. That is how the menu is platinum, which one of the water has compared to it. And there is We have data. And we use discovery, and we are in the COVID: the reason for the things in discovery, is because they are very much collaborated. And here, the products of technology products that we are in this day, to be brought, and what we are doing all the time, using data so that maps, there are maps, whatever. What do you want to algorithm to have all these automatic problems that are comparable in different platforms in the Internet? No, it's basically for the users who have access to that data. If I put a vote on Facebook, that is not the veg, if they're Instagram, these companies are portrayed, the structure of our clarity structure, the processes of galaxies, not very. Europe has the memories, but include Europe are difficult to see that function. So, all this problem very difficult to have. As you can see, this information with the restrictions that we have. There are two forms in which I consider privacy in general, one is the protection in transit original. Transito, or we see the right of 50, it can say, no, and what we are demonstrating here, and I want to say for the Internet, not that you can see what this is. If you have credit that the banks who are protection, a vece compared to it, I want to make a model statistical model, I think. Because this is here. There are two things. One of the many protection in transit is very interesting, and I don't know much about respect, but they are very interesting from computation that is cryptography. Decomputation that is cryptography. Cryptography is essentially transformative data in a cadena of numerous electoral cases. That is what they are the major part of what powers the cryptography, and also elliptical functions. Elliptic functions would be lattices. There are very interesting things there. Problems recently in this area is how manipulated all encrypted manipulations, how you can internal non-related encrypted, how we can internal algorithms of clustering encrypted algorithms. All these basically will be all the theory of statistical model models, but encrypted. It's very interesting. Look recommended. It's very interesting. The recommendation that I don't know this. But I can blow today statistical, which is a vendor that I reveal myself in that public, like people discover that it is. Digos que tenemos con tablea idatos. A table idea, we are a hospital. A hospital that has medical registrations. The hospital is interested in extra information to see that cancer. The problem here: the hospital diverse and very confident of their center. The hospital that has the capacity for them, but not statistics that. Statistas que entiendo estos datos. So que vaero hospital, the hospital va publicaros datos, if it medio malo or medio ton publicando datos, what do you publish the public and decir estadistas there solve this problem. And the statistics in general are good people, no quiet encounters, but a other form to a privacy leak and. Having a privacy leak and what we can say here is not data, or there is a protein that is based on very interesting, but that is what cancer, or what is correlation with the cancer. It is more likely, it is like women, there are some In the same time, very personal. Looked public, like this vase, probably. Carrie, the first thing that I did, and the first thing that the people yes. Okay, but we have the hombre y lo publicam. And the publicamos. Algún problem with this. There are data public data and electoral institutions that have my number, my sexo, my code post. With a vase data, with a union and discovery that have been. And cover that cancer. If you pop into it, it is anonymization. In cases, the company is grouped in Massachusetts, and this public data from all people, the medical region of all the people who have data that we are very good, we are the identificated. We are the identificadors, we procupene doctorado garo puede la basedos el electoral, the registrar of the coverador, the registry of their medical. So other examples, the very time, we are publishing the historical people. The public anonymous public. Anonymous persona number four, if you have what you can buy, whole person is this, and discover people and the association with historical. Ok, this was only the initiative of technicas of privacy, and here the first privacy, which is. To privacy, that is, we are not an immaculate and here that we are with the basics remotely in the name of the people, but these are seven identificators, which are the union with the public. What we are simplifying or the generalizamos, and specific general, and also three people. And then three people have the same representation. So if you have a union with a public visa, really no saber here is that problem with this vase dataset. That is one of the problems, and much of the noventas. And many of the 20 years, how we have animization of the candidate of data. It is a problem in complex problems, which is that no solution in polynomial solutions, but there is a literature immense respect, so how we are optimized, and if we say that in one and three other, and we have a little bit more optimistic. How obtain this? That is a question of utility of the data. There is a problem more great here in this vase of data that are anonymous, but one of these things is joining the three people in cancer. So anonymously revealing. It are there practicals, there are no literature that have revealed information of users. I think the Io Conozco was one in Netflix, which research systems recommendation. Recommendation solar locations of the basic data usars usaronization in this type of data and identificators and position the ratings of the particular readings. There are a data publication that we have IMDB that also put ratings. So what we see in the investigators will compare the ratings and IMTV with the ratings of. When this situation, and there was a way that people find this technical to protect the sense of the attributes of the vote. There are other ideas that can be written that the promise of people. Promedio de Geente Cancer, what is the median voyage statistics? There are also in specialty when the data are multidimensional. What is the case in when you have models migrants terminating attacks for these programs? So, really, the three forms of anonymization is very susceptible to attacks. How can we really lose here or what we are not informed has our adversary? We have not modeled what the distribution a priori distribution is. Models the distribution prior to the adversarial distribution to discover if a person is the basic data. This problem of models is the priority. How we do, in order to discover how to discover. So, the work 2000 20s that are a cryptography. Analyst, cryptography, described and not going to procure what the adversarial knowledge is prior, you are queer the possible distribution prior, and going to start with this and introduce the concept of privacy differential. So, the privacy differential is defined as a difference, but a vase data, and a vase of data. Datos data, and datos, and machinario demos, of first. That is, if you variable only in the data of the data, all this. If you have a mechanism that is a vase of data and a space, we will see a function of the total, but a media with a little rider. If to allow, If to allow vase data of Frima, we have the probability that the mechanism in the basis of media is the epsilon, the probability that the mechanism in the basis of Frima. What significance is this question? What significance is that? What significance is that the basis of data that we contain information about me and first contain information? If the distribution of output is more like the information, I can distinguish it. Yes, the question here is that if the siesta no verse is the menos epsilon, the probabilities maximize one. The probability maximum is one. Yes, for event. Puedecer que esto que pas con unu probabidado y poca, so das un cachito, no? So when Epsilon seguel vetero, this is one. This one, and that is what the same distribution and really not in a mechanism. So, that is epsilon quantify how to do it. It is a here: the mission vase data here is yet in the vase, there are other people in the vase, and that robbery question: that proportion of a path cancer, which proportion of a cancer. And there is a variable tori, that is the sun, a variable MD primo, but the roja and very parcel. So if I observe a outcome of these two variables, no podcast Andres are based or if you are based. And especially for other people based on the same thing. The mechanism is more and more conforming to it. So, we can discover in particular. Now, because it is the variable, I agree, the question is: this function, this can be the response of the mechanism approximately correct mechanism. Mechanismos approximately correct. So there is all those parameters for the value of the epsilon. Conforme epsilon, it is already suitable, but more than zero. Conforme epsilon infinite, it is better, but more circumstances. So functionality in practice, but the question is how we can implement differential privilege. The response is very general, but The response is very general, but there is a very sensitive mechanism that determinists their data, but in the media, the median, we construct a mechanism private ME definitely aside, more algo delay. This is a relatory, and I'm pregnant as we Here we have a simple resolver esteem that we have vinyls, but this represents the patient in cancer, or not. I want to see when you have cancer. So, the function is the sum of the idea of regarding to satisfying privacy. To satisfy the privacy of different probabilists that are distributions. Almost the number of distributions. No? There are two problems. You can see it because. Because there is a binomial that is approximately a gocien. Claro, but the response is the same. The optimize a little bit more, but the place is sufficient to approximate what. So the place is. The place is pregunta. No, that form aquín para la la para la variable la torrieta. So digitiste la binomial, dige la gación aviara puyo uto uto uto toméo torpción. Ence que lamas de este déha. No, no, no. Mas albo del rido. Okay. Los datos aquí está picos. Nos nona varablatoria, la lo unica variable la tator. The races digo, but a place and the mechanism of epsilon differential. Voyages about the prior because very good and because of more discovering about how we can implement mechanisms in general mechanisms. What I think is to do the razor between probabilities. No? No, what probability that the mechanism is igual set, and what the mechanism of prima means. Well, it is the definition of the mechanism in the FDA, more than 100,000. So, if you first prima, this is more of myself, and I wanted to do a distribution data. And how is the distribution of data in those? Here is the distribution of details in settings, and that the distribution of 8. Tengo que es la definition of the place, and this is the menu, and the menu is prima. How the razor y me que está de differentia, the difference la poda quotar por desiglad del triangular, y me queda que es menor que es la epsilon esmos estu y aquí zondo de. And here is the toddler what is differential privacy. This is our first es la evaluation in the dataset. This prima is the sum in the first value. And what is the condition that number? My datos are vinarios to the more. And And all you have to do is private difference. Yes, the royalty of sin. That is going to be there what about other types of variables and how function is. The royal algorithms are already already dependent on great parts between what we have sensibility in a functional sensor. And also the sensibility of the function. If you have a function, what wants the comparison between the value of the function and what? The quantity of riddles will be proportional to this different proportion and function privacy differential when many data. They want to calculate the promise of colour. Calculate promise of a million millions. This differential is like a million. So what is one in a million? So many variants that are. So this is the unique por the differential as popular and sustainable because. And that because they have guarantees to ignore the person in particular, but if they have sufficient data, the response that is correct. Ok, so I'm like, differential of the complication, how we supremo, how the semester. How we are modeled statistical models, and that is a very articulate dedicated date. And there are sobre, okay. So, all the vases of data, all the vases in the universe, that supreme can be very great, so we can relax conditions also great necessary. But here distributions because no mechanism here we have the same, we have two distributions and what I think is the razor of these probabilities. But we are with the razor of these probabilities. Y consider concern. Consider with valores that in this person conform to Christians, that value land more. But I will not probability that one point, here, they are not going to be, no. So, because we can privately. And in this case, there are what we have approximated. Whereas, okay, I think that the mechanism satisfied mechanical condition of privacy condition, but some error of probability passes, the probability of detail. Because it is a probability that mechanism discussion is very immigrant about. May immigrants about Delta. What is the probability? Digotine queer as one of the number of data that is not, and there is interest here that the concept of Delta is like dependent on the mechanism. Consider the mechanism that is a probability of Delta public based data complete. Those obviously. Today is private, but it is private with probability to the majority part of the time. The mechanism galcian mechanism is more private, like a statistical agreed galcian, they are more private that the cabinet decision. But if we have the mechanism of epsilon private mechanism, it is the same quantification, so it is the same from the point of view of quantifying privacy. The quantifiable privacy queen is very simple. So this difference is the analysis to revelatory analysis that is the logarithm of the razor of the probabilities where the probability of M Delta. For the people that probability, you have notar a little like the divergence that How the divergences or how divergences of Reni and this toddler are not differential, which is privacy differential concentrated privileges, privacy Gaussian. And the idea is to take the privacy with a problem of hypothesis. If you have a lot of different private differences, we have difficulty as distinguished between this ocean or this otago. This Gaussian or this other Gaussian. And if you typically say that. Maybe interesting works about privacy. But this privacy. We have or the mechanism differential mechanism and differential private yasta. In general, observamos, bases, datas, more. Observamos vases more. And I consult the patients that have cancer when the patients who have cancer queues are. The patients that have encouraged that tier in this other propidation. So we have our independent index of the mechanism, emede. No, I meddle. If I promise these valid quality, and all of the privacy conforms observamos, we have privacy, all the question here, as we quantify the privacy because we are cuandoos to the top of the place in contrar as the terminal exactly, it is more complicated because the place is the place. Because the sum of the place is the place. It is where Gaussian mechanisms, because we are Gaussian, Gaussian, evolving more fascinating. But the calculation of the privacy composition in general is very difficult. The problem is resolved more and what is concentrated differential privacy is because we are facilitating calculus. If someone uses, If someone uses divergences, work with the divergence, it is much more than work with divergence total variable to calculate the same for people of dynamic systems and diffusion processes. This is basically a model in differential, how we. How we prendized machines and models with different vase data, work in the past. For considering a function of perida, mandating one with parameters, and we also want to understand regression, for example, and a double aquifer. The majority of the problems that injure the minimizar, the sum of functions. Ok. So, how do you calculate the sensibility of the function? So, there are two campuses about how this problem is one study sensibility. Sensibility DF relatively sensible when it porqueemos like the minimum of a convex function, when we have possible when the mechanisms advanced in models are all neural niggundo mechanisms convex mechanisms. So the identity part was, okay, well, wear the sense of gradient and parameters. And for those who don't know, I will explain. And for the process of evaluation, I will understand that my process because the sensibility of the user mechanism is great. And the digital as a component private mechanism, and the colour of the privacy, can calculate the privacy in this form. So, I can calculate the privacy in this form. Funcion in practicing. And the voice is because the rationale consider what function is my theory to, but the rationale considered with function is that the mechanisms of private graduates like it. If you are using it, you will not previous iteration and. That is the gradient negative in the middle. And I think that differential and learning rate that is a normal method, like one entry to the past. What is a little privilege? Because. Poor privacy. Because iteration of 20, estoy accidento misdos. But the final queen is not the iterantes of cada passion. What interest is the ultimate solution. So because I analyze the privacy of cada pass, that is, and pagando porcada cada esque valuable gradient. Ok, because we have analyzed the solution final. If some vegetable discovery comes, it is a combination of gaussian combinations with non-linearities in the gradient, the system here, and so on. But these very recent empathy like an approximation contima. I can see my system dynamic system, like what is happening when. What is what is happening with Walmart encourages the gradient of a function and the study caused? That is the power as a process of diffusion, a differential stochastic question, and then study the problem as the limited distribution of a stochastic process. Consider what we are going to do very well. Consider what I want, and what is the word for convex functions? For convex function, esoteric problems of the very difficult, but it's hidden between our last car is in matrices. Because people here matrices, in the interest. In the morning, interesting. Otherwise, based on my problems with the matrix covariance, like the calculus of private calculation. If I represent my view of data as a matrix here, the function is here, transport. What I can use: here also is the topic. Figo is a total. That is what I was covering and the great solution that used the central energy that are segues more than the covariance, have my spectral composition, have the values, have vectors. Ten colossal vectors. And I used to agreed Gaussian, aye, valores, and my aiquen vectors. Use because in how Gaussian, the spectroscopy of this matrix is not exactly what the spectroscopatries are, no? So that's about the spectroscopy. Polycarp in the spectroscopy. You can tomorrow the entire orthogonality. But the orthogonal issues, but we will regard how the number corrects. This question, how sampling in this space of matrices or matrix are problems very interesting in this quitame. And you want to present the problem. Presentaries the problems consider that in the world that we are, where we are going to live, first and queer as you are important. Regulators, companies, scientific areas consider this as a solution technical solution to a problem that has to be done. These years. These mechanisms of private memory requires distributions in dimensions. Basically, it is the problem. Compare two distributions in a very dimension with distinct dynamic processes. How we are auditing statistical methods, we are auditing electoral metrics, and differential stochastic optimization is all these mathematics and camps. Campus of mathematics is still campus. One day, this traditionally computers cryptography, some statistics, I consider that the type of distributions that are complex and that more sophisticated methods will necessitate. And that has references, I think, we will put this slides in the slide. Recommending all these introductions the differential and the problems that are between 200 and 200, so that they are very much awesome. Much Andres, preguntas hacan el zum. Ok. Well, I primer octave, yes, of the teto. So that is the same. No, what is statistic? If you say statistics, but just in the next page, when the material intuition because it is incorrect, and also the distribution. The distribution of the tools in principle. One with us the cover and here is studio. If you have understanding the porridge, if all this is If we were to go on the vanilla, question two parties. One if the data are private differential, the data has not been summarized for the dataset because the principal has to assume that the distribution priority of the adversarial distribution is what. When your mechanism can assume that the data biennial distribution and decir, okay, if they are IID, if they are independent, and I am and the great approximation because consider that in that galaciences that various rations. The first is when you have this. When you see if you have this transformation that is transposed a Gaussian, which is a matrix that does not necessarily definite, positive. And you know, covariance is definitely positive. So, for example, we are more. No? The second is that. Sunday is that as your digiste, the matrix covering the material that interests me is a very good thing that the matrix coverings is the spectroscopy and the vectors. So, if you want to gustaria, it is that the riddle that the gregas to the values and the vectors is like. So, you have a exponential, but it is exponential that But financial has the spectro. Well, if you want to really, the glacier is passing that in the spectrum of this agreement that will be like glaciers. No, well, if you don't force much allocation, what is there? If not, it auto points as a circular. And that we are the distribution with the cosmos. So I have the puzzle auto future and circulation that summaries. Claro, what is it? What is that better when it possible? Notidado possible to maintain the mejorotilidas. So, no es que este mecharismos afribado. This mechanismos privadado, me que escloro. Puedes escalo mejor, pues agrear less frivido in certas areas of your matrice to tenero mejor utility and so that distribution can utilize this. Because we have the distribution of wish chart, y que seporé. Yes, that is what I did one of the positive definite positions as mejor with Gaussian. But what is the mejor option to read? That's the question here. And that's what we're going to do as much. Claro, because you also contacted me, if you have collaborators in this area. Well, many por the platform. We explained supervision how. How privacy, but to make sure that this is terminal of situations of maciado legends, you are not variants. Okay. How we did depend much of the problem. Normally. Normally, if it is like utilities general, if my road is in the one or in the two, and it's like interesting and local. What interest is there depending on the rocket that you want to distributions that are more optimal that others for the rocket interest. So, for example, the Gauss, the mechanismo, the place of mejorrow. The mechanisms that have interest as outliers into processes, and depending much of the person that processes ignorance. My principal has the probability that Tien la probability estimates, and that is the probability, but what happens if we don't have concerts, and the conditional problem? How fast and private. Maybe not fast in the absolute face. In principle, you can see here, we are here in the unofficial, and you have to. And they have a person who does not know that Philips comes in the binary, where summar la cantía de cance. Yo conosco que limeras enemeros un personas, no lo tien. No. So the respondes can. If it is a variety that is people who have cancer, if you don't understand, but immediately. No. When the green rider que pasa, agreea son rido que estamaño uno o sero.  Andres y nosotro nos demos
