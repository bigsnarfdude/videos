Thank you for the invitation. I'm very happy to be there virtually. I'm sad that I'm not actually there in person. Oaxaca is a very beautiful city. But anyway, let me start with some basic definitions. So mostly I'll be working over a complex I'll be working over complex numbers, but sometimes over a subfield of C. So, hopefully, you can see the screen. If you can't, let me know. So, let X be a smooth complex projective variety. And I'll fix this for the whole talk. And I'll write H star of X for Betty cohomology, which is really just singular cohomology. Just singular cohomology, and I'm going to use rational coefficients. And I caught some of Mark's talk this morning, so you already know what the child group is. But again, I want to use the child group for with rational coefficients. So these are the basic players. And I want to recall that there's a cycle map which takes you from, I'll just use this funny notation box p. Box P. It takes you the sewing in the index by codimension. So this is the Cha group of codimension P cycles, and that goes to cohomology with of degree 2p. So it just takes a variety to its fundamental class. And so by definition, at least for me, the image is going to be the space of algebraic cycles. So one question is what can... One question is: What can you say about this space? And there's a well-known constraint coming from Hodge theory. So, if you look at the space of algebraic cycles, which is the image of the cycle map, then of course it lies in H2P, but more interesting, it's also in the PP part, which is the middle part of the Hodge decomposition. So, you recall a complex variety has a Hodge decomposition, which can be defined. Which can be defined in various ways, but if you take a form and write it in local coordinates, then there's p dz and p d z bars. And so by definition, the space on the right is the space of Hodge cycles of codimension P and then the famous conjecture, Hodge conjecture, asserts that these two are actually equal. Actually, equal. Okay, so let me mention a few related conjectures. These I won't say in much detail, but I'll simply just mumble some words for future. So let's say instead of defined X being defined over C, let's say it's defined over a finitely generated field, like a number field or something like that. And let's say the field is K. Then the Tate conjecture is. Then the Tate conjecture is, you can think of it as an arithmetic version of the Hodge conjecture. And very roughly, I'm not going to be precise, you have a cycle map into LADIC homology or atoll cohomology with Q coefficients roughly. And the Galois group acts on that. And so if you take the Galois invariant part, that should be the image of the cycle map. And it may not be obvious. And it may not be obvious why this is viewed as an analog of a Hodge conjecture, but you can make the analogy much more solid by introducing muff or take groups and so on, but I won't do that. And there's also a variant of these conjectures, Du De Janssen, which I won't make precise, but it's convenient to work or allow quasi-projective varieties instead of just projective. Instead of just projective varieties. All right, so with that, let me get into the topic. So let's say that X is fiber, which means that it maps to something of smaller dimension. And then a natural approach is to try and break the cycle map along the map. So let me try and make this a bit more precise. So this setup in Precise. So, this setup in red is: I'm going to use the same notation for the rest of the talk. So, I just want to be clear. So, let's say X is your smooth projective variety. It maps onto another smooth projective variety, Y, by a function f. And let's say that this is a surjective morphism. And remove the discriminant from Y, that's where things That's where things are bad in X. And remove the singular fibers from X. So I'm going to call the variety downstairs U and the corresponding variety upstairs V. And if I restrict V to U, that's a smooth projective map. Okay. So this I won't really introduce. This I won't really introduce very precisely, but again, there's a filtration on cohomology of V, which is called the Le Ray filtration. And if I take the associated gradient of the cohomology of V with respect to this filtration, then I get the cohomology of this direct image sheaf on U. And I should say that I'm using the analytic topology or complex topology. Or complex topology when writing these groups. Okay, so this is just a bit of notation. So maybe I haven't really said much, but are there any questions? If there are, just ask. So let me continue with the next topic, which is so we are interested. So we are interested in the image of the chow group in cohomology. So a natural approach is to pull back the Larae filtration to the Chow group. So this is the most naive way to introduce the Larae filtration on the Chow group, and that's all we need. And so then we can break up the cycle map using this thing. So let me introduce notation. So again, this is... Introduce notation. So, again, this is a little bit unpleasant. And so, but so P is really just for the codimension of the cycle. I records the cohomological degree on the base. So, if I take this LeRay filtration on the Chao group and take the associated graded, it maps to the space of Hodge cycles in this. Cycles in this comology on the right. And I should probably say as an aside for people who know what this means, that the right side actually has a mixed hodge structure. So it makes sense to talk about hodge cycles in this context. Okay, so I think, so again, this is maybe I'll just take a few seconds to let you absorb this notation. So basically, Absorb this notation. So basically, the previous cycle map is now broken into these more technical sounding cycle maps. And I won't spell it out, but there's a similar story in ellatic homology. So here you would use the et al. topology and instead of Hodge cycles, you go to Tate cycles, which are Galois invariant cycles and so on. You can imagine that there's such a thing. I think okay, so the first result is fairly technical, and I apologize. Talk, it's bad, and the Zoom talk, it's even worse. So I don't expect you to absorb anything. Just basically for future, when I say that there's a criterion that allows you to check these conjectures, this is what I'm referring to. So let me call the dimension of x is equal to n, the dimension of y is equal to m. dimension of y is equal to m and the difference which is the dimension of the generic fiber is r then really this is two statements but i'll just say it in one the hodge or the tate conjecture can be checked for v and this is the jansen's version for the quasi-projective variety if these these uh box p i's or box pi Or box PILs are surjective in this region that's marked down here. Okay. So it seems like it's made the problem much worse, but I claim that in good situations, you can actually use this to do things. So this is a technical result. So maybe you can just not focus on it too much. I'll do examples shortly. All right. Right, so maybe I'll say a word about the proof. And again, you can ignore this if you don't like these words. Use the Larais spectral sequence, obviously, to write down the obvious region where the theorem holds. And this is in yellow, which looks green on my page, but it's yellow or green. So this is this big region here. And then what do you do? Use the hard left. You do use the hard Lefschetz theorem, you actually use it twice to cut the size from the big region, which is yellow, to the blue region, which is the statement, which is what's stated in the theorem. And the idea is that the smaller the region, the better your chances of checking something because you have less work to do. All right, so that was maybe just kind of a general. A kind of a general sketch, but maybe I should focus on a case where things can be made even more concrete. So the Hodge conjecture, for example, is open already in degree four. So let's start with that case. So when the base, which is X, has dimension 4, you can use further tricks to reduce the region, this critical region, to a single. This critical region to a single point. So here's the precise statement. So X is a fourfold, all right, four-dimensional smooth projective variety, mapping to an M-dimensional variety Y, then it's enough to check this one cycle map being surjective. So it reduces things to a small. Things to a small check. Okay, so enough of this technical stuff. Let me turn to examples, which is maybe a lot more interesting. All right, so maybe I should stop if there are any questions or comments, complaints. Okay, so let me now turn to examples. So the first example is really from a couple of people, well, me. Of well, three years ago, I suppose. So again, there's two statements, but let's focus on the Hodge. But for those who care, it's also true for Tate. So the Hodge or Tate conjecture holds for the universal genus II curve with level structure. And maybe I'll say a little more about what all of these words mean. All of all of these words mean when I sketch the proof. So let's take the moduli space of stable genus 2 curves with level n structure. So level n structure for those of you who know or don't know maybe is really a sort of a marking of the curve, a basis of a cohomology mod n. basis of cohomology mod n. And it sort of kills the automorphism group. And then you take the not just smooth curves, but stable curves. So it's a compact, it's a projective variety. So this is the so-called Derou-Lomp moduli space. So standard computation, which is well known, the dimension is 3G minus 3 when B is the genus. In this case, it's 2. In this case, it's two, so three times two minus three. I think that's three, right? Three, yeah, six minus three is three. So the base is a threefold, and that was this number m um. All right, so now we introduce the whole fibration. It's not really a fibration, the whole map. And what is x? X is the universal genus 2 curve over this space. Curve over this space, right? So remember that, and the point of n is when n is large enough, at least three. This is actually a fine moduli space. So there's a universal family of curves over y, universal family of genes to curves with this data over y. So since it's a family of curves over a threefold, the dimension of x is 4, which is the first. Which is the first interesting case where one should check these conjectures, or at least the Hodge conjecture. The Tate is one knows even less about it. All right, so this is just an notation. So this is the universal family of curves over M2 with markings. All right, so now, yeah, so what's the point? Well, The point. Well, we had to say something about hard cycles, and again, this is a little bit technical, but the space of hard cycles, whatever it is, sits essentially by definition sits inside this thing on the right. So the content of this statement is not the inclusion. That's sort of almost a definition. The content is that this is zero. So there are no Hodge cycles in this particular range. Hard cycles in this particular range. Okay. And that is good because it makes life easy. So checking something when the space is zero is really easy. And so how does one do this? Well, this GER2 space, you can actually write it down as the hypercolomology of an explicit complex. It's a log complex for those who know. For those who know, and then use some work of Falting's Chai in their big book on, you know, to actually show that this complex is acyclic. And so the complex is acyclic, it has no cohomology. So not only in this degree, but in any degree, but we only need it in this degree. Okay, so Right, and so why is that good? Because this corollary that I stated maybe five minutes ago, where is it? Yeah, oh yeah, this one. You just need to check this one case. And in this case, M is three, remember. So we're done. So that means this is trivially surjective because it's mapping to zero. Conjective because it's mapping to zero. So the Hodge conjecture is a consequence. Now, the Tate actually requires more work, but I don't really want to say much about that. But yeah, so at least for the Hodge conjecture, the key point, really, if you want to understand in one line what the key point is, it's this vanishing statement. So in other words, you can actually reduce the verification. You can actually reduce the verification to vanishing theorems, and that's good for me because this is what I like proving vanishing theorems. Okay, so that was the first example. Again, any questions or comments? All right, so let me continue. Ah, sorry. Is there a question? Yeah, yeah. What is the discriminant locus there for? The discriminant locus there for M2, uh, okay, yeah, sorry, uh, yeah, so yeah, so you have this Deline-Mumford boundary, which is the is the divisor at infinity where the curves become singular. And that, so that's the that's the discriminant locus. Okay, so it's a divisor on the boundary of M2 and M3. Does that answer your question? Does that answer your question? Yes, thank you. Okay. All right, so let's see. Any other questions? Because I'm going to go to another example. Okay. So yeah, so the second example, again, is maybe good for people who like this sort of thing. It's more arithmetical in nature. The previous one was maybe more geometric. The previous one was maybe more geometric. This one is more arithmetical. So let's say D is a quaternion algebra. So, what is a quaternion algebra? It's an algebra which looks like the quaternions. So, I square, you have generators I and J. I square, for usual quaternions, I square equals minus one, j square equals minus one, ij equals minus ji. But then you change the i square to some assigned value. square to some assigned value, j square to some assigned value. And that's a quaternion algebra. And so I want quaternion algebra over Q, for example, or generally over a totally real field, right? And I want to split it in one real place. So that means that if I was working over Q, when I tensor to tensor this D with R, it becomes It becomes not the quaternions but two by two matrices. Okay, so let's take the group of units of norm one. So quaternions have a natural norm, and that's called G. Let's fix torsion-free arithmetic group gamma. All right, so then gamma will act on H. H is the upper half plane through the Through a natural representation of the real points of G into SL2R. And this comes from the fact that this D was split at one place. So again, if I was working with quaternions over R, when I change Q to R, sorry, quaternions over Q, when I change Q, base change from Q to R, it becomes just two by two matrices. Matrices of norm one, but that's exactly SL2. And SL2, of course, acts on H. So again, this is probably obvious to people who are arithmetically inclined, but I don't want to assume. So the quotient is a so-called Shimura curve. And it's kind of interesting for lots of reasons. There's actually no points at infinity. It's a compact curve. And you can actually... And you can actually view it as a moduli space of abelian varieties with some extra structure, which I don't want to spell out. And again, because I've chosen, you may wonder why I chose it torsion free, because I chose it torsion free. It's actually a fine moduloid space. So Y carries a universal family, which I'll call A to Y. All right, so. Right, so yeah, okay, so the simplest example would be, I think this would be a family of abelian surfaces with quaternionic multiplication. But there's other examples as well. Okay, so we're not quite done for the whole specification, but this is the base. Remember, I always have a map from X to Y. Have a map from x to y, and I'm telling you what y is. So y is a curve. And now I should tell you what x is. x is the fiber product of this universal family as many times as you like. All right, so again, the statement is the Hodge, if you care about that only, or the Tate, if you care about that, holds for X. And I should probably mention in passing that even though this could Even though this construction is analytic, if you interpret it in terms of moduli space, you have a natural model over a number field. So y is actually defined over q bar, for example. So take actually makes sense to formulate. All right, so what is the sketch? So again, I'm going to use the main So again, I'm going to use the main criterion, which I stated maybe 10 minutes ago. It's this somewhat technical result, which maybe it's not. Yeah, here, this one. Whatever this is, it reduces the verification of these conjectures to checking in a certain region. So that's what we have to do. Okay, so that so we apply the main criterion and we want to see that it actually works. And so there's so in this case, there's more than one case, right? There's going to be several. In half the cases, remember, I check on a parallelogram that the various maps are surjective. In half the cases, one uses invariant theory. Invariant theory. Well, okay, maybe I'll say nothing more about that, but invariant theory allows you to reduce the problem to divisors where it's easier. And there's the remaining half of the cases. And in this case, one needs a vanishing theorem similar to the previous one, but this time the vanishing theorem is due to well. Theorem is due to, well, it's not exactly due, but it follows easily from work of Piveg and Duo. So I'm just going to leave it as a very rough sketch. But the previous example, you can see that a vanishing theorem is very good because once you know something is zero, checking surjectivity is really easy. So that's good. Really easy. So that's good. So if you can make things zero, then that's good. And in half the cases, that's what you do. And then the other half, you have to use some other argument. All right, so that's what I have for this one. Any questions about this statement or sketch or anything else? Anything else? Okay. So I may end up finishing early because I thought I would. Yeah, maybe I'm rushing too fast. So let's see. So I'm going to do one last example. And this is related to elliptic surfaces. But not exactly elliptic surfaces. So maybe I can be a little bit slow. So, maybe I can be a little bit slow here since I have so much time. So, start with: so, what is an elliptic surface? Maybe I can just fill in these words. It's a family of elliptic curves, except some of the time they degenerate into singular curves. And so it's a family of elliptic curves over a curve Y and semi-stable. And semi-stable says that the singular fibers are semi-stable curves, which maybe, if you know Kadaira's work, it means that the singular examples are polygons of rational curves. That's, I mean, Qadar has many, it's classified the singularities, but those are the semi-stable ones. Are the semi-stable ones? Okay, so now we want to take the fiber product of this as again as many times as you like. Unfortunately, in this case, you will get singularities. And that turns out that maybe I should have written this down. I'll simply say it. And if you can imagine how to. Can imagine how to. I'm writing this in the air. So, locally, the singularities, if I choose a coordinate t on y and xy here, then locally the singularities look like xy equals t. And so when I take this fiber product, I will get product I will get singularities of the form a monomial equals another monomial and that's what what one calls toroidal singularities so among all singularities in the universe these are among the easiest to to understand and in particular there's a well-defined procedure for resolving the singularities this is called a toroidal resolution and so I use this procedure this is Timothy Procedure: This is to Mulford and maybe his collaborators from the 1970s. So you use this procedure and resolve X, sorry, resolve the fiber product, which I'm not giving a name, and I get a smooth variety X. So by its very nature, X is mapping onto Y. So, and this is my situation. Once again, so I have a map F from X. A map f from x to y and the fibers are at least the smooth fibers are products of elliptic curves. The singular fibers are some more complicated combination of products of polygons, but whatever they are, that's what they are. Okay, so once again, I'm going to focus on the Hodge conjecture. This time, I have nothing to say. This time, I have nothing to say about tape because this is a more analytic construction. So, we want to verify the Hodge conjecture for X. And here's the statement. So, this is from this year. It's a little bit technical, but let me go through it slowly since I have so much time. So, let's imagine not a single elliptic surface. Elliptic surface, but a family of elliptic surfaces. And again, I want all of them semi-stable. And yeah, so this, all of them should be satisfying some suitable non-degeneracy condition, which I'll explain in a few minutes, actually, in a few seconds. Minutes, actually, a few seconds, probably. So, suppose I have a family of elliptic, semi-stable elliptic surfaces satisfying this somewhat mysterious condition. Then the Hodge conjecture, I don't know for all of them, but it will hold for the general member. And by general member, I mean general in the sense of the bear category theorem, or a very general lambda. Lambda. Okay, so that's the statement. And to make it complete, however, I should explain what this condition is. So I didn't want to state in the theorem because it's a little bit technical, but I'll state it below. So what one finds is that there's a certain kind of Kadira Spencer map for this family. And there it is, for those of you who like big formulas. Who like big formulas? There it is. And so it's something like a Kadara-Spencer map associated to the variation of Hodge structure attached to this elliptic surface. And so the condition we want is that this map kappa lambda, however it's defined, should be injective somewhere. Injective somewhere. Okay. Now, where it's injective, I don't claim is necessarily the same lambdas in the theorem, but there will be some lambda. In fact, generic lambda, the theorem should hold. Okay. So that's now the full statement. And maybe I can make a few remarks about it. And I'm And I'm on my penultimate page. So I have one more page. And I'll go really slowly. So this is remarks about the proof. I don't want to sketch. Actually, maybe I should. Yeah, so there's always this danger. I think people have heard this Milner story where Milner goes to somebody's thesis defense and somebody proves a wonderful theorem and he points out that there are And he points out that there are no examples where that theorem holds, or maybe the only example is zero. So, this is always a risk that I was getting nervous. So, I want to point out that this theorem is non-vacuous. So, and again, unfortunately, I didn't write this down. So I'll just state it without writing it down. So, oops. Let's go back. So, one example of a family is where lambda, the parameter space, consists of a single point. And then, when you have a single point, then you stare at this really strange condition. And it's actually a fairly serious constraint. However, there are examples where this holds. And in the literature, these are called exceptional. Exceptional elliptic surfaces and examples include so-called elliptic modular surfaces. So, if you know about modular forms, modular curves, then they parameterize elliptic curves with some extra structure. They carry universal families of elliptic curves. And so, those are elliptic surfaces. And for such elliptic surfaces, this condition in blue holds. This condition and blue holes for that surface, you don't need to take a family. That's one example, and this example actually goes back to Shioda. So, sorry, I should say that the theorem in this context was due to Gordon. And so actually, Gordon's theorem was my inspiration for this one. So, this generalizes Gordon's theorem. So, this generalizes Gordon's theorem. Oh, yeah, but there are other examples as well. Maybe I should say it. I wish I'd written it down. You probably wouldn't want me to tech something in real time. So let me just say it. So there are examples of families of K3 surfaces due to Dolgachev and Hoyt, again, where this condition holds. And you can describe McCarthy. So there, and you can describe them quite explicitly. They're given by explicit equations, they're very nice. So there's at least three classes of examples for which this holds. Nevertheless, it's not always satisfied. I mean, if I pick a generic, I mean, an elliptic surface at random, there's no reason for this condition to hold. Okay. So a word of... So, a word about the proof. So, the proof is similar to the earlier ones in the sense that one uses a similar strategy. So, what is the strategy? So, maybe I'll just jump back to the previous theorem since I have all this time on my hands. Oops. Where am I? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay. So this theorem, which I mentioned before, half the cases use invariant theory, and the other half use a vanishing theorem. So that's the template for this one. So it's similar. So use half, on half the cases, you use invariant theory. And the other half, you use a vanishing theorem. This time, the vanishing theorem, I have to admit I'm cheating, is built into the theorem. Is built into the theorem. It's really, maybe I'll just say it, the vanishing theorem follows almost immediately from the non-degeneracy condition and the Kunneth formula, right? So remember, the examples I'm dealing with are fiber products. So not surprisingly, one needs to use a Kunneth formula to reduce it to a single lipid. Single elliptic surface. So, yeah, that's all I have. So, I guess I'm going to end early and maybe, I don't know what time it is there, but yeah, maybe can take a break and have a beer or something when my, yeah. That's good. All right, so that's all I have. Thanks. Thanks very much, Dono, for the very interesting talk. Are there any questions in the audience? Did you hear what he said? No, it's very, very faint. Sorry, could you speak up a little bit? No, don't worry. I will bring the microphone. Maybe you can say the word about how to use invariant theory in this context. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is yes, I should have written this thing down. Written this thing done. Or if maybe if I used an iPad, that would have been better than making pre-prepared slides. I could have written it, but now I'm committed, so I'll just have to say it. Yeah, okay. So maybe which is the simplest case to explain? Maybe this one. Okay. So it's a theorem of Weil, Herman Weil. Hermann Weil from the 1930s that if I have a symplectic group acting on a space, I can basically write down the tensor invariance. So sorry for not being able to write. I'll simply say it. Suppose I have a standard representation V of sp2g, right? So sp2g is a Is they're G by G matrices in particular. So they have a representation onto, let's say, C to the 2G. So you take the standard representation, and if I take V tensor, V tensor, as many times as I like, and I ask what are the sp2g invariants of that, then Weyal tells you. Then Weil tells you they're generated by basically tensors of degree two. Okay, so this is this again might seem a little bit strange and technical, but this is great because in the case at hand, when you translate this into geometry, so the special case of the symplectic group is SL2. So in fact, we only need to use it for SL2 in this example, but I stated the general case. But I stated the general case. So the idea is that, yeah, you basically apply this invariant theory result to reduce checking the statement of the Hodge conjecture, which is the surjectivity of the cycle map, basically to divisors. Where it's known, it's the Lefschetz 11. Where it's known, it's the left shots 112. So the invariant theory reduces what seems like a very complex problem to the simplest case where in this case one knows how to do it. So basically you're saying that your hard cycles are products of degree two cycles, which are invariant. And those come from divisors. Therefore, the whole thing. Divisors, therefore, the whole thing. So, Danu, Danu, the SL2 action is from the Lefschitz package. Is that the point? Or? Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Actually, it's coming. No, it's coming from here. So I said there's a SL2 built into this stuff, and that's where it comes from. Or rather, maybe I should say more accurately, it comes from here. That's where it comes from. That's where it comes. So to be a little more precise, what I sketched is probably only correct for the number field being Q. And then you basically, when you complexify the group G, it basically looks like SL2 of C. And in the case of a more general number field, it's going to look like a product of SL2C's. SL2Cs, but then that's you can still apply vials result in that case. So that's that's how it works. Yeah, there's one question in the chat. I don't know if you can see that. I can open it maybe. Ah, chat. Yeah, I think I can. Okay. Yes, I can read it. So maybe I should read it out loud. So do you, Isidro. Isidro asks: Do you have other families of abelian surfaces where your conjecture is true, not necessarily quaternion multiplication? Yeah, good question. I'd like there to be other examples. I'm not an expert on this, so if you have suggestions, I'd be thrilled. So the reason I focused on this case is because there Because there's a long paper of Phiveg and Zhuo where they studied it very carefully. And so I had access to their vanishing theorems. But there are hopefully other examples, but then one needs to worry about the statement. So maybe. Statement. So maybe I'm being a little bit vague about what one needs. And again, if I had a chalkboard, I wish I was actually there. I could have just written it down. But if you look at the actual complex that computes this hypercolomology that's supposed to vanish, it looks like a line bundle goes to Omega one log of the discriminant tensor, probably the dual of that same line button. And in this example that I'm dealing with, this complex is actually acyclic, which makes everything vanish that you want. And in other cases, it may not be acyclic, and then life becomes quite challenging. So that's the reason. That's the reason why it works in this example, and maybe would be more difficult in other examples. I hope that answers the question. Yeah, thanks very much. Are there any other questions from the audience in Oaxaca or from the audience in the world on Zoom? No, that's not the case then. Let's thank Donovan. Case, then let's thank Donno once again for his very nice talk. And it's a pity you are not here. And thank you very much for joining us from Purdue.
