Thanks, Thomas. And thanks for the invitation. It's been a great conference. It's been a very nice and diverse conference seeing all the different types of pattern formation and the different perspectives that everybody brings to the table. It's been quite fun, and I'm glad to be here. So, today, I'm going to try to talk to you a little bit about modeling mechanical metamaterials in general. In general, origami and kirigami structures specifically. And just as an example, what we see here is this is the famous Mira Aura pattern. So you basically take a sheet of paper and you fold it in half and you fold it in half again and you unfold it. And what you end up seeing is a crease pattern, which has a straight line crease and then two creases that form like a V. And this is the basic template for a mira aura. And if you repeat that pattern, Mira aura, and if you repeat that pattern, you can create a corrugated folded structure. And the mirror aura typically is a planar structure, so it corrugates, but in a planar fashion, and it can contract from like a large shape with large surface area all the way to completely folded flat. But what I'm interested in in this talk is: how do you understand the behavior of these systems, fairly generic systems under loads? Generic systems under loads. And in the context of a mirror aura, what you see if you try to bend it, you see that it deforms into this saddle-like shape, which is very strange because a typical conventional sheet doesn't deform into a saddle. It only has isometries or developable surfaces. So if you draw, if you look at any point on a sheet, you should be able to draw a straight line in a conventional sheet. And here you have this, this Gaussian. And here you have this Gaussian curvature, you have negative curvature here because you can draw a curved line here and you can draw a curved line going up here. But of course, I'm saying all that. I'm saying it deforms like a saddle, but actually it's oscillating on a very fine scale. So it's actually in some average sense deforming like a saddle. So I really want to try to understand these types of behaviors. Actually, I'm not going to solve the origami problem. I'm not going to solve the origami problem in this talk. That one turns out to be a bit more difficult because you're dealing with surfaces. It's also only a 30-minute talk. So, okay, so let's not worry about origami and let's think about something like kirigami and not really even kirigami that's deforming out of the plane, what most people think of as kirigami, but actually planar kirigami. So you take a rubber sheet and you pattern it in some way, and the slits will. Way and the slits will open up or close depending on how you push and pull on it. Okay, so that's that's the idea. Uh, mechanical metamaterials are a very broad subject. So, and I have a very loose definition of what a mechanical metamaterial is. And here are some examples. So, my loose definition is essentially a material which has a repeating unit cell or something that looks locally like a repeating unit cell, which is composed of stiff elements. Which is composed of stiff elements and flexible elements. So, in this example here, what you see, this is the Miro Aura again. And the stiff elements are the panels. The flexible elements are the creases. Here you have what I call planar kirigami. The stiff elements are again the panels, but now the flexible elements are actually these little tiny hinges that you see here. Here's an example of essentially a truss system, except if you look at the scale bar, it's a pretty impressive truss. Scale bar, it's a pretty impressive truss system. So you have the stiff panel, the stiff elements are the bars, and the flexible elements are the hinges, or what the material science community would call the nodes. And here's an example of sort of 3D origami, where you have stiff panels and along, you know, flexible creases, and they form this sort of very interesting structure. And all of these I would view as mechanical metamaterials. As mechanical metamaterials, because you have this combination of stiff elements and flexible elements, and they're repeated in some way, and typically they give you interesting properties. And the premise of all these materials, essentially, is that there's no issue in trying to do this at any scale, essentially, with the technologies that we have these days and are going to have in the future. All of these things are possible. And so you have this large design. And so, you have this large design space. And if you're an engineer, you think with this giant design space, you should be able to create tunable engineering properties on demand. And that's the idea. The challenge here is you have this large design space, right? You have to find a way to decide how to design something. You're typically not interested in one specific property. You're interested in some bulk property of the system. So, how do you design a unit cell to achieve a certain bulk property? To achieve a certain bulk property. And then, of course, another challenge is: well, if you have stiff elements and you have flexible elements, then you have these like highly contrasting elastic behaviors. And so when you start loading the system, it's not easy to understand how these systems are going to generically respond under loads. And so this talk is mostly going to be about trying to do modeling under loads in some reasonable way. Oh no, I lost. Oh, no, sorry. I just forgot how my slides worked. So, the modeling challenge. Okay, so if you're an engineer and you have to model these systems, how are you going to do them? Well, typically you're going to put your structural mechanics hat on and go, well, this may be a solid with a bunch of panels and a bunch of slits, but let's just convert it to a bar and hinge system. So I replaced the panels with a bunch of bars. Panels with a bunch of bars that are essentially panels because they're very stiff, and then I replace the hinges with a torsional spring. Typically, the bar stiffness is much larger than the hinge stiffness. And you can put this into a computer and you can start running simulations left and right. And so if this is the design in my big giant design space, now I want to understand the kinematics. You run simulations left and right. They're perturbative, right? So you have to sort of move around. You move around in a region you already know, and you have to sort of do this convergence, and it's kind of messy. And it's not quite clear if you're doing these types of simulations, whether you're actually exploring the kinematic space of a given design completely. And then also, you know, if you're a graduate student, this is kind of a frustrating task. So if you have a different design, you have to redo the whole process. You have to model the stiffnesses in a reasonable way, and then you have to explore the kinematics. And then you have to explore the kinematics in a reasonable way. And it's cumbersome. And I would like to replace this. And I would like to replace this using the fact that the basic observation that these are typically made of a bunch of repeating cells. And if you have enough repeating cells, you might expect to be able to do some averaging. And with this averaging, you might expect to get a constitutive law that looks more like one of these conventional constituents. Conventional constitutive laws that you would see in a continuum setting. And then, you know, if you're an engineer, you want to go back and do some modeling-informed design and sort of iterate the process. So that's the basic idea of what I'm interested in in this context. And, you know, this talk, I'm going to say that we figured out how to solve this problem in the planar kirigami setting for, well, a very specific type of planar kirigami. And it turns out that for the type that I'll explain. For the type that I'll explain, all of them are governed by a field theory, which is a set of nonlinear partial differential equations. And okay, sometimes you don't like to solve nonlinear partial differential equations, but you can turn these into practical constitutive models and you can put them into abacus and you can run simulations. And here's a bunch of experiments. The color plots are how slits open and close. And here's a continuum model, which is supposed to do a good job of relating to that experiment. And I think it does do a That experiment, and I think it does do a rather good job. So, that's that's essentially the talk. So, let's let's let's get to the details. So, this is an experiment by my collaborator, Paolo, a very simple one. You just fix two ends of the rotating squares pattern that Bob introduced briefly last time, and you start pulling on this, on this side. And so, what's the experimental observation? Well, you start pulling on it, the slits open up. Pulling on it, the slits open up. Slits open up at the boundary at the points over here, and they open and they open and they open. And then slits start to open up everywhere. And okay, this is the type of structure you see. And I'm a theoretical person, so I look at this structure, and I would like to understand why when you pull on it this way, you get this kind of dramatic features where the slits are opening up in a choreographed way, but not. In a choreographed way, but not in a way that's easy to explain. And so you look at this, and if you zoom in on a unit cell and you sort of go into your favorite editor, draw some boxes and rotate the boxes, you realize that this thing, you know, you take a bunch of squares, you can easily rotate it into a configuration which looks like that. You can draw, you can highlight a different unit cell, you can easily rotate a bunch of squares into a configuration which looks like that. And so you can just ask a And so you can just ask a basic question: which is: is this overall deformation consistent with a mechanism? And by mechanism, what I mean is if I just think about the squares as being rigid connected along perfect points, can I construct this pattern just from doing that? So let's think about this. So this is not the configuration that I showed you in the experiment, but it's an equivalent open configuration of this pattern, this rotating squares pattern. And what I'd like to Pattern. And what I'd like to address is the concept of the rigid kinematics, where I pretend all the squares can just be rotated and they have to be connected back together again. And so how do I do that? Well, let me just take two of the squares and just rotate them relative to each other by some rotation Q and some rotation R, as I've done here. Okay, and now I have to figure out how to glue the rest of the pattern back together again, given that I rotated these two squares. These two squares. And so you think about how to glue this. So I have these two lines here. I have these two lines here. I have to fit them together in a way in which these two are just being rotated. There's only one way to do that. So there's only one way in which this line, which sorry, which has the same length as this line, and this line, which has the same length as this line, is going to The same length as this line is going to come together to fit this thing together, and it's to create a parallelogram slip or rhombi slit in this case. And then, okay, so you realize that you can replay this argument over and over again, and you end up with a configuration which looks like this. So, what I started with is I just rotated two panels, and then everything else followed from that. So, I have this configuration, and the problem with this. And the problem with this configuration, if you were concerned about the experiments from the previous slide, is that this is QR, QR, and then it's repeated. So this deformation is periodic. And so, you know, this is not going to explain the experiments, which are which are not being repeated. So even though this looks like a rotation of the unit cell and this looks like a rotation of a unit cell, they're different. They're not periodic, but the actual rigid. Not periodic, but the actual rigid kinematics are. So, how do we address this? Well, I want to do a little bit of a digression because I don't just want to talk about the rotating squares. I want to, you know, tune, have a tunable design space. And so you can sort of like, you see this RQ, RQ marching in this kind of design. And you can think about what, why do you get this marching? And the answer is that you have a periodic pattern in the reference configuration and all the slits. Reference configuration, and all the slits are parallelograms. That's the answer. And then you must have this sort of periodic marching in the rigid kinematics. And so then you can ask a question. So is there a general recipe for creating unit cells, which all have whose slits are all parallelograms? And they're unit cells in the sense that they're these two by two structures with in which the slits are parallelograms. So I like this because I can actually prove the give you a general recipe. That gives you a general recipe in pictures. So, the idea is: let's start with a seed like this one, and I want to create a periodic pattern of this seed. And because my periodicity has to be something like this picture, I know that this thing has to get repeated in this direction because it's periodic. Because I want my slits to be parallelograms, I know that if I know two sides of a slit, then I actually know the other two sides of the slit. The other two sides of the slip. But because I want something to be periodic, I know that whatever I just drew here has to get repeated. And now I just color in everything. And now I have a pattern which is periodic on the scale of this type of unit cell and whose all of its slits are parallelograms. So I've just generalized this design space. So that's nice. And again, all these patterns have this property where you create these patterns. You create these patterns, and then you have this motion, this continuous motion, in which the slits are opening and closing in a way that's effectively periodic or effectively homogeneous, actually, but periodic and effectively homogeneous. And here's a couple of examples. One, the rotating squares example, and another example which falls into this parameter space. And of course, you load the thing, and it doesn't look like it's effectively homogeneous. So this. Homogeneous. So, this kind of rigid kinematics doesn't explain everything. So, what's the answer? Okay, so here's one of those generic patterns that I'm showing you. And we know that it has this feature in its rigid kinematics that it oscillates back and forth in a periodic fashion. And I'm just going to draw the rotations with pluses and minuses in this case. And I'm going to do some labeling of points in the reference configuration. Points in the reference configuration and points in the deformed configuration. And, you know, so you have these vectors S1 through S4, they create a vector S. You have these vectors T1 through T4, they create a vector T. And you can recognize that this is a Brave lattice in some sense. Okay, so if you take your unit cell and you translate it along S and T, you're going to get the entire structure. So this is actually a Brave lattice. And now you can ask, well, how is the unit cell? And now you can ask: well, how is the unit cell effectively deforming? And so that question is basically: well, how does S go to its deformed counterpart? And how does T go to its deformed counterpart? And since this is nice and periodic and I know everything, I can just think about how the little vectors S1 through S4 are rotating under the pluses and minuses. And you do a little bit of algebra, and S def becomes this, and T def becomes that. It's just a little bit of algebra. And then Algebra. And then this is really kind of natural in the crystallographic theories that I understand from continuum mechanics. You take this description of S def, you know your description of S, and you say, well, I can relate these two by a linear transformation. And that linear transformation, very naturally for me, is going to be an effective deformation gradient. And so I define an effective deformation gradient as the linear transformation that takes S to S. Transformation that takes s to s def and t to t def. This happens to be unique. And what you're really doing is you're zooming out and you're forgetting about all the stuff that's going on inside the pattern. And you're just recognizing that no matter what's going on inside the pattern, the mechanism is taking S to S def and T to T def, and they're given by this linear transformation here. Okay, you do that and you just, you know, you recognize the structure of this problem. It depends on a rotation. Problem: It depends on a rotation by an angle gamma and a rotation by an angle xc, but it depends in a really complicated way on xc, but not so much on gamma. So it must be a rotation by an angle gamma, and then some tensor which depends on xc, which is complicated, but we don't have to compute it. Okay, but this is an effective deformation gradient that is homogeneous. So that explains the pure mechanism that essentially averages out the pure mechanism. Averages out the pure mechanism, but that's not the problem I want to solve. So, the problem I want to solve is the problem that what I see in the experiments is not homogeneous. So, I'm going to play a trick and I'm going to say, well, oh, you know, maybe there are many unit cells. You know, when I look locally, I see a mechanism, but the mechanism varies on a scale which is large compared to the size of the unit cell. So, I'm going to take my homogeneous effective deformation gradient, and I'm going to pretend, or I'm going to allow it to vary. And I'm going to pretend, or I'm going to allow it to vary in space. And that's all I've done here. I've replaced f effective with a deformation map, y effective, whose gradient is locally consistent with this picture. So gamma is allowed to vary, xc is allowed to vary, and that's the big idea. Yeah. Quickly, just if we'd like to compare, if I'd like to compare to what Like to compare, if I like to compare to what Bob told us yesterday, the difference is that in your system, a pure mechanism must have a homogeneous gradient, whereas in Bob's case, basically it's an arbitrary gradient or almost arbitrary. Yeah, so well, let me explain that. Let me try to answer your question as carefully as possible. In my system, I know all the mechanisms and they are effectively homogeneous. Are effectively homogeneous. In Bob's system, there's much more subtlety because there's actually lots and lots of mechanisms, but somehow it doesn't matter when you average out in Bob's system, you always get something that is effectively conformal. But in my system, the... In your system, it's not conformal. My system is more rich in the effective description. His system is more rich in the micro scale properties. So I don't know if that answers. I don't know if that answers. And sometimes, Benny, it is conformal, sometimes it's not in this system. We'll see. Yeah. And so, this A of XC, right? If this A of XC is lambda of XC times identity, where Lambda is a scalar, then it's a conformal system. And so, okay. So I did this like trick where I just took my homogeneous effective def yeah. So, also that just I understand it completely, and I guess you were just kind of alluding to that. So, let's say you have a mechanism that kind of varies smoothly over the surface, but then there's some kind of similar to like a subcritical bifurcation where it jumps quickly to something else. So, you would have kind of like a yeah, so those are that's a good question because that that relates to uh I'm actually assuming some smoothness to this system. Some smoothness to this system and justifying that this is going. So let me get to the next line. Okay, so okay, so the next line. So, okay, I have a constraint, okay? But, you know, the left side is a gradient. The right side, you know, needs to be consistent with the gradient. You take a curl, you get a PDE. And so now I'm going to try to solve a PDE, which is hopefully going to. Which is hopefully going to produce smooth solutions. And of course, the question about whether you're going to form domains sometimes is a question to be addressed, hopefully by the end of the talk, a little bit. So now we have a PD. And my claim is that the PD is governing what we see for the most part in the experiments. And so let me just look at this PD again. Let me remind you what the independent variables are in this PD. What the variables are in this PD. The variables are XC and gamma. XC is the opening angle of this slit. And gamma is like, draw a box around the unit cell and it's like the rotation that the angle that's describing how the unit cells are rotating. Of course, this is being sampled at every unit cell. It's a smooth field that's being sampled at every unit cell to give you this kind of physical picture. And you can do this for all the time. And you can do this for all the types of patterns that I showed you before. And you want to solve a quasi-linear PDE, or I mean, for me, a non-linear PDE, the most natural thing to start with is you study the linearized PDE first. Assume you have a solution and then perturb it, and you get a linear PDE. And this linear PDE happens to be something that is very, you know, that you can just use classical PDE theory and classify the linear PDE. The linear PDE, and you find out something very interesting about this problem. This PDE is either elliptic or hyperbolic, and when it's elliptic, the pattern is auxic. So the unit cell, when it's elliptic, if you pull on it in one direction, it wants to expand in the opposite direction. And that's exactly consistent with when this PD is elliptic. When you pull on it in one direction, it wants to contract in the opposite direction. Wants to contract in the opposite direction, that's exactly consistent for when this PDE is hyperbolic. Now, elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs are very interesting because they have some generic properties. In an elliptic PDE, the maximum and minimum of the field variables always occurs on the boundary and never on the interior, except for the trivial solution. In a hyperbolic PD, these typically describe wave-like phenomena. So, for our purposes, what you should expect is that boundary data. You should expect is that boundary data. You apply some load on the boundary, you should see it propagate into the interior along characteristics. And though I did the classification in the linear setting, it holds in the nonlinear setting as well. And these kind of generic properties are what you should expect to see if the PD is actually governing what we see in the experiments. And so here's our experiments. And in the top, we have a non-aughtic, so more conventional-like material. more conventional like material and and and i call it a hyper and it's governed by this hyperbolic pde in the bottom we have an auxetic uh actually conformal kirigami as bob pointed out and it's governed by and i claim it's governed by the elliptic pde and the coloring is basically how the slits are opening and closing and so in the top figure what you see is you're you're applying a point you're applying a displacement essentially at this point and you see these kind of Point, and you see these kind of contours that go off in straight lines, so characteristics. And in the bottom, you see that the contours are completely different. They sort of emanate around the loading point in ellipsis. And okay, you know, can we solve the PDE system exactly? We can try to cook up solutions that really do a good job of trying to approximate the experiments. And in the top example, we use. This, in the top example, we use simple wave solutions via the method of characteristics. These are exact solutions to the PDE. And in the bottom, we use conformal maps using complex analysis. And this is our best attempt at solving analytically for this nonlinear PD that's matching the experiments. And the nice, I mean, the kind of remarkable thing, you might say this is not a great match, but there's nothing to really fit. You're trying to solve a nonlinear PDE. Trying to solve a nonlinear PDE and match it to an experiment, and you have nothing to fit because these are all geometric parameters of the unit cell. Okay, so that's that's that. Now, I want to go back, since this is technically a math conference, and I still have five minutes, so that's good. I want to go back to this jump I made where I had, I calculated, I did it a coarse-grained average and got an effective homogeneous deformation gradient. Homogeneous deformation gradient. And then I made this jump. I said, oh, you know, well, things in the experiment are locally mechanistic. And so let's just leap from here to here. We don't actually have to just, you know, appeal to the experiments to make this statement. So I would like to try to convince you that this is a very generic fact of these systems, that if you have this kind of homogeneous mechanism, you should be able to spatially modulate it on a scale that's much larger compared to. Lar, that's much larger compared to the size of the unit cell. So, how do we justify this type of field theory? So, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to try to do a construction. So, what I'm I'm going to say, okay, I believe the field theory is correct. So, any, suppose I have any solution to the field theory, can I fit it using sort of a very simple kind of construction? So, imagine I have a domain omega L, kind of like what Bob was doing. You sort of draw Of like what Bob was doing, you sort of draw a certain you draw a kind of a complex potato-looking structure and you fill it with a bunch of unit cells. And so, what I want to do is I'm going to highlight a single unit cell and my construction is going to be based on a unit cell type onsatz where I just sort of modulate this onsatz for every x-bar. And so I draw, I draw, I, you know, I have an onsatz, which is, is, you know, four types of deformations, and I modulate it for every x-bar, and it looks like. Modulate it for every X bar and it looks something like this. It's not a big deal. The idea, at least to start, is the important point is that I have cooked in these effective deformations and these angle fields that I was describing in the field theory that I told you before. And if these things are not homogeneous, so if these are smooth but arbitrary and not homogeneous, then this is a rigid onsatz that's going to sort of produce a Going to sort of produce a bunch of gaps in the system. And you can imagine, okay, you can imagine just brute force trying to calculate the gaps that you have under this type of onsats here. And I'm good at actually doing those types of calculations. So there's a natural way to prescribe these types of translation fields. That's not a big deal. But the important thing is that you calculate the gaps. And what you get is that at every X-bar unit cell for every gap, For every gap, the gap at leading order is proportional to the difference between y effective gradient y effective and RA. And this, in fact, is our PDE constraint. So what you actually get is that if the PDE holds, then the gaps are small. So if the PDE holds, then the gaps are actually small compared to the size of the unit cell. So any type of elastic energy you have in this Type of elastic energy you have in the system is actually going to be very small as long as the PDE holds. So that's a construction. So that sort of suggests that the PDE is sufficient for low elastic energy. And then you go back to this domain walls question. You want to understand how to decide whether the PDE is necessary for small energy. And that's something like this. And that's something like this. Let me try my best to explain it in. Well, I only have one minute. So, okay, what's the idea? The idea is in a real system, you don't have, you know, you don't have panels and points. You have panels and hinges. So something like this picture, the hinge has a length scale. The panels have a length scale. And in a real system, you apply some arbitrary deformation, and you might get something like this. And you'd like to understand. And you'd like to understand when it can be approximated by something which is just, you know, square panels and perfect points. And of course, an arbitrary deformation is going to be subject to some elastic energy. And the key result that my collaborator Ian, who is in the audience, was able to derive is that you can essentially approximate. So for any deformation. So, for any deformation, the elastic energy can essentially be measured as its deviation from these types of mechanism deformations here. Except there's a funny little log term, but the log term is actually very physical. It says that if your hinges get really small, this delta gets really small, then the right-hand side of this equation blows up to infinity. So, it's a terrible estimate. It's a terrible estimate. But that actually makes a lot of sense because if your hinges get really small, then you can get really far away from being a perfect mechanism. It's totally allowed because you can just accumulate a bunch of elastic energy in a really small region. And so anyway, this type of statement, after you do a bit more analysis, will allow you to justify that the field theory is not only something that is sufficient, but also necessary. But also necessary as long as the energy of a deformation is sufficiently small. And with that, I'm going to end my talk by just saying that: yeah, I'm an engineer, so we make models, and you can write down a model since you know this field theory, and you can run a bunch of abacus simulations, and the simulations actually do a very good job of matching what you see in the experiments. And so, I'm happy to take questions. I have a question, Paul, if you don't mind. You just have a couple of minutes, so I'd like to jump in unless someone else has an even more burning question. But one thing I was just a thought that crossed my mind is for the hyperbolic case, the most famous solution in hyperbolic differential equations is the Riemann problem. And it would be interesting to set up a boundary. interesting to set up boundary conditions on your on your you know on your structure in such a way that you you would get solutions of the Riemann problem you should see so we so we have a rare faction fan we have a rarefaction fan yeah we have a rare faction okay that's that's my point okay then my my my further issue question is is or remark is that if the energy Energy of the PDE is the underlying energy that's on the right-hand side of the hyperbolic PDE is non-convex. The Riemann problem has solutions with phase boundaries. That would also be quite interesting to see. Yeah, so there's some problems making complete analogies, right? Because actually, you know, you have a bunch of elastic energy stored. You know, the PDE is an effective description. The PDE is an effective description. It is not easy in these systems to form phase boundaries, I think, because there's no way to do this compatibly. So there's a lot of elastic energy stored at the phase boundaries. And so it's a good point. I mean, it's definitely for me, I think, an open question. What settings would you expect to see? What settings would you expect to see phase boundaries or jumps? So, jumps in the actuation fields. So, all these actuation fields for everybody in the audience, all these actuation fields are varying smoothly, but you could imagine a situation where you actually had jumps in the actuation fields. And, you know, what is the cost for jumps? There's going to be a cost. And right now, I think we know how to justify the smooth case at a certain The smooth case and at a certain small enough energy, but the cost for jumps is a little bit larger energy, and it's not clear to me yet, you know, can we even do an experiment that realizes something like that? So just to jump in, I would say we know how to quantify the cost of jumps. That's the gradient C term. But Dick, the deeper point here I think that Paul was ending with is: are we ever going to be able to do an experiment with enough unit cells to realize To realize a jump. Yeah, I mean, there's you're at the borderline now. It's things are not quite as sharp as you would like to see, but I feel like if you just made it four times as big or something, you would see it more sharply. I mean, it's a matter of the length scale of the domain versus the length scale of the unit cell. But anyway, yeah, certainly it would be interesting to see this non-convex case. See this non-convex case. Yeah, I agree completely. So technical challenges aside, suppose you had hinges which are directional and that you can easily rotate them clockwise, let's say, but they will resist if you go the other way. How crazy would that be? It depends. So it depends on how strong the rotations are. How strong the rotations are because the hinges really, I mean, the hinges are really small area, uh, so they're not dominating the system unless you really, you really change the material and you and you induce this actuation at a scale which can break this geometric fact that things want to be locally mechanistic. And that would actually be very hard to do, I think, in any unless you choose your reference configuration to be fully closed. So, so that's a natural example where hinges can only. Natural example where hinges can only actuate in one direction if your reference configuration has fully closed slits. Yeah. But yeah, I don't think you'd break the local mechanism unless you really worked very hard experimentally to do that. So here we see the gradient C term and we see corrections besides the effective energy. In the simulation, In your simulation pictures, you show us included those things. Yeah, so these simulations require this type of correction terms. And if you didn't include those, it would somehow be too degenerate, I guess. Yeah, so our stiffness, you know, my postdoc forgot to include this term at one point, or we were just confused about something and we couldn't get it to run because you need this term really to regularize the finite element. Regularize the finite element stiffness matrices. And it's not really well posed. And it shows in the actual implementation of the FEM. I ask a quick question. So since in your model, you have flagged these smooth gradients. Would that say anything about how the experimental system would react to if you, for example, would snap one of the bonds? One or many? I mean, you really need to snap. I mean, okay. I think that depending on the size of this, if you have enough unit cells, snapping one is not sufficient to break the ideas here. Yeah, so if you put a hole in it, you're still going to be locally mechanistic. I think there's a way. Certainly, if you do. Certainly, if you do enough, you'll start breaking the features that you see. Yeah, so I guess maybe from an engineering point of view, could you make like predictions of how robust your system would be to snapping a number of bonds? That's a good question. The problem that we have, right, is it's a little circular. We designed the effective description. So this simulation is not going to cut it for that question because this simulation. Question because this simulation is based on the idea that the thing is locally mechanistic, so we'd have to go and start all over again. But in principle, actually, yes, I think that that's something that we could address. I have a quick question. Yeah. So, a lot of these designs that you started with, the slits had some kind of anisotropy to them, right? They started off elongated. But there's some experiments where under Some experiments where, under compression, right, you start with square slits. Yeah. And then in those cases, you sometimes see different symmetries of rotations under compression. Yeah. There's a can your system kind of handle that. Yeah. Yeah. So there's a clever experiment by Katia Bertoldi, I think, was highlighted by Bob. If you take, you have the open rotating squares case, and if you force, you frustrate the boundaries by twisting an opposite. The boundaries by twisting in opposite ways. So, what happens is that there's a mirror symmetry in the rotating squares. So, you can rotate one way and you can rotate the other way. And the macro scale looks the same. The micro scale is different. And so, if you force these opposite rotations, you end up with a domain wall. And that domain wall is not actually a solution to this PDE, I believe. That domain wall is really governed by the balance between these terms. And I mean, but These terms, and I mean, but there's some it's governed by the higher order effects of that I that I'm washing away in my field theory. Um, so those details matter in that kind of experiment. Uh, but yeah, that's a yeah, that's exactly something that we're interested in understanding. Any last-minute burning questions?
