We need to be part of this experience. And my talk today is going to be on disease model. So mainly we want to look at spatial profile of solutions. And so most of the work I have from work with Kioni Castilano, who was my former PhD student. Right now he's doing his course of Virginia Tech. Of visionate, and some of the results are followed by cetacean. And also, I have Repang and Nicholu, who are very nice collaborative. So, as we know, infrared diseases are illness caused by pathogenic microorganisms, and Professor Gumel already talked about this yesterday, so I won't waste time on this. So, definitely, and the main reason for a study has to do with. Reason for a study has to do with kind of control strategy. And what you're used to usually when the disease and there's probably no medication to treat as for people to stay for. So what I'm going to look at is mainly how the diffusion rate of the population affects the spatial distribution of the population at endemic equipment. So I'm going to look at this simple model, so-called Anyway, the SIS model. The S is for the successed population and the I is for the infected population. And the first part is the diffusion part. This is a constant, so it's for the S is just to say that the diffusion rate for the soil population. And we have the term due to interaction between the infrared population and the soil population. And beta is the And beta is the infection rate, and we have the recovery rate of the infection, which is gamma q. And this model is usually called more or less a closed system because we neglect several stuff like disease-induced birth rates or equipment rate, all those stuff. But something we include here are this power P and Q. So more or less, when P is between zero and one, it tells us that uh little infection That little infection in contact with cell population results into more infection. And when P is bigger than 1, tell us that the infection is not, the result is not that much. And the critical case is when P is equal to 1. So we allow for those parameters to be just positive numbers. And our aim is to see how those parameters affect the special profile of the civil state at endemic decline. Kilobolt. So, if you look at the PD model, the parabolic system, due to the fact that P can be 0 or 1, definitely, if you look at this side, because P can be less than 1, so we lose kind of leafies respect to I is equal to zero. So to take care of those technical issues, when P falls between zero and one, we require for the initial to be strictly positive. Initial to be strictly positive just to ensure uniqueness of solutions. And also, when Q is between 0 and 1, we impose the same assumption on S is 0. And under those basic assumptions, in 2019, Peng and Wu actually proved that the system is pretty. In fact, they show that it's eventually bounded in the sense that there's this n infinity that depends only on the total size at the initial. Talk size at the initial of the population that bound eventually the solution. So, something that I mentioned before that has to be critical here is the fact that the total population is conserved. So, it doesn't take into change due to loss in the population and so on. So, let's first look at the OD so that I make sure that I don't just waste my time on the PD. So, if you look at the OD, this very At the OD, this we have based on p being between 0 and 1 or equals to 1 or bigger than 1, when p is less than 1, the disease killed them is always unstable. And there is always a unit in the media given, which is always globally stable. That's what the ODC is the middle diffusion. When p equals 1, we have a critical number for the total population size, more or less that determines R0 is equal to 1. And before that, To one. And before that, Z fleet lab is still globally stable. And after that, it becomes unstable, and there's this verification of the Z. And they're also globally stable. You have a unique curve. And the last case, when P is bigger than 1, the disif is always linearly stable. So, but still, you can still have endemic equilibrium and we have a batification. A bifurcation point here, so it's the standard mode modification. But the top one corresponding to the one with the bigger number, Fn is always stable, and this is unstable. But before N star, the Z frequency is always stable. After that, we have that biostability phenomenon. So when we just neglect population movement, taking ds to be zero and di to be zero, so we have this picture. zero so we have this picture for the OD system. So if now we include the P, the diffusion, so I want to focus on the C V state, and again I'm fixing N to be the total population. So the first question is to know if all the parameters are constant, well then by just adding the diffusion rate that induced the special problem. And it turns out that that is not the case, that if it That if all we need is Charles, the ratio of the gamma of our vector to be constant means that infection rate is proportional to recovery rates. If that is the case, for the PDE model, if you want to understand the structure of the CD state, you just go back to the OD system. You get the same thing. So there's no diffusion-induced special pattern in this model. So later on, when I talk about multiplicity, so we have About multiplicity, so we have to keep in mind that it's due to two factors: both diffusion and the the parameter that we have inside. Also, I introduce this R to be gamma or beta just because I'll be using that expression later. So if you look at the PDE model, so you want to see if there's any differences between the PDE model and The PD model and the ODE model. And the first case we look at was the case of P is equal to 1 and Q is equal to 1, which is a critical case if you go back to the OD system. And we notice here that actually we may have, this is the verification is always forward here. It's possible to have a backward verification in the PD mode in that particular case. And that is even by this Given by this result that we have here. So we introduce these quantities or star, the maximum of this quantity here. The maximum is achieved to establish to exotic, I think, 11 and regular weight and 2008. And so if you pick one of those phi that maximizes, we define this. And independent of how we pick phi, if you look at it, we have the power phi squared, phi y q. phi square phi one cubed so we scale out it just cancel out so that turns out to be important for us because when that n star is bigger than one we may have a backward verification for small diffusion rate of a successive duration however when m star is less than one the bifurcation is always forward interestingly even though it's forward we may have an s shape bifurcation Shape verification. So you first go forward and then turn back again. We have, this is exactly this case that we have here. And this is definitely not possible from the ODE system because when P is equal to 1, we know we already have that forward, we continuous all the time. So that already highlights some differences between the PDE model and the ODE model. So now, let's So, now let's now focus on the main title, which is Spatia Profile. So, now I know that if I talk about the PDM mode, I have to be careful because we have this multiplicity of city state. So, I want to look at it in three different cases. In the first case, we fix the diffusion rate of the population and then let the I go to zero. More or less, it's kind of illustrate the movement of the infected population. And you ask how. And you ask about how what is the special distribution of the population at endibium or equilibrium. So, when we do that, what we notice is that the soil population tends to be uniformly distributed, which is given by this part. And we look at the infected population, given the final decision, for the decision, then the total number of infected populations decision by piece, which is just equal sequence of the first one, plus something that turns out to be. So, something that turns out to be important is this special set that we have here, which is exactly the set where, if you look at the local population number, which is maximized. So, outside of that set, the fair population will go extend. So, if they have to survive, even though the total population of them is this one, they have to survive only on this set that is here. So then we say, oh, what's really the, before I go, there's something also that is here, this assumption that I put, it seems to be technical, but really not, because if we have the reverse inequality, there's no endemic equilibrium. So which means that that assumption we put is also necessary and sufficient for the existence of equilibrium. And this set we label it as the high result. Label it as the high-risk A. So now let's focus on that set. Omega star. What's the real distribution of the infra population in that set? And I'm going to look at two different cases. In the first case, I'm supposing that that set is just a few points, so isolated. And due to the fact that the total size is equal to this, right away we can use a simple analysis. We can use a simple analysis to show that it converges to a combination of delta functions. So we have those peak at every location that we have here. But something that is open in our results, if you imagine that we have just two points where those minimum is achieved, would the population concentrate at each of them or only at one? And that's we cannot answer that question. And it seems that the And it seems that they will concentrate on both. And the reason for that is we look at the model or the question from another point of view, we focus on the PD model and take di to be zero directly. So we have the genericity on the i equation, but the first equation is still parabolic. And under that case, we could actually prove that in each of those peaks, the population will the infer population will cause some height in the lung. Now let's look at the case when that set is non-empty, has room inside, so the tail is non-empty. And if I do that, it turns out that this I'm taking the simple case here. In the main paper, we look at more general cases where you have small pieces. So if you look at just suppose you have one component of it and it's connected. It and connect it on that set, the Fed population will converge to the solution of this system that we have here. So we have a missed boundary here. In the part that is inside the domain, so the I will be zero, but the one that touches the boundary, so we keep the normal boundary condition that we have. So if we focus on that set that we call high scale, we can also get information. Here, we can also get information about the distribution of the infra population is completely determined by this. In this case, we also found uniform R for the inferior population. That tell us that we cannot have X at all in this case. So, if we have a single isolated point where the maximum is achieved because of this uniform bound that we have here, we can actually prove that on those isolated points, the development will be that bound. In the evaporation with that. So they only focus on the part of omega where the interior is normal. So we can get those information on that. Now we look at the case P between 0 and 1. So all I talked about before, if you go back, is P equals 1. So if you look at the case P is between 0 and 1, what we have is that What we have is that both population will always persist when we receive the movement of the fair population. In this case, what we have is that the soil population becomes again uniformly distributed as before, but the effect population persists uniformly. So we can see already the difference between the assembly level when p is between 0 and 1 and p is equal to 1. And P is equal to 1. And that's exactly suggested by the OD that I just mentioned before. And we then ask: okay, this limit, if we let P goes to 1, what will we get? Will we recover what we knew for P is equal to 1? So that we just need to do this and then let P goes to 1 to recover the first part. It turns out that it depends on this number compared to RMA. In the first case, In the first case, the infected population goes to zero, meaning that the high infected population can be eradicated. But if the top population is greater than that critical number, we still have almost the same result as in the case of the PD, where they concentrate on the high-risk area. So we can recall, but it depends again on whether the top population is bigger or not than that particular number. Thank you. Thank you. We also look at the case DS goes to zero, and that becomes more interesting because this time the total population plays a significant role. Be smaller than this quantity, then the F population will always go to zero. In fact, at a rate of this, and the S population gives this type of special profile. And when N equals that critical number, again, the population goes to zero. And the most interesting. Goes to zero. And the most important part is when n is bigger than that critical number. It turns out we can have two different branches of, and they make a current. One. Gamma over beta. Ratio of recovery rate over. Yeah, because that's one over R rate for the U.S. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so NAT needs to be greater than that. Exactly, yeah. So in this case, if you look at it, it turns out we had two different branches. It turns out we have two different branches. This always exists. You always call an astronaut solution. And then along that branch, the inferior population persists. It's possible to have another branch that will behave exactly like this case that we have here. And both are possible. And we actually prove and give a sufficient condition to have both possibilities in the case of the last part, how many minutes. So, what I did in the first two parts is let di goes to zero or and fix dx or let ds goes to zero and fix di. What if they both go to zero at the same time? But at the different rates. So, then we look at di over ds to be the rate of the convergence here. And we saw that in that case, we can also say something about the limits. The limits of this and it's given by this special function S sigma and I sigma. And to know more about that, look at the limit of this with respect to sigma as sigma goes to infinity and zero. And it turns out that we can recover almost everything from the previous two parts. But the difference is in this case, when we focus on the high. Focus on the highest area, we have a sharp interface between outside of omega star is always zero. But on omega star, it's exactly uniform constant. So we give this categorist a function. And that's, I think, I'm okay. I'm on time. Yeah. So, and that's probably the last result I want to share with you. We also have the case of zero, there's a P, there's a one, go to time. P is less than one due to time, probably and we can also notice the same thing as the case of the OD. Now when P is between 0 and 1, both population always persists to be from one unit. The deficient rate goes to 0. And so this is a short conclusion on the results. And so here are a few references related to the talk. So thank you. Thank you very much. Why do you take this S to the P times R to the P term I to the Q? What's the reason for this model? Exactly. Because in the standard way, we suppose that the new inflation is proportional to just the number of the contact rates between sustainable and effective. In the traditional, we suppose that the We suppose that the incidence rate is kind of the new infection is proportional to the contact rates between the susceptible population and the infected population. But it's possible that the infection could be more kind of harmful in the sense that even small contact rate can still yield a high number of infection. And one way we think of capturing that is throwing those 500% site. So we don't know whether it's accurate, but it's the only way for us to kind of capture those. So the way for us to kind of capture the step of one. To take the, for example, I infect C S if they are close enough. So you take the integral, a kernel, you know, a kernel that for I for I sorry or for a kernel for L C The inflation rate The infection rate depends on the KN function, that depends on so here you want this side, right? You want to replace this part by an anti-grap of I, is that right? I would rather take a function beta, beta and S, which is linear in S, because in fact, really, it is not and or Yeah, and okay, I see your point. Now, for linear in S, you can see throughout the talk, the Q didn't play any role at all. So, that really doesn't matter in our analysis. It was just only added for curiosity to see whether in the long run we notice something, but because it doesn't affect. The only thing that matters is exactly the power of peak. So you are right, taking Q to be one or any number doesn't take S as a function of X. Take S as a function of X and beta of X and S together, which will be some kind of a Gaussian curve. If you are closer, the infection is more extensive. If you are further away, it speaks. Oh, that would be interesting. And I think I think that an Italian guy has a book on He has a book on defection something with lots of kernel functions. I'll give you the name when they go on the back of the mic. Oh, I would just point out that this non-linear incidence function has been around since the 1980s, and there was a debate with her path coat and people like Simon Levin and others. People like Simon Levin and others about the appropriateness. And well, people continued to use it after the debate. So the resolution to the debate. So there was a legitimate underlying mechanism for that. For mainly kind of studies more kind of mathematical. Yeah, though there was lots of provisions on that. I think lots of people have used that type. Yeah, but I don't know. For example, for diseases where people change their behaviour based on how touchable the disease is, like saturated incident function, whether one should be housed in two or type three functions. So all this organizer, in some cases, actually it fits the data better than you standard instead of mass action. So it depends on what it is. I'm interested actually to see which. Interesting actually to see if you use greater than one. Yeah, as we noticed, it doesn't have in the classical SIS models. We don't have a bacon application, but it's greater than one yellow, which is interesting. I don't know what mechanism, what causes that about greater than one. I don't think it's a good spot there. Oh, I think you raised a card.
