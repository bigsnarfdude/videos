For Quadlix and Applications. Thank you. Thanks very much, Samir. Yes, I'd also like to thank the organisers for soldering on with this conference. I've enjoyed all the talk so far. I think the last time I was in Banfer was actually back in 2011, and I think, I mean, obviously, Banfer is a great place to visit, but I remember the conference photo being. Place to visit, but I remember the conference photo being truly horrible. It was like minus 19 Celsius. We were forced to stand on some icy knoll to have our photo taken. So, certainly, I enjoyed the conference photo this time around a lot more. I want to talk about some work that I've been doing recently with Roger. It's slightly, Roger Heath Brown is slightly open-ended. And I guess I'm mentioning it here in the hope that maybe it could be applied in other contexts. So the problem. So the problem is the button. The problem is very classical. So phrased here in terms of elementary number theory, we suppose that you're given a pair of polynomials with integer coefficients which have no common factors. And then the basic question you could ask would be how often, or what's the probability that when you evaluate these That when you evaluate these polynomials at integer vectors, these two numbers are co-prime. So, this is a kind of co-dimension two constraint. So the failure of these two numbers being co-prime is the same as asking that there's some prime which divides both of these numbers simultaneously. And I'm thinking really of these two polynomial conditions as a kind of co-dimension to condition. As a kind of co-dimensional two condition in affine n space. And so to make some progress on that question, what you really need to do is try and show that it's quite rare for these conditions to for this mod P condition to hold for large primes p. So this was observed and put into practice first by Eckerdale in the early 90s. In the early 90s. And so he exactly calculated this probability, and it's what you would expect it to be. So at each prime, it's exactly the probability that your two polynomials don't have that prime as a common factor. And so that's answered. And this the sort of underlying ideas in this argument have been applied to lots of other settings. And the question I want to address here is. The question I want to address here is: what if we additionally ask that the integer vectors x satisfy some auxiliary Diophantine equation? So let me first mention the sort of key estimate, which is known as the geometric sieve, which underpins Ecdell's result. So it's an easy exercise to count rational points in projective space. I'm taking just the naive exercise. I'm taking just the naive exponential height here. So, this is basically the same thing as counting integer vectors, primitive integer vectors, whose Euclidean length is bounded by b. And that grows like a constant times b to the n as b goes to infinity. Now suppose that you're given some codimension 2 sub-variety of this projective space, which is defined over q. Then the sieve states the following. So, I mean, Eckadel doesn't Following, so I mean, Ecadel doesn't write it like this. This upper bound was proved by Bargover relatively recently. And it states that if you're given any parameter m and then you count rational points in this projective space, height at most b, which reduce to an fp point on this codimension 2 sub variety when you reduce modulo some large prime, some prime p bigger than m. So that's the counting problem. And then the result is that you can always bound this by essentially b to the n divided by m plus another term, b to the n minus 1. So the second term is always less than b to the n, so that's kind of like an error term. And the first term is a bit like a main term, and it tells you that at least if m is bigger than a power of log b, it is indeed very rare. It is indeed very rare to have rational points in projective space which reduce modulo a large prime to a point in this codimension 2 subvariety. So that's the sieve and it, as I mentioned before, it's been adapted to quite a wide range of scenarios. So I've listed a few here. This is by no means exhaustive. So much earlier in the Much earlier in the 99, Punin and Stoll used this to say something about the density of hyperelliptic curves of even genus at least two whose Jacobian has Tcha-Veribich group with non-square order, assuming it's finite. You can also use it to say something about local solubility in families. So there's a nice paper of Bargover, Cremona, and Fisher, who show. Ramona and Fisher, who show that about 97% of plane cubics, when you order them by height, so plane cubics defined over the rational numbers, when you order them by height, are soluble over every local field. And in fact, there's a very precise expression for that constant. And then, most recently, there was a paper on the archive this year by Cremona and Sadek, who studied the proportion of Study the proportion of Weier-Strauss equations for elliptic curves, which happen to be globally minimal. But there are many others. So, in analytic number theory, for example, people care a lot about square-free values of polynomials, and there's a series of papers tackling those problems. But all of them involve, at some point, at least, this geometric sieve. And yeah, then the question I want to ask is: Want to ask is, we can't read that, is what if we replace this projective space by some other sub-variety? So, first of all, can you answer these questions? Can you prove something similar? And if you can, are there any sort of interesting applications along these lines or other lines which then become available? So, unfortunately, we're only really able to do this for a very special class of varieties. We are working We are working with indefinite quadratic forms of rank at least five, defining some quadric hypersurface in projective space. So I think it's genetically impossible for me to mention or to give a talk without mentioning the words circle and method close together. So this is a slightly irrelevant comment, but you can use the circle method to count rational points on these quadrics. And you find that the counting function bays like b to the n minus. Counting function behaves like b to the n minus 2 times a constant. It's not very difficult. And then we give ourselves the same setup. So we ask our, we suppose that we're going to have some codimension two sub variety inside this quadric now. And then we want to try and show that it's rare to have rational points on your quadric which reduce modulo sum large prime to this code of engine two subvariety. That's the goal. And that's achieved in the That's the goal, and that's achieved in this result. So, you take a codimension two-sub variety, let's define over q. I'm kind of supposed to be taking integral models and things, but I'm going to ignore that here. And then the result has a very similar structure. So you're taking some parameter m, which is supposed to be large, and you count rational points of height at most b, for which there's a prime p bigger than m, which reduces you, modulo that prime to this. Reduces you modulo that prime to this codimension to sub-variety. And then that's the upper bound. It has the same kind of structure. You have a main term and an error term. The error term is always smaller than the circle method answer. So it's n minus 2 minus something small. The main term is only going to be smaller if you allow m to be a power of b. B. So the okay, I yeah, so the theorem doesn't really involve the number 7847. I think that's the population of Banff as of 2016. In principle, you can take any large number, so b to the n minus 2 plus 1 over the population of the earth. Something I just didn't want to write epsilons. So that's the bound. It has a very similar structure. And I guess I should mention that. I should mention that around about the same time, Yang Chao and Zhizhang Huang also gave an independent proof of this fact, though I think they use quite different methods and they don't get any power savings in the estimate. So they just save some small power of logarithm. Okay, so firstly, is this useful? So can this be used in interesting contexts that I've not in. That I've not envisaged. That's why I'm talking about it. And secondly, I do want to point out that it can be false when you have quadrics of lower rank. So let me first perhaps say something about the proof. This is just a one-slide sketch of the steps involved. So at the top is the kind of upper bound. Now we are fixing a quadric. If that quadric. If that quadric doesn't have any rational points, this is not going to be a very interesting upper bound. So we may as well assume it has a rational point. So therefore, we can make a change of variables and assume that the quadratic has this special shape. Not done very much so far. Secondly, we're assuming that we're given some codimension to sub-variety. And if you muck around with results. And if you muck around with resultants for a while, you can basically reduce it to the situation that your codimension two thing is, what it has, it has, oh, sorry, that's a typo. It should have the quadratic equation, because it's supposed to lie inside x. And then it's, you can assume that it's just given by two equations, so f and g. And moreover, you can use the quadratic equation to eliminate the xn variable, so these don't have the xn variable appearing. Don't have the xn variable appearing. And between the two of these, you can use resultants to remove the last variable from the first equation. Anyway, so that's a nice concrete co-dimension T sub variety Z that you can work with. All right, this steps may be a bit of a mouthful, but the key idea is to basically Basically, instead of viewing this quadratic hypersurface as an equation, we're just going to sort of fix xn minus 1 and think of it as a congruence, modulo q, modulo that variable. So as an upper bound, I can bound everything by fixing that variable q, which is the variable xn minus 1, and then counting. Minus one, and then counting how often q divides the left-hand side, capital q of x1 up to xn minus 2. Now, yes, so that's what I want to do, but that, I want to count integer solutions to that, but I can equally break that into congruence classes, modulo q. So, I'm yeah, so this is the sum over q, all q is going up to b. Now I'm breaking into congruence classes. Now I'm breaking into congruence classes. This is over all b1 up to bn minus 2 modulo q, which happened to lie on this quadric, q equal to 0, mod q. And then what's left? You're left with counting the rational points now in variable, so it has these coordinates x1 up to xn minus 2. And they have to satisfy three key properties. They have to have height at most b, obviously. Secondly, they have to, when you reduce have to when you reduce modulo q they have to reduce to this uh this b this this b vector that we've um we've fixed and thirdly we've got to capture this condition that when you reduce one to a large prime you end up on this code subvariety and that's just asking that there is some large prime p for which f and g are both congruent to zero modulo p. Yes, I'm not going to say too much more about this, but the key observation here is that this condition that x reduces to a fixed vector modulo q defines a lattice condition. And it's a lattice which has relatively large determinant. And so in fact, what we've actually reduced the problem, when you make a convenient change of variables in that lattice, you reduce the problem to counting points in some projective space. Points in some projective space which reduce modulo P to some co-dimension 2 subvariety. So that's exactly the setting of the Echadel Civ. So through the structure of this special quadric, you can rearrange it so that you can actually just get away with reapplying a kind of lower dimensional version of the original Ecodal Civ for projective space. So I've really oversimplified here, it's a bit tricky because It's a bit tricky because your co-dimension 2 subvariety depends on some of these variables and the sieve, sorry, the lattice you produce turns it into a very lopsided counting problem. But anyway, I wanted to at least mention the guts of the proof on one slide. I've done that, so now you can completely delete that from your memory, and I can just talk about some applications. Oh, I wanted to give an example. So this is an example. So, this is an example which shows you that rank four. So, this is a bit more analytic on the theory. Rank four things can go wrong. So, I've taken a split quadric and I've taken a codimension two. So, the codimension two things here are just points and I've taken the point one zero zero zero. And I'm interested in the counting function, which counts rational points which have height at most b and for which there's some prime bigger than, I'm going to take square root b such that this point x. Such that this point x reduces to z modulo p. Well, I am just going to restrict, instead of counting everything, I'm just going to restrict to a special line. I'm going to look at the line x2 is equal to x4 is equal to 0. And in that line, I'm going to actually look at special solutions in which one of the coordinates, this one here, involves a Involves a prime factor, a prime factor between square root B and B. So in fact, this is a lower bound for that quantity. And now this is something that it's quite easy to estimate. So you're just counting integers a and b in the first instance, such that a is less than or equal to b and little b is less than or equal to b divided by p. So that gives you b squared over p and you have to sum this over all primes between square root b and b. Between square root B and B, and using the prime number theorem or some weaker variant of it, you get B squared as a contribution. However, if we looked at what we had as a main term, sorry, as an upper bound, that was the upper bound that we had. We're looking now in the situation that n is equal to 4 and m is equal to square root b. You certainly get something here, which is b times b to some exponent, which is less than 2. So, certainly things. So, certainly, things can go wrong when you are looking at rank for quadratic forms. I think if you avoid these split cases, you can still get something to work. But I just wanted to point out that there is a slight subtlety in rank four. Okay, so that's enough of that. Let's talk about some examples. So, let's go back to co-prime polynomials, which is what I started with. So, we can answer the With. So we can answer the analogous question here, where you give yourself a pair of homogeneous polynomials f and g, and you run over points on this quadric hypersurface, again, assuming that you have something indefinite of rank at least five. And then you're able to, so you need to make the, obviously you need to make an assumption that there are no components That there are no components of the intersection of f and g which are completely contained inside q in this quadric, otherwise, it would be very hard to make them co-prime. So, the natural assumption to make is that the intersection of hypersurface is f equal to g equal to q equal to zero, has co-dimension three in the projected space. And then you can basically precisely calculate the probability that these two polynomials are co-prime as you go over this much thinner set. Co-prime as you go over this much thinner set now of zeros of a quadratic form. And you end up getting some positive constant, and it's a product of local densities, the densities that you would hope to see. The other, oh, right, maybe I should just mention that also you can apply this to say something about strong approximation on quadrics when you remove. When you remove co-dimension two sub-varieties, this is kind of an interesting area. If you've got an algebraic variety, projective algebraic variety, and we know that weak approximation is unaffected if you remove anything of co-dimension one. But if you're talking about strong approximation, that can have a strong effect. Sorry for using the word twice. But Olivier Wittenberg has raised. But Olivier Wittenberg has raised the question: if you start with a projective variety which satisfies weak approximation and you remove some type of co-dimension two, does that still satisfy strong approximation? And so this answers that in the case of a quadric. I don't think this is a very deep fact, though. I think you can prove this much more simply without using any counting arguments. Okay, the other direction I wanted to discuss briefly was local solubility. Local solubility. So, actually, it was just when I was finishing my PhD, there was a conference in AIM where I heard about this result of Poonin and Volokh, which I really like a lot, which states that if you order degree D hypersurfaces in some fixed projected space in the naive way by height, then a positive proportion of them are everywhere locally soluble. So, there's this caveat that you need. So, there's this caveat that you need to ignore the case of plain conics, because in fact, 0% of plane conics have rational points. So, you could ask more generally if you allow yourself to work with a kind of general family of varieties. So, we've got some morphism, dominant morphism from y down to x. Let's say smooth. Let's say smooth and projective, and you assume that they have some geometrically integral generic fibers. Then, yeah, what can you say about the density of points downstairs, which lie in the image of idelic points upstairs? So that's what this limit sigma is. And then you can ask questions like: when does this exist? So, obviously, it's you certainly need there to be idelic points upstairs in the first place. So, it's very natural to impose the condition that y has points everywhere locally. But yeah, so if you look, for example, okay, yeah, another natural condition to impose is that if you look over any codimension one point of the base, the fiber should be. Base, the fibre should be irreducible. So, if you have these two conditions, is it then sufficient to deduce that a positive proportion of the fibers are everywhere locally soluble? Which is a sort of generalization of this Punin and Voloc result. So, this could have mentioned one condition. I haven't got time to talk about it too much, but that fails for plain conics. So I looked at this with Dan Lochran and Martin Bright, and we answered positively, provided that you are dealing with a base's projective space. And that's not surprising because we use the Echadel CIF, which rather limited us to exactly that case. And it turns out that this density exists and is a positive product of local densities. And one of the other consequences you get from this variant of the SIB for quadrics is that if you allow the base to be a quadric, which has rank at least five, then the same statement is true. Okay, I think I'm almost out of time, but I just wanted to mention in rank four you get slightly. You get slightly different things happening. I think the same statement is probably true. So I've written down two quadrics of rank four. The first one has Picard group Z, the second group has Picard group Z squared. And the counting functions behave slightly differently. So the first one behaves like B squared, the second one behaves like B squared log B. And I took a special case. So I took the set, the variety Y to be the The set, the variety y to be the intersection of x with this thing here. So it lies naturally as a complete intersection inside y-projective space. And then you can think about the morphism from y down to x. So it's easy to write down idyllic points on y in fact you can write down rational points. And it turns out that you can analyze this counting function quite carefully. So you're counting rational points in the base on these quadrics whose height is at most. Whose height is at most B and whose fibers have points everywhere locally. And what you find is that if you look at the first case, the first example, it behaves like B squared. So that's exactly the situation that we saw on the previous slide. So the ratio of this, you don't see if I point, the ratio of this divided by the total count behaves like a constant as B goes to infinity. Constant as B goes to infinity. So a positive proportion, therefore, are everywhere locally soluble. A positive proportion of the fibers are everywhere locally soluble. However, for the second example, you get quite different behavior, and it's kind of interesting. So it grows like b squared over log b. So when you look at the ratio, in fact, that limit, well, it exists, it's equal to zero. And in fact, it decays like log b squared. So, in fact, when you analyze this, you see that for the second example, the fiber over the co-dimension one point where x1 and x3 are equal to zero is not irreducible. And in fact, this is kind of compatible with some other work of Lochran and Smates, where they exactly look at this situation where you have failures of this codimension one condition. And I think the exponent here matches up with what they did. Yeah, I think that's. Yep, I think that's all I had to say. Thanks very much.
