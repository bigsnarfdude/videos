Yes, complex cobordism using new methods of equivariant stable homotopy theory. Okay, so let me just get started with some background. Hopefully I can get through it fast because I think Bernardo already said most of it. So this is just a definition of non-equivariant complex cobordism, which is defined again as a set of equivalence classes. Is a set of equivalence classes of weakly stably complex n-manifolds, which are just compact and smooth. Where, if I look at this tangent bundle, I can add a trivial bundle to it, this n, such that this has the structure of a complex bundle. And the equivalence relation is just these two m0 and m1 are cobordin if there exists some weakly safely complex m plus one manifold, such that the boundary is their disjoint union, and such that if I look at this. That if I look at this tangent bundle restricted to this boundary, I just can form it as the tangent bundle of the boundary, direct sum with a trivial bundle. And I can similarly define a G-equivariant complex cobordism, where some so far right now g is going to be compact Li. I'll have to get a little bit more specific later, though. And I define it similarly now just that the manifolds have to have some given. The manifolds have to have some given g-action. And again, now this tangent bundle, direct sum with the trivial bundle, has to be given a g-equivariant complex bundle structure. And this is sort of a similar equivalence relation as in the non-equivariant case. Okay, so that's how you define geometrical complex cobordism and homotopical complex cobordism is so non-equivariant. Let me start with like the non-equivariant side of things. Equivariant, let me start with like the non-equivariant side of things, is defined first of all by looking at this BUN, which is recall is we can express it as this Gressmannian of n-dimensional complex vector subspaces of this infinite direct sum of copies of C. And we can, and this BUN then has its universal bundle, gamma n, which is just given by, so a point corresponds to a space, so you just take that exact space there. And And there is this natural bijection going from maps from some, I guess, paracompact space X to BUN with n bundle, with isomorphism classes of n bundles over X, just by looking at the pullback of this universal bundle. Okay, and then I can look at these Tom spaces. I look at D, I put D2 to D2N. I put D2n to be the Tom space of BUN with respect to this universal bundle. And these form a pre-spectrum, like so. And it's an inclusion pre-spectrum, so I can spectrify like so by taking the co-limit over degrees m of these loops in degree 2m minus n of these d2m. And this is the non-equivariant time spectrum. In other words, non-equivariant homotopical cobordism. Topical cobordism. And so there's this Tom's theorem, which says that, in fact, we have this isomorphism between geometrical, these geometrical complex cobordism spaces, omega n, and these homotopy groups of this mu. And in fact, the coefficients of mu are expressible as this z on these infinitely many. Z on these infinitely many variables, x1, x2, where we put these xi in degree 2i. And so maybe the natural question is if such a theorem works for equivariant versions of this geometric and homotopical cobordism. And the short answer is, of course, no. But we can be more specific, such as, for example, excuse me? I think. Oh, yes. Okay. I will keep moving on. So, for example, we can ask if there is still some sort of form of free generation by elements of even degrees, which is sort of like this evenness part of the Tom theorem. We're going to ask if we can explicitly calculate these coefficient rings, mu g star and omega g star. MUG star and omega g star. And we can ask how badly is it true that omega g star is not isomorphic to mu g star because we still have this Tom-Pontryagin map which Bernardo introduced. Okay, so let me first go through a little bit of how the definition of MU changes when we want to be G equivariant. Okay, so again, G is going to be compact Li for now. And what we do is now we. And what we do is now we just take BUNG to be this Grassmannian of the space of n-dimensional complex vector subspaces of this complete universe, which is this direct sum of infinitely many copies of a direct sum of each irreducible complex G representation. And now for a paracompact G space X, again, we have this natural bijection between maps from X to B U N G. maps from X to B U N G with now G equivariant and bundles over X and the isomorphism classes. And it's still given by just taking pullback of, again, you have a universal bundle on this B U N G. And again, we can now again make these Tom spaces and we now put this gecovariant pre-spectrum dv to be this time space of the space of Of the space of the dimension of V dimensional subspaces of the complete universe direct sum with one copy of V. And yes, and we take this Tom space with respect to this gamma to the dimension of V. And spectrifying, I guess again, it's an inclusion pre-spectrum. And so we can take again with this co-limit. And we spectrify to get this ROG graded G equivariant Tom spectrum. G equivariant, Tom spectrum, Mu G. And this is in fact an E infinity rank spectrum, which means that if we look at this operad of isometries from this direct sums of this complete universe to itself, then this acts on a smash of copies of MUG, like so. Okay, and so this, so here we see that MUG forms a genuine geovariant spectrum. Forms a genuine G-equivariant spectrum. But sort of classically, that's not true for omega-G because you can see it doesn't have this ROG grading, for example. And we consider it only as a naive Z-graded G-equivariant homology theory, meaning just by taking for some space X, manifold M over X. And so we have a map between these coefficients from omega g star to mu g star, but it's not in general an isomorphism. But it's not in general an isomorphism for a non-trivial G. Okay, so that's enough background. So let me talk a little bit about the evenness conjectures. So first is geometric evenness conjecture, which states that if I look at these coefficients of these geometrical complex cobordism omega g, these coefficients form a free mu star module generated in even decay. Star module generated in even degrees. And we have to phrase separately the homotopical evenness conjecture, because again, these two are not isomorphic. And this again says that MUG star forms a free MU star module generated in even degrees. Or we can have something slightly weaker like a flat MU star module generated in even degrees. Okay, so first sort of intuitive question is. So, first, sort of the intuitive question is if there's any connection between the evenness conjectures, say, like an implication either way. And there really isn't. But what you can do is there is some connection between omega g star and MeG star. So what you do is, okay, so I'm going to focus on the case when g is finite for this. If you look, we can look at this enlargement of omega g, which we get just by looking at this direct sum over degrees n of omega g. Of omega g in degree to n the number of elements of g minus one. So again, this we can put this twiddle here just by considering omega as omega g as a homology theory and applying it to this S Sn times this reduced regular representation, complex reduced regular representation of G, the CG over C. And so Brucker and Hook constructed an orientation class for faithful G representations V, call it EV in this omega G twiddle in degree the dimension of V of S V. Okay, so this is just S V, I mean the one point compactification of V, such that if I invert it like so, if I take E C G C inverse in this inverse with this enlargement of omega g, then I precisely get these coefficients mu g star with e this orientation class and its inverse. And so what we get is that if we have evenness of this evenness conjecture for omega g big, then we would have it for mu g star. But we can see that maybe it's a lot more to ask evenness. It's a lot more to ask evenness for omega g big than just for omega g. So there really isn't a clean connection between the two evenness conjectures. Okay, so my work is, I have this counterexample to the flat version of the Mahomotopical evenness conjecture, which in particular would imply that the free version is also false. And I use this PC log subgroup. For example, you can think of it. Group. For example, you can think of it as unipotent lower triangular matrices in this GL4 of FP for some prime p. And what's really interesting is that Andrés Angel, Eric Semperton, and Carlos Segovia and Bernardo Uribe also have found that these class of groups with these non-zero Bogomolov multipliers actually also form counterexamples to geometric evenness conjecture. So I'll talk a little bit more about any. Talk a little bit more about any of some sort of speculation I have between the relationship between these sort of classes of groups, which we have here. But let me first talk a little bit about how I prove my method of proof for this counterexample. Okay, so the first step to my proof is to find this weak orientation class, which Class, which I can use to get between Hm for some with coefficients and some Machi functor M to get to Borel cohomology. And that's sort of like the key technical point, because from this, I can make a completion theorem for a G equivariant ring or module spectra. And I sort of show sort of like a more specific statement of it, but I prove it by sort of considering these Whitehead towers and using. Whitehead towers and using this sort of fact that this inverting this weekend orientation class gives boro collomology to see that if I take homotopic collimates, then I also get borocholomology in this case. And there's a little condition which I need to ensure convergence. And then how do I get the counterexample from this? Is that if I were to assume both flatness and evenness, so I need the whole sort of conjecture, then I can apply the completion theorem. I can apply the completion theorem to this Morava K-theory, smash over MU with MUG. I can consider it as a module spectrum over MUG. But here, and if we were to have flatness and evenness, then we should also have this evenness over here for this spectrum. And that cannot be true by these explicit calculations done in 1999 and 2001 by Igor Chris. I Chris, Igor Chris, and Lee to find odd elements in this more avoc-theory of BG for this specific example of G. Okay, so let me first start with this first point, because it's sort of going to be like a running theme, like finding these orientation classes throughout this talk. So let me sort of first state it a little bit more concretely. So, sort of, the key result to it is that if I So, sort of the key result to it is that if I have an orientable finite-dimensional faceful G representation V, and for some Machiefunctor M and some degree M greater than one, then I can consider this reduced homology of in degree M times the dimension of V of S M V with coefficients in this Mackey functor M. And I find that it's actually equal to just taking M and applying it. Equal to just taking m and applying it to this trivial orbit, this g over e. And specifically, I apply this to the case when m is the Burnside-Machifunctor, in which case it gives us that this homology should in fact be isomorphic to Z. And we can look at what element corresponds to one. And this will be my weak orientation class, this EV. And the key fact is that if I have a Machi functor m, then there exists some V for which if I invert this Ev. For which, if I invert this EV on this side with the HM, then that's equivalent to this borel cohomology. So here, the plus is just a disjoint base point. Yeah, again, I'm applying this to this trivial orbit G over E. And from this, I can use this fact to get my completion theorem. And so here's a condition which I need for. Here's a condition which I need for convergence, which is that just that there exists some finite degree for which if I look at any G space X, then if I have some module spectrum or ring spectrum K, then if I look at its Atiya Hirze, sorry, Ati-Hirzer-Brück spectral sequence, then it needs to converge to, if I look at the one converging to this K star X, then I need it to collapse. X, then I need it to collapse to this Rth page. And so if I have some ring spectrum E and I assume that I have some module spectrum K over E satisfying this condition, then my res and suppose also that there exists some class E V twiddle sitting in this E twiddle in degree dimension of V of this one point compactification S V. One point compactification Sv such that if I look at this composition, so here the mu is just the operation of E as a ring spectrum. So if I look at M smashed with this S, V minus its dimension, composed with just E smashed with this, this class is E V twiddle. So I get a map going from E to E smash s V minus the dimension of V. So I need this to be an equivalence. But then when Need this to be an equivalence, but then once I have that, I know that there exists this decreasing filtration Fi on these homotopy groups pi star GK, such that if I look at this limit of these I of pi star GK over this FI piece of pi star GK, then I get that this is isomorphic to pi star GF EG plus to k. So just warning that this is not, this isn't the spectrum E, it's a different meaning. meaning. Okay, sorry about that. And in F0 degree, it's just a whole thing. And sorry, thank you. F is a filtration of modules. Okay, so that's basically how I prove the evenness, my counterexample to the homotopical evenness conjecture. But again, I think it's really striking. What's really striking is that. It's really striking. What's really striking is that if we look at this class of groups, which were found to form this counterexample to the geometrical evenness conjecture, there are these groups of Bogomov multiplier non-zero. And so again, just reviews and some notation from the previous talks. This is the Bogomov multiplier can be described just by looking at these classes C in the second cohomology of G with Q over Z, such that if I look at N. Over Z, such that if I look at any abelian subgroup of G, then if I restrict to that H, then I get zero. And what's really interesting about this is that if I have a group with a non-zero Bogomolov multiplier, it actually forms a counterexample to the netter conjecture, which is a big question from algebra, which basically states that if I have this group G, this finite group G, and I put it to act faithfully. And I put it to act faithfully on some x1 up to xn. And I can look at this fixed points of g's action then on these rational functions. So I guess here I'm going to be using over c on these variables x1 and up to xn. And there's a question of whether this is isomorphic again to some field of rational functions c t1 up to tn for some new variables t. And so it's no T and so it's known in general to be false for g and like sort of one big method for finding counterexamples to it is by using this Bogomolev multiplier. And so in particular, all of these counterexamples to the geometrical leavenness conjecture are also counterexamples to the netric conjecture. And so my example actually, I think, has Bogomol of multiplier zero. So that actually. Zero, so that actually there's no way of seeing that doesn't immediately mean that it satisfies the network conjecture, so that this is true. Um, but yeah, I think it's really interesting a question of whether these geometric and homotopical evenness conjectures could possibly have something to do with the rationality, sorry, this should be a superscript, of these fixed points of this CX1 up to Xn. Yeah, because there's no really good sort of A good sort of way of seeing any sort of connection a priori, but it's a sort of some. I feel like this is some good sort of evidence that maybe there should be something there, some connection. Okay, so that's sort of my work on the homotopical evenness conjecture. But I also want to talk a little bit about some new methods that we have for calculating homotopical cobordism and geometrical cobordism. So let me start with homotopical cobordism. So, let me start with homotopical cobordism, because maybe that's more close with the previous topic. And so, basically, the big technique right now is this formal group laws. So, let me just say a quick review of non-equivariantly, how that relates to calculation of the coefficients, I'm sorry, of mu non-equivariantly. So, if I have a complex-oriented non-equivariant spectrum. A complex-oriented non-invariant spectrum E, then I can look at, I can apply E star to Cp infinity, and I end up getting this power series, E star and some variable U. And so I can look at tensor product online bundles, which is this map going from Cp infinity cross C P infinity to C P infinity. And this is contravariant, so I get this opposite map going from E star u to E star in two variables u and V. E star and two variables u and v. And I look at where it sends this element u. So to some power series, u denoted u plus over f with v. And this is called, this is a sort of what we end up getting is something called a formal group law. And so it's of this form. So I can write it as this sum with these coefficients aij of these powers. And sort of what's really striking is that. And sort of what's really striking is that it turns out that I can consider this Lazard ring on which I have the universal formal group law. So that's basically I just look at this Lazard ring, which is, I just put these coefficients A at J there, and then I mod out by exactly the relations which I need to make this sum a formal group law. So I need associativity, commutativity, and unitality. And I just write those out as relations in these coefficients. And so then there's this big theorem of Milner, Pullen, and Novikov. Theorem of Milner, Kullen, and Novikov: that if I look at these non-equivariant coefficients of mu, I can write it again as this zx1, x2, where these are these variables of even degrees. But it's actually the same as this Lazars ring. And so this might be a way, so one could ask if maybe this is true, that effect that we can describe MU star as some Lazard ring. Some Lazard ring. Yes. So, what is the addition on Mu star? So, like, there's two different algebraic structures, right? Orange that is the addition and like modic structures, right? Because Mu star has more of a multiplication than an addition. Is this an equality of vector spaces? What is this? Uh, this should be like an isomorphism of rings. So, like, I mean, yeah. Oh, so how do the X's relate to the Aij? Ah. AIJs, ah, so yeah, I'm actually. I don't know if there's like a good answer to that precisely because, like, like what do we have in the Lazard ring? It's like, like, these relations which you get for these AIJs are actually pretty horrible. It's not, yeah. But in principle, each AIJ can be represented as a kind of something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, definitely. It's a, yeah, it's an isomorphism reverse, so there is something which you can, yeah. And so, like, gequivariantly, we can try and define a gequivarient formal group law and gequivariant Lazard ring and say, is it true that MUG star should be that? And so, this was possible. So, the equivariant formal group laws are defined for a billion compact Lie groups, G, by Cole Greenlees and Igor Kriz. And okay, so I'm just going to give the definition for G finite and I'll say some words about how it needs to change if it's compact Lie. It needs to change if it's compact Li. So basically, the idea is that it needs to be this pair of data AR, which is a commutative ring A and an A algebra R, such that R needs to be complete with respect to some ideal I, whose intersection with A is zero. And I need to have this co-multiplication delta going from R to this completion of the tensor product of two R's with respect to this ideal, which I get from looking at. Ideal, which I get from looking at x tensor one and one tensor x, where x are these elements of this ideal I. So just denote it by this R tensor A complete with R. And this needs to be co-commutative, co-associative, and co-unital. And basically, I also need like an I-continuous map of A algebras going from R to the dual of A, G, hat, which is just this. Which is just this Pontryagin dual of G. And it needs to make this delta on the R compatible with the co-multiplication, which I get just from the group structure on this. And then finally, I think the most important thing is I need this system of these regular good coordinates. So if I have some L in this Pontryagin dual of G, then I need these coordinates X, L, and R, such that X, L, and R, such that there is this isomorphism of A algebras, first that A is needs to be the same as R over all of these good coordinates, and I needs to be expressible as like a product of these X L's. And if I look at some specific L in this Pontryagin dual, I need to be able to obtain X L from X1 by looking at this composition of first doing this co-multiplication and then And then, so I have this epsilon, which goes from R to this A G hat dual. So basically, I just need to look at precisely sort of like the L coordinate of that, which is like this epsilon L here. And I do identity on this R. And so I get to some A tensor over A with R, which is just R. So if I apply this to X1, I need to get XL. Yeah, so I'll just write x for x1 because you sort of can get all the other ones from it this way. Okay, and if g is not necessarily finite, so if it's just some abelian compact Lie group, then we instead of requiring our is complete with respect to this ideal, we instead require that it's complete with respect to the topology given by looking. Topology given by looking at, by taking, if I look at each of these ideals for some choice of L1 up to Ln in this Pontryagin dual, and I look at the ideal generated by XL1 up to XLN, I need to take these ideals to form a fundamental system of neighborhoods of zero. And with that topology, I need R to be complete. And so then it's a result that there exists some equivariant Lazard rank. Some equivariant Lazard ring such that we have this correspondence again, like in the non-equivariant case, between ring homomorphisms from Lg to A and formal group laws A and R. Okay, so before I say how this precisely, how exactly this works, how precisely this gives us this MUG coefficient, let me first. Coefficients. Let me first say some words about this orientation, which I have. So basically, if I have some G equivariant rank spectrum E, so again, let me denote its operation by mu, and it also needs to have a unit from the spheres to E. This is supposed to, this is called complex-oriented. If I all, if for any G-equivariant n-dimensional complex bundle, n-dimensional complex bundle, I have this Tom class U in e twiddle degree 2n of X with respect to this bundle psi. And I need this tom class to restrict to a unit if I look at pi naught of EH, which I can just write as this, for every fiber of this XH. Of this XH. And in the case when G is a billion compact Li, if I have a complex-oriented G spectrum E, then it determines a G equivariant formal group law with just taking A to be this even degrees of the homology of a point, and R we need to take to be the even degrees of this cohomology of. This cohomology of BUG of one. And so, how this applies here is that specifically, MUG is an example of a complex-oriented spectrum. And that's sort of why we know that there is, that it should have something to do with formal group laws. Okay. So let me go back to this computation of MUG star and the computation of this equivariant Lazard ring. Of this equivariant Lazard ring. So, first of all, let me introduce a little bit of notation. So, if I have, okay, maybe it's bad to use E for this also, but if I have some complete flag of this complete universe, this complete universe U, then it is, we can see here that it's like equivalent to the data of a sequence of simple C representations. So like L1. Oh, yes. Yeah, the formal equivariant formal group law is only sort of happy if it's a bit. Group law is only sort of happy if it's a billion. So, to this sequence of these simple representations L1, L2, L3, and so on. And so if I am given some gequivarient formal group law, AR, then I can look at this XEN, which I just get by looking at by multiplying these first. Multiplying these first n good coordinates which I get, which correspond to this L1 up to L n. And so we can, again, so sort of just by this formal group law structure, we get that R needs to be isomorphic to this. So these are, I use this double bracket just to mean that we allow the infinite linear combinations. So A on these variables XE1, XE2, and so on. X e2 and so on. And so then we can write, so then we can look at what we get from looking at this co-multiplication. And so it needs to be an element of R tensor R. So in particular, so I'm applying this co-multiplication to this x, this good coordinate corresponding to the trivial representation. And so I get this sum with these coefficients aij of these variables x ei tensor x ej. X E I tensor X E J. And so these all, this I need to remember this notation, this A I J E. And I also can consider this, these Euler classes I get by looking at this reduction of, as far as for some L in this Pontryagin dual of G, by looking at X L inverse in R and then reducing over X to get back to A. To get back to A. So if I complete x, then I can express this delta of x as a power series in these one tensor x's and these x tensor ones with coefficients in these Euler classes. It's AULs. And so if I look at the coefficients of like the underlying non-equivariant formal group law, so x. group law. So x going out to these just these normal Aij times xi x to the i tensor x to the j. I can then express these Aij as polynomials in these Aij E's and these ULs. And so the main theorem here of why we're doing this is that, so proved by Anke and Wiemeller for Zmod2 and then Haussmann in general, is that if I look at these coefficients m u g star, these are isomorphic to this. These are isomorphic to this G-equivariant Lazard ring, Lg. And we can even do a little bit better because it turns out that this equivariant Lazard ring actually has a concrete presentation. So this is this presentation is due to Igor Chris and Yense Liu. And what it says is that, in fact, just like in the non-equivariant case where I can express a Lazard ring as these Z. As these z on these coefficients Aij over some relations, I can do something similar here, where now I take these generators, these Aij E's, and these Euler classes, UL, and I need the following relation. So I just need that U naught is equal to zero. U for some for two L for two representations L and M, U L plus M needs to be U L plus with from a group. Plus, with the from a group law with um. And I need to also require that if I look at these relations on the Aij, which I get non-equivariantly in the Lazard ring, then I can express them also in these AIJEs and ULs just by looking again at these polynomial expressions I had for them from the previous slide. So I need to also require those relations. And then that's it. And we get the Lazard ring, and also, therefore, a Lazard ring, and also, therefore, a presentation of these equivariant coefficients of the homotopical complex cobordism. But recently, something which I'm really excited to talk about is that Pohu, who we have in the audience here today, actually computed the G-ecovariant Lazard ring for all primary cyclic groups G in even more concrete form. So, let me talk a little bit about that because I think the expression which he gets is a little bit more. Is a little bit more concretely usable than what we have here. So basically, let me talk a little. So to get to how she, to her result and how she proves it. So if I have some, let me just talk a little bit about this take diagram. So if I have some group G, I can look at this sequence going from this EG with a disjoint base point to S naught to EG twiddle. And then I get from this a tate diagram just on the top row of just. A tate diagram just on the top row, I've just smashed with E, and the bottom row, I've just smashed with F going from EG plus to E. I should mention that this is due to Greenleaf's and May. Okay, yes, due to Greenleas and May. And specifically, in the case when G is Z mod P, so sort of the first case of these kinds. Sort of the first case of these calculations which she has. So this looks like this diagram. I've just rerun it after taking fixed points and coefficients. And so up here, we have again EZ mod P smash over Z mod P with E coefficients and E Z mod P coefficients. And here I have geometric fixed points, which I'll say a little bit more about why that works in this case. And on the bottom, all we have is Borel homology, and we go by this norm map to Boral cohomology. And last, we have this Tate cohomology. Okay, so in general, this usually why had previously usually isn't for general G, this the same as this geometric fixed points, but here it is, just because I guess, so I previously had this I. This EG Twiddle smashed with E, and then I took the G fixed points. But here, and so I guess what EG twiddle really is, is we can consider it as this EF twiddle where I take F just to be this family of only the trivial subgroup of G. But usually in general, when you're making this geometric fixed points, I need to look at the family instead of all proper subgroups. Instead of all proper subgroups. But here, luckily, we're in Z mod, for this case, it's Z mod P. So these families are the same. So it really is just a geometric fixed points in that top corner. And so here I've again just written out the right-hand square of the Tate diagram. And here I have just MU, Z mod P. Then I have these geometric fixed points. On the bottom, I have boracohomology. I have boroch homology, and then I have take cohomology. And it turns out that if I take coefficients, this is actually, if I look at this, these if I look at this bottom map and this rightmost map, these are actually jointly onto. So if I take coefficients, what I actually get is a pullback of rings, which is sort of our method of calculating this coefficients of this mu z mod p. Coefficients of this mu z mod p. Okay, so sort of the components which we need then to compute this mu z mod p is a calculation of mostly of this geometric fixed point of mu. Okay, so let me say a few words about how that is computed. So this is a calculation due to Tom Deke and Igor Chris. So basically, again, I'm using the fact that MUZ, we're using the fact that. using the fact that mu z mod we're using the fact that mu z mod p is a complex oriented orientable z mod p equivariant spectrum so in particular i can look again at these euler classes which i get by looking at uh this element in mu z mod p in degree okay so this is the uh nth power of the pth root of unity so that's a i think of that as a representation um and then i minus two in the degree and Two in the degree, and so I get an element in there just coming from the complex orientation. And I can look at its image in this mu uh, maybe this should be downstairs down here, a subscript, mu z mod p in degree minus two. And then the coefficients of these geometric fixed points of mu z mod p can be expressed like so. So basically, it's this smash of these mu z. uh smash of these mu with this bu plus with a number of copies of these bu and i take these coefficients and then i have these euler class un and their inverse un inverse uh for all choices of um n between one and p minus one okay so then basically i can i need to choose some more variables to represent these vu pluses so basically i get this calculation I get this calculation that I can express these geometric fixed point coefficients as this mu star with these variables bin and these Euler and these Euler classes and their inverses for all i greater than zero and n between one and p minus one. And I can even further simplify the notation just by taking b0n to be this un and just taking u to b u1. Okay, so then to get this calculation of this sort of explicit calculation of these coefficients of mu z mod p, let me just introduce a little bit more notation. If I have some choice of n in z mod p cross, so one up to p minus one, it has an inverse. And I need, but I need to keep track of, so I have this n inverse and So, I have this n inverse, and n times n inverse needs to be one mod p, but I need to keep track of this multiple of p, which I also have, if I were to just do the calculation in z in the integers. So I can consider this universal formal group law on mu star. And let me just denote this, this, if I do it n times to some element x by this square brackets n times x. This square brackets n times x. And finally, let me denote if I take x plus over this formal group law with these n copies of y. So I can rewrite it like so. And then I can define these coefficients aij to the n times x to the i times y to the j. And finally, let me also write for this specific p, these coefficients of this p times of u. P times of u by this ci. Okay, and so here again, I've just rewritten this right square of the tate diagram. And what I have here, and so I have, so this is what I want, this MUZ mod P star. And so here are the geometric fixed points. On the bottom here, I have calculations of boreal cohomology and take cohomology. So this iota is just localization by this u. And this phi map is turns out to just be what I do is I take. Be what I do is I take if I try to apply it to p b i n, I end up getting this sum uh over these coefficients a i j n times u to the j. And if I were to apply it to this inverse Euler class, this B U 01, then I just get u inverse in this ring. And so using this, the calculation, which is Using this, the calculation which was done by Strickland for p equals 2, and in general is due to POHU, is that one can express muz mod p, these coefficients, mu z mod p star, as this ring over mu star with these variables, this u, these bij to the n's, these lambda n's, and these qi's, where here I have i greater than or equal to 1, j greater than 1, and n again in the C model. Again, in the C mod P cross over these following relations. So these first relations say that these Bij's need to encode these coefficients, these Aij. So I need to require that Bij to the N minus Aij to the N is equal to times Bij plus 1 to the N. These second relations need to sort of say that these Q's encode the Encode the different of these C's, which I get again from looking at those p copies of this variable u. And so I get, I need to require that qj minus cj is u times qj plus one. And finally, maybe this is the most interesting one because this is where these numbers, these k n's come back. And it's that if I look at these lambda n's and I apply it to this b01n, I end up actually getting one plus this k n times. Plus this Kn times Q1. So we really do need to keep track of those K. It's not just enough to look at this multiplication in the C mod p cross. And oh, yes. Oh, sorry. Tell us your metrics more or less. What is U, what is E, what is lambda versus P? Okay, I'll introduce this your results, so you can say something about that. So, you can say something about this? I think maybe it's better to say that there's actually a UN for each n in Zp from between 1 and P minus 1. Those are the Euler. Yes. Those are the things that will pass the best geometric influence. For the rest of them, maybe I can eat the guide. If you go back one way, and look at the lower left corner, the best guide is to. The best guide is to think about it in the parallel homology. And basically, the let me think. The BIs are, well, I can tell you maybe later with writing, but the point here is that if you start with a BI, that's the. Okay, that's the well the UN for n that's between zero and sorry between one and p minus one in the lower left corner is the n series. And then what you can do is that every time, for example, if you just start with those, you can think of those as the b0s, b zeros, and then Zeros, and then what you do is you peel out the subtract the bottom the constant term and then you divide by u. That is the bi j with a j increase cycle. And where if you and where if you go forward, the lambdas are kind of like a fake U over U over the lambda n is like kind of like u over the n series of u but except that doesn't actually exist in the lower left corner. So that's why it's like, for example, if you have p equals to three, you have two, you don't really have two u over two u. You have four u over two. So these are the ones. Are the ones okay? Okay, thank you. Um, and yeah, so this is a computation uh for the case of G, the cyclic group. Um, and there are also, and she also has calculations for all Z mod Z over Z mod P to the N. And basically, the problem there is since this top right corner of the Tate diagram, we don't already, we don't know again that it's this geometric fixed point. Don't know again that it's this geometric fixed points because you have other subgroups now. So, basically, what she does, I think, is use this is sort of basically she looks at these sort of intermediate degrees of these cyclic groups, these mod p to the n minus l plus one for these l's running. And she makes this uh staircase diagram, which looks like this. Um, and yeah, and using this again, she Yeah. And using this, again, she manages to make this actual computation in explicit presentation of these coefficients mu of z mod p to the n. Okay, but let me just in the last few minutes also say how actually we can use these sort of this type of equivariant stable homotopy theory to calculate the geometric. To calculate the geometrical cobordism as well. And so this is the work of Jack Carlisle. So basically, let me again now let me define this G pre spectrum now by looking at V-dimensional subspaces for some representation V of V direct sum with these infinite copies of C, which is, yes, which is what we would. And if let me take this again, this. This again, this Tom space with respect to this universal bundle. And so if I spectrify this pre-spectrum, I actually get a genuine ROG graded G-equivariant spectrum. And the work of Jack Carlisle is that if I look at the Z-graded degrees, that these really are actually the geometric cobordism groups. So this is a genuine geo-variant spectrum. A genuine G-equi-variant spectrum, which somehow contains this data of the naive G-spectrum and the naive homology theory, which we get just classically from the omega-G. And so again, let me, again, if I have, I can ask if I have this orientability, in which case, if I have an orientable G-spectrum, then it's in particular for some. For some representation v, it should be v minus two times dimension periodic for any complex representation v. So the complex degrees really don't give us new information there. And for example, we've already seen, so we have the sporal cohomology, examples we've already seen are these boral cohomology. So again, now I need to have these rings to have some sort of G-action. K-theory, and of course, this MUG. And of course, this mug. But non-examples are this hm, just for some coefficients and some green functor m, connective k-theory, which I get by just looking at tau greater than or equal to zero of kg, and now this genuine g-equivariant spectrum for geometric cobardasome. So it's not actually equivariant. Sorry, it's not actually orientable. But I can ask if there exists some sort of way of. Ask if there exists some sort of way of getting between them. So, if there's some sort of weak orientation class which I have in these non-examples, which I can invert to get to these corresponding complex-oriented theories, which I had on the previous page. And so this is sort of where I think like sort of all the stories I've been telling today sort of come together, because it's yes for this connective cave theory by Atiya, and Brocker and Hook show it's yes for this geometrical proposal. Geometrical cobordism. And I used in my completion theorem that there is a way of doing it for Hm. And so we can ask maybe like how generally does that go? So like, how generally can we say that there exist weak orientations to obtain orientable equivariant spectra? So Jack Carlisle, in particular, investigated the case of Omega. The case of Omanga G in detail for G, the case of Zma2. And maybe I'll say something about his results in the last few minutes. And here it turns out that this weak orientation is precisely the reason why, so in fact, it is, so it is injective in this case, but it's precisely the reason why it fails to be an isomorphism here. Okay, so he actually finds. A presentation of these coefficients for Zi Ma2. So let me just talk a little bit about that. So again, so this should be omega, actually. This should be omega Ziema 2 star. And what it says is that how he does it is basically he looks at this formal group law x plus f y and you can express it in you can In you can express it in mu star power series in x and use those as coefficients for power series on y. And in particular, if you invert x in this, you see that this x plus f with y is actually a unit. So you can make some sort of, you can write this inverse, I can write it as sum x naught plus d1 times y plus d2 times y square, where these di's live in these mu. DIs live in these MU star X, these Laurent series. Okay, and I'm running clever like with Bohu result with sort of encoding these coefficients somehow. And but the sort of the key point is that in this case, this sort of equivariant. Of this sort of equivariant formal group law, sort of type of computation approach actually helps you get explicit computation of these coefficients of these omega Z mod 2. But let me just say, but since that maybe is very formal, let me just say a little bit more about that Pontriaga and Tom map, which we have and this Wikor. And this weak orientation class. So, if I let me just denote the complex sign representation by C minus. And so I can consider, if I look at C minus, a direct sum with this infinite direct sum of these copies of C, I can consider this specific vector space, one-dimensional vector space, just by looking at one in the second coordinate. And this is a point living in this Grassmannian space. Space this Grassmannian space. And now to get to the spectrum, I need to take the Tom spaces and I get this map from S2 to omega Z mod 2 of C minus. And then I can, so this corresponds then to just thinking about what this is, this corresponds to some Tom class, weak Tom, this element called the weak Tom class. This element called the weak tongue class, tau, living in pi 2 minus the 2 in the degree of 2 minus this sine representation of this geometric cobordism spectrum. And it turns out that the map of Zma2 equivariant spectra going from omega Z2 to Mu Z Ma 2 actually induces an equivalence between Mu Z Ma 2 and Omega Z Ma 2 with tau inverted. Okay, so just to loop back to sort of the sort of initial intuition behind sort of these topics, which I was talking about today. So we know that this Tom theorem fails equivariantly. And we also know that this evenness, even this evenness fails, both for geometric and for homotopical cobordism. And so now we have some ways of calculating using these formal group laws, these coefficients of these MUGs and these omega-Gs in the case of these primary cyclic groups. And we have some sense of, at the very least, we have some sense of the fact that this sort of orientation maybe is sort of the reason why we don't have this isomorphism. Isomorphism. But in the case of ZMOT2, we actually know that this is the only problem and we have injectivity. And so that's sort of what I sort of have talked about today, but still a lot remains open. Recently, there's this computation of the coefficients of the symmetric groups on three elements, equivariant, homotopical. Homotopical cobordism computed by Ho Hu, Igor Kriz, and Yunze Liu. And there's a new approach to calculating MU equivariant with some dihedral group, DP, and these coefficients. And there's some approach to this created by UTALDIO. But in general, both MUG star and omega G star remain pretty. And omega G star remain pretty mysterious. So, for example, I think a really interesting question would be whether either of them actually contain genuine sort of odd elements. Because I actually am not sure for mine, because it sort of requires both flatness and evenness to get the counterexample. But that's all I have prepared today. Thank you, Romas. Thank you for this nice talk. We start with a question from Zoom. I'm here. Yes, let me. Wait. So, can I clarify? Is homotopical evenness known for abelian groups? It is, it is. Okay. And so that's the result of Lefler and Comazania. Okay. Yeah. Over the MUSM. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Sure. And in your case, so I mean, my algebra is pretty bad, but so you contradict flatness. So, you contradict flatness. Yes. So, does that mean you get torsion classes? Is that right? Um, yeah, so it's unclear whether the problem is that there's torsion or the problem is that there's actually just some odd elements. I see. Okay. But the odd elements might themselves be torsion. Yeah, maybe. Okay. It's yeah, it's basically since like the way I got it was sort of just from technicalities of like this. It's really, we don't have any, I don't have a way of getting like precise. Have a way of getting like a precise sort of explicit computation of that those coefficients in that case. Okay, cool. Thanks. This nice idea that you showed of Carlisle, I don't know who did it, on which you put a representation on the front, and then you just take the infinite, whatever dimensional space, and you do some, you spectrify, and then. spectrify and then and and by doing this you achieve something that i don't understand very well uh but but what is it that you're doing somehow what is that you're controlling you you're controlling some sort of fixed point data what is it that that is happening on this construction by by forcing just one specific dimensional space there v and then what's what's yeah you have an intuition what's going on Yeah, do you have any intuition what's going on? I yeah, actually, I somewhat don't because I guess, okay, so so this is uh only work with Jack Carlisle, so I haven't had anything to do with it. Um, but yeah, mainly he has in his paper, he really only focuses on the case of G equal to Z mod two. Um, yeah, so he doesn't really say very much about this sort of this idea of how. This sort of this idea of how this sort of gives us this genuine spectrum for this geometrical comportism. Yeah. Especially because the statement at the bottom doesn't mention the V. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess. And on top, you would take any V. Yeah, that's a sort of, yeah, that's right. Like, it's sort of sort of the idea is that, like, this theorem is basically just to say that the coefficients I get of this geometry. coefficients I get of this geometrical, this sort of possible geometrical quartism spectrum really do give you geometrical quartism. If I look at the degrees which we have anyway, just from the sort of like the classical side of the story. So it it's just to say that this sort of this spectrum really is useful for calculating these B equals C. Oh, I guess, okay, if it's I guess if it's trivial. I guess if it's trivial, then it's those are like the those were those are like the rethink of those as like the but then there the result is that is the gen mean g spec in ROG grade right yeah it's ROG graded yeah that's just for all for all vector spaces we define this is a genuine this is an ROG graded prespect yes means a reference that's not necessarily That's not necessarily irreducible. No, I think, I mean, I used, I think, you know, it's not necessarily irreducible, but if it's Zma2, it's just copies of these are copies of the trivial and the signs. So this thing, this omega G V that's built from the that's Boot 3 spectrum is a collection of those E V's is Collection of those EVs is vibrated in the case when T is E12. Yes. So, but we're only the JAG, I say I have JAG really only sort of calculate the Z breaker. Also, how did you get the Z graded? You just take the fixed bit. Thank you, everyone.
