And I also would like to thank the organizers for my invitation that is very nice to work on and beautiful. Thank you again. Okay, so today I'm going to talk about the stability program and the comprehensive care process. So we'll see that this program. This was doing between two concentric infinitely long cylinders, like this, and the inner cylinder is one text, is uniform skill meta, and the other one is a text. Then you easily imagine that this kind of ramping at all with a And indeed, when the rotational speed of beta is sufficiently small, then this laminar, it's called a critical problem, is scary at that. Now increase the rotation speed omega, yeah. Then due to the central Fourier pulse, due to the southern value of this rotation speed of mega, In your memory you will find the unique patterns of vortex like this. Okay, this is so-called theta vortex. And mathematically this phenomena is formulated in rotational stability problem for brain dynamic applications. And in this talk, I don't consider this problem for a For a compressor. So here the spaceboard we can see this usually depends on the heliocity of the Terra vortex. So I will denote by the layman alpha of the Terra vortex and then the critical velocity is a function of the layman alpha. Of the layer data. So let me first consider the heat compressor program. This is a cluster program under study a long time ago. Here you see the incongruous system and the unknowns and the pressure P and the velocity V and Yeah, uh alpha is a rate number and it's proportional to the uh omega versus the omega of this process. And then this uh system of equations, graphic speaking, flash file and several linear are always system, so a class file population theories such as the such as the ground available and so on is a bit of to see the bioportation and the stability of the air objects. So the situation, so the first results obtained by Verity and Vietovic, which there exists crystal radio matter below which the quad block we see is stable and is stable and about this wetter number papered problem becomes unstable on theraports on x. Near the onset of instability the theraport x is stable because the data patient is super referred. So it's it can be shown and seen by Seen by the theory of ground bits and the situation as well. So here you have arboxes and reinforcements. Then for this, this you have this kind of cup. It's called a neutral cup. It is medium at alpha equals to sun. alpha equals some alpha c and when you fix alpha here for example then below this curve the vector is stable and the two pi over alpha perturbations and about this curve the theta protects the parables and it's stable and the two pi are determined so So you can also consider the stability of material X and the non-deadened particles, but the decays between. So in this case, the stability of the theta of X depends on its weight number. So for some range of alpha and R, theta of X becomes uns. Of X becomes unsettled. So not very called variations. Then you have a protein. So here you have neutral curve and then there appears new curve above this neutral curve like this. So uh in the new car, tailor bortics is stable and the relevant alterations, while between two cars, tailorbortic is in this region are unstable. This is the so-called eta stability, no? And this uh stability writer reports from the ER's analysis. So you can see a uh So you can see a spectrum of the inelectron occurred around the terra optics, you can see this one. Then if the alpha radius are increasing, then at the alpha c you have theraport x with length alpha c is scale. And for the scalable therapy, the case is the same as the correct For the spherical theoretical text, you can also consider the non-linear problem, but it's a really bit uh hard problem and to solve it took a long time. Finally, we share this disability of the terrible text with Principal Wayna and he also and he also obtained detailed asymptotic behavior or population of the parallel text. And the case in the case in Darshan exclusively in Z virtual. Here you have one dimensional heat corner in Z variable with correspond zero called the pair of text. For the pair of text. This is due to the translational variance in deviation. So, in this talk, I will consider this program for compression equations for a barotropic query. So, here the system, continuity equation, the equation of motions, and the pressure P is assumed to be a smooth function of A smooth function called the base key row and its derivative row called one is just normalized as well, due to some non-dimensional equations. Then here you have the Reynolds number and the exam is a marker. Okay, so in this talk I must tell the BC It's close to the constant state one and the low handwork such and the small. So the situation is quite small close to the incompressed regime, but the incompressed the system is quite a linear high-power power system, so some care is needed. Okay, so already first use the marketation problem and so the theta case is just is expected to be periodic in G variable. So I impose a periodic boundary function in G division. So consider two type of R coordinate functions. And in the regular coordinates, the domain In circular coordinates, the domain is described, the inner boundary is R equal to R1 and the outer one R equal to R2 and C L R. Then the boundary conditions on the radial boundaries, if we represent the velocity field symbolical coordinates, the altimetrical component neutral component V theta is equal to 1 on the boundary, this is due to the non-dimensionalization. On the other hand, outer boundary it takes zero. And the R and D C components are also zero on the outer. Then you can easily show that the system, the program has a special instruction representing the critical In the Quebec row, I denote it by UC each I know and the verse CP that has only a single component and it is the same verse profile as in the case of the incompressible program. And the MCO is a smooth function of R and it's quite close to the constant thing. Close to the constant, say one when the mammal vector is sufficiently small. Then, if the radius, radius and mammal numbers are sufficiently small, you can show the asymptotic stability in the complex area of vegetables. So, now the question is: what happens in the stability of the petrol when Of uh vetting ground when the radius number increases. Yeah, so uh okay, so I divide the uh the equations into the perturbation one and the magnitude perturbation is denoted by phi, it's state by xi square and the velocity velocity perturbation by that. But now, then here we are governed by this system of equation. So on the left hand side, I collect all of linear arms, and the left hand side I noticed in linearity. It's difficult to control the pointers. Okay, so the Okay, so the first two lines on the left hand side is a bristle part and has the dyspotic structure. Yeah, the rural parts. This requires instability of the wavelength. And then the linearity in the momentum equation takes this form, Wayne W plus all circles. W plus all the sign squares. Therefore, if you write the inside zero, you obtain this incongruous system. So you could expect the serial allocation of anomaly to car in the incongressive program. In this case, the main difference to the incongressable program appears from appears from uh continuity equation here uh this um non-linearity reports derivative loss so in the standard setting of the bilocation analysis it's not uh presential uh so uh transfer theory uh is not applicable to this program directly Okay, uh consider the uh station control. Here I denote the no uh linear operator uh by A epsilon R and I take the Reynolds number as a part of the parameter. And N and G denote the nonlinearities and N is the nonlinearity coming from the Here D coming from the continuity equation which reports the verticals. And G is in some sense almost half. So then this problem using what there is trigger solutions solution that corresponds to the weight draw. So I'd like to consider, I'd like to look for non-traditional solutions. not only a solution of this system for range of the range then you obtain alpha so fix alpha close to the critical wave namda in the case of the incompressive curve. Then you can find a critical radius lambda under each signal. Are their epsilon, which is the function of alpha, and for reverse number about this reference number, you obtain some non-terriver expression. And the non-terrigial branch is characterized by a small chronometer data. The reference number is this form. Here A each I exactly positive number. positive numbers so you have each book super picture and the solution the density is in H4 and verse D in H5 with niche the mean value condition for the density and the solution is all the data so it's substantially quite small and the And the ring store part here is an eigenfunction of the zero eigenvalue for the linearized operator of therapy. And capital units are delta unique sign delta denger. And this is a shear function with respect to parameter delta with varies in this solar space. So this stays in contrast to the case of the incompressible program and in the incompressible program the remainder is a shielding function of gap. So this is due to the hypothetical statewide. Okay, here I constructed the solution H4, H5, but you can consider construct H2 and H3, but to consider the stability, I need construct in higher order surface. And also uh we can also uh construct a solution uh which described We describe a mass or the HCR when the mass is small. And this is important to consider the stability of the air process. Okay, so you have a senior feature to the heat compression program and neutral path and we know neutral path the payer voltage is paid for scale and about this neutral. And above this neutral part, you have compressible care. But as for the study, due to hypocritical aspects, you need some care. Consider the study under the unique valuations, but due to some typical reason, I hear it cause action matricity in the alteration. In the motor sheet. So the real operator is denoted by the T-dimensional data. It takes this form, the operator around the present law and the remainder counts. These remainders are coming from the linearization of the non-linearity and they all appear. So when delta is zero, these 0 is 2 times marks. Here A is coming from the linearization in the continuity equation. So you have possible the derivative of P with square shant W epsilon z. This W epsilon z uh goes to zero, vanishes when data goes to zero. But the But so here you have parcel data here. Therefore, this is the not real valuation, kind of senior valuation. Okay, then you have the following starving z of x alpha across the critical wave map. Then x i 1 z are sufficiently small. We are the imagery here. And in much IDRC, you have two ideant targets. One is zero, which is a semi-simple eigenvalue with Mars 32. And the other one is delta, lambda delta, which is a simple eigenvalue and has the C2 smoothness in delta. And uh lambda epsilon delta as this asymptotic expanding A is A epsilon child sequence. So this lambda epsilon delta is stable. And here the lambda etc if we consider uh incompressive programme, then it's a vector analysis, so that's a uh impact analyzing data. impa analytic delta. But in this case, just CQ. Okay, then the parent zero coming from the consultation mass and the transfer environment in z direction. So the eigen space is found by the mass derivative of the family of η vertex and the z derivative. And the Z derivative here. Okay, so this is the result for the stability of the Loving Path directions. So you have strictly stable part and zero eigenvalues with Mark Risky 2 and one stable eigenvalue which is all the data set. And when data possesses And when data is there, this lambda is data goes to zero. So in fact, uh geolinearizot combines the operating around the vertical at the peripheral Reynolds number. In the e-compression case, this minting process is the same. The muting process is a bigger value, but in the case of the compressive program, it's a kind of senior valuation process, so you need some care to analyze. And to show this result, you need some smoothness for the lambda X7 data, which comes from the smoothness property of the results. So the reverb is denoted by R epsilon delta of lambda and the smoothest property of this referral comes from the vertical theorem of this and we have a form so the the imaginary axis the only But the imaginary axis belongs to the resorbent set, except the neighborhood of the origin, and you have this estimate. As for the smoothness, if chapter F belongs to H3 and H2, then the resolvent is shear function resolvent applied to F is a shear function of delta disbarging, this solar system. disparaging these solar spaces. And the data uh derivatives uh satisfy this thing. So combining these smoothness properties and the regarding velocity, you obtain the design uh as we expand the preferred identity heights. So now uh to share the uh study. Uh Sally Sali Ahmed. Robless question. Okay, so now right. Okay, so uh robust operations. So consider the stability and the absolute container for the thing that. Then the linearized operator is functional as an operator on the software space on the four series. Then you obtain a similar picture to the e-compressment program. So you have neutral path, about this neutral path, you have F and the stability and Inside the colours. And the picture, when you charge the table, this picture converges the incontext picture. Okay, this was called the linearized analysis, and in fact, you have the following spectral information. Around the imaginary axis, you have two lines, permit right. Characterized by C. One is given here, so it's always legally, so stable I stable spectrum. On the other hand, this one, the stability determined by the sign is better than positive, it's stable, better than negative mass stable. beta is negative mass. And beta is given by this this one. Therefore beta nearly it corresponds to the acres insert image. So you have this subject. So now when better posted, so you have the static division, you are in the stability division, and then you easily see that from this prior From this parameterization, uh the parallelization behaves diffusively in that sign and the nonlinear problem is at the core. So if the wave number is the physical one, then the initial perturbation belongs to H2 and H1, and sufficiently small the perturbation in this global time. Lower in time and extension decays in the order titanal minus one clock. So this is the same decay as that of the heat fire. And in fact, the asymptotic reading part of the paltration is described by sigma 1, sigma 2, and these quantities are governed by this system of decreasing equation. Reasonable decision operations. Okay, so okay. Thank you for attention.
