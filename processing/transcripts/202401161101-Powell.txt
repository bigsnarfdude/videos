Always an experience that I enjoy. So, as my title suggests, I'm going to talk about the continuity of the Lyapunov exponent for quasi-paradicles. And we've seen the Lyapunov exponent talked about both yesterday and in Anton's talk and in Zhengi's talk. And then also in the last talk, the Lyapunov exponent was talked about. And in fact, the continuity of the Lyapunov exponent was discussed and required in a few results. So most of those were for the Laplace exponent associated with Schrodinger operators, and I'm going to take a zoomed-out view of that. I'm not going to talk about Schrodinger co-cycles, I'm going to talk about something a bit more general. So what is a co-cycle for us? So a co-cycle is going to be a pair, A and omega, where omega is going to be an element of the D-dimensional torus, and A is going to be a matrix. And A is going to be a matrix-valued function. And we're going to view this pair as acting on Td cross C2 into itself, which simply takes a point x in the torus and a point, a vector v in C2, and it maps it to x plus omega. We shift x by the frequency omega, and then we act on. And then we act on V by A of X. And A is a map from the D-dimensional torus into the space of 2 by 2 matrices with complex entries. And I'm going to put a few kind of regularity assumptions on A, otherwise, there's not a whole lot we can say concretely. So I'm going to assume that A is Assume that A is, to begin with, at the very least, an analytic function on this torus. So you can view the torus as the unit cube in Rd, in which case this is simply an analytic function of d variables. We're also going to assume, for technical reasons, that the determinant of A of X does not identically vanish. Does not identify vanish. And we'll see why that's a reasonable assumption when we actually define a Lachman's bunch. So, what are some examples? Well, we've seen some examples. The Schrodinger co-cycles are some examples. So, these are the cosine where you take A of X, and let's say also. And let's say also depends on e to be e minus v of x minus 1, 1, 0, where v is the potential of some quasi-periodic Schaunger operator. These happen to be SL2C matrices. And we want to be a bit more general. We want to consider arbitrary 2x2 matrices, more or less arbitrary, so long as the determinant doesn't dynamic. So long as the determinant doesn't dynamically vanish. And for that, we need to actually broaden our scope a little bit beyond Schrodinger and consider Jacobi. So a motivating example would be the Jacobi cocycles. For those that are unfamiliar with the Jacobi cocycles, these come from the Jacobi operator, HU acting on L2 of Z, which takes the form A of X. A of x plus n omega acting on u n minus 1 plus a of x plus n plus 1 omega conjugate acting on u n plus 1 plus v of x plus n omega acting on u of n. Adding the conjugates to a simply ensures that this is self-adjoint. That this is self-adjoint, taking V to be a real-valued analytical potential. And from here, you can study the transfer matrix to study the associated eigenvalue equation. And if you do that, you can massage that transfer matrix to extract a cosine. When you take A of X to be E minus V X V X instead of a minus Instead of a minus 1, you get an A of X. Instead of a 1, you get an A of X plus omega conjugate. And you still get a 0 here. And so this would be the generator for a Jacobi cosy, sort of. There should be a division here, but we're going to ignore that for the moment. So this is kind of the motivating example for our talk of an M2C-valued. Our talk of an M2C-valued quasi-paradic co-cycle. And for co-cycles, one of the most important kind of properties is that you can iterate them. So if we have this action A, this pair A omega, acts on X V this way, then you can actually apply this co-cycle n times. And if you apply this cycle n times, let me just denote this by A n x omega. x omega is a of x plus n minus 1. Omega times a of x plus n minus 2. Omega times so on, all the way up to a of x. So you can iterate this cosycle n times, we'll denote this by a superstrip n, and it's just a product of n of these matrices. Of n of these matrices as you shift along the orbit, given by your dynamics. A very important thing that I want to emphasize is for the moment I'm not making any restrictions on omega. It can be absolutely anything in T D. It doesn't have to satisfy any Diophantine conditions. It doesn't have to satisfy even giving rise to some kind of ergodic shift. It can be absolutely anything for the moment. And as the title of my talk suggests, I want to study the Lyapunov exponent for this code cycle. So what is the Lyapunov exponent? We've seen it already a few times. For completeness, let me just write it out one more time for everybody. So we're going to define. Everybody. So, we're going to define the Lopinov exponent as the limit as n goes to infinity of 1 over n, the integral over the d-dimensional torus of the log of the norm of the nth iterate of our cosycle integrated with respect to x. This is going to be a normalized Lebesgue measure on Td, so again, the unit cube and RT. Cube and Rt. And this differs from the Lyapunov exponent that's been defined in a few critical cases. So if omega doesn't give rise to an ergodic transformation where your ergodic measure is Lebesgue measure, this doesn't actually agree with the Lyophon exponent as has been defined from the dynamical systems point of view. But we're going to define it this way in that case because we're going to see that this actually has. That case, because we're going to see that this actually has some interesting properties defined this way. If omega does give rise to an ergodic shift with ergodic measure, Lebesgue measure, this agrees with how the Liophant exponent has been defined already. So, existence of this limit follows from Fouquet's lemma. So, this is a subadditive sequence of real numbers, which is why we integrated. Numbers, which is why we integrated. So this limit does exist by some additivity. And each of these guys is finite by the assumption that the determinant is not identically zero. So if the determinant was allowed to be identically zero, it could work out that some of these end up being minus infinity, and we'd like to avoid that if at all possible. So we're going to make this assumption. That's why we take this as a determinant assumption. And our central And our central question is, is this continuous? Is L as a function of A and or omega continuous? As we've already seen in the last talk, continuity of the Lyapunov exponent does have some consequences for spectral theory. Spectral theory beyond those that were already mentioned, some other consequences. So in d equals 1, if you study the almost Matthew operator, this is when this is a Schrodinger cosycle and v is 2 lambda cosine of 2 pi x, then continuity of the oval exponent can be used to actually get an explicit formula for An explicit formula for the Lyon of exponent. And that explicit formula did play a role in the proof by Avala and Junior Skaya for the Ten Martin. This also, continuity naturally plays a role in Avala's global theory. Avala's global theory. And you can also extract quantum dynamical information about Schrodinger operators or even Jacobi operators if you assume positivity and continuity of the output exponents. So there are various situations where you can extract logarithmic upper bounds. This was done by Judah Miskai and myself, and then independently done using alternate methods by Shimis and Sotin. So, what can we actually say about the continuity of the optimum exponent in this setting? Well, we can say a few things. So So the first theorem I would like to mention, this is for the moment 2022, says the following. Suppose we have our co-cycle, A omega, as we were stated, as before. So A is So A is an analytic function, the determinant does not vanish identically. Then two things are true. Continuity is true in essentially two ways. Let me call this 31. And this is 1a. So first of all, L of A omega is a continuous function in A. In A for any fixed wind. It can be rationally independent to rationals. These could all be, all components could be rational. You could have a mixture. It doesn't matter. The output of exponent is going to be a continuous function of our cosycle A. More interesting, More interesting, some might say, is what happens if you vary omega? Can you vary omega? Is there any sort of continuity in that regard? And the answer is yes. So if omega naught is such that the components Are rationally independent irrations. Then the Lyapunov exponent, A omega is continuous in omega at This omega naught. So, what is kind of this saying? It's saying that if you have a Lyophon of exponent and you have some omegas which are all irrational, then you can approximate that Lyophon exponent using omegas which give rise to something that's periodic, a periodic shift, for example. And you can actually explicitly compute what those are for periodic omega. For periodic omega, they're associated with spectral radius, radii of matrices. So it's something that you can actually zip your teeth into and compute. Right. Yes. Great point. So this is sharp. B is sharp in the sense that if we remove the rationally dependent irrational part of omega, if you take Irrational part of omega. If you take any other omega which doesn't satisfy this, you can actually find explicit cocycles A for which you have a discontent with an omega at omega naught. These were first constructed by Avila for SL2C co-cycles when D is one, and it's not too difficult to take those examples and push them to D larger than one. So this is certainly shocking. So, this is certainly shock. So, um, yes. So, this is basically this theorem in generalized previous work of Gandhi on the Cheney of the cycle. Yes, so I was about to mention exactly that. So, historically, the question of continuity of these Lyotan exponents really starts out in the early 2000s with the work of Gonstein and Schlug for Schrodinger cocycles when d is one and omega satisfies a particular diaphanic condition. So that was the first known result about continuity for Schrodinger cosamples. And this argument Co-cycles. And this argument is specific to Schrodinger co-cycles. You can't really leave that world. Next was the work of Ogen Jinriskaya, who studied the SL2C case when D is equal to 1. So SL2C when D is 1. When d is 1. So they have an analog of our theorem 1a for what happens when your d-dimensional torus is dimension 1, d is 1. This also, so this is for 1A, this is 1A and 1B that work. There's also work by Avalo. Genius guide. So the first item is even more specific, right? It's not continuous in A, even if you're in the classroom-friendly cycles, you have to vary the energy. You can't vary the cycle function, right? Say, Lydia, sorry. So, I mean, right now it reads as it's continuous in A in the classroom-friendly market cycles for D1 and omega in DC. Yeah, so it's really for energy. For energy. Yes, you're absolutely right. Yes. Thank you. Yes, so this is for energy. This was originally written for the Schrödinger co-cycles, but the argument works for SL2C, whereas this does not. And then there was work by Avala Ginmaskaya and Sedel, who did 1A and 1B in the case, again, D is equal to 1, but instead of looking at F. But instead of looking at SL2C, they did MNC. So this is all for D is equal to 1. Well, what about D greater than 1? Well, what is known? And that's much more restrictive. So as was mentioned, the first result in this direction was by Borgan in 2005. And for deep greater than 1. For deep greater than 1 in the SL2C case. Again, the original argument was written for Schrodinger, but it works for SL2C without any effort analogs of 1A and 1B. So our result pushes this result beyond the SL two C regime into the M two C regime. So we allow for singular co-cycles now, not just the cosycles with the terminate one. Co-cycles with determinant one. And then there are a few results by Duarte and Klein dealing with D greater than 1, but omega diaphan. And they can get analogs of 1A in the regime of M and C. So we also push those results. Push those results in the case where N is 2 to arbitrary underneath. Can you deal with not SL2 but symplectic? Yes, that is a wonderful question. The answer is no. This is a question that I would love to be able to answer in the affirmative. It's something that I've been thinking about for since I was writing this up, and the answer is no, I can't handle simple. No, I can't handle symplectic at the moment. But that is the eventual goal: to push this to symplectic. Well, in fact, push it to MNC would be the real goal. But if 2x2 is not important, it's... Well, 2x2 is important here. For our result, 2x2 is important. You can't go beyond 2 by 2 at the moment for our argument. Okay. So all of these and our first theorem here has really one major thing in common. They all work explicitly for analytic cosecles. A has to be analytic. You can't really drop that seemingly in any of these arguments. Because they're based on obtaining certain Obtaining certain large deviations, and to get large deviations, the arguments that were developed by Borgan and Goldstein require kind of analyticity. So the question that one could ask is, all right, is that simply an artifact of the proof? Is it possible to go beyond analytic? You just have to use a different method, or do you have to kind of massage this method a little bit? Is it at all possible? Is it at all possible? And this appears to be a I think I just want to mention like it's not entirely true that there are no results outside of analytic kind of. Exactly. There are results, and I'm about to mention. Yes. I'm being purposely obtuse, yes. Alright, so removing analytic statement. So what if we want to go into the extreme other side of analua? I say the extreme other side, but still having some regularity. What happens if we look at A, which is continuous? What, if anything, is known here? It's known that the Lyapunov exponent That the Lyapunov exponent is discontinuous at non-uniformly hyperbolic cosecants. It's continuous at many, many, many. What if, okay, we have to have clearly some regularity if we want some kind of general statement about continuity? Continuity. What about if we add a lot of regularity? So, what if we say, well, let's look at C infinity. This is pretty close to analytic, right? So, surely if there's anything to be said, we can say it about C infinity. And the answer is, no, even here, even in C infinity, there exist counterexamples. There exist counterexamples. L look at A. Omega has discontinuities. Alright, so this, so in the continuous sets, you can look at work by Fuhrman. For this, you can look at examples constructed by Jidmirskaya. Got it. I apologize. And Marx, and also counterexamples constructed by Wang and you. Examples of smooth A, where you still get discontinuities in the Lyophonics problem. Okay, but as was mentioned, But, as was mentioned, there are positive results, right? So, what are the positive results that exist? So, in d is equal to 1, the following is known. The following is known. So, if we look at Schrodinger plus ideas and the potential. And the potential V lives in a particular Gevre class on T1. Then, and omega, which is just sitting on the one detour for the circle, is irrational. Then you have continuity is continuous in A for S smaller than 2. The space, the Gevre class is essentially a way to kind of kind of smoothly interpolate between C infinity and analytics. So when S is 1, this is the set of analytic functions, and when you increase S, you get less and less regular. And one way to view this is looking at G, it imposes certain decay on your Fourier coefficients. So that's what's known in D is equal to 1, and it's explicitly for Schrodinger curve cycles. What about when? What about when d is greater than 1? Is anything known? Maybe it's good also to mention the sharp transition option. Thank you. Yes. This is sharp by... So this was originally done by Klein in 2005, and it was recently shown in 2021 by Geo Wang. Wen Yo and Jacques then this is sharp. So there are examples of these co-cycles where V is taken to be in Gs, where S is strictly larger than 2, and you get it as consummative. So this transition is sharp. 2 is the cutoff. You cannot expect anything better than 2. 2. What about when d is greater than 1? What is known? Is anything known? And the answer is yes, some things are known, but not nearly to the level as what's known when d is equal to 1. So by a result of Klein from 2013, again, if you look at the Schrödinger-Christ cycle, You take V in Gs on T D, so particular Gevre class. You take omega to be diophantine. Then the associated Lyapunov exponent as a function of E, because it's a short number cosmic. Because it's a short-up cycle, the continuity in E. Does anything known? Then this is continuous in E when, for the co-cycle associated to lambda V, where lambda is strictly larger than some lambda naught, which depends on v and on omega. And this is based on an argument by Arguments by Borgenga, Ochtin, and Schlag, where to get a large deviation, they had to assume largeness of a coupling constant, and also they had to assume a transversality condition. And the transversality condition is essentially there to take the place of not identically. The place of not identically zero for the not constant for the potential. This is generalizing not constant analytic potential to a transversal Gevre potential. Okay, now these require this Schrodinger structure and in the latter case requires both transversality and a very large coupling constant. So the question when So, the question one can ask is: what is known, what is doable for SL2C or even M2C co-symphonies? Is anything doable here? And at the moment, we have partial results of the following form. Sorry, Matthew. I also want to point out that when D equals 1, when in the MASF, we also have results for C2 cosine type. Ah, yeah, so I apologize, you know, you just need a C2 cosine type. Yeah, so you just need a C2 C2 times. So C2 cosine type. N D is equal to what you said. Yeah, D is equal to 1. I apologize. I was aware of it, I just didn't write it. So suppose we have our co-cycle now, and what do we need to assume about the co-cycle? So let's assume a few things. Let's assume that omega is diaphragm. Then Then there is an S naught strictly greater than 1, which depends on the diaphene parameters of omega such that L A omega is continuous in A. In A in the space GS, TD, as long as S is smaller than S. So very similar to this D equals one case, but it requires a Diophantine condition. The Diophantine condition tells us how regular we're allowed to be. And at the moment, if you take a worse and worse Diophantine condition, S0 goes down to 1. Goes down to one. So this is a sad state that at the moment we can't go beyond diaphragm time. But for any diaphragm time, we do have some kind of constant. So what's assumption? Let's say is this like M2C? M2C. Absolutely. Yes. So this is for M2C. D strictly, D greater than or equal to 1. So this also works when D is 1. But it's the usual diaphragm, not strong diaphragm. Not strong diaphragm, it's the usual diaphane. Not strong diaphantine. It's the usual diaphantine. So when I say diaphantine, I mean that k dot omega, for those that don't know what I mean, k to the minus, say delta. Not great to equal to delta omega? Well, I don't know how to define that when in multi-frequency. Oh, yeah. When you send beyond that front, I am in to do with. Yeah, I can't go in. I can't go anywhere. Is it true? I think so. I think that there should be an analog of this. There should be a cutoff in analog for the D equals one case where for any frequency which gives you ergodicity, you should be able to get continuity in A. So for some fixed S. Fixed S, no matter what your frequency is, as long as your frequency gives rise to something analytic, ergodic, it should be continuous. So we should have an exact analog of my theorem 1A for some S. But at the moment, this is the baby step towards that direction. This is not even known for shorting, was right? This is not even known for. Shorting, exactly. Exactly. No, I don't believe in D greater than when it's not for sure. Okay. So in the remaining time, let me kind of give you an idea of how one can approach proving theorem one or theorem two. Question: Does this not depend on omega through C and delta, or in a more complicated way? Just delta. Just depends on delta. In point of fact, I believe it's actually possible to get some concrete modulus, but that requires a bit more careful work than has been done. So, you mean modulus? So you mean modulus of continuity? Uh well I I don't mean modulus continuity in the the the uh yes, I do mean a modulus of continuity. I believe that there is a modulus continuity that you can get here. By the way, uh a modulus continuity was uh obtained in uh this result by this is reasonable because you have a large company you have positive exponents up there and you assume nothing about positivity. Um ah yes, so if you assume positivity you should be able to get a modulus of constant vessels. Continuity, yes. Good point. Yes. Yes, if you assume positivity, then you should be able to get a modulus of continuity of the same flavor as what's obtained here. So, how could one approach continuity the Lyapunov exponent? Well let's remember this is the limit of 1 over n the integral of the log of the term of A. And let me call this right here let me call this L N This L N Are you sure about the date of this theorem? Okay, the date of this theorem is 2024. And this is 324. Yes, this is a more recent work. Thank you. Always trust Lama to point out my errors. So let's So let's have this. What's known about this object right here? Well, this is actually continuous in A and omega. For any A and any omega, this is continuous. So continuity of the Lehrna exponent is a natural kind of analysis question. You have a sequence of continuous functions. You want to know if the limit is continuous. So continuity would follow if you could obtain some kind of uniform. Obtain some kind of uniform estimate to show that this coast is very uniform. So, how could one approach that? There's in the d greater than one, following the ideas of Bourgon, there's really two There's really two key ideas. The first is known as the Avalanche principle, which was introduced by Gausslin and Schlab when they studied continuity in the first place. And this is a tool that essentially allows one to compare the norm of a long product of matrix. Norm of a long product of matrices to a product of the individual norms. And under suitable assumptions, what this says is that you can compare lnk omega minus lm times mk omega. You can say that this is really small. For m large, but not too large. And for n, large, enough. Enough. That's a consequence of the Avalanche principle under suitable assumptions. So the question is: what are those suitable assumptions? Well, those suitable assumptions are essentially covered by a large deviation. And that's really the second component, is one needs to prove some notion of large deviation, which we saw yesterday, but let me recall it. A large deviation for us is the following. For us, is the following. You want to compare the finite scale Yapen of exponent to what happens before you took the integral. You want to look at when this is large. And you want to say that the measure where this happens is very small, is exponentially small. So this is the type of large deviation one would like to prove. Under suitable conditions again on n and omega. And that's really the key difficulty in most of this business is obtaining a reasonable large deviation and then showing that the large deviation that you get can be used to apply Avalanche principle. The conclusion that you get from Avalanche. Principle, the conclusion that you get from avalanche principle is such that this n, this omega, is, or this m times n, this omega, if you plug it into your large deviation, you still get a good enough estimate to apply avalanche principle again, and you iterate this scheme out to the limit. That is the idea, glossing over considerable technicalities. I'd like to thank everybody for listening. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. So, questions, comments, comments? Can we talk about continuity of that model as far as regularity in Valytic? Okay, so what is known, and you can obtain it as a corollary of my first theorem, is in this. Theorem is in this exact same framework, you have an M2C valued co-cycle which has non-vanishing determinant. If you assume omega is Diophantine and the Lyapunov exponent is positive, then you get a weak holder regularity. So between log holder, stronger than log holder, but weaker than holder, somewhere in between there. It's something of the form. And this is also obtainable by the methods of Duarte and Klein. That you can show L A omega minus L B omega naught say is less than e to the minus log of of M minus E plus omega minus omega naught minus one to some sufficient power. You can obtain regularity like this. So the continuity at omega naught is like this, and if you take omega naught to be omega, then in a neighborhood of B, you get regulated that looks like this. You get regulated that looks like this. You can't at the moment do better than this in d greater than one, largely because this comes from the strength of this comes from a large deviation, and the large deviation that we get is not as good as it is when d is equal to 1, where you do get half-holder constant. But what if instead of an audit you'd have to take a mirror potential? Uh I believe the exact same thing can still be done. Um uh because dealing with the meromorphic, the idea is you still want to kind of the game with singularities you want to excise around the singularity in some regular fashion. And I don't see why doing the same thing for a Meromorphic function would be any Be any more difficult because you look at your denominator here and look at the zero set, that's the zero set of an analytic function, so all the techniques that we used for our business should work there. You don't need your potential to be bounded. Well, it's a one-periodic, it's a function on TD, which is compact, and it's analytic. So, yes, it's definitely bounded at the moment. But if you make it Uh make it meromorphic, I don't see an immediate issue with the argument. Again, you you should be X size around zero set of an argument function, and that has nice structure because it's a zero set of an analytic function. So I think in the context of your theorem too, I don't think you can get like a large deviation estimate like this. A Latin deviation estimate like this for like unit for all m bigger than equal to, you know, you probably only can get some arithmetic version of Latin deviation, like for instance, like a vault edge, or things like that. So in the context of theorem two for the Gevre? Yeah. Yeah, so for Gevre, we can still get something of this form, but the epsilon that you get, the way that it's written, the epsilon. The way that it's written, the epsilon, depends on the scale. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay. And right, because how does one, what's one way to attack the Gevre is you take your Gevre function and you approximate it by a truncated Fourier series that's now analytic. In the analytic, you have this, and so the game is how closely are you is your approximation? And that's introducing additional error based on. Additional error based on how large your polynomial approximation is. I think, yeah, because here you assume omega is that function. So I think my question actually should go back to your theorem one. Okay, where you only assume omega to be rational independent, right? Yes. Then you your version of that division is probably not as good as this one. So you can still get something like this, but your uh what you uh What you it's based on the idea that you assume that k dog omega, say, is small, is larger than delta for, say, k up to some scale k0. And then your scale n is taken to be larger than delta to the minus 1 k0. And if you do that, then you do obtain something exactly like this, where your epsilon is taken to be Taken to be for all intents and purposes, k0 to the minus c where c depends on d. No, I just No, that's true.
