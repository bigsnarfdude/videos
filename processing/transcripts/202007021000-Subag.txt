might be interested on what uh functions new are admissible and so this is a question about positive definite functions on the sphere and it is a classical question that has been answered by Schoenberg and for loot to be admissible we need it needs to be we need to be able to write it as a polynomial in one variable with non-negative In one variable with non-negative coefficients, and possibly this polynomial can be infinite. And the second definition, which is of course equivalent, is a realization of a process which are such covariance. So the claim is that if you take the process I've just defined and you compute the covariance, you get what we had in the previous slide. So given a mixture, we take a linear combination with the same coefficients gamma p. With the same coefficients gamma p of the pure p-spin models, which I assume to be independent, and they are defined through the following formula. So, x here is a point on the sphere with coordinates xi, and you go over all monomials of the Greek P, multiply each one of them by a Gaussian variable independent, and that's it. So essentially, this is the most natural way to define a random homogeneous polynomial. Random homogeneous polynomial. Now, I will mostly talk about two objects: the free energy and the Gibbs measure. And the free energy is a random variable that depends on the choice of a parameter beta called the inverse temperature. It's given by 1 over n log of the partition function, which is following integral over the sphere. And probably the most famous result. And probably the most famous result in this business is the Parisi formula, which expresses the limit of the free energy as n goes to infinity to a minimum of some complicated functional, which I will not even write, applied to a measure we minimize over the space of probability measures on the interval from 0, 1. And this has been proved famous. This has been proved, it's a famous result by Talagrand first, and later it was extended by Panchenko for the case of models on the cube with plus-minus one spins, and by Chen for the spherical models, which I'm talking about today. And both proofs were based on the optometricity property. Okay, and the Gibbs measure is a random probability measure on the sphere. You simply take your You simply take your random function, multiply by beta, and exponentiate. Use this new function, which is now positive, as a density on the sphere, and normalize everything so that the total mass is one. And let me tell you about a nice property of this measure. So, at an arbitrary point on the sphere, what we have is a Gaussian variable with variance of order n. So, the fluctuation is. So the fluctuations for most points on the sphere are just of order square root n. And the maximal height, case like n, and specifically if you normalize it and take the limit, it converges to a certain number, which I denote by E star. This is so-called ground set energy, which of course depends on the model. Now, you can take an intermediate energy level between zero and zero. Energy level between zero and the ground state energy, and look at the approximate level set. So, by that, I mean the set of points on the sphere where the energy is roughly this number up to some small arrow. What happens is that for any such energy value, you can choose beta, such as the Gibbs measure is asymptotically supported on this approximate level. So, you have this family of measures. Family of measures, and you can put yourself at any height you want. This is another way to study these level sets. But this is the way, this is the object physicists like to work with. So this is what we talk about. Now, the main result I want to tell you about is called a tap representation, and I'll start with a classical tap representation. This is after Paulus under... Is after Dallas, Anderson, and Palmer. So, what it says is that for any spherical model and any temperature, if you take Q to be the maximal point in the support of the Parisi measure, so if you remember, the Parisi formula expresses the free energy as a minimum over a space of measures. There's a unique minimizer, which is called the Parisi measure. And you take the support of this measure and take the right model. Of this measure and take the rightmost point, that is Q. Then you can write the limiting free energy as the sum of three terms. The last two of them are explicit given Q and your model new the choice of beta. The first is the ground state energy, but computed over the sphere of radius square root Q, not the sphere of radius one on which we originally. One on which we originally defined the model. And as to comment, you extend your land of function to the interior of the sphere, to the ball, using the same formula that we saw on the second slide. And this was originally, or this the TAP approach was originally introduced in 77 for the SK model, for model with the model with easing spins. And Kuchampa Rizi and Pirasso and Chrysanti. Puchampo Risi-Pirassot and Chrysantien-Sommers derived this formula in the Q-spin case for the spherical models. And there are many, many other works in physics about tap representations and other aspects of the TAP approach, which I will not touch today. And mathematically, it has been proved in several cases. So, for the spherical models, for the pure ones, you can Pure ones. You can prove this formula by looking at critical points and some analysis of what happens around them. This was done for large enough beta and later together with Benarus and Zetuni for mixed models, but assuming they are close enough to Q, so essentially that one of the coefficients gamma P in the mixture is large and all of the others are so on. Belius and Kiesler proved the formula for the two-spin case. The formula for the two-spin case, which is a unique case where the model is replica symmetric for all temperatures, so it's a bit different than the case El Autogen Priv. And Chen and Panchenko proved the formula of an analog of the formula, which looks a bit different. It's slightly more complicated for general models in the easing case. So, when you work with a hypercube, and this formula, this proof actually relies heavily on the Relies heavily on the Parisi formula. Today I'm going to show you a different proof in the spherical case. And the proof will be for a certain generalization, which I describe now. So I'm taking Xi to be IID samples from the Gibbs measure, and I will call Q a value between 0 and 1, a good overlap. If for anything, Overlap, if for any fixed K, an epsilon, I look at the probability that for the first case samples, each pair has inner product or overlap, which is roughly Q. And I want this probability not to decay exponentially fast. So in many, we know of examples where if you take a value from the Parvis. A value from the Parisi, the support of the Parisi measure, under some assumptions, we know that this probability will be lower bounded uniformly in n. So it would be essentially compares to a number. I'm allowing for Q to be a good overlap. I'm allowing this probability to go to zero, but not too fast, not exponentially fast. And an important remark, which I actually almost said, is that Said is that if Q is in the support of the Parisi measure, then Q is necessarily good. The other direction is not always true. For example, in the critical temperature, you can have cues which are good, but not in the support. And here's the generalized upper presentation. So again, it holds for any spherical model and any temperature. Temperature, and it holds for any Q which is good. Essentially, it's a characterization of the property of Q being good. And the formula now has the first two terms exactly as before, but the third term now is the free energy, the limit of the free energy associated to a new mixture. So, new Q is a mixture that you explicitly Explicitly expressed using the original mixture and the value of Q. This is a function of T. So you start with your model and you choose a Q which is good and then you get a new model. You need to compute its free energy, the corresponding ground state, and this is related to the original free energy using this formula. And why is it a generalization? And why is it a generalization? Because specifically for Q, which is the maximal value in the support, what happens is that this model, this mixture, is what we call replicosymmetric, meaning that the free energy is just half beta squared times the variance that corresponds to this model, which is exactly what we had in the classical representation. Okay, so this recovers the classical. Okay, so this recovers the classical representation for Q, which is the rightmost point in the support. And before I move on, I want to mention that together with Weikov Chen and Dmitry Panchenko, we proved an analog of this representation in the easing case for mixed models. It's more complicated, but I will not state it now. Okay, so now. Okay, so now I want to move to talk about pure states. I'm doing it just to motivate some of the definitions and the type of questions I want to answer. I'm not going to use any information, any information we know about pure states later in the talk, but I think it's a nice way to motivate the problem. So, what is a pure static composition? It's first, it was proved by First, it was proved by Telegram without relying on the autometricity property. And more recently, Jagannath gave a new proof which also generalizes telegram results using the autometricity property. What it says is that under some conditions, which are written in the footnote for specialists, you have a sequence of disjoint subsets of the sphere and the number q star. And the number q star such that the Gibbs measure of the union of those sets goes to one. So, if you're interested in the Gibbs measure, it's enough to understand what happens only on the pure states and what's special about these cells because this property by itself is not very special. So, the important property of these cells is that if we take two independent samples. We take two independent samples from the Gibbs measure, x and y, conditional on sampling from the pure state, their inner product or overlap is essentially q star. So this holds for any epsilon. And also we have a soup over I, so this holds simultaneously for all pure states. Okay, so in some sense, it means that there is no further structure on the pure states if you're looking at the If you're looking at the inner product, it's concentrated on one value. It's a degenerate random variable. Now, the following is actually a simple corollary from the theorem. So here I'm defining mi to be the barycenter of the pure state, just the center of mass relative to the Gibbs measure. Now, you can see. Now you construct a new measure, G hat, which is you just take your pure states and you shrink them to a point. Take the mass of a pure state and put all this mass at mi and this the rest of the mass which will go to zero I just go to the origin and then the distribution of the overlap under the Gibbs measure the original measure The Gibbs measure, the original measure, or under this new measure, will be essentially the same. So, in any reasonable metric, they will be close to each other with high probability as n goes to infinity. Okay, so in order to understand. Someone asked if the probability in two, how it behaves when n is large. This probability? With high prob Yeah, I think so. So let's say this is a random variable and it converges in probability to zero. Okay, the Gibbs measure itself is random. All of this is a random variable and it converges in probability to zero. The question was about the rate of decay? I think so. I don't think we know anything about the rate of decay. Thank you. Okay, so what the collar is saying, in some sense, is that you only need to know the weights of the pure states and the location of the barycenter to understand the overlap distribution. Okay, so I hope I convinced you that this is an interesting object. And now I'm going to ask a sort of an imprecise. I'm going to ask a sort of an imprecise question just to motivate what I try to do next. The question is: can we identify the barycenters of the pure set by quote unquote just looking at the random function? So I want a simple, nice condition, not something that goes through the Gibbs measure itself, but something that looks at the point, at the value, and maybe in a certain neighborhood of a point, and be able to tell. point and be able to tell its pure state, but to understand really the pure state themselves, a very fine analysis. So I'm allowing myself to look at pure state-like subsets, which I didn't define, but these are subsets which have properties which are similar to pure state. Now, it doesn't make sense to work with, ask questions about the subsets of the sphere. About the subsets of the sphere themselves, because essentially there are too many of them. So, what I want to do is work with points in the ball inside the sphere, and I want to attach somehow a set which can be a candidate for a pure state. So, going from a subset to a point by taking the barycenter is easy. It's obvious what we mean by that. But I want to attach to any point a subset in a natural way. It turns out that It turns out that the natural way to do it is the following. So I'm defining a band around the point, which this is the formal definition, but let me use the picture. So the point is anywhere inside the sphere of radius one, for example, this point. The band is constructed as follows. You take the orthogonal plane to this point in Rn and you intersect it with the unit sphere. With the unit sphere. And then you give it some small width, which is this delta n. So delta n is some sequence that goes to zero slowly, which we can fix now once and for all. And just to emphasize, the band is a subset of the sphere. It does not include the disk itself. So it's the boundary of this disk. Okay? Okay, so this is how I associate a set to each point, and I also want to associate the three. And I also want to associate the free energy to M. And this is the same definition we used for the usual free energy, but now I'm integrating only over the band, not the sphere. Okay? And what you can check quite easily is that for pure states, conditional sampling from the pure state, with high probability, the point will come for the corresponding base. The point will come for the corresponding band, from the band around the barycenter of the pure state. Okay, and for the pure states, we know that we have lower bounds on the mass of each pure state. We know that I didn't state it before, but we know that the mass does not decay exponentially fast. And therefore, the free energy, if I compute it only over one pure state, is roughly the whole free energy. Is roughly the whole free energy on the whole sphere. Because of this relation, I know that the difference between the free energy on the band and on the pure state would be small because to get to the free energy, I need to take log of these quantities. So what we get is that if you take a pure state and you take its barycenter and compute this free energy on the band, then it's going to be almost the free energy if you were to compute it over the whole space. Where to compute it over the whole sphere. Okay, so there are points for which these bands are heavy, and specifically any barycenter is such a point. So now I want to change my question to I want to look for points which has this property. Okay, so I want to work with bands and look for points such that the band around them is heavy, if I as heavy as it can be. As heavy as it can be asymptotically, if I compute the free energy. Now, if you think about it for a few minutes, you see that this condition is not so good because there are too many such points, points that satisfy this approximation. So, actually, even if you understand what are the points, it's not going to be very meaningful and give you any. You any good information. So, what I want to do is look for points which are more special than this and require more. And the new requirement will come from again from pure states. So if you remember, for a pure state, if we sample two samples, the overlap is concentrated on a single. Overlap is concentrated on a single value. And that will happen also if you sample many points, let's say 10 points, and the overlap between any pair will be also this value because just the generate random variable. And if you think of what it means in terms of this band, you get the following. So here I'm looking at the Gibbs probability. I'm taking k samples. K samples under the Gibbs measure, conditional on them coming from the band. And I look at the probability that xi minus ml dot xj minus ml for any pair is small. So what does it mean? If the two points are xi and xj are these two blue points in the picture, xi minus ml and xj minus ml. Xi minus ML and Xj minus ML are the two lines. And when epsilon is equal to zero, they are orthogonal in the sense of this picture. Okay, so here I'm looking at the probability that I take case samples and they are almost orthogonal in this sense. I'm allowing some error, which is this epsilon. What happens is that for the barycenters of the pure state, this probability will be This probability will be roughly one. Now I want to define a new free energy, which is this old free energy, just the free energy on the band that we saw before. And I want to add this term, one over kn log of w. This is a penalty term. It can only, because it's a log of some probability, it's going to be Be non-positive. So, for some points, like the barycenters, it will be roughly zero. And for some other points, it will reduce the value. And so, it will help me look at points which at a smaller set of points. This is just algebra, this equality. You can rewrite this definition as an integral with k replica. k replicas. So here we're integrating over k points from the band and in the exponent I have the sum of the values Hamiltonian at those points. But these are not those points are not independent. There is this the same restriction on the angles between the points. So that's just another way to write it more, which looks more like a free energy than this. And what happens for the barycenter? Since this before we take the log, this is one, so after the log, this will go to zero. And for any finite kn epsilon, this will go to zero. And therefore, for n that goes slowly to zero, and epsilon then goes slowly to, sorry, kn goes slowly to infinity, and epsilon then goes slowly to zero, you have the following approximation for the at the very end. Approximation for the at the barycenter. So, this we saw before, now telling you that also this even smaller free energy will be roughly the total free energy. And this is the final question I want to ask. I want to find points or to, sorry, to characterize the points which satisfy these two approximations. This is something I know that happens for the very centers. That happens for the barycenters. And I want to understand if there's a simple condition or characterization for this to happen. So just to summarize, in the last few slides, the fact I used the purestate was only to motivate this definition. So just want to summarize, I'm defining two free energies. The first one is just the free energy on the band with one. On the band with one replica, the other one is with many replicas, which are constrained to be roughly orthogonal. And we know that at very centers, we have the two approximations here. And in general, we have these two inequalities because the free energy on the band is definitely smaller than the free energy computed on the whole sphere. And because we represented this free energy Represented this free energy as this one plus a penalty which is which is non-positive, we have this other inequality. Okay, so the next thing I want to tell you about is a certain concentration property, which is really key to the proof. And in order to state it, I need some notation, I'm going to define a center. We're going to define a centered version of those three energies by simply replacing Hnx in the exponent by Hnx minus H and M, the value at the center of the band. Okay, and if you define the centered free energy, and the same for the one with the replicas, you can just you have the following two relations. You can just rewrite the free energy as the centered one plus the energy outside of the integral. Outside of the integral. So the logic behind this is that if you look at the process HNX minus HNM on the band and the random variable HNM, then they are approximately independent. So if I have something independent, I just want to pull it out of the integral at the log and have this formula. And now that we center the free energy, we have the following concentration result. You look at You look at this replicated free energy and you look at its deviation from the expectation, and it converges to zero uniformly over the pole of radius one. And this uniform concentration is really important because we'll be interested in points essentially random points. So, and actually this And actually, this theorem is not very hard to prove. It mostly follows from a general concentration result for functionals of Gaussian variables, Lipschitz functionals of Gaussian variables. And the important thing is to set the definitions right. And after you get this definition, it's really easy to see that you have this concentration. So now with this concentration, So, now with this concentration result, I want to show you two immediate consequences. So, the following sequence of equalities and inequalities holds for any point M in the ball. The first approximation is the concentration that we just saw. The equality is just from definition, and we already talked about two inequalities. This I have for any point. This I have for any point. Now, what happens if Q is good? Actually, if and only if Q is good, with high probability, there exists a point M star on the sphere of radius square root Q, such that those two inequalities hold as approximate equality. So they hold up to an error term which goes to An error term which goes to zero as n goes to infinity. Okay, so what do we do with that? First, note that, so since for any m, so now I'm looking at points on this field, the sphere of radius square root q, and for all those points, this expectation is the same, just by symmetry. It doesn't matter which point I'm choosing on this field when I'm computing the free energy, because it's expected. Energy because it's expectation, it's not going to be symmetric. And I know that for any m on this on this sphere, this quantity is smaller than the free energy. And therefore, if I have a point where it achieves the free energy, then the energy must be maximal at this point. Okay, this is really simple. Since it's always a lower bound for this, and I have an Lower bound for this, and I have an equality, it must be maximal. And then, just by looking at this point with this property, so on the left-hand side, I'll have E star instead of this energy. And I know that for this point M star, these are approximate equalities. Therefore, just by comparing the two sides, you have that the free energy, if Q is good, the free energy is asymptotically Uh, asymptotically, the beta times the ground set energy at radius square root q plus uh. So, you need to take limits. So, if you take the limit in n, what we have is the limit of this free energy. This is almost a tap formula. Okay, so if you remember the tap formula, we had this term, we had two terms instead of this one, which I'll talk about in two slides. But if you follow this. If you follow this really just a few arguments and you already get our formula, there's another immediate consequence. Now that I know that this is the free energy, I can just substitute it in the right-hand side. Therefore, for any on the sphere of radius rho q, I have a characterization for the points that we were interested in, the points where We were interested in the points where those three energies are approximately the same, because, okay, what you have here is just beta times E star and this expectation, which you also have on the left-hand side. So, for these two inequalities to be approximately equalities, we must have that this energy is E star, which will appear on this side of the formula. Okay, so in words, if I look at points. If I look at points on the sphere of radius square root q, and I want to know which are the points such that the band has the free energy, which is roughly the total free energy, and such that the measure is spread on the band in a way that allows me to sample many points which are orthogonal on the band with probability which is not exponentially small. Then the answer is that these are exactly the points. Exactly, the points which approximately maximize the Hamiltonian. Okay, so you can just look at the value of the Hamiltonian and decide if the band has this property or not. Now, let me go back to... I was asking if the pure state decomposition theorem depends on beta, the temperature. Well, what it holds for any beta, but for example, if you Better, but for example, if you're in the high temperature phase, what you have is one pure state, et cetera. So, there are things which I didn't mention, like the weights of those pure states, which will depend on the model, will depend on beta. I will talk later about the ultrametric tree, the structure of the tree will depend on beta, but the fact that the theorem is true does not depend on beta. I mean, the way I stated it, it can be degenerate in a sense if there's no, if you'll be. If there's no, if you're below the critical data, we'll have just one state at the center. Thanks. You're welcome. More questions? No, it's good. I asked in the chat if anyone had anything. So now I want to go back to the TEPL presentation. So what is missing is in the presentation is just In the presentation, it is just to prove this equation. This is what I showed you in the previous slide, and this is what we have in the Apple presentation in the beginning of the talk. And I will not explain how to prove it, but I just want to show you where these two terms come from. So, the first one is quite easy to understand. If you take the band, so we're working with points of the sphere of radius squared q, take an arbitrary such point. You take an arbitrary such point and look at one over n log of the volume of the band and take the limit, this is what you get, this logarithmic term. So this is just an entropy term. And the second term arises as follows. So take one such point and think of this is a very thin band. It took its width to go to zero as n goes to infinity. To zero as n goes to infinity. And I want to think about it as a sphere of one dimension less. So it hardly varies on this axis. So I would think of it as a sphere. And I want to look at this process with which we define the three energies, h and x minus the value at the center, as a new spherical model on this sphere. It will be a process whose covariance only depends on the angle of two. Covariance only depends on the angle of two points, so to correspond to a spherical model. And you can compute the covariance, the dependence of the covariance on this angle. And this is how I define the coefficients alpha p. So you do some computation, it takes half a page, and you see what you get for this coefficient. It will be a mixture, will be a polynomial, and you can compute explicitly alpha p. alpha p and then what i want to take is not exactly this mixture but i want to remove the once fin interaction and this new mixture is the mixture whose free energy is what appears in the top representation okay so i just wanted to show you uh that the relation to the how it how this free energy is connected to the Hamiltonian on the bend. The Hamiltonian on the band. Okay, so now I want to go back to talk about the pure sets and ultrametric tree. I'll explain what that means. So let me just remind you, this is how we motivated the definition of the free energies. We know that at barycenters, all free energies are approximately the same, and it's not difficult to verify it's immediate. To verify, it's immediate that asymptotically, the barycenters, if you look at the norm squared, it will be Q star, which is defined as the maximal point in the support of the Paris image. So from the characterization of such points, we know that now that the energy at the barycenters is the maximal energy on the sphere of radius. On the sphere of radius square root of q star. Okay, so that's an immediate consequence about the energy of the barycenters. And now I want to talk about the ultrametric result. First, let me start with the reason ultrametricity hazard. That's one of the most famous and important results in spin glasses. It was proved by Panchenko. And so here I'm taking epsilon constant n to infinity, and x, y, and z are three independent samples from the Gibbs measure. And what the property says is that the overlap of the first pair is at least the minimum of the overlaps of the two other pairs minus some arrow, which can be as small as you wish. So if you fix epsilon and then take n to infinity, epsilon. And to infinity, epsilon can be as small as you wish, and this happens with probability that costs one. And the way I want you to think about it is as a transitivity of the following relation. So you can define the relation on the point. So you think that we take many samples from the Gibbs measure, and then we define the following relation. If the two points are in the relation, if the linear product is larger than Q. inner product is larger than q, then this essentially means not exactly up to small errors, it means that this relation is transitive. And so it's actually an equivalence relation because the other properties are immediate. And the equivalence clusters are nested in the sense that if you increase q, if you look at q prime larger than q, then what happens is you just And then what happens is you just break down the equivalence classes into smaller classes. Okay, so you can think of q equals zero. You have all the samples. Let's assume that the overlay distribution is positive always. So at zero, you have all the samples and then you increase q and you form these equivalence classes and you break them down as you increase q. You break them down as you increase Q, you have this hierarchical structure of clusters. And you can also talk about this hierarchy in terms of subsets of the sphere, not just samples. And this was done by Jagannath in the theorem. Actually, it's the same work I mentioned before. We constructed pure states. So, I just want to explain what the theorem means for the pure states. I just want to express it in the way that is relevant to what I want to explain. So, what he showed is that if we look at the pure state, so that's equivalent to one of his results, you can arrange, so you can arrange the barycenters of the pure state. The barycenters of the pure states in a tree structure such that the leaves are going to be the barycenters. And it has the following geometric property. Any two edges are orthogonal to each other. These are not necessarily edges which have a common vertex. Simply, any two edges on this tree are orthogonal to each other. Okay, and now Okay, and now maybe answering, partly answering one of the questions that was answered before. What changes between model and model and different temperature is qualitatively what changes because there are other things that change, but the number of levels of this tree depends on the size of the support of the Parisi measure. And when the support is fine, this is what we call a finite representation. And this is what we call finite replica symmetry breaking or finite step replica symmetry breaking. When the number of atom is k plus one, we say that the model is k R S B. And for example, in this picture, this corresponds to three RSV when the tree has three levels. And in a moment, I want to talk about full RSB models for which the support is an interval from zero to Q. An interval from zero to q, and in this case, what happens is that the number of levels to this tree goes to infinity as n goes to infinity. And the radii, so if you look at all the vertices and the radii, then asymptotically they will cover this whole range. So you should imagine something which is this huge tree that with the limit is going to be almost a continuous. Almost a continuous structure from the origin to the pure states. Okay, now how is this relevant to what we talked about before? Let's take a point. For example, in the picture, I look at this point. This is not the center of a pure state, it's an internal point of the tree, not a leaf. And I want to look at the corresponding band. So, on the orthogonality property, all those edges are orthogonal to this vector, which is the location of the green point. So, all the descendants are going to be points in this disk, which is the orthogonal hyperplane. And what happens is that the intersection between this The intersection between this band and the bands which corresponds to the pure state is such that there is enough mass on this band, this large band. And in particular, the free energy of this band will be roughly the free energy of a pure state, which is roughly the free energy of the whole sphere. And also, since the centers of the pure states are orthogonal relative to this point on the band. Relative to this point on the band. What we'll have is that this other free energy, which was related to the ability to sample orthogonal points, will also be roughly the free energy without replicas. So what we conclude from this is that the energy at any point on the sphere is maximal compared to the same sphere, for the sphere of the same radius. Okay, so this holds uniformly over the tree. Any point has the maximal energy. Now I want to go back to this picture and recall that in this tree, any two edges are orthogonal. Now we know also that the energy is maximal at any point. And I want to talk about the full RSB case. So this tree is really dense in some sense. And I want to relate this to the problem of optimization because now think of suppose that we take beta to infinity slowly. So what will happen is that the centers of the pure state will be very close to radius one. We have this huge tree which we can hope to somehow follow from the origin to get to one of the points and get a point with the maximal energy. So let me be more precise. So, let me be more precise. And here's a problem I'm interested in. So, you're given the Hamiltonian, and what you want to do is find a ground state configuration, a point on the sphere where the energy is roughly maximal. And precisely, what you get as an input are the coefficients that define the Hamiltonian or the ki's. And you want to design an. And you want to design an algorithm that produces such points with minimal time complexity. Okay, so here is the result. So what you need to assume is this full RSB condition that I mentioned before. I want to assume that for any beta, the support of the Parisi measure is an interval from zero to q. For small little, this will be a degenerate. Small beta, this will be a degenerate interval, it will be just a point zero, but for large beta, it will be an interval. And then the theorem says that there is an algorithm which produces such a point up to an error of epsilon, and its time complexity is n to the degree of the mixture. Okay, so what is this? And to the degree of the mixture, it's just if you think about it, the number If you think about it, the number, so let's assume that the mixture is finite, otherwise, the way I stated the problem doesn't make sense. If the mixture is finite, the number of coefficients you have is of this order. So that's the minimal complexity you can have, just storing the coefficients. It turns out that with this complexity, you can get to an approximate ground set energy. And of course, in the end, by diagonalizing, you can Diagonalizing, you can get an error epsilon that goes to zero if you allow anything that is asymptotically larger than n to the degree of loop. I also want to comment that for the spherical models, this condition is equivalent to the following explicit condition. Just need to check whether nu double prime to the minus half is a concave function on the Is a concave function on the interval 0, 1. Okay, so you can just replace this condition star by this one. And the last comment about this theorem is that it was recently proved by Montenari and then by Elalaurier, Montenari, and Selke. And I think Andrea will talk about this in his talk. A similar result in the case of easing spins. In the case of easing spins, so when you optimize over the hypercube instead of the hypersphere, and what they do is they use a certain class of message passing algorithm, and they show that under similar condition, you have the optimal such algorithm will get you to the ground set energy. Okay, so now I want to if you want to. We had a couple questions. If you want just to make sure one person was asking if this theorem here, the beta was arbitrary. This theorem? Yeah. So it's a theorem about, okay, maybe I should have said that the words with high probability are missing, but this, okay, so the term is that there's an algorithm that with high probability given the random function. Given the random function hn, which comes from a model, from a mixture, which satisfies this property, with high probability, the algorithm would produce such a point. And the other question was if the algorithm is explicit. Yes, I'll show you in a second what is the algorithm explicit. Thank you. Okay, so before I show the algorithm, I want to tell you how you Want to tell you how you obtain this algorithm, what's the idea? So I'm going to assume this condition, and technically I'm going to take beta to infinity with them. Don't worry about this. And what I want to do is look at only one path from the tree. So it's a discrete, the tree is discrete. So I'm going to interpolate this path linearly between the points and I will parameterize. points and I will parameterize this past so that at time q the point is at radius square root q and now I'm just going to tell you about two properties inherited from the tree so the first one is this orthogonality property and specifically what I want to note is that each of those segments is orthogonal to the current position because the current position is the sum of all the previous segments and all those segments are orthogonal. And all those segments are orthogonal. So, in particular, any segment is orthogonal to the current position. The second property is what we saw on the tree, also holds on a path on the tree, from the tree. The energy is maximal at any point, so essentially it's maximal at any of the points on the tree itself. But since assuming this condition, I will have infinitely many vertices on this path as angle. Vertices on this path as n goes to infinity. So even between the vertices, it would be roughly maximum. Okay, so now I know that I have these two properties for any pet on the tree. And all I want to take from this is the knowledge that such paths exist. I don't want to use it in the proof. I just want to think how we can construct such a path by ourselves. If we didn't, because we can't just pick a point for the Because we can't just pick a point from the tree. Of course, we know it exists, we know what the properties are, but we can just say, let's take a point from the tree. So now let's think of how we can construct a path with these two properties by ourselves. So the first property we can just impose. I just want to build a path by concatenating many directions which are orthogonal. Which are orthogonal to the current direct, to the current, sorry, the current position. So the summing over the previous steps, normalized correctly. So after k steps, I will be radius one. And every time I choose a new direction, it has to be orthogonal to my current position. But of course, you want to choose those directions to be able to say something about the energy. Specifically, we want to maximize the energy. Maximize the energy locally at each step. And maybe the first guess should be to use the gradient because that's what we want to do: go in the best direction in terms of the energy. But this is a bad idea because if everything goes well, we should have at time i, we should have a point which has the maximal energy on the corresponding sphere. The gradient should be approximately zero. And what I want to do is simply take the second-order approximation. So choose a direction in the span of eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues of the Hessian computed on the orthogonal space to your current position. This actually works. So precisely, the algorithm goes as follows. Pick some large number of Pick some large number of steps k, some small error delta, initialize arbitrarily for the first step, it doesn't matter. Take some point with radius one over square root k. And then at each iteration, choose a direction, a vector of length one, is orthogonal to your current position. I also want to require that the projection onto the gradient is positive. I will show you why in a second, essentially, to avoid dealing with. To avoid dealing with the first-order term in a Taylor expansion. And note that if it's negative, I can just flip the sign and have the other inequality. And the important property is that the second-order approximation or the second-order derivative in the direction of v is almost the maximal. You can get up to this arrow delta. And then I simply update by taking a small step in this direction. By taking a small step in this direction. Okay, and I continue this way until after k steps I end up on the sphere of radius one. What you can show is that the energy on the path is consistently maximal up to this error epsilon. And you can make epsilon to be as small as you wish, provided that k is large enough and delta is small enough. Delta is small enough. Okay, so this simple algorithm gives you a path which is consistently maximal. And as for time complexity, you can check that one iteration takes some constant times l to the degree of due and you need to run k iteration. So you have a constant that depends on delta and k and therefore depends on epsilon. And lastly, this is the last slide, and I'll explain it. Slide, and I'll explain in a minute how you prove the correctness of this algorithm. So, you want to control the energy on this path. So, you need to control the Hessian because that's how you choose the direction at any point on the path. But you can actually control it uniformly in the ball. What you can prove is in an appropriate sense that for any point in the ball, the edge of the spectrum of the The edge of the spectrum of the Hessian computed on the orthogonal space is roughly two times nu double pump q to the power of half. And q and x are related by this condition. So the radius of q is quote, sorry, the radius of x is quote q. And now you just tailor expand and you see what you gain from one step. So this is where we started. If you recall, I wanted the projection. I wanted the projection onto the gradient to be positive, so I can conveniently forget about the first order term here and just put the second order term, which I control using this proposition. You have some error which behaves with a different power of k. And then, if you want to control the energy, essentially, by concatenating these increments, what you get is an approximation of the integral. Of the integral of this function. So now we have this lower bound on the energy. And by some other argument, for example, by the Parisi formula, under the condition star that we assumed in the theorem about optimization, we know that the ground set energy at radius squared Q is exactly this integral. Okay, so you prove that Ropeth achieved this energy, and you know by some other argument that this. And you know by some other argument that this is the maximal energy, and therefore you finish the pool. And I'll stop here. Thank you. You should all have the ability to unmute yourselves now. And so I suggest we give some lot of applause to Ediran for a very nice talk. So now, what we'll do is we'll cut both the recording and the live streaming on YouTube. And this way you can feel free to ask your questions with your mic directly to Edielan. So there's a couple of questions there. I don't know if you have access to the chat.
