Thanks for the invitation. I'm glad to attend this workshop and give a 30-minute talk. The theme of my talk is final focus, hyperkill varieties, and Lagrangians. This talk has two parts. The first part is to establish an identification between two constructions of hyperkill varieties. And in the second part, we discuss using a modular functor to construct Lagrangians in the hyperkillo varieties. In the hypocrite varieties. Here we focus on two specific families of final fofolds. The first is cubic focal, which is a smooth cubic hypersurface in P5. Another family involves grass manions called Pushamukaya. Graph menu is called push and client force. Its definition is more complicated. A general GM for day a general GM for day is defined to be a smooth transverse intersection between GR25 with a hyperplane and a quadratic hypersurface. After that, we're going to body into Pina. Now I get into our first patch. When we deal with hypocated varieties, the main difficulty is to find the concrete examples. While these two families of found on focal share similarity that they can give direct algebraic constructions of hepatitor validities. For example, if we consider the fundamentality of lines on cubic fold, it is smooth projective hypercaddo forefold due to Bubi and Donaghi. Moreover, the LSVS 8 volt constructed by Lineline, Serger, and Matt Trayton out of Twisted Cubic is also a HEPA killer 8 volt. The Lada Fa Kawazan compatifies the relatively intermediate Jacobian fabric associated with the cubic full fold and show that it is a herbical tenfold. On the other hand, similar results occur for GM44 as well. If we start with the GM44 today, we will have a Lagrangian data. Then, as introduced by Giovanni, Then, as introduced by Giovanni on Monday, we can construct two associated families of hyperkilovarieties associated with this Lagrangian data, which is the double EPWQ sex peak and the double EPWQ. They are both habitat varieties due to the oak. Of varieties due to the ogrady and the Iliab Kabasuda, Kabasuka, and the Renestate. People believe that the reason why these final focals are related with hypercalorities lies in their K3 nature. Besides the fact that they have K3 typical homology, if we look at their derived categories of coherent sheets, they actually exist a K3 category. They are truly in this case three category. For example, if we look at the drive category of cubic focal dby, we have a semi-oxygen decomposition. Here we call the nontrivial subcategory the Kuzanes of component of y, which is defined by the right orthogonal component of these three exceptional fractions. According to Kutanesa, who I is a K3 category In the sense that it shared many same numerical invariants with the derived category of a case rate surface. That it has the same set functor and the same house child homology. And the same house child homology. So, we may also call this Kudanes of components of a non-commutative K3 surface. As the modular spaces of stable sheaves, some K3 surfaces provide. Some K3 surfaces provide major examples of habitat varieties due to Mukai, Buvi, O-Grady, Yushi-Oka, and many others. Now we have a K3 category. It's natural to generalize Mukhai's constructions on K3 surfaces to the K3 categories and study the modular space of stable objects on this Kuzenesome component. Hence, we need the existence of the stability conditions on this subcategory and some property. Subcategory and some properties of the marker spaces of the stable objects. Fortunately, based on the beautiful work of Bailey Hosemaque and Stellari, if we look at this subcategory, it really has bridge and stability conditions. And under some circumstances, the bridge and modular space can provide hyper-calivarieties. And that is the theorem due to bio La Hose. Mercury New Perry and Stellary It says that if we have a non-zero primitive path to V. And we take a stability condition generic with respect to this machine vector sigma. Then the bridge and marker space is a smooth projective hypercalevarity of dimension v square plus 2. Of dimension v square plus 2. Now we have two ways of producing hypercalebarities. One comes from the projective geometry of these two families of final focals, and the other comes from the And the other comes from the multi-like contractions. So, one may wonder whether these two ways of contractions will coincide. And the answer is yes in several classical examples. By the recent work of Li, Petusi, and Zhang, They realize the final variety of lines and the LEL SPS eightfold as bridge and model space on the K3 category. Otherwise, we construct a symptomatic resolution of a single modular space on the K3 category and showed that it's also hypercalor and birational to the twisted intermediate Jacobian fabrication associated with the cubic focal. First, we can see that the QY unifies the two different constructions and can be sought as an original source of the hypercale varieties. Here's a remark. Indeed, all the discussion mentioned above can be generalized to GM focals as well. That is to say, if we consider the drive category of coherent shifts on general G and four volt DBA, it has a semi-arthropic composition whose K3 category has stability conditions and produces hypercale varieties as well. And this is done by Kusanessa Perry. Perry and the Perry Putusi juice Now motivated by LP this work, we aim to interpret the double EPW stack stick associated with the GM foreport as a bridge and mattress space. As a bridge and model space. So if now we fix a very general GM focal Z and a generic stability condition. Together with Liu and Zhang, we have the following isomorphisms. That is, M sigma lambda one is isomorphic to the W EPW sexic, and M sigma lambda two is isomorphic to the double EPW sexic. Moreover, Kapasuta, Kapasuta, and Mangadi prove that another half kilo 6 volt double EPW cube is also isomorphic to another bridge and model space. That is the M sigma lambda one minus lambda two is isomorphic to the double EPWQ. Indeed, 11 also shows that the double dual EPW stack sig is actually the MRC quotient of the modular spaces of the conics on a general GM4 fold. Then, under the identification done by KKM, Done by KKM with the physical one j, we can show that double E double cube is also the MRC quotient of the modular spaces of twisted cubics on very general GM4 forward. That is, if we consider the twisted cubics on dire general G and fourfold, it has a morphism to the double EPW cube, and this morphism is directional to a P1 fibration. Actually, here very general means general non-Hart special, which implies that the lambda1 and lambda2 are the generators of the new megable K group of the Kusana subcomponent of Z. And we plan to weaken this condition in the future. Okay, now we get into the second part. The second part focuses on a special class of hepatitis varieties called. Special class of hepatila varieties called Lagrangians. Here we have a motivating example. If we consider a curved state containing a K3 surface. Curve C containing a K3 surface S. Then we take the symmetric power of this curve, say then it is automatically Lagrangian in the Hilbert scheme of n points on S, which is a hypercalor variety. So we want to ask a question how about we treat the curve C and the K-free surface S by a non-cumulative curve and a non-cumulative case rate surface. If I take X to be a cubic four fold and Y to be a smooth hyperplane section which is a cubic threefold. Then the semi-arsegimization of this cubic three fold will produce a non-commutative curve. That is to say, if we consider a cubic three-fold containing a cubic four-fold, we will produce a non-colonial. Fourfold, we will produce a non-commutative curve, and as we mentioned before, if we consider the cubic four-fold semi-arsical composition, we will produce a K3 category, which can also be seen as a non-commutative K3 surface. Then it's left, then motivated by this classical example, is left to build the connection between this non-commutative curve and this non-commutative K-3 surface. So here we define a modular functor between Qy and Qx, which is a capital J defined by the J lower star composed with the projection function. Then we can show that actually the functor capital J is the have a lift adjoint which is the J upper star. So we may think the capital J as a non-community push forward. We aim to use this factor capital J to construct Lagrangians in the hypercase varieties as region modulate space on these K3 categories. More precisely, with speed version Zhang, we propose the following question. That the capital J will induce the rational map between the abridge and the modular space on the co y, which is a non-cumulative curve. To the bridge and market space on history category. Moreover, we expect that the image of this rational map is a Lagrangian sub-variety in this larger bridge-model space, which assumes it is a hypercale variety under some conditions. On the side of the G and full faults, we expect the same things to happen as well. Here, we always assume that the both bridge and modular space are smooth and projective, and the larger one on the right-hand side is a smooth-projective hypercaleiti. We verify our questions in some examples. Our questions in some examples and recover several classical results. In addition, we realize the Lagrangian four-fold in the LSVS8 fold as a bridge-modular space on a non-commuted curve and find the Lagrangian subvarieties in the double EPWQ in a very general case. That is, the functor capital J we defined can unify the following Lagrangian value. Unifies the following Lagrangian embedding in the case of cubic cofolds. The first one is way we can show that the We can show that the final surface of lines on a cubic three-fold is like ranging in the final variety of lines on cubic four-fold, which is already shown by Wazen. Secondly, if we consider the contractions of the twisted cubics on cubic three-fold and consider the image in the LSPS8 fold, and it is also like. As big as eight folds, and it is also Lagrangian. And it's also observed by Shinge and Salt Tenko. On the other hand, if you consider very general GM fold, then J will induce the WW surface as a Lagrangian subvariety in the W cube. And this is already shown. And this is already shown in the 11 and many mouse paper as well. Secondly, we can find the Lagrangians in the double EPW cube, which is the bridge and model space of how y, lambda one minus lambda two into the double EPW cube. And this result is new, I think. This result is new, I think. Okay, maybe I should stop here.
