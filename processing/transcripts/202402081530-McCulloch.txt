Written down and written to me. Oh, I don't know what I've said. Anyway, uh, thank you also to the organizers for inviting me to this conference and inviting me to speak. So throughout this talk, I'm going to be mentioning various different definability results, but all the structures I'm going to be concerned with are going to be expansions of the order of real field where we all know what Which each we all know. But ordering fields, we have reals, plus and times, zero one, and usual ordering. And such an expansion is said to be a minimal. A visible if every definable subset of the reals is just a finite union of points. And intervals, and some sort of classical examples of ebony or structures. I'm not going to run through the whole goggle, but I'll just mention a couple of them. So we have our bar itself. We also have our exp, which is the expansion of our bar. I the real exponential function and polymormality of this follows from the Katarsky and this this is just due to the okay so at this point a sort of immediate This talk is about definability results. An immediate non-definability result, which is like so trivial calling it result, is silly. But the real sine function will not be definable in one of these expansions. And the reason for this is clear: if you assume that it is, then you get that a serious set is a definable subset, but this is an infinite discrete set, so this can't be definable. Set, so these can't be definable in a minor structure. And you're done. So, sort of the natural initial question to ask in this area is: well, okay, you were considering the sine function on the whole real line, which got you this infinite discrete set. If you restrict to some bounded real interval, you remove this infinite discrete set from your consideration, can you get some definability there? So, question. And I and R, the bounded interval is the restriction of sine as interval, and the restriction we're going to consider is: is it definable in Rx? And the answer to this question is no. And this is a theorem of Ricardo Mean Coney from 1997. And it turns out that one can actually say even more, this is also true. That's been coding. So now we let D in article 2n polydisc and we consider function f this. Use this D to the reals and the theorem says if F is definable in Rx and polymorphic in the dist Then f is in fact definable in the ordered real field itself. Okay, so we take the sine function, we ask this definability question, and we see that we can't really get any definability at all. And first part of this talk, I'd like to First part of this talk I'd like to consider is: okay, so we have this X function, it's very nice, X has lots of nice properties, its model theory is also very nice, this is quite classical. Suppose we take some other transcendental function which is similar to the exponential function in some way, shares some of these properties, can we get analogous definability or non-definability results? So that's what we're going to do next, and the function in question. To be x, and the function in question would be the reviascraft p function. Seen a lot of the j function this week. The p function has been sadly misrepresented. I'm gonna bang on about it now. So, okay, so Firstly, we get the definition and firstly we say that a subset omega With complex numbers, we say that this is a complex lattice if we have omega one and omega two, then C such such that we can write omega bottom m plus m omega 1 plus n omega 2 where we let m and n range over integers and we also insist that the metric r of omega 2 over m is positive and to each such complex lattice you have an associated you have an associated p function. Most of the time I'll just drop the subscript omega and the v function, or at least relabel it, so I have to keep writing stuff over all the time. But just to show that we do have this association contest, and the p function is defined to be one over z squared. 1 over z squared plus the sum over all non-zero omega, and I'm not going to fit that off. There again sum over all tensor one over 1 over z minus omega squared minus 1 over omega squared. So that's the virtual speed function. Those of you who may not have seen it before, it has various nice properties. In particular, it's periodic with respect to the status, and it has poles at lattice points as well. For our purposes, I would also have. Purposes and what it also has, it satisfies an addition formula and it also satisfies a differential equation. G two and G three depend on the latter. G2 and G3 depend on the lattice, but I'm not going to say anything more about them because I don't need them. But like I said, for our purposes, this peak function is a transcendental function, it's periodic, it has an addition formula, and satisfies a differential equation, which all of the addition formula is g of z plus one is something. Yes. So p of z plus w is a rational function in terms of Rational function in terms of k of z, p of w, p prime z, and p prime. So, as a poor question. Some zoo for all non-zero area in the lattice. It's a lot of good. Uh okay, so we want to know whether you can say anything about We can say anything about definability, and it turns out that we can. And this is analogous to the theorem of Rx that I just erased. We have D once again as an open polydisc, and we have a function f from F from D to R and we let Erica and C B complex lattice but we need to assume something namely that this does not have Have complex multiplication and without I and R the bounded closed interval And we also assume that it does not contain any points. No, that does. There we go. And we conclude that if F is holomorphic in polydisd. I'm definable in an expansion of R bar given by expanding by P restricted to interval I. Then our function f is, is it okay if I go this way? Then f is definable. Definable in our bar. Okay. So there's a statement. Like I said, it's analogous to the theorem from the Rx case. I'm kind of cheating slightly here, because this is really a matter of parts restricted to the interval. But that's annoying to write, so I should write B restricted by it. Sorry, you said it's really by heading. Sorry, really. I think sorry, uh really I mean the real part of P restricts the interval and the imaginary part. There are cases when this is real value, but okay, so the proofs of all these theorems that I've stated so far if goes into R supplier helping the real contribute a little more. Complex values at some point. I'm going to think as usual data. F is people side A. Yeah, like this. So it's not coming into P, so it's like it's actually the yellow. Yeah, it is. Yeah, companies. So a similar remark is what Patrick made applied to the way you stated comments. Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right. Okay, so the proofs of their insight state so far follow a similar method and part Method, and part of the method relies on Jambel for x in the Rx case and for p in the p function case. So it's natural at this point to wonder, okay, but there's some other translational functions which have an x statement, which we could expect similar non-definability results. And at this point, we've heard the j function mentioned so many times. Mentioned so many times that it should not be a social surprise that we can say similar things to Jack. So I presume that your theorem requires the lattice to not have complexification. Do you know how much of the theorem is not true with each other? Like, is it Have complex multiplication, you get definability. So different there. Okay. C disk, just a disk this time. I is an interval again. Uh avoid buttice points. P restricted to the disk is definable in the expansion of P restricted to the interval if and only if only has One example, and this is, I mean, this is a Zero McIntyre on its way to proving something much bigger. But if you look at z plus iz, then you can show that p of iz is minus p of z. So that and the addition formula will get you the foundability of this. That's a good question. Okay, so as I said, I mean, J function has an actionable segment And this is due to either animal and when it comes to number 50, here we now ask for IHB. Here we now ask for IHP bounded interval in the poster reels. And we have disc D in the upper half. D in the upper half plane, then we conclude that J restricted to this disc is not definable in the expansion of R bar by J restricted to I times R interval I. So that's the statement we have for J. Now as you can see from the definition of the p function, which is now on there, back for a complex lattice, we associate the p functions. So, in particular, as you vary these lattices, you get different p functions. So, it makes sense. So it makes sense to consider: well, suppose we took the order of real field and we added restrictions of several p functions to it, what kind of things could we say in there with regards to definability? So that's what I'm going to talk about next. But before I do, I've been talking about restrictions a lot, but I want to make it a bit more precise before statement the following notes. So we have So we have here we got to the end an open subset and f from u to r is a function and we say that f is F is locally definable with respect to some R, an expansion of R bar if for every A set U There is a neighborhood which we denote with u sub A of our point A such that friction of f to this neighborhood is definable. It is definable in Russia. So now we need another couple of definitions. So here is once again open and map from u to R to the M and we left delta now this box All the corners are rational, and we also assume that the closure of this open box is contained in you. Then we say. Then we say that a proper restriction F is a restriction of the form F restricted delta and And if A is in fact in delta, then this restriction is proper restriction round out and X. So we've had local findability and proper restrictions and now I want to link these two things but there's a new bit notation. So So we have a set of maps F each defined on an open subset of R to the N. M which takes values and out to the n sum m and n and then this P R F is defined to be A set of all the proper restrictions of the elements of F and sub D R F is The expansion of the auditory field are the graphs of the component functions. Of maps in Piara, And the link between these two things that I mentioned earlier. F from use R will be locally definable in R if and only if all its proper restrictions are definable in R. In other words, this RPRF is the smallest expansion in which all these functions are locally defined. Okay, so. Okay, so as I said before, the reason we want to do all this is we want to vary our lattices and look at several key functions. And this is what's known as interdefinability. So now I'm going to take. Now I'm going to take some complex assets omega 1 up to omega n plus 1 and their associated p functions are going to be denoted by p1 up to p n plus 1 and the question that we wish to consider is when is p m plus 1 M plus one locally definable in R P R of P one up to P F Due to the way I ask the question, there is a triple L example. Okay. Audience participate. Okay. Audience participation didn't work. So, trivial example when Pm plus 1 is equal to Pi for one of the I octane. So, some less trivial cases. We'll think about the first one. I'm first going to state an identity. An identity satisfied by the p function, which may seem quite strange if we haven't seen it before, but it's actually quite easy to work out. So we have alpha, a non-zero complex number, and we say that the p function associated to alpha times omega, omega is just some complex artis, evaluated at z, is equal to To one over alpha squared p sub omega of z over alpha. Now, why would this identity help us? Well, here's the definition. Here's the definition. So we let omega 1 and omega 2 be complex classes. And If we have some non-zero complex in the alpha such that alpha times omega 1 is contained in omega 2, then omega 1 and omega 2 are such. Isogenous, and this is usually noted like this. So when it comes to our local definability question, we can see that we get a positive answer if omega n plus 1 is isogenous to To remove i for i equals 1 up to n let's use the identity and the other case that we have. That we have comes from a quite nice fact that I think was mentioned earlier in the week, inflection left, probably, but complex conjugation is definable our bar set, meaning what we're looking at. So if we consider what's known as the short reflection. Of some function f, and just to colour myself, I'm assuming that f here is on a disk with a real center. Okay, and it turns out that. Okay, and it turns out that when it comes to p functions, the Schwartz reflection of p omega is actually the p function associated to the complex conjugate of our logice omega. So when it comes to local definability, we get another positive answer if omega n plus 1 is the complex conjugate Conjugate of one of our other. Okay. So those are two nice cases where we can answer this local definability question positively. And it turns out that that's it. So this is due to Karen Jones, Jonathan Kirby and Tamara Servey. Head in terms of heading. And firstly, we let F1 be a set consisting of a complex X and some A functions. And we let F2 consist just of p functions and we assume that no p function in F2 Is isogenous to one in F1 of its force reflection, then the theorem says that Any set that is definable in both R, P R F one and R P R and F two is definable. In our bar. Okay, so that's instant findability for the fashion SP function and has been discussed in particular in Francesco's talk. You have these p functions are seen in the eccentric maps for elliptic curves, and elliptic curves turn out to be. Turn out to be Ben varieties of dimension one. So it is natural to consider whether we can state similar results for the exponential maps over beta varieties. And it turns out that we can. So this is joint work with Gareth and Jonathan. So let G and H be the abelian varieties and we denote by Fg. And we denote by Fg and F H referred to as associated sets of exponential maps. So these are just what you get if you do everything you have with the B function, and then you also need to consider that you could get products and being subvarieties. And being sub-varieties, and then you have to add in all the sorts of actions, and that's what these associated sets ups and maps are. And you suppose that the intersection of these things is empty, then we conclude that That any step definable in R P R F G and R P R F H is the final in And other so in Europe we have their the one that we have here says also something. And also some p functions. Yes. And the other one over there, you only have these functions for the variants. You also have x. Yes. Question. Okay. Okay. So, maybe I missed this. Can you say the associated exponential maps mean, for example, that if G is a product of multiple elliptic curves, then you're going to not have surge or not? And you start with x, g and then you add xh for You add xh for being sub-varieties and then you add x for be the varieties isogenous to these and then you add exp And then you add exp products. And finally, you add all the Schwartz collections. There's another way to do this. Schwartz reflections of everything you already have. A slightly better way, maybe, to do this is we know that any agreement. That any abundant variety is isogenous to this product of powers of simple abelian varieties. So you could start with the exponential maps for the simple abelian varieties, and then do products and isogenies and so on, and you should get the same thing. Okay, so I'm running out of time, but I'm running out of time, but the proofs of both the past two theorems, I use one of these Kushovsky pre-dimensional constructions that Jonathan mentioned in his talk. I'd just like to spend the last few minutes talking about some open problems. So, way back at the beginning, we had these non-validated. Undefinability and definability results for x, p, and j, but there is a bit of a gap. So when I stated the result for j, I just stated it for the restriction of j to a disk, and it is not definable in this expansion. This expansion, and the open problem is do the holomorphic version of this result. So f is u by v, u and v are definable in this. If f is holomorphic, sure it's already definable in our bar. And then what you want to show is f is holomorphic, then definable in this expansion. Okay, and And the second open problem is write semi-abelian instead of abelian. So into the findability of semi-belian, of excellent maps of semi-belian varieties. Tiny problem. The reduced ability theorem is not true for semi-related varieties, which is a bit of an obstruction, but get rid of that and you'll be fine. Third open problem is the statement of that theorem and the statement of the other theorem. There it's specifically noted that this intersection is empty, and an open problem, and this is open even in the VyStress B function case, is when it's not empty. So just to give you a better idea of what the statement should be, this should be true, but you would have, let's just let F1 F one, F two consist of p functions and we let f3 be their intersection, which are empty, then the conclusion should be something like Any set definable in R P R F one and R P R F two is definable in a P R That's all I wanted to talk about. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. Do you have any questions? Which results are? The one that you have there. So it's basically analogous to the proof of the p-function case on the Svachovsky pre-dimensional instructions. So, you know, pre-dimension. So we use a different pre-dimension to the p-function case. But yes, you need facts there and you need pre-dimensions on. We need three dimensions on that kind of as we need like the whole and so on that Jonathan mentioned is talking about. What if you wanted to do something like knowing that the j function is not definable here? For some reason, I thought it must manage restriction. I just tray rather than thinking I had somewhere. So then, you want to take some p functions? Is the j function definable in So, to some extent, because you could express that problem in a setting from earlier results, where you'd just be looking at restrictions to this definable and expansions restricted to the interval. Now, if you just add p, not really sure how to show it because you need like so if you expanded by peer restrictions. Expanded by P restricts the interval and J restricts the interval. Well, I think if you just directly apply the method, the ones I think you can say that something like not both of P restricted to the disk and J restricted to a disk are definable in a structure. I don't think you can say just one on the right. Because when you are. So basically, like the way the proof works is. Proof works is you assume definability for a contradiction and you end up comparing upper and lower bounds on some transcendence degree of some extension. Small upper bound, big lower bound, that's why you need X. But when you first apply this, you actually have upper and lower bounds on different extensions. So you need to do some fiddling to get the same extension. And you like this fiddling just comes from backs about P that you know. Facts about P that we know, but also what is helpful when you're looking at p restructured to the disk is that one of the functions you're looking at is like p of i t. And then you apply the x to i t as well as t, so you can just get rid of this. But if you are applying this with like p and j, you need to be applying it with p and j at the same time. If you do it just on your own, I don't think you can apply manipulation. I'm not sure how to get around that. I'm not sure how to get around that. But saying something like, not both of these are definable is a slightly unsatisfactory result. But you can, for the bias-stra-seta function, you can say it because the derivative of the bias-stra-seta function is just minus p. So you have that in there, and there's an act statement with p in the bias-stra-seta. So you can say the restriction of bias-stra-CTA to a disk is not definable in the structure given by defining by p. Byte finding by pain and by shape. I'm not sure. This is gonna be a very ignored question, but what exactly the assumption that fg intersected with fh is empty means? Because like set theoretically, they have like different condominiums, right? The functions in Fg going to G, right? H go into How could they be equal? How could they be equal or what does it mean? Well I mean G is like E1 and H is E1 times E2. Oh, okay, I see. Like so it could be that j that this hold, like the assumption would hold to be just because of shape of key and H. Oh, yeah. More questions? If not, thanks for having me. And we resume in six minutes. The set of exponential functions include the set of exponential functions of all the separate and all the exponential functions.
