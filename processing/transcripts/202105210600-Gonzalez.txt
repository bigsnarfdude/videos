It's my great pleasure to introduce the second speaker, Professor Maliad Ma Gonzalez from University of Madali. The title of the talk is non-local ODG in conformal geometry. Jomisha. Malia, please. Okay, so first of all, I would like to thank the organizers for the opportunity to be here. Is the sound good enough? Yes. Okay, so it's just a pity we cannot be there in person, but I'm happy to see everybody at least in Zoom. Okay, and my talk is going. Okay, and my talk is going to cover two different analysis problems that I could involve non-local operators and in particular the fractional Laplacian. But the tools that I'm going to use come from conformal geometry. So first I knew conformal geometry and thanks to that I could solve them. So let me start with some background. I start with ever Riemannian manifold of dimension n. I'm going to take a conformal change of metric. Take a conformal change of metric. So here I have my metric g tilde that is going to be a conformal change from the original background G and the conformal change I'm going to write it with this conformal factor U, a positive function. Now with this one can define the conformal fraction a Laplace. I'm not going to go over the definition so I say thank you to Azara and maybe And maybe other talks that explain, and Fang one that explains the background for this operator. So, for me, the conformal fraction of Laplacian is going to be this big operator where the power gamma is between 0 and 1. Okay, so now the important thing about this operator is that it satisfies an intertwining. Satisfies an intertwining property. This means that if I change the metric conformally as I pointed above, then the operator satisfies this transformational rule between the G metric and the G tilde metric. Now with this, I can define the fractional curvature Q G gamma, that it's just the operator applied to the function one. Now there is a normalization constant that I'm not going to. A normalization constant that I'm not going to care, but because I'm always going to take the power n greater than 2 gamma, and if I substitute the function 1 in the equation into the intertwining rule, I obtain the Q-curvature equation that relates the Q-curvature of the G-tilde metric. And then, of course, here you can set up the fractional Jamabe problem that it's to find a conformal metric in. Conformal metric in which your new Q gamma curvature is constant, and I think Monica talked a little bit about this. And okay, there is many people have talked about this type of problems. And okay, this is a semi-linear equation with a critical power non-linearity in the right-hand side. Okay, some particular cases of this. Particular cases of this fractional operator. You have P1 is just the conformal Laplacian, it's the minus Laplacian constant times the scalar curvature, or P2, the Panich operator, that is the by Laplacian. Now, these two powers, and in particular, the integer powers are local, but in the rest, they are non-local operators, they can be understood as direct to Neumann data. And for instance, P1/2 is the Neumann boundary operator, is the normal derivative plus. Is the normal derivative plus at mean curvature and p3 halves involves the normal derivative of the Laplacian, so you see it's of third order. Now, when you calculate these operators on some particular manifolds, on the flat case, since you don't have curvatures, p gamma reduces to the fraction of Laplacian, so it's the gamma power of the Laplacian. You can understand it in Fourier transform if you. In Fourier transform, if you want, just because in Fourier, the Fourier symbol of this operator is just CLA to the two gammas, so it's just a multiplier. Now the sphere, the P gamma operator, has this formula with the involving the gamma functions. And I think it has already appeared in some of the talks. The Q curvature was calculated by Ranson. And then if you And then, if you learn like representation theory of symmetric spaces, then you realize that these quantities are quite natural. And a philosophy here is that you are going to get a lot of gamma and special functions in this business. Now, in the case that I'm going to be concerned today is the case of the cylinder. So, I parametrize and let me write the cylindrical metric in G sub C is just take the Just take the Euclidean metric dx squared divided by the conformal factor R square. So if you rewrite this, take the Euclidean metric in polar coordinates upstairs divide by R squared. Now make the change of variable r equals to the e to the minus t. It's called empty folder. You see, you simplify and you see that the cylindrical metric is just the t squared plus the theta. is just dts square plus d theta square, where dts squared corresponds to the r well to the line and d theta when I write the theta squared is the metric of the standard sphere of dimension and main square. Okay and the main object of the study in my talk today is going to be the conformal fractional applaution on the cylinder. I'm going to denote it by pica matu C and since I'm only going to consider this by And since I'm only going to consider this background manifold, I'm going to drop the dependence on the metric, just in that I'm going to be talking about the cylinder all the time. Okay, so now if you use that the cylinder metric is conformal to the Euclidean metric, you can use the intertwining rule for the operator to write just this simple rule to relate the conformal fraction a la Placian on the cylinder to the fraction a la Placian. To the fractional Lacian. So, the moral of my story is that if I want to study an equation that involves the fractional Lacian, when you write it in polar coordinates, it's going to be much easier to work on the cylinder. So, I'm going to transfer my equation into with fractional Lacian on an equation with P gamma. But they are equivalent and they're just related by this intertwining rule or a conjugation if you want by these r factors. Okay. So now. So now, just let me talk a little bit more about the conformal fractional Laplacian on the cylinder, the gamma. Recall that I'm writing the metric as with a t variable, and I'm going to be considering solutions that depend only on the t variable, so quickly the theta dependence will drop. Okay, so just a quick review. Consider the spherical harmonic decomposition of the sphere Sn minus one. So this means that I have a sequence of eigenvalues mu m and a sequence of eigenfunctions E m. So that they satisfy the eigenvalue equation for the Laplacian in the s and minus one sphere. So the decomposition tells me that any function on the cylinder can be the On the cylinder can be decomposed as that depends on the and theta as a sum of each projection over the nth subspace. Here I'm not I'm using a little I'm doing a little bit abuse of notation with repeated eigenvalues, but let's not worry about it. And the first theorem that I'm going to present, this is, I think, the first This is, I think, the first paper in a thyras thesis. Is that if you project the conformal fractional Laplacian on the cylinder over in the spherical harmonic decomposition, so let me co-put the separate index PM to denote the nth projection. What we can prove is that this operator diagonalizes under the spherical harmonic decomposition. And moreover, if you take the Fourier transform, then this operator. The Fourier transform, then this operator is just a multiplier. So now, when I write this hat, it means just the Fourier transform that in the T variable that becomes the X variable in Fourier variables. It's the one-dimensional Fourier transform. And you see that, as I said, in Fourier variables, the operator is just a multiplier, theta gamma, super M and the Fourier. Super M and the Fourier symbol. I mean, this multiplier is given here. I wrote an explicit formula with the gamma functions. It looks a little bit awful at first, but then you realize that you will see in my talk that this will be very natural. Okay, so now I am okay. So quickly I will concentrate on just the zeroth projection and just working on gradial functions. So I'm going to forget. On gradial functions, so I'm going to forget about the M. Now, the proof of this theorem is just, as I mentioned, the first proof is by joint work with Athara de la Torre. We used the extension problem and we wrote the, well, comes the scattering, we wrote the scattering problem just realizing that the cylinder is the conformal infinity of ABS space. Then you write the extension and take the direct relative to Neumann and you obtain this formula. Now, I'm going to present a new proof. Now, I'm going to present a new proof that we just found, at least for radial solutions for the m equals to zero projection, using Mellin transform. So the Mellin transform is defined here in purple. Basically, it's Fourier is a combination of Fourier and a logarithmic change. So this is what I did above. I changed from R to the T variable by an exponential logarithm, and then I took. Loarithmin and the netup Fourier. So instead of combining those, you can write Mellin transform and the Mellin transform of a function u. Now I have some freedom to choose the index here, so I'm just write it there. It's not important how you write it. It's just the integral over the positive r times r to this power. So the properties, as I said, if you take the right alpha, then for you to Then for you to transform is equivalent to Melling up to this logarithmic change. And if alpha equals minus one half, then it's also an isometry, and I'm going to use these properties later. So to reprove this theorem above, instead of writing in Fourier variables, I'm going to write it in Mellin variables. Now my Mellin variables will be lambda, but I just have to obtain a formula for this multiplier in Mellin. This multiplier in Mellin. So, this is what I wrote here, just using Mellin instead of Fourier. And I need to recover the same symbol now in the variable lambda. So, now the proof is just a lengthy calculation, but it's easy. It's just write the intertwining rule for the conformal fractional Laplacian, take the Mellin transform of this, that's what I'm doing here. And now recall that the Fourier symbol of the fractional Laplacian. That the Fourier symbol of the fractional Laplacian is k to the 2s, so bring a Fourier transform in and out and just calculate. And the two things that you need to realize is that this Fourier transform is the nth-dimensional Fourier transform. So it's actually, if you do the Fourier transform in radial coordinates, this is the Hankel transform that I wrote there, and you have a formula in terms of Bessel functions. And at some point, you will need to integrate all these things, and you need to. These things, and you need to do integrals of Bessel functions and powers, and you see that you're starting gamma functions in the formula, and that gives you the proof of the symbol. Okay, so quickly I will run into the fractional geometry problem, instead of conformal metric with a constant curvature. It reduces to solve this Yemenian equation to fix ideas, just to consider a Euclidean background and put an background and put an isolated so on an RN and put an isolated singularity at the origin so it is known that if u must have a singularity a very precise singularity at the origin so if you change variables r equals c to the minus ts above and change from u to v by this factor then what is important here is that your It's important here is that your original equation is equivalent to an equation for the conformal fraction of Laplacian on the cylinder. And moreover, you obtain the same equation, but with a different operator. Now, what I'm doing here is nothing. Look at the case of gamma equals to one for radial solutions. If you write the ODE for the solutions and you make all these changes, you obtain. Make all these changes, you obtain an ODE in the V variable, and the advantage is that the equation in the V variable is autonomous. You kill all the factors in R. So the same thing is happening in the fractional case, even though this is not an ODE. And this is what I explained here, that if you start with the fractional Laplacian equation and you make all these changes from U to V, then you obtain an equivalent equation that has much, much better properties. So I'm going to quickly give you two applications. One is the Give you two applications. One is the fractional caffarellic connect inequality, joint work with We Au and Azara de la Torre. And then the second, more recent applications, we did regularity theory for non-local equations with drift and Hardy potential. And this is joint work with the Hardy Chan, Marco Fontellus, and Jung Chengwei. So just quickly, the fractional Kafara Cornier and Berkeley inequality, the local equation, the usual The local equation, the usual equation, is just this one. It relates the norm of gradient squared and u to the p with some power weights. And you try to find the best constant. Then we set up a fractional analogus. So here you need to change the Diraclet energy by a fractional energy. And then you need to introduce the weight. So we propose this inequality. You can prove that the best constant is a test. The base constant is attained. And moreover, if it's not attained, then you have, you know, exactly why, because that's that function, that singular function is your enemy. You have some inversion symmetry proof and moving plane. And something that is interesting is that the minimizers or the best optimizers of this inequality may not be radially symmetric. And we gave a small characterization of what happened. Of what happened. I mean, we found some cases where you have symmetry breaking of the minimizers for this inequality. Now, the pictures on the left is what you usually see for the local case that has received a lot of attention. And you realize that there is a region, a yellow region where you have symmetry, a purple region where you have symmetry breaking, and a red curve, the felisionider curve, that separates both regions. Schneider curve that separates both regimes. So, in the non-local case, we didn't find the Feldier-Schneider curve because it's quite complicated, but we found a region where you do have symmetry breaking, and this is this purple region, or now blue region that we found here. So, actually, we proved symmetry breaking in this range and the existence of a Feli-Snyder curve, a little a bit of a Fele-Snyder curve. So, now the problem would be to continue this problem. The problem would be to continue this problem, and now the proof is to perturb a minimizer in the direction of the first eigenvalue, and you need to figure out when the first eigenvalue is negative. But the idea for all this proof is that instead of working with original inequality, I'm going to change again do the MTM folder or work on the cylinder. And for instance, if you write the Euler-Lagrange equation for the inequality, so the equation that Optimas satisfies and you make That optimizer satisfies, and you make all these changes, then you see that you need to recover again an equation for the conformal fractional Laplacian on the cylinder that is semi-linear and it's of the same type that I have been talking about. So, we're again looking at if this equation has only radial solutions. Now, another result that we have, we prove a non-degeneracy in the radial sector. Degeneracy in the radial sector. So, if we have V-bar that is a minimizer and we consider the linearized operator around this minimizer, we would like to characterize the kernel of the linearized operators if it's invertible. And okay, you can calculate easily that the derivative of the v-bar, the minimizer, belongs to the kernel, and the theorem. Belongs to the kernel, and the theorem is that actually the kernel is just one dimensional and is composed by is completely characterized by this function. Okay, so now you have the something that it is in the local case because you have an ODE here. This is not an OD anymore, and you cannot do nothing. You cannot use, you have to start your theory. We also got the uniqueness of minimizer up to translate. Of minimizer up to translation in T, and the proof follows a unique continuation argument as gamma tends to one. Because you have uniqueness for gamma equals to one, then you will have uniqueness for the frac for all the gammas. And this follows the classical work of Frank Levmann, and they did it for the pure fractional Laplacian equation. Now we use their proof relies on the spectral properties of the symbol. Now, our symbol, it's the peak, the symbol that I presented before. It's the big symbol that I presented before with the gammas function, is actually much better behaved than the symbol of the fraction of Laplacian. So we could get the same results. Okay, now maybe I will not cover this, but just a quickly an idea that if you consider the equation just solve just solve for radially symmetric solutions. Just solve for radially symmetric solutions of a P gamma linear equation, then we found a Green's function formula that you can write your solution as a convolution with a Green's function, and this Green's function is calculated from the symbol. And okay, so if you invert the symbol of the equation, you have to be careful because this is a Meromorphic function and you can have poles. function and you can have poles and but I may not have time to do that and now I will finish just with talking a little bit about non-local equations with drift which is our second application so we are working on the regularity theory for this equation in red that it's the you have a fractional Laplacian of U plus a drift term plus a high plus a drift term plus a hardy potential. So this potential r to the two gamma is critical for this equation. And you see that you have a competition between this that is order one and then the other two that are of order two gamma. Okay, so you see that to have solutions, our theorem is that tells us that we have solutions for this equation and regularity. So now yeah. So now just let me define this E gamma weight that is just in Fourier variables is just an exponential or an exponential type weight in Fourier. And our first theorem, let's say, imagine that we only have the fractional Laplacian and the drift. So equals k equals to zero. There is no kappa. So under the Fretholm condition given by this weight, so that the integral of the right-hand side is zero, we have The right hand side is zero, we have that the equation gains two gamma derivatives. Okay, there is a little epsilon there, but I will remove it in a second. But you see that you have the standard Sovolev inequalities gain of two gamma derivatives, even in the case s less than one half. Or say if s is greater than one half, then well, you have the fractional Laplacian wins the drift. The fractional Laplacian wins the drift, and there is nothing to prove. So, quickly, the proof of this theorem is just as okay for radials in the radial symmetric case. I'm going to consider only in the talk today. So, take the Fourier transform of the equation. Everything is radially symmetric. When you take the Fourier write equation in Fourier variables, you just have an OD, then integrate it, and you get an explicit formula. Integrate it and you get an explicit formula and work a little bit hard and you get the estimates and that's the proof. Now let me go to the general case in which you have a kappa here. Now this trick of taking Fourier transform is not going to work because the Fourier transform doesn't talk well with this potential term. So what we did is instead of taking Fourier we took Mellin. So this is our second theory. So, this is our second theorem that if kappa is less than the Hardy constant, this is already technical, not to get poles. I'll finish in a second. That for the whole equation, if you work with radial solutions, then you gain actually two gamma derivatives. So, this is a better result than the previous one. And the trick is the same: use cylindrical coordinates and technical transforms. So, the fractional Laplacian, you recover again this. Recover again this symbol that I presented at the beginning. Now, let me do the proof for k equals to zero only because it's explicit. What you see, and the main idea here is what you're seeing is that you have a v of lambda and a v of lambda in a different complex line. So you have an equation relating the values of a function over two complex lines. This is called a Riemann-Hilbert problem. And okay, you have a unique. And okay, you have some, you need to make some changes. You see a lot of gamma functions coming in, but when you make those changes, what you arrive is at this equation. Just compare the gerv1 over two different complex lines. Okay, so make take a logarithmic change and you just, so the two lines become the right line, and you have to study the jump of the function over the two sides of this horizontal. Two sides of this horizontal red line, and that's the Cauchy integral, and you have an explicit formula for this V1. So, okay, that's your solution. Then work out and get the estimates, and then you get the gain of regularity. For kappa different than zero, you don't have this nice change, but again, well, you can. You can, since this introducing this kappa is not going to make a big change because you just introduce a factor, compare theta with theta minus kappa, and it doesn't really matter. And now the Fretholm condition is recovered. Okay, for this equation to have a solution, you need that the integral of this right-hand side essentially is zero, more or less. And if you're okay, so this is what I wrote. Okay, so this is what I wrote here. You have all these changes, you have worked hard, we work hard and fix these special functions. This is and stuff, that is the Mellin transform of F times the Mellin transform of our original weight. If you use that, this is an isometry, you just get the integral of F times E gamma. This is what the Fred Holm condition. What the Fredhon condition that I wrote at the beginning. So, okay, I think this is the end of my talk.
