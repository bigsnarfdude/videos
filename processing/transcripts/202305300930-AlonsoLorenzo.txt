Thank you very much for the introduction, Jason, and thank you very much for everyone to come here. It's very nice to see all of these familiar faces. Okay, so I'm going to start talking about the T2S and also, but Daniel has already had a nice background on DHVSTOS, so I'm going to be able to go a bit more quickly through this part. So, as he already said, I dig to structure I is a free form which is pointwise linearly identified. With some standard associated form over R7 denoted by phi zero. Once we have a digital structure, phi, then we can define a metric, gene, depending on phi, as well as a volume form. And with both of them, we can define a hot star operator. Then, we denote by psi, which is known as the cross-society. Which is known as the cross-resetive form to be the fault star operator of phi. And this would depend on phi in a very non-linear way. Now we have different types of J2 structures depending on which of the associated form phi and psi are closed or not. So we say that a J2 structure is closed if D of phi is equal to zero. And we will say that it's co-closed if D of Ïˆ is. If the outside is equal to zero. Now, as you already know, if both of them are true, then the tissue structure is torsion-free. And if we have a manifold with a torsion-free tissue structure, then this would be what's known as a titu manifold. Hence, the holonomy would be contained in the exception of the group T2. And I also want to mention the nearly K-LER. K-ler nature structures, as Jesse also mentioned them yesterday, which have neote parallel neo-parallels equal to lambda psi. However, during this talk, I'm going to be focusing on co-closed detail structures. I will I will be explaining a little bit about why later. So, from now on, I is going to be a co-closed district structure. And we will consider P, which is a principal G-bandal over M, which is a seven-dimensional manifold. Then we define the two instantons as connections on B such that the curvature with the cosmosity form is equal to zero. Or equivalently if F A, which with psi, is equal to minus the hot star of F A. To start off the FA. David already told us a couple of reasons to be interested in digital instantons, but I want to make a few more remarks. So the first remark is that we do need to ask. For the digital structure to be composed. However, we do not need it to be closed. And the reason why it has to be co-closed is because if not, the D-Twinstanton equation would be over-determined. Other remark that I wanted to make. That I wanted to make is that on a compact due to manifold, due to instant terms are absolute minimizers of the jungle's energy functional. Energy functional. I can see this expression on the space of clinic energy connections on P. So this is very similar to the picture that happens in four dimensions. So as Danielle already said, one reason to be interested in digital instantons is the Donaldson-Thomas program. So as Donaldson was able to control So as Donald John was able to construct the variance to G2 of four manifolds using LPSF2 connections, then there is a hope of using G2 instantons to find some deformation invariant over compact D2 manifolds. However, my main motivation to be interested in G2 instantons is actually something different, which is related to the talk that Megan gave yesterday, which is the aderotic G2 system. I'm not going to give the definition again because Mario already said it much better than I could have. But the important thing is that in this system, a G2 instant naturally appears, and this is over a manifold with a G2 structure that after a conformal transformation, we can assume it to be co-closed. However, in the case that this is apart from co-closed, also torsion-free, then the main equation of the system, which is the heterotic Bayank identity, is not. Methodic bayank identity is not as interesting. So, this is why I will be focusing in teacher structures that are only conclusion. Now, let me introduce some examples of teacher instances that are relevant for the rest of the talk. So first of all, over Brian-Salomon metric on the manifold R4 times the script, this is from 89, Clark 2014 found a one-parameter family. Of G2 instantons. Now, this family was later generalized by Lottigal Oliveida in 2018, where they studied both SU2 cube invariant and and SU2 squared times U1 invariant D2 instant and these were over both this manifold with the variance of one metric but also over some other D2 metrics like the B G G one standing from Vancouver, Gomeys, Gux and Couca which is a particular example of a bigger family of G2 metrics which is known as the B7 function. As the B75. So, over these metrics and also over other metrics on manifolds that are not necessarily this one, they were able to find existence, non-existence, and classification results. Their work was later complemented by Stella Turner very recently. And this was also over the Bryant-Salam metric. And they were able to find one more one-parameter family of instantrons. Just filling a case that was left over in Latean Olive study. Now, there is other recent, very important family of dichometries, which is the one by Foskolohaski and Sarnostom in 2020. In 2021, and in this paper, they were able to construct actually not one but infinitely many new one-parameter families of complete digitometrics, which are asymptotically conically local. Asymptotic gates. And these were all SU2 squared times U1 in prime. Now, over the asymptotically conical limit of one of these families known as the C7 family. Matthias Nostroman Turner found another one-parameter family of the two intercodes, this family being non-explicit. Being non-explicit. Now, there is something that all of these examples have in common, which are that the manifold have a homogeneity one structure. Hence, it is natural to continue exploring homogeneity one symmetries to find new examples of G2 instantons. However, all of these also have G2 metrics, so the G2 structures are torsion-free, not only closed. Hence, what I was trying to do is try to use homogeneity one techniques, but now relax the techniques. Techniques, but now relax the condition of the digital structure being torsion-free to only being co-closed. And other thing from these examples is that all of the manifolds are non-compact. By relaxing the condition from torsion-free to co-close, then we are going to be able to look for G2 instances in manifolds that are compact as well and find some new examples. Yes, you have this nice table here. Just a question: The gauge group is the same and also. Yes, it's SG2. Saying, also? Yes, it's a teacher. And we'll stick with that one? Yes. Are there results known for other gauge groups? Sorry. Are there big results known for other gauge groups, like larger gauge groups? So in this manifold, no. In other cases. We get a bio and someone with the manifolds. I have two one-parameter panels in SU3, and I have some. SU3, and I have some examples with SU3 also. I suppose on Twister connected sounds you can do. Oh no, I don't know. But they're not co-homogeneous. I mean, they're not complex. As I mentioned homogeneity one manifolds, I'm gonna have a short progression to define homogeneity one manifold syntax. Anyway, that's okay. For anyone that's not familiar with them. You remember it's 180, the true? Yes, this is Brown Coober, Domis, Kooser, and Bukhov. So definition, a manifold S is of homogeneity. And this is of competent. If there is an action by symmetries of a compact digit. With a generic orbit of codimension one. Then, if we have a manifold which is homogeneity one, and if we further assume that the fundamental group is finite, then if we consider the projection onto the orbit space M1. Onto the orbit space M1G. This is going to be isomorphic to some closed interval in case the manifold is compact, or if the manifold is non-compact, but it's also not just a product space, then this is going to be an interval of this form. Then we denote by principal orbits to be the inverse images of the integral points of these intervals, while the similar orbits would be the inverse images of the boundary. The inverse images of the boundary points of these intervals. Hence, for a non-compact homogeneity one manifold, then we would have one singular orbit, while for a compact one we would have two different singular orbits. If we denote by m prints to be the union of all principal orbits, then this is actually isomorphic to the interior of this interval times a generic principal orbit that we can write it down as g mod k, where k is the principal isotropy group. Where K is the principal isotropy group. And this is actually going to be a denser group of the manifold M. Hence, when we're working with homogeneity one manifolds, it is natural to first work out what are the structures on the principal part of the manifold, and then we can extend them to the whole manifold, to the similar orbits. However, for this extension to be done in a smooth way, there is some extra conditions that we need to check that follow from our Check that follow from our work by Estimura 1 that tells us in general how to extend attention smoothly to the singular outputs. What category is that isomorphism in? Sorry? Isomorphism. In what sense? We can write that an isomorphism. I don't know what isomorphism means. Do you mean scale? That's okay. That's okay. K is the principle. Okay, so when we have a homogeneity to one manifold, we can also describe it in terms of the group acting together with the isotopy groups. That for a compact case, there will be three of them, two singular and one principal, and for the non-compact, one singular and one principle. The manifolds that we're going to be considering through the rest of the talk. Through the rest of the talk, are the Brayan's Helen manifold, R4 times S3, which has a group diagram given by the acting group of SU2 squared. It has a singular isotropic group, which is SU2, and is diagonally embedded into the acting group. And then trivial, principal isotropic group. I'm also going to be considering a compact homogeneity one manifold, which is S4 times S3. And this one has a very similar homogeneity one. And this one has a very similar homogeneity one structure, but now with two similar soto-brows instead of one. Now, the reason why I'm interested in these two manifolds in particular is because last year I was able to construct a big family of co-chlosed digital structure over both of them. So the natural question was to ask either any examples of Was to ask: are there any examples of these two instatons on these manifolds with these structures? So, what the theorem says is the following on these two manifolds with these previous commodity constructions. Here is a summary of SC2 square invariant couples the two structures which is moving by. By three smooth functions, also positive, that we denote a1, a2 and a3, and they go from our interval, which can be either 0 infinity or our quota split or 0, 1, together with certain. Together with certain boundary conditions around the similar orbit or orbits and an oscillodiameter. Basically. And moreover, any such structure which is constructed from a half-flat SU2 structure. So as you can see, there is a lot of these extra structures and they would be given by the beta which functions. And as I mentioned, there are some boundary conditions which say that if we have a singular orbit at t equals zero, then the area functions need to have. Then the AF functions need to have a full radio expansion on this way. So they'd look like t has plus some higher orders on t and also it has to be odd. And similarly, if there is another singular orbit at t equals one, then we will need to have the equivalent conditions around this other singular orbit. One of the things that the proof of this theorem uses is a fact that was initially welcomed by Schulte Hedenberg. Quoted by Schulte Hedenberg in his PhD thesis and also later by Maxim Salaman, says that a generic is a true square invertebrate L flat SUV structure on the principal orbits of this manifold that they all look like S written. They all look like S3 times S3 is given by six smooth functions, Ai, A1, A2 and A3, and B1, B2, and B3, also with integrals of definition. The A ones that appear here are the ones that are going to appear ultimately in the theorem. Appear ultimately in the theorem, and then there is these other three functions appearing: b1, b2, and b3. That's what this theorem shows is that they are actually depending on the data of the AI functions. And also to check the extension of the singular orbit, there would be some boundary conditions on A's and B's. The A's are already imposed in the conditions of the theorem, and the ones of the B's are automatically satisfied. This is other of the things that are shown in the proof of this theorem. So, what's half of that? Sorry, what's half flat? Half-flat is that we have an SU3 structure given by the two-form omega, then some free form that we can write it down as the sum of the imaginary and the real part. Then the omega squared is zero and also the omega one. So the thing is that we can write down all of our structure in terms of these six small functions. And then, for example, the And then, for example, the metric on the principal part of the manifold times A would be given by us. us t squared plus where ethers are just from dual basis Basis on the principal bundle. Hence, we can interpret the functions ABs as deformations of the conical metric. So these are all co-closed, and the only conditions on the A's are that the boundary conditions, there's no... Also smooth positive. Yeah, but there's no differential equation you have to satisfy. So then if you can, for this family, if you with the rest of the torsion, then you presumably get differential equations on the A's for the. Differential equations on the A's for the other two torsion components by solutions there? Yes, so for example, some of the examples that I mentioned before happen when you introduce these conditions and also what would be the co-close equations. So what I'm trying to say is that a particular case of this family of co-closed feature structures are the known examples of three. And that's in R4 times S3. Yes. And probably on S4 times S3, you can't make it. In this case, no, there is no exact. Can you kill one of the other two torsions, maybe? Yes, actually, tau zero is equal zero. Okay, so these are the structures that we're going to work with. Now, let's move on to the problem of finding the digital instantons. So, the setup of the problem is the following. As I said before, the gauge work is whenever we exit 2, just because it's the simplest non-ABN case. And we will work on a temporal gauge, which means that we're going to look for connections that are equal to a one parameter family of connections on the principal orbits. Now we have to s actually we have to say what are the bundles that we're going to be using. Are the bundles that we're going to be using? And if we have a homogeneous orbit, which is a situation where some group K, then the principal bundles over this homogeneous orbit are in correspondence with isotropy homomorphisms for the goal from K into the gauge group, etc. Hence, over the principal orbits, as K is trivial, there is only the trivial principal value. And for a singular And for a singular orbit, then we have two different choices of isotropic momorphism because there is two ways of writing an isomorphism from SE2 to SE2, being the trivial isomorphism and the identity isomorphism. Hence, over a singular orbit, we have two choices of bundles. Sorry, can you say that again? Yes, so there is a correspondence between pre-sync bundles over an orbit, an homogeneous orbit, that with isotropy amongst them. That with isotropy amomorphisms that go for the group K, in the case of the singular orbits, this is equal to Se2. So because there is two choices of isomorphism from SE2 to SE2, there is two choices of basic issues. Yes. Amorphism. That's what you choose me. So, or two choices of So all two choices of bundle are P1 given by the trivial homomorphism and P identified. So if you wanted to generalize this to other SUM age groups, for instance, you would basically have to do some more combinatorics into all the possible languages. All the possible lands? I guess so, yeah. And then you would be able to figure it out. So there is this second order principal bundle using the identical moments. As for the case of R4 times S3, we only have one similar orbit. There will be a total of two choices of bundle coming from the choice of bundle over the similar orbit. So this is four. Now on S4 times S3, we have to make a choice in each of the two singular orbits. So at the end, we will have three possible choices of bundle. Coming from taking two trivial bundles, one trivial and one identity, and two identity. These bundles are defined about the singular orbit? Yes. Well, yeah, this is the definition of the singular orbit, and then this is just the construction by taking the relevant bundle over each of the singular orbits and then the trivial one over the principal orbits. And finally, we're going to introduce an extra condition, which is that we will focus on the case where there is an extra symmetry, an extra AC2 symmetry. And what this means is that in our data of the A functions, we're going to pick all of them to be equal. Now, if we make this assumption, then we can also find that the B functions will have to be the same. And this is actually an explicit expression. explicit expression and this is something that in the general situation where the a's are different we don't have so our previous theorem says that there is that they exist some b's satisfying all the relevant conditions but they're not necessarily explicit however in this case where there is this extra situation symmetry then they are So you mean that in the choice of the three functions AI, which basically define your metric, you have the freedom to choose them equal. And what are these now? So this is an explicit expression. It depends on A. It's a particular solution. It's the only solution for these A functions, and then the parameter is zero. It depends on. It depends on L1, and there's an explicit formula, although I'm not copying it here because it's actually kind of complicated. But it's good to have an explicit expression because then we would also have explicit expressions in some cases for the AC ones. So that's it. Not only the A stars. You can write A B structure, the in terms of the A and the B functions. Is that the sizes of the two SE2s and SE2 squared? So she answered for it. Oh, yeah. You also answered my question. I wanted to make it differently on A. Perfect. Um okay, so then we categorize the first proposition, which says that if we have theta be an assumed q connection. By connection with the edge project then up to an equivariant gauge transformation. We can write it as the following eyes are the standard basis of the DIDevel SU. develop SV2 and then X and Y oh and the etas are the same basis that we had before and X Y are smooth functions satisfying the following system of audience Maybe you can exaggerate the dots. What's this report? So, this is the system that we filed. Yes, also. However, this system turns out to be very difficult to solve, first of all, because it's non-autonomous, and second, because there are some singularities. And second, because there are some singularities in the singular points. So, from the expressions that we have from A and B, we do know that these terms are of the order 1 over T. Can you remind us how SU cubed acts on SU2? How does SU cubed act on SU2? Can you remind us what that action is? Is it SU cubed or SU? No, they're SUQ invariant because apart from the action of SU2 squared, then we have this X by SU2 symmetry. Okay. So we can write it down. Symmetry. So we can write it down for our manifolds, a different common unit, one structure if we want whether group acting cube. Okay. So we have this singular initial value problem, but we do know a theorem that tells us a way of finding solutions of singular initial value problems in a neighborhood around the singular points. This theorem was originally due to Mal-Grant, but there is also a nice reformulation by Foss Polar-Haskins. By Fosscola Haskins in 2017. However, this theorem only gives us short-time existence of solutions. Then there is an additional problem of trying to extend these solutions to the rest of the principal part of the manifold and also to the second singular orbit in case we are with a compact example. However, before applying this theorem, we do need to specify which is the bundle that we're working on around this singular point. So let's first consider the case of people. I'm confused. The proposition, this is not to have instant option. I mean, it's just what it is. It's just. And theta is what sort of object? It's a it's a it explains to me what what sort of object theta is and where does data live? What sort of object data is? Where does data live? Sorry, can you just? Data, what kind of object is data? Data is the collection, it's theta, or deteriorates the collection. So it's a one-form bundle, or it's, or it's, where is data? In terms of what you've written, like TI, tensor, eta I, where are the A? This is the TSR basis of the Niali reflector. There's one more question from the chat. Which is that Derek Harland in the chat asks: should the proposition say instantaneous? Asks, should the proposition say instanton rather than connection? Yes. That's fine. Yeah, these are the equations that make it to be a teacher. Little SE2 valued, where? So these are the SE2 values. This is the basis of the one space, and this is just the small functions. So these are one frames on SU2. Hopefully you'll rest on the S2. So we're not really working on the bundle, we're pulling back to SU2. So those things are defined on the whole manifold. Oh, e to i plus e to i minus. That's very different as you choose in the picture. As you there's the Lie, the Ts and the Lie algebra of the gauge group, and then the eta i is eta i is the Lie group. The extension on pupa. So, coming from less simple one expected, and there would be. There would be a condition for the extension of our functions x and y up to the singular orbit of the bundle P1. We can introduce this in the conditions of this theorem by Melgrange or Foscolar-Huskins to see when we have existence and also uniqueness of solutions around a singular point. But as this is an existence and unique inversion, the uniqueness is key because we can observe that if we take y equal to zero, then Equal to zero, then we can find a solution for the equation for x. This being some function f. So f being this. And because of this, have an explicit solution, we would get the following connection. So we can be e to the what? E to the integral from some parameter one and a half to t and this is the function f and then in the denominator we have the same, but also an extra integer. Also, our next idea So we found that these are solutions of this proposition. And as we have an explicit expression, we can check that this is well defined over the whole multiple R context free. So in this case we are able to check. The three. So in this case, we are able to find that extension outside of this neighborhood of the singular orbit when x1 is positive. So we can write down a first theorem that says that on there is an explicit. And this is explicit because, as I mentioned, the B's and the A's are. As I mentioned, the B's and the A's are explicitly. And in particular, if we take x1 equals to 0, this is just a trivial flat instance. Our remark is that if we particularize this for the total free digital metrics, the Brian-Salamon one, which corresponds to taking Which corresponds to taking values of A1 equal to where T is where R is implicitly defined is maybe zero one. And then we get our cognitive digital structures will be the Bayonet Saliman deter structure and clock systems. Is that a classification? Is it a classification? What do you mean? Is it a classification? Yes, in this case, that's all of them. And the same as happens with the Clark C2 instantons, is that they would bubble off an anti-second connection over the singular orbit, which is an associated submanifold. So more technically, what this means is that if we have a parameter lambda, then we can construct a succession of deltas. which are positive and go to zero when x1 goes to infinity such that if for a point in the singular orbit s3 we define a rescaling on the unit bone in r4 two we ballov radius delta So we're standing with any light following. Then, if we take the pullback by this of our connections, then this converges uniformly to the basic anti-serve dual instantaneous. Anti-self-dual instanton with parameter lambda, which is the following thing. This is what we know as the bundled behavior. Let me try to draw a picture of the situation. So we have our manifold here, and then we have a singular orbit, which all of the singular orbits are isomorphic to S three. Or these are isomorphic to S3, and this is an associative. Then, if we pick a point and consider the tangent space to S3 and we pull back the instantons from the seven-dimensional manifold to the four-dimensional one and also do this rescaling, then when we take the limit from x1 goes to infinity, this will end up giving us the antiscala. Up giving us the anti-sellable instant. And this is the same that happens in the card, the AGA standards. What is the four-dimensional space? Like the conormal panel to expand. So this is what happens for R4 times a screen now on S4 times the screen. Things get more complicated because then we would need to check what happens around the P second singular orbit. On singular orbit. We can start by doing the same thing around the singular orbit at t equals zero, and for the bundle p1, you would also have the same explicit expression. We can also denote it the theta of x1. And then we can extend it to the principal part. However, when we are looking to see if this extends to the other singular orbit, we found out that there are some regularity issues. So what we get is that on the bundle Bundle E11, there is only one instant one, the trivial one, which corresponds to x1 equal to zero and on a bundle that is strictly. That is trivial around one singular orbit and the identity around the other. There is a one parameter of three histons theta x1, where now x1 goes from zero non-included to infinity. Man equal to infinity, which is smooth around the one singular orbit, but not exactly smooth about the other one. And at t equals one, this has C1 regularity. So, although we were not able to prove smoothness, then we have some certain regularity conditions, and in particular, the curve. Conditions and in particular, the curvature happens to be bounded so things do not get too crazy. And yes, we're able to look what's happening because we want this explicit expression, which is the same that we got in the other case. Now let's move on to the other situation where we have the identity bundle. So, first of all, if we start with the case of R4 times S3, then we can once again. Then we can once again use this theorem by Malgrange to find out one parameter function of the two estimates. of t equals zero. We can denote this by theta y0 and y zero is in R. And we notice that of this family there are two flat instantons which in this notation are theta of one. theta of 1 over minus 1 over v 0 and zeta 1 over v 0 and also a non-flat exclusive instance which corresponds to y0 equals 0 and is given by the following expression. This expression is very similar to the one that we had before because it's basically obtained with taking the parameter x one that you've been thinking. Parameter x1, what you've been thinking. However, to find out if we can extend the rest of the elements of this family outside of the neighborhood of the singular orbit, we cannot do as we did before, which was using the fact that we have an explicit expression to extend this. So we have to use other different kind of arguments. One thing that we can do for the case of R4 times the strip is use forward invariance of sets. And we do find that for some parameters of this fact, You find that for some parameters of this family, then we can extend the instantons. We have y0 and y0 only in the sub-interval, which is not all of the possibilities that we have in a neighborhood of the singular orbit. So, a first remark about this is that if we once again particularize for the case of the Bryan-Salamon metric, our instantone theta y0 is the one of the instantones found out by Los Dela and Oliveira. Olive, they denote indeed a limit, because it's the limit when taking x1 to infinity, and the instant terms theta of y0 with y0 in this integral. different from zero this corresponds to one parameter family of stain alternative another observation that I wanted to make is that before it was a classification result right It was a classification result. Right now, it is not, or at least not for the moment. This is still a work in progress. So, for the other parameters of y0 that are not in this interval, I still don't know if it is possible to extend this interface. This would be a question for the future. So this is the picture on R4 times S3, but then once again, things will get increasingly more complicated when we move on to S4 times S3. In this case, we do not even know how the instantons look like, so we do need to check. Look like. So, we do need to check the conditions around the singular orbit, but we do not know what our instantons are. So, this ended up to be the most difficult part of that problem. One thing that I was able to check was: even though we don't know the expression, I was able. Even though we don't know the expression, I was able to bound any other instaton where y0 is in this interval by using two of the known solutions. So I just erased it, but we know that there is this explicit instaton, zeta zero and only two flag ones. And we find that any other in this integral has to be bounded by these two. So one thing that I was able to show is that there is a continuous extension of these instantons up to the other singular orbit. This is with the bundle identity around choosing all orbits. I'm not writing this down, but this is obviously SHOQ invariant, I'm getting SC2 with 0 now in 0, which is not outside. The simular orbit at V1 and has a continuous extension. This is other thing where we are. This is other thing where there's still some questions that arise, which is we know that there is C0 regularity, but we don't know if there might be higher regularity, for example C one, or maybe if we can even find that under some circumstances the Earth are actually going to be smooth. But knowing that at least we can continue to extend them is a really good news. And let me finish with a picture of what are the families that we have constructed. So, first of all, we have this extra. So first of all we have this explicit one parameter family theta of x1 that when x1 goes to zero this is the trivial one and then if we take the limit x1 goes to infinity then this is theta of zero and this is a member of the other one parameter family theta of y zero that finishes in these two flat epsilon tons one over V zero and minus one over V zero. And minus one over BC2. And there is actually a correspondence between these two sides of the picture, just by swapping the two numbers of AC2 squared. And on R4 times S3, these are over the bundle P1 and this jumps to the bundle PID. While for S4 and S3, this one is in the This one is in the under P11. These are in P1ID and this one is so these are the examples of the two instant tons in these two manifolds. Further questions? So if I remember correctly, you said that in the compact case, if it's cold closed, then the symptoms are absolute minimizers of the angle of energy. This is when the manifold is a teacher. Can you actually calculate the angle of energy for these examples? The animal energy for these examples here? Can you explicitly come? I haven't tried. Because it could be the case. It's just not automatic. So if the G2 structure is not closed, instantons could still be getting milled. Or they're getting milled, but they may have been minimized. Yeah, even. Even more, they need not be minimized if there are counter examples. Precisely. Precisely. So it is an interesting question. But the answer is not automatically either yes or no. It needs to be shared. So it would be great. The thing is that, so especially in the identity bundle, the things are non-explicit, so it's very complicated to actually compute things or know what's happening. In this other case, where the things in the trivial bundle, when we have explicit expressions, then we can do computations, like, for example, the curvature. But in this part of the picture, right now, In this part of the picture, right now, I find it very difficult to compute things like, for example, we can go scratch. You could formally check if you're in some tongue nodes at least. Or the other here and not. No, not necessary. Not necessary. Jason's saying no. Well, I think not necessarily. Not necessarily. Are there more questions? Yeah, good questions. Yeah, questions. Sorry? Ah, so this is still not an archive. Hopefully it will be shown. Will be soon. But well, the theorem that I mentioned before about the existence of cognitive structure structure is already on archive. If you look for my name, then you will find it. This next part is not yet. If you are interested, I can send you an email when it's ready. We'll be happy to get that. Yeah, sorry, these were the questions. Oh, yeah. A question online from Derek Farland. He asks: Could these methods also be applied? Could these methods also be applied to the round seventh sphere? I think so. Did you try to check whether this sort of G2 system recovers? I haven't yet, but it's on the list of things that we're doing. Okay, that was quick. Another question? Yeah, yeah. Well, I was just wondering, maybe this is all unrelated, but like. Maybe this is a little unrelated, but like what people use these half-flat SC3 structures for, or why they're important. I mean, in this case, they were key because they were able to using them, we were able to write down everything in terms of these smooth functions. But I don't know if in any other situation are important in other samples. If you have a an approximate manifold, uh you get the necessary structure that it's all plotted, that's fine. So it's always existing any other surface in the actual. Yeah. And there's this thing called the teaching flow. If you start from the half-factory structure, it's real analytic, then you're always thinking about meaning to it's available. I think that's what I'm studying. I don't know if I'm going to jump in. Alright, let's have the coffee break and thank you for selling.                                        Okay, so Okay, so let's continue with the final talk in this morning's session. Very pleased to have Buddha Fowler from Unicamp, who is going to tell us about the harmonic flow of SP2-SP1 structures on 8-vanes. Thanks, Jason, for the introduction. I'd like to thank the organizers for the invitation to do this talk in Panama. Okay, can everyone hear me at the back? Am I loud enough? At the back, am I loud enough? Cool. Okay. All right. So, I want to talk about the harmonic flow of SP2SP1 structures on eight manifolds. So, I mean, this is the conference about sort of G2 and SPIN 7, so you might be wondering why is there SP2 SP1 here and not G2 and SPIN 7? So, I'll try to make the case that if you do replace it by one of these groups, the same thing is more or less gonna hold. And I'll explain what the words in the title mean as I go on. But for the time being, let me tell you sort of what is this talk really about. So, oh, the thing is a bit off. There we go. So, first thing, what should you think of when you see the word SP2S1 structure? So, you should think of a cousin of spin set and structure. So, well, you know, like a spin set and structure in 8-manifold is. A spin-seven structure in 8-manifold is given by the data of a four-form, matchmaker special four form, that will in turn give you a metric and an orientation. So you should think of a spin, a speaker SQL structure as making something very similar. And the second sort of keyword keeps getting off, I don't know why. This is preview. That should work. You're hired. You're all fired. Thanks, Piero. So, the second sort of keyword in the title is harmonic. So, we've heard all sorts of notions of harmony, but in this talk, what are harmonic? But in this talk, what a harmonic structure is, is something very similar, very sort of closely related to the notion of harmonic maps. So, classically, what is a harmonic map? A harmonic map is a sort of map between two Riemannian manifolds, and it is called harmonic if it is a critical point of some energy-type functional. So, in this talk, these harmonic SP2S1 structures are going to be likewise some critical points of some energy-type functional. So, this is what this talk is about. And there's a word float. And there's a word flow in the title of this flow, and so it is the title of this talk. So I'm going to be giving you a way of how to flow these structures to find harmonic ones. I'm going to be more precise later on. But the plan for this talk is first to give you some background on general what does it mean to be a harmonic H structure. And then I'll discuss the case when H is SP2 SP1 in more detail. I'll discuss some results about the flow. And at the end, I'm going to discuss some very sort of To discuss some very sort of concrete examples to sort of make you kind of see that it's not just an abstract computation, like no, you can actually use it to compute stuff. Okay, so where does SP2SP1 come from? Well, it comes from Vegas' classification of Holomic Row. So you guys are probably all familiar with Vegas classification. So you have KLA manifold, Clavia, HyperKaler, Quaternary Keller, G20 Spin 7. This is sort of our favorite ones. So the SP2 SP1 bit really comes from this Quaternic Keller case. SP1 bit really comes from this quaternicular case here, which occurs in every sort of damage and multiple of four, where, well, we start from eight. Let's not look at the case n is equal to one. And so what is the relation between sort of G2 and spin 7? Well, G2 and spin 7 manifolds are sort of Riemannian manifolds where your tangent space is modeled to look like the Octonians. So in the G2 case, it's the imaginary octonions, whereas in the spin 7 case, the full octonions. By contrast, By contrast, Coton kilometers are model on the Cotonian system. This guy is done. Cool. So, what you need to know is that aside from the first case, with manifold scalar, all the manifolds arising in this list are in fact anti-manifold, so which is proportional to the metric. And all of them are rich, but aside from the cotton killer case, the cotton killer one is a bit odd in this list in the sense that there could be positive scalar curvature or negative one. Negative one. And in the problem, sort of the classical problem in sort of special homomy is sort of to find manifolds with homomic group contained in one of these lists. This is what the business is about. And the problem is that it is generally very hard to find Gopher. Can you go for I think of this SP2, SP1 case as being like choosing a reduction from like a reduction in structure where I choose a way to take O and write it as H2, instead of like H2, like that. Like, is there any way to upgoing from O to H2? Spin 7 to SP2. Maybe I say something a bit later about that? Okay? I mean, the different sort of algebra, but maybe I'll say something more. Okay, cool. Okay, so in all of this setup, you would like to find a currently constant tensor, usually a differential form. But the problem is that it's an over-determined system, it's very hard, and you even have sort of topological structure, but it's. And you even have sort of topological obstruction. For instance, if you don't have some vanishing co-modules class, you know that you might cannot admit a torsion-free guy. So, this eventually sort of leads you to look for weaker notions. For instance, in the GT case, you look for close, co-close, you might sort of constrain the entrance torsion in various ways. And in this talk, it is one of these sort of weaker notions. And the notion I'm going to be interested in is that of harmonic edge structures. Sometimes these are also called isometric guys. So, what is it? What is the harmonic edge structure? So, here's a setup. Harmonic structure. So here's a setup. Go for it. The harmonic structures are the best among a certain isometric class. They're not isometric. It's a claim by any case that no. They're a way to choose someone within an isometric class. But I'm not going to say harmonic and isometric. Yeah, he's objecting to your last sentence on the previous slide that you're saying there are also coloursymetric structures. Well, I mean, you say isometric. Well, I mean, you said isometric, you said harmonic, so you guys sort of. No, no, both of you guys had papers with one with title isometric flows, one with harmonic flows. So it's not up to me. I just want to say that if you look for papers and you see harmonic structures or isometric structures, they're both the same. No, they're not. No, harmonic is a special case of isometric. It's just the best one. Oh, okay. If you go back one slide, just real quick. The very last thing you said, the AKA, should probably not be there. Or if it is, it should say the best among isometric structures. Okay, okay, fair enough. Okay. Okay, fair enough. It's fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. Yeah, no, no, it's not isometric structure. Yeah, I get your point. Yeah. So, sure. Asometric structures, probably. Okay, yeah, it's fine. Anyway, so what's our setup? So the setup is as follows. Suppose I give you a remote. Suppose I give you a reminder in my fall, ng. The metric is going to be fixed. And let's suppose that your mindfall admits an H structure which is compatible with the metric. So that means, so concretely speaking, suppose you had a metric on a sort of seven manifold and you had a G2 structure that induced that metric. You could find sort of, this is the sort of statement I'm saying. Now, let's suppose you had one of these guys, you had one sort of tensor psi, which is compatible with your metrics. Tensor Psi, which is compatible with your metric, there's a sort of gauge group acting on that guy which gives you different tensor psi, which is which again induces the same metric. So, a very sort of simple and concrete example to keep in mind is, suppose I give you a manifold with an almost Hermitian structure. So you have a UN structure, you have a metric, you have an almost complex structure. And let's suppose that this guy has machine-first-germ clause. Okay, and you say, well, can I find an n-zero form that is compatible with this data? Well, you can pick one, but the problem is that you can pick other ones. Is that you can pick other ones? You can multiply by e to the iF for any function f, you're going to get a different n-zero form, which is also compatible with your metric. So you have different sort of S-UN structures, which is compatible with the same sort of UN structure. Now, the problem is, well, how do you pick the best guide? So a natural answer to that question is, well, let's try to minimize this functional here. So you take the covariant derivative of your tensor, take its L. Derivative of your tensor, take its L2 norms, the energy functional, and you say, Well, let's try to minimize this guy, and the guy that minimizes the size that minimizes this energy functional should be the best representative. This is the goal. Yes, yeah. Everything's sort of compatible. That's right. And one sort of remark here is: if instead of psi of being a denser, it was a map between Riemann and manifold, this would be precisely the energy function. This will be precisely the energy functional that you use to define harmony maps. So, by analogy to this, you call a critical point of this functional here a harmonic H structure. This is where the name harmony comes from. It comes from the algebra of the theory of harmonic maps. And indeed, a lot of the theorems I'm going to tell you come from sort of analogues of harmonic maps being translated to these harmonic H structures. But I should be aware of you that harmonic doesn't mean that the tensor here is harmonic. It's a sort of very different sort of notion of. It's a sort of very different sort of notion of harmonicity. What is harmonic tensor in the Raspberry Plus here? No, I guess if it was a differential form, then you have an obvious notion, but yeah, that's what I want. Because I mean, in all the cases, you have a differential form. So I want to emphasize that it does not mean that the differential form is harmonic. It's a very different form. You are fixing the SON structure. I am fixing the SON structure. Yeah, that's right. Another thing you could do is let the xi determine the SON structure. Sure, that's what Byte would be cool. Byte and bit do that, right? I mean, they do exactly this would be yeah, but then the problem is that working out the critical point of the function would be a night would be much worse because the metric will also have to vary. But I mean, we're gonna hear probably talks about that later on. So tomorrow, there you go. Okay, so so the natural question is sort of what is the critical point of this functional here? Point of this functional here. Well, aside from the trivial one, of course, there's always currently constant guys. So, to tell you what these are, let me remind you of the notion of an intrinsic torsion. Whenever you have an H structure, where H is a subgroup of SON, and you take covariant derivative of your tensor psi, which is customized as prestiges is H, then its covariant derives you a one-form that values in H perp, where H perp here is a complement of the holnomy algebra argued at the same time. Of the holomory algebra are viewed as a sort of sub-algebra inside SOI. And this guy here, this two-form valued one-form, is known as the intrinsic torsion. So this is always the case. And what Eric Lubo and Enrique Sai proved was that this tensor psi from before defines a harmonic A structure precisely when this intrinsic torsion T here is divergent tree. Okay, so the d of t here is zero. And so this is the zero. And so this is the number of PDs depends on the dimension of H per P here. Okay, so the weaker notions are coherently constant. Now, the problem with this definition here is that it's an implicitly defined guard because intrinsic notions are one form the values in the space of two forms. And I haven't told you how to compute that. So how does one compute T in practice if you want to work out something? Well, the way you do it is you think of the intrinsic torsion as a one hole that values in The one form that values in the space of endomorphism. I mean, it's a one-form that values in the space of H per, which is a two-form. So this is a Q-symmetric endomorphism. And you can act by this diamond operator here, which is just the standard slot GLN action. And this is precisely what nabla psi here is. And to get the intrinsic function, you just have to invert this operator here. And then you get T, and then from this, you can compute what D of T here is. This is how the recipe goes. But the problem is that this inversion operator does depend on the H structure. Does depend on the H structure. So, in principle, there's not like a general way of just defining this diamond inverse sort of operator. So, you have to work it out for different H structure. Okay, so far so good. So, let me sort of give you sort of a more sort of concrete definition. I mean, like, when, for instance, I say I give you a closed due to structure of co-close one, you know, precisely what that means in terms of intrinsic torsion. But if I say div t0, I mean, what in God's name does that mean concretely? So, let me sort of motivate that. So let me sort of motivate that. That's fine. Let's go. That's fine. Okay. So let me sort of motivate what this means in a very sort of elementary case, the simplest case. Consider harmonic SU2 structures. Very simple. This is simplest non-trivial special harmony. So in this case, what is an SU2 structure? It's a triple of almost complex structures that behave like, say, maternity Paternians, or advice you have this triple of two forms. Don't know. And if you work out what the covariant derivative of this guy is, well, it has to be one from the values in hperp. And in this case, the h perp is just omega 2 and omega 3 for omega 1. And then you get sciatic permutation of these indices. And if you do the recipe that I told you before, you find out that the intrinsic torsion, well, it's a one-form the balance, the orphanal complement of the Liadra, but the orphanal complement of the Liadra is, well, it happens to be another Liadra. Is, well, it happens to be another Liadra, which is the SO3 Liadra, which is a speech of cell draw two form, which is precisely my guide of free. So, what does D mean? Well, D F T means that each of these one forms are co-close. So, you can just work that out. But if you just stare at what I've written down for you, you're going to realize that what is T? Well, T is just the induced Levischeck connection and the space of cells or two form. Because this is precisely how you define that guy. You define that guide. So, the condition that d here is zero is simply the statement that the induced left-shift connection on the space of self-joul-2 form is in fact incoulom gauge with respect to the trivialization given by omega-1 omega-Omega-3. So it is saying, let's pick the best trivialization of that space so that your connection is in full engage. So, that's a statement. This is what Sergei has been telling us. Exactly, exactly. Exactly. So he was talking about this higher-dimensional question. So here's a non-trivial example of a harmonic SV2 structure, which is not torsion-free. So you could pick, you could figure out the half-surface, it's S3 cross S1. You can pick the standard sort of left-in variant structure on this guy, which was the hyper-complex one. And you can check that indeed it will satisfy this condition that dvd here is zero. But it is obviously, it's not hypercaler, right? All the hypercalero compact guys are factorous or K-free. Flat Dora Saul, Gayfree, who knows that? Daniel Saw. Go for it. If you take D of omega high, is it just AI wedge omega high? Is it these the leaf forms of these selective forms? If you take D of this guy. D of one of the omegas. Yes. Like D of omega 1, is it just A1 wedge omega 1? No, it's going to be. It's going to be... Oh, you can just change the tensor products by wedge. Yeah, in this case, yeah, you just replace the tensor by a wedge, and that's how you get it. That's how you get it. It's not the same thing. It's not the same thing. Okay. Yeah. Another question. Go for it. So, in terms of where you have a classification in this dimension, this is what I wanted corresponds to the stars? This guy here? No, no, this is an example. Yeah, second order definition, not a third order. It's not a special. It's not a special torsion. I'm not restricting the torsion to like in a special sort of space. It's not like that. It's a very sort of trap. I'm just sort of minimizing. It's a very sort of trap. I'm just sort of minimizing the energy of the intrinsic torsion. Yeah, so it's not necessarily killing part of the intrinsic torsion in principle. Yeah. What is this harmonic basic structure on the intricate response? On this guy? Yeah. It's just a hyper complex one, the standard left invariant guy. Okay, cool. And of course, Sergei has been telling us about the sort of thing that the same thing should. That the same thing should be true in the G2 case. You can think of the intrinsic torsion. Well, it's a one form that values, well, not in the algebra, but in this loop, whatever that is. But the moral of the story somehow is that whenever you should pick up harmonic structure, you should pick up something happening in column gate. It's sometimes in the best representative. That's sort of the moral of the story, concretely, what you should pick up. Okay, so we are interested today in SP2SP1 structure. Today, in SP2 SP1 structure, so let me define that because I mean people here are probably familiar with V2S concern, but not this guy. So, a convenient way to do that is to start with an SP2 structure. So, an SP2 structure is just like an SP1 structure, but in four dimensions higher up. So, you have a metric, and you have your, again, a triple of almost complex structure, T1, T2, T3, which satisfies an imaginary quaternions multiplication rule. And okay, some heat manifold now. And one very convenient way of defining. And one very convenient way of defining the spin 7 structure group is to define a four form, which is defined by the sum of the square of two of this guy, but you take minus of one of the other guy. And the stablizer of this four form is precisely spin seven. Okay, so it's a very convenient way of seeing how to kill a minus special case of spin seven. And to get to the sp2 case, sp2s one case, what you do is instead of putting a minus here, you put a plus here. You just take the average. Here. It just takes the average. Oh, there should be a bracket. It's the average of this guy here. So, in this way, you could see, like, I mean, advertly speaking, they might look very similar, but this guy here gives you octonions, this guy here will give you sort of quaternions. So, maybe that answers your sort of philosophy. You can explain something that almost confuses me. So, J's only exist locally. Yes. Omega exists everywhere. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. So why are they big omega? Yeah, big umbrella is the same. Little embers do not. Yep, that's right. Why is that? Yeah, why is that? Oh, why is that? Why do they not even use this globally? Why is this thing this globally? Because if you change frames, it's independent of. Yeah, it's kind of saying you have a bundle. The trivialization of the bundles, the bundle is not trivial, basically. So this guy is precisely saying that, you know, untravel stuff. But I mean, there is actually concrete. I mean, there's actually a concrete way of defining this J1, J2, J3 using, oh my gosh. So somehow the moral is okay. But we use these guys wrong, and this doesn't change this guy, that's why. Yeah, but I don't have better reasons for that. Okay. So, sort of some basic fact about SPGS1 structure. So, if a manifold admits an SPGS1 structure, then it also always They also always admit a spin center structure. Not necessarily related to that guy, but topologically satisfies the same condition. It satisfies the condition to admit a spin center structure. But the converse is not in general true. So, you know, like being S having an SP2SPA structure is something more restrictive. And also, another contrast with the spin 7 case is that in the spin 7 case, asking that your foreform is covariantly constant is equivalent to asking that it's closed. But this is not true in the particular case. Asking that this curve here is currently constant means. That this guy here is correctly constant means that your form has to be closed, and also that the R direct ideal, this ideal differential determined by omega 1, omega 2, omega 3, has to be a differential ideal. So if you take d of omega 1, this has to be combinations of omega 2, omega 1, omega 1, omega 3, again. Okay? So it's a different condition. And it's a non-trivial condition. There are examples where this indeed doesn't hold. You have closed guys, but the advocate ideal, not the differential ideal. This is a theorem by Swan. This is a theorem by Swan, isn't it? That's right, yeah. That's Swan's PSG thesis. But just just to be clear, S V two, S P one, and Spin Set, neither of those are subgroups of each other. No. So I'm confused by this fact then because how do you see from what kind of stuff should be obvious? Are you saying that if there's an SP2 SP1 structure topologically, you've satisfied the criteria needed to admit spin-up? So you would automatically It's not just staring at this formula and saying, well, you have locally these omegas and you just change the sign, because then it would be very. No, no, no, no, no, it's not, no, it's not, it's not obvious at all. Yeah, yeah, sorry. Yeah, this is not a natural sort of candidate to be, yeah, sorry. And since we've been hearing a bit about spinners, so I should tell you, for instance, in the quote-unquote case, the cell draw part of this sort of spinner bundle, the positive spinner bundle splits as a three-dimensional component and a five-dimensional component, whereas the negative bit can just be identified. Whereas the negative bit can just be identified with the tangent bundle or the manfold, which is sort of again different from the spin side case. Okay, so just to sort of highlight that they're very different, but even though we're going to see that the harmonic theory is just going to be very, very similar. Any questions, comments? R5 and R3 are. I'm going to say what this is in a minute, maybe more precisely. It's a lot of decomposition, so it's not an irreducible bundle. The bundle splits, that's what I want to say. Okay, so let's do. Okay, so let's do some simple representation theory. So in the spin 7 case, you know that spin 7 is a subgroup of SO8, so the Lyad draw splits, so you have the space of subdraw two forms, the space of two forms, sorry, splits as a spin 7 bit and it's four formal complement. And the spin 7 4 forms sits inside the space of 4 forms. And you see that H perp here again sits inside lambda 4 as well. And again, the And again, the same thing is true in the sp2 sp1 case. Again, this guy here is a subgroup of SO8. So, again, you see the holomi alpha sitting in here, and the off-known component is over there. And again, you see this guy embeds inside the space of lambda 4, where the tensor capital omega here lives. This minus here is, and earlier I said, just a sort of comment, this lambda 4 5, 1. 5 minus the sort of subscript is the dimension of the space. The minus here is just to say it's anti subdual guy. And this is precisely in the spinner representation. This is exactly this five-dimensional block here. And the R3 here can just be identified with this guy. Okay, so there's natural sort of isomorphism you can compute. I mean, so you can identify spinners, the point because you can identify spinners using sort of differential forms very concretely. Okay. Okay, so the key point of this is that HBURB is always irreducible. This is what you need to make the theory work. And secondly, this also holds true in the GPN and UN case. And HBURB can always be embedded in the space wherever a tensor lives. This is the sort of key criterion you need to make the theory work. Okay? H work is always lambda 215 here. Yes, lambda 215 here. Sorry. Just maybe say if it's not irreducible, one has to work harder. Yes. If H is not irreducible, yeah, it's not the other one. For instance, if you think of something like an sp2 structure, then H perfect will split. Because you have omega 1 and gator omega 3, and then you're going to have more components as well splitting. So then you have to be more careful with the representations. But in this case, it's going to be fine. Okay, so here's a recipe for Okay, so here's a recipe for cooking up the intrinsic torsion in our case. So, well, I told you earlier how to get the intrinsic torsion. You have to inverse the style operator, and this is where the inverse is in this case. In this case, you take the covariant derivative of your four-form, so you get a one-form that values against the space of four-form, and then you convert three of the entries into vector fill, and then you shove that back inside the four-form. So this gives you one form that values in each birth, which is this fifteen-dimensional space. 15-dimensional space. And surprisingly enough, the same formula works for the spin-7 case. So, you know, the exact same formula works, but should be aware that this is also very different equation. One is like seven PBs, and this is also one sect. Can you explain again what you think you can try to do? Yeah, so you take NABL omega, you get one form, the value of the space of four forms, and take three of these forms, you convert them to vector forms, and then you shove that back. And then you shop that back in there. So you get a one-form, the values in sort of two forms now. This is one form, the value in space of two forms. And well, I mean, it's not obvious that it has to appear, but it does, because it's the same triangle. Cool. Okay, so what's good now is now we have an expression for t, so you can compute what div t is. But the problem is that, well, how in calcium do you actually find? How in Gaussian do you actually find a foreform whose dft is actually zero? Well, the proposal is to mimic what happens in the case of harmonic flow of maps and you introduce this heat type equation to find a harmonic guide. So you decide to evolve your full form by the div t itself. And the critical point is precisely going to be the harmonic guides. Okay, so I've written down a flow. Written down a flow. So far, so good. Cool. Well, not really, because, well, I've just written down a flow. I don't know if it has a solution. So, first thing I have to justify this. And this was justified by work of Eric and Enrique. So they prove that the harmonic flow of any structures in general, where H is some stable subgroup of SON, does have short-time existence and it is unique. And moreover, they show that if the flow cannot be has a maximal sort of time of existence, Has a maximal sort of time of existence and it cannot be extended beyond that, then it must be the case that the intrinsic torsion is blowing up at some point below the manifold here. Okay, this is the intrinsic torsion has to blow. Okay, and the problem of interest at this point is, I mean, we know that the flow exists now, and we want to understand what happens as time goes to the maximal time of existence. So we have this finite time singularity. So, how do we try to understand what is going on with the flow? So, to do that, So, to do that, we do a parabolic rescaling, which means you rescale the distance on your manifold by a factor C. So, in a four-form it scales by C4, and then you change time by a factor of C square here, and then you get a new solution to flow. So, the point being that if you start with one flow, you get a new flow, but now this guy here is defined over a different interval of time. What you can do, you can translate S, so you can short the. S, so you can shove this guy here with a minus, and then you can have a flow well defined up till time zero. And if you take C in this expression to be this guy here, the intrinsic torsion, the super of this guy, then you know that this guy is blowing up. So if you take the limit of this guy, then you should get a flow that is well-defined from minus infinity to d squared to zero. You should get an anti-em solution. Okay, and you would expect that this guy was solid. These are solutions which evolve by symmetries. Solutions which evolve by symmetries. I'm going to give a more precise definition later on. But the first problem here, only in the type 1 case, we'd expect them to be solitons. Yeah, expect it to be. I don't think it's always true. More philosophically. Yeah, it is for Richie. Yes, for each for a lot of good flows, it is, but I think you have to prove it each time. Yeah, that's why I say expected. Expected by comparison. Expected by comparison with Ozopless, yeah. Yeah, but it's not a theorem, it's not like not obvious reasons, yeah. Why is can in red and inverted commas? Well, because I haven't justified that we can take a limit. So we can't a priori we don't know that, right? So we need to sort of justify that. Okay, so first I need to justify why we can take a limit, and then I'll have to tell you what solid and solve. So let's do that. Solute and solve. So let's do that. So, first thing first, you do have a compactness theorem. To take a limit, you need the manifold, the sequence of solutions here to be in a compact space, meaning that if you have a sequence of solutions, which is well-defined over some interval of time, and you need some extra condition, so first you need bounds on the curvature and the intrinsic portion, and you need a lower bound on the interactivity radius. Then, if you have this condition, then you can actually take a limit of your guy. Let me sort of. Let me sort of say why you need one. So, the reason why you need a curvature bound is because you don't want in the limit your manifold to develop a singularity. So, you could get point like curvature could concentrate at points, and then you can, in the limit, you might get something which is not a manifold. And you need... I thought the metric was fixed. Are you varying the metric as well? I thought the metric was fixed. I think the Brunson curvature. I think the bounds and covert are you guys for free. Yeah, the boundary cover is for free. Yeah, and the activity radius. Yes, and you need the lower bound. Oh, yeah, I guess I guess the same thing true. Sorry, can you say the answer to that question again? The answer to what question? Why didn't you take the metric to be fixed? Why do you worry about curvature? He's okay with curvature. Yeah, but we're, yeah, I probably should not have said that. Probably the key for engineering dictionary. Yeah, sorry. Injury injectorship. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, maybe it's a maybe the way you state the statement like this is so that we can apply the more sort of general theorem. Because the reason the way you prove this theorem is really to just rely on Chigogramov compactness theorem for your manifolds. So this works in the setup where the metric is allowed to vary. I guess in this case, I don't have to do that because the metric is always fixed. But in principle, if the metric was allowed to vary, then you would need these conditions to make it work. Okay, and secondly, so I mean, so from G your grommo of compactness, you only get a Riu manifold in the sort of limit, but you can't justify explicitly that it had to be a cotenquiller. It had to have a cotton-killer structure. But the point is that there is an expression that gives you the metric out of the differential form. And almost the same expression works in the spin-7 case as well. So Spiro found this sort of expression here for the spin 7 case. But if you stare at what he does, it always works for any sort of. Does like no, it always works for any sort of like non-degenerate full form, and then you just kind of realize that. I wouldn't say I found it. I asked Robert how to do it, and he told me something which I didn't understand. And then guided by his guidance and my confusion, I stumbled onto it. But he surely has it in his file encounter. Fair enough. Okay, but no, surprisingly not, it's about not surprising here, I guess. Almost the same formula works once you address. Almost the same formula works once you adjust things the right way. So now we can take limits, so we're happy with that. And next thing is what solitons? So, what is a soliton for this flow? So, a harmonic soliton is given by the flowing data. You have your four-fold, you have X, the vector field, C is some constant, and you want this vector field to reskip to be homophetic vector field. And you need the divergence to satisfy this condition here. Divergence to satisfy this condition here. So, div D, we know what div d is. Contracting a vector field with the intrinsic torsion makes sense. This guy here is the d of the dual one form to the vector field, which is the two form, and then you just put that into the h bar. And then the same sort of expression works in other cases, like in the G2 case or in the spin-7 case. And if the constant is negative or zero or positive, then you call them shrinking, steady, or expanding solitons. Which is good. Which is kind of confusing because the metric doesn't change, but it's just because of analogy with V2 flow. Yeah, so just because of the sign of the constant, you just call it sort, and although it's not necessary, it's never changing. So the accuracy is always zero. No. No, no, because the vector field, the diffeomorphism part coming from X is going to scale and metric, but you also have the scaling, which cancels each. Have the scaling which cancel each other out. So, the definite solution of this form where this row here depends on the C. You have to be thinking, I guess, from the perspective of an observer that's moving along the QS. Okay. So, the flow will you can find you can cook up some scaling from this C and you can find some diffeomorphism for integrating this vector field here. And then so you get a Activating this vector field here. And then, so you get a symmetry solution. It's just called a solid constant. Okay, so one sort of simple observation, just from this definition or proposition, if you want, is that expanders and shrinkers necessarily have to be on a hidden space. Because if C here is non-zero, then the existence of such a vector field essentially just has to be the order vector field of some translation stuff. So it has to be on our 8 if you want to guide. C head in zero. Basically. Well, I mean, we. Well, it's because if you have C positive or negative, you're in Euclidean space, so C0 is the only interesting case. Yeah, but that doesn't mean that it's torsion tree. No, no, no, I wasn't saying that. I was just saying that you only want to take C equals zero, is what I was saying. I think what already says that if you're on eucliding argument, you can't, sorry, if you have an extender or shrinker, the manifold must be clicking your. Okay, you'll give you an example. I'm going to give you an example of a steady soliton later on, but I don't know about expanders and shrinkers. And when I say steady soliton, not trivial ones. So I don't want torsion-free guards. So I won't say that I can solve this guy on some examples, but not necessarily the torsion-free guys. But the C cursor is the only interesting case, I think. Okay, so you think that you're never going to be able to sign solutions? Never going to be able to cite it. Oh, okay. Well, thanks then, Naira. Okay. Okay, so a bit sort of more technical version now. So in order to prove, I mean, you have a flow, in order, if you want to get epsilon regularity, so if you want to get regularity of the flow based on sort of controlling certain quantities, you want to get a long-time existence of the flow. So maybe you. Time existence of the flow, so maybe you control certain quantities and you can justify that the flow will exist for a longer period of time. If you want to study singularity set of the flow, you need to control some maritime quantity along the flow. And the obvious guide to use is, well, you might just say, well, let's pick the energy because the energy is obviously decreasing. But however, you will need to do parabolic rescaling to get something meaningful out of it. And you can't use the energy because it is not invariant. So, in order to tackle So, in order to tackle this problem, you have to introduce a new functional and system sort of localized energy-type functional, where what you do is, instead of looking at the energy, you're shoving over here a solution to the backward heat equation, and then you scale this integral here by this time factor here. Okay? And if you do that, then you can, well, you can think of this as somehow telling you how much the energy is controlling as t goes to zero. Just controlling as t goes to zero around that point, p and t node. And if you do that, you hit it with a sort of standard theory, you can get this polling almost monotypistic formula. But it's almost monotone because while it's not quite going down, it's going down up to a factor and up to this star here. So it's not quite as good as you want it to be. However, if you are on flat space, then you know precisely what the backward heat equation is, what the solution of the heat kernel is, and it is this guy. The heat kernel is, and to this guy here. And in this case, you actually get it to be monitoring. You can actually kill off this whole guy here, and you can just set this guy here to be one. Now, while this formula here works and does give you certain regularity and long-time existence, you have to control some very strong quantity in order to get that. So that's the problem. And the same thing is true in the heat harmonic heat flow for mass. But the idea originated to challenge. Idea originally due to Chinese true base is to use the fact that you know explicitly what the Euclidean backwards heat kernel is, and you can use that in the and modify this functional in a right way to actually get an improved estimate. And this is somehow what was what is sort of different in what was previously known in the G2Spin7 case. So let me sort of emphasize how this is done. I mean, this was originally done by He and Li in the case of UNN structures, but if you stare at the proof for long enough, you're going to realize that the proof Enough, you're going to realize that the proof can be extended very easily if you just interpret things the right way. So, how do you do that? I mean, first of all, how do you prove this formula? Well, the way you prove this formula is well, you just take ddt of this guy here. Once you take ddt, well, once you hit this guy here with d dt, you can just replace it with Laplacian. Once you hit this guy here with ddt, well, you know precisely how this guy here is evolving, so you can hit everything here, then you integrate by code, because with La Barcian, and then you extract off the term that you that you need, and so you get the bound. And then you use a yellow key type. Then you use a Yemki-type equation kind of from the diffimorism variance. I'm going to come back to that later on. But somehow here, the point is that the best you can do if you do that is you can just get this constant C here. And the problem really is that you don't know at all what U is going to be on an objective manifold. It's an absence and sort of sort of an existence theorem, but you don't know what U is. But whereas you know what it is in the flat case. So what you do is you modify your do is you modify your your functional, your localized energy type functional by introducing it, by introducing in the standard heat kernel of flat space. And then you multiply by some test function, which is sort of locally supported in a little ball, and you can just scale your metric in such a way that your injectivity radius is one everywhere. You can just work on this sort of little touch. And so if you identify the point we have with the origin. And what you're doing. With the origin, and what you do is you're going to do the same thing, you just hit it by ddt, and then you see how this guy is evolving, and you get sort of some differential inequality, and then you integrate that to get your quantity. And this turns out to give you a better monotony formula in the sense that before you have this fixed constant here, now you have a better estimate of what's going on. I'm not gonna write down what the function f here is, but no, it's some sort of function that it's a bit like log type functional, but it but it gives you the better estimate that you need. Bet estimate that you need. But somehow, what is somehow the key point here in this proof? Well, the key point here in this proof is that when you work on this little ball, the metric in sort of geodesic normal coordinate is approximately the flat one up to some curvature term. And this curvature term is fixed because the metric is never changing. So the point being that the intrinsic torsion is varying, but the curvature is not. So you can sort of trade off in that way. And then you can just replace partial. And then you can just replace partial covariant derivative with partial derivative, and then you just do the integration by false in the obvious way. And this leads you to this improved estimate here. And one sort of key ingredient that makes this proof work is the so-called Yankee-type identity. Now I'm going to go into. Okay. So far, so good. This is a better model formula because it's exponential terms. Yeah, exactly. It's just enough to give you like sort of, if you control the energy, you'll be able to get long-time existence instead of this entropy time. Yeah, go for it. Can I just ask quickly, how about your regularity of this T norm squared? Why do you need these kernels? Is it to regularize it? Or how should I think of this kernel? What is it doing? What is a signal? It's concentrating at the The signal, it's concentrating at the point T. Sorry, it's red, it's smooth, but it's not too very bright, it's just to concentrate with it. Yeah, okay, it's just yeah, it's compared to the delta. Yeah, right. Okay, so the key point in this proof is like, you know, like the key thing that would change depending on your age structure is precisely the anti-tag identity. I'm gonna So, this the reason it's almost is because of Hamilton's estimate on this heat kernel. When you try to take the d by dt of u, there is a term and that's why you have to use this c1 and c2. But that term vanishes if you take it, the Euclidean heat curve. I don't understand why you are still getting some exponential term if you on the next slide. Yeah, well I get this guy here. No, the that will be there, but the That will be there, but because this G is the Euclidean heat current, right? Yeah, but the metric is not Euclidean. The metric is approximately Euclid. So in that Euclidean case, exactly. Cool. Okay. Any possible? Okay, cool. Okay, so what is this Bianca type identity? This Bianch type identity. Well, when you're doing this integration by both, at some point you have to take the inner product of the covariant derivative of t with t itself, and then you're going to have to sort of integrate by both. And in doing so, you're going to have to see how the covariant derivative commutes. So when you swap X and Y around, how the intrinsic torsion will vary under this guy here. Well, so the way I wanted to read this term here is to say that when you take current derivative of t and you sort of T, and you sort of skew symmetries this guy, you get some quadratic term involving the intrinsic torsion, and you get some curvature term. Point is that curvature term is not changing at all. Whereas this gadget could potentially be changing. Moreover, in this case, if you project in the h-per direction, this gadget goes away. But in the proof, you're going to see that at some point you have to kick in a product with key, which belongs precisely in the space. So you can kill off this garage straight away. And this same proof works precisely. How do you sort of How do you sort of prove this guy? Well, you use the fact that you know precisely what the intrinsic torsion is given by. So, you take nabla of this guy, you get nabla square here, which is some curvature terms, the curvature operate acting, and then you get some quadratic terms involving the intrinsic torsion here. If you screw symmetries, you get precisely the result. And for the last bit, to prove that, what you have to do is just realize that here is some quadratic pairing of the intrinsic portion, so it's belonging in H perp, in H per. In H perf and H perf. But if you look at the representation here of this guy, you see if there's any H perf component, there's no guys. This is how you extract this term here. And the same proof here works in the spin 7 case as well. But the advantage of doing it this way is that you don't have to chase indices whatsoever. In the G2 case, it's a bit more tricky because if you take R7 and the R7, you're going to get another R7 component. But in this case, you're just going to have to be a bit careful and you have to. To be a bit careful, and you're actually going to have to understand this operator here in the corresponding case. But it's point-wise, I mean, it's an ad-right computation. You can just do that on R7. Once it's fine, you're good to go. Okay, that's a point. Yep, I just said that, and I just said that as well. And it's called blank type analytic because Spiracle is that because it arises by different moves in very different. Because arrows by different moves are invariant of the interesting torsion. But I think you can actually show that it is a BIT identity for some other connection torsion, another connection. I see. So I accidentally gave it the right name. Oh, okay. So when you split the connection into the H-bit, that's the precise connection. I see. Thanks. And an immediate consequence of this is that. And an immediate consequence of this is that if t here is zero, you see that well, if t is zero, well everything vanishes and you have that the projection of the curvature in the 215 bit is zero. This implies the statement that the holomogises. Yeah, go for it. So could you say why did you just refer to the market? Because in the GH case, if this guy here would be L7, if you take L7 tensor R7, you're going to get another R7 component sitting in there. So it's not obviously clear that once you project, you're not going to get any other. You project, you're not going to get any other contribution from this quadratic term here. So you have to work a bit harder to see that the operation indeed is going to give up that term. That's what. So, just another quick question. So, that quadratic term can be rewrite it in terms of T? This guy here? Well, yeah, this is morally T, this is morally T, but I mean, having an index, because like T was this guy, right? He was Nabla. Oh my god. Oh my god. So tomorrow it's hidden sort of decontracted with D in a very strange way. Yeah. To be clear, tomorrow I'll share in the general yeah. So yes. So it's just sort of like Sneeta doesn't have index. It's my assumption. Okay. Yeah, so this is just a measure of the failure of the reduction of the harmony group and this is this also works for the other cases as well. And you need precisely this argument here inside the integration bypass. Here inside the integration bypass that you do in the previous statement, in the previous VR. So, I'm not going to discuss the epsilon regularity, no long-time existence, because Enrique is going to talk about that tomorrow. But this relies crucially on the fact that you can get this improved estimate on this new function here. But in essence, the point would be that if you have small enough energy, you can get long-term existence, and it's going to be smooth, and it's going to converge to d. Smooth and it's going to converge to a 50. I mean, you're going to get a precise statement about that to more wrong. Okay, but let's move on to something a bit more concrete. Note that if you're on a homogeneous space and you are working with something which is completely invariant, you don't need all these guys because the point being that the energy is going to go down. If the energy is going down, you know precisely that you know that globally the integral is going down, but because if it's The integral is going down, but because if it's invariant, then that means that every single point has to go down as well. Because at one point, it's going to determine the intrinsic torsion everywhere, basically. So, in this case, on a homogeneous space, you always have long-term existence in the back. And we're going to see an example of that later on. Just one comment is that in this case, if you do have a finite time singularity, then you can only show using this method of this paper: is that the singular set has. The singular set has half door dimension six, so you only get sort of two dimensions down, you can't get more than that. And that's because we don't have a better theory than the original theory due to Grayson and Hamilton. Because in principle, what you would expect is if you're working in some sort of special holomic case, you would expect that the single set would be some sort of somehow related to the special geometry that you're working with. So in your work in a geek case, you might expect asterisk gravity. In this case, you might expect it to be some sort of calibrated gap. It to be some sort of calibrated guy, which is maybe S4 or something like that, but we don't have that just from this theory. In this case, it's probably just this guy or 8. Probably should be very, very deep. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. In Kotenkeler case, calibrated surmountfuls are much, much more restrictive than the Sinza Spin Seven case. Yeah. So, give us a basic example of how make structure, which is not true. Example of harmonic structure, which is not trivial. If you have a Riemannian manifold which is locally conformally parallel, then it is automatically harmonic. This was known in some cases, but this is quite okay. So how does the proof work? Roughly speaking, if you know that it's conformally parallel, what does that mean? That means there exists some function where you multiply by this function. This guy here is going to be currently constant. F here is some locally defined function. Some locally defined function. But then the projection map into hf, this is conformally invariant operator. And the point is that once you do that, the new left shifter connection that you get from the torsion free guy is going to commute with this guy here. Because this guy here presents home, this is a special homic type. So it's going to commute with this guy, whereas the original connection would not. Using this sort of comparison, you can actually extract off the diagonal div d. This is sort of a bit tricky computation to do if you just did. Tricky computation to do if you just did it with the original connection. That's why you need to conformally parallel here. A similar proof was done by Sergei in the G2Ks. This proof also applies to the spin turn case. In fact, for any intensor you want, the same exact proof works. It doesn't depend on anything. So there are lots of examples. In a way, I'm sort of justifying why harmonic is good, because if you're conformally parallel, your homework is true. Okay, so let me now give you an explicit solution to the flow. Explicit solutions to the flow. So I'm going to start with the hyperbolic covenant plane. So this is topology to just R8. You can think of it as a solvable Lie group. And here is your structure equation. Okay, so this is a solvable Lie group. This space here is an Einstein manifold, has negative scalar curvature. This is in fact a non-compact dual of HP2. So it has full holomy, so it's portion-free guy. Holomy Sp guy follow me sp2 sp1 you can define an sp2 structure using this formula here and you you can define the quote killer four form precise by this expression here antiscover constant because has special harmony okay so it is trivially harmonic so what you can do in this very sort of elementary case is well the nilma is a sort of sort of leg group right so what you can do you can just take two of the coframes and just rotate them around minus one factor okay S one factor. Okay. You sit down now, you start computing. This guy is not going to be total-free in general. So you sit down, you start computing, and you get that d is given by this expression here, which in here are constants. A and b or any functions. Any functions, yeah, as valuing S1. And here you see there's only one guy, which is comic in this case. Okay, so supposed to be so expected. And you can work out what the flow equation here is explicitly. It turns out to be the flow D here, and you can sit. To be the floor D here, and you can sit down and you can solve it, and you see that indeed the flow converges to the guys that you knew because there was one torsion-free guy, so it indeed converges in infinite time, so you get convergence in infinite time. In fact, the solution is in fact eternal, so it's well-defined for all backwards time as well. Well, this was naturally to be expected because there was a torsion free guard to begin with. And also, you should note that the energy is always infinite in this case because the manifold is not compact, okay? The manifold is not compact, okay? But the flow still does what it's meant to do. It still finds a torsion free guy. Although the volume is also not sort of the gradient flow in a way. I don't know. Would it be? I'm not sure. But it is a compact quotient. Yeah, could do. I don't know. I guess not because it could prove their project. Not because it will disprove the conjecture of Watson that the compact no no sorry. Can you pop up one moment to the how do you say that? No, because all I did, I rotated, but I mean, yeah, like a lot of whether you were precipitating a maximum noise. Exactly, that's precisely. Exactly, that's precisely. I'm very restrictive in what I can do because I can't make very general ansats because my ansat always has to preserve symmetry, which is why I get like this weird type of answers where you know I can only, I mean, you could pick more general guy, like maybe you rotate F3 in SO3, something like that, and I think it will still work, but it's just not your computation. Okay, nearly done. Okay, so let me give you. So, let me give you a non-conformally parallel example now. Start with SQ3. This is Moraclotten form. Note that the fourth commodity group of that guy is zero, so it cannot admit a torsion free guy. In fact, I should have said that any compact, all cotton Keller manifolds in dimension A are either the cotenic plane H P two G two of S O four or the Graph Manian of uh two planes in C four. Two planes in C4. There's only three examples in the compact setup. So this clearly could not have been a contact. They're the only ones that can exist. Yeah. Positive case, yeah. Negative case is y. Okay, so you can define a metric using this guy. Define the obvious metric. This is not the binary one. The biojet one is something else. Just sort of a comment. You can again make. You can again make a similar answer as before, and you can in fact check that this guy here is hyper-complex. The ashruated, almost complex structure is in fact interval. The same was true for the example that I gave you earlier in the SU2 case. And you can check that this guy here, the fourth one that I define, indeed satisfies it is indeed a harmonic guy. And there was no chance of getting a covariantly constant guy, but still there's harmonic in this case as well. Indeed, it's not close. As well. Indeed, it's not closed. You can play similar trick as before, and then you can run down the flow, and then you're going to see that people again converge to this card, like just like in the other case when I rotated the card, rotated to framing. But the natural sort of question in this case is that, can you prove that this guy here is a global minimum? Is this the best harmonic structure that you can get in this guy for this guy here? In general, I don't know if there's a second variation formula. If you could check whether this guy is. Formula: If you could check whether this guy is stable or unstable under the flow, something like that, I don't know that as well. Just some open question, like maybe it's applicable to the different other cases as well. Here's a non-trivial example of a steady slotton. Take the flat guys on all eight, make the following answer. Take two of these one forms, multiply them by some cos and some sign, metrics again on chain. Again, I have to do cos and sine because I can't fiddle around with the metric. Fiddle around with the metric, work out what the intrinsic portion is, while everything else will vanish except for this guy here. And then you can see that dF T here is precisely the portion contracted with this vector field here. This is precisely the soliton, the steady soliton. So in fact, the gradient soliton here. This is lambda of x1. And in fact, you can do the same computation in the spin-semin case, and you can also get a steady salt in the spin-seven case as well. So they are non-trivial solutions, and you can actually use them to do. And you can actually use them to do computation in general. Okay, I think that's all I wanted to say.
