Okay, so our last speaker for today is Tim Sentens, who is going to talk about Manning's conjecture for integral points on Tauric varieties. So hi, everyone. Yeah, I will talk about Manin's conjecture for integral points on Tauric varieties. So I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to speak. Yeah, let's start the talk. Yeah, let's start the talk. So the story sort of starts with the following results due to Batirev and Chinko. So they wrote two papers on this, one in 1996, one in 98. 198, which is the following: Let X be a smooth projective term writing over number. Uh number fields F let H be an on the clinical height function. What they show is then there exists some positive constant and actually very expressed about what this constant is such that if you look at the number of rational points on On the torus, so yeah T is a torus of height less than P, then as T goes to infinity, this is asymptotic to C times T times. times logarithm of t to the rank of the Picard group of x minus one okay right yeah um yeah so it was a very influential paper uh in the money management literature because yeah Yeah, so Manning Collection predicts that exactly this statement is true, where you only count points in T because maybe the points on the boundary they could be too many of them. So you move them, but the K-Manic setup is normal. You move some closer variety of bad points, and then you get this kind of statement. But it was very influential because this C, but it turns out is from turns out is it is um this is a product of three things you have some common kind of communitarial constants uh then you have that which is the size of each one pick An AF Tamahan measure of the Brahman instead. And so this was the first year in the literature where one was able to prove a case of the manic manager where there is some kind of Brahman obstruction. And one saw in this case that one has to modify the constant in the paragates by this kind of homology set. Yeah, F-bar. So, yeah, very invention. So, um, by the way, later, so in 2010, uh, Sean Bertoir and uh Chinko They put a paper on the preprint on the archive where they attempted to extend this method to count integral points to all varieties. And I say attempted because it turns out that the arguments contained some mistakes. This seemed, yeah, this was somehow cleared quite soon. But no, the variants were wrong, but maybe the alternative was still right. That theorem was still right, but actually, then very recently, yeah, to be clear, a bit more than a year ago, which give a counterexample to the theorem, and I will discuss this. This counterexample within the future. So, but somehow, what's nice about counter example is a very nice genetic interpretation. And once you know that they exist, you can somehow try to fix what Shamadra and Tinkle did. And so, today I'll talk about that ideas. So, you can tell about the following theorem. So, okay, quite a long thing. So, let X be a smooth projective. Okay, actually, projective not necessary in which proper, but let's use the term projective for simplicity. Variety. Over F T X is a torus D is the visor torus or the visor lying outside the torus. And U is the complement of this divider. So in the manufacture legit thing, the height you should be looking at is the anti-conclude height. So for integral points, you choose a different height. It turns out you choose the love anti-canonical height. Let H X F B a log on the canon local heights. So, what does this mean? This means it's the height. The heights um from the following divisor, you look at the undeconoco class, but then you should modify this by the okay, you look at any. Okay, you look at integral points. To look at integral points, you have to choose some integral model. Let U be an integral model of U. Okay, we should assume that they are integral points at all, right? And actually, I mean right. So the issue is you can choose like I mean integral models you can always like outside modify them at some finite set of places and you can always you know basically forward it in such a way that there are no integral points. So you should choose some integral modules that have integral points. Our integral points and mountain temperature is necessary, but what I went to work, you should assume actually that there are integral points in the torus. Okay. There is a setup and then the theorem is There exists some positive real constant and some integers that start to look at the number of integral points of bound height. As B goes to infinity, we will see times B times my power. And in principle, yeah, maybe not sent this thing, but B and C have a genetic interpretation. So they have not just some arbitrary constant, they have It's not just some arbitrary constant, it really has geometric interpretation. And so, if you look at the paper of Samoa Valenchenko, you might look at this and say there's exactly the same theorem. But actually, the main difference is that my B is different from their B. So, this is basically this is also in this Welsh counter example, in the Welsh counter example, you can see. In the Belcher count example, you can see that it's a counter example exactly because logarithmic factors line up. Moreover, this B is always smaller than the B of Shamodo-Valenchinko. It might be equal in some cases. Okay? It can contain zero. Yeah. Yeah, of course, yeah. Yeah, I mean, if yeah, for example, A1 over Q, you can't tell me you see that later on. Yeah. So let me talk a bit first about in-zero points and about this counter example of Florian. Count example of Florian. So somehow, yeah, that's true. That's true. Thank you. So an important So an important construct in this algorithmical points is the notion of the Clemens complex. So this was introduced by Shemitwa and Shenko. So, okay. It's like this. It is a pause set, so it's a partial audit set with elements which are called faces are Are two poles. So for each infinite place, you have some object, and Z V is a stratum of so this divide will after base change to the algebraic closure. Base change to the algebraic closure, it is always S and C. And so you have some kind of notion of stratum where you intersect, look at intersection, and then you look at some introducible components of this. But over F it might not be S and C, so that's why we say over F bar, which is defined over Over the local completion at your place, and you should have some points at a place. Yeah, it should be of points and it should be non-zero. And I use a notation, so if I put a circle on top of it, it has the open stop strata. So ZV is always the closed strata, and ZV with a circle above it is the closed strata. My else presentation, UZV. This is the minimal open sub variety containing Containing U and that V. Okay. Okay, so why do I introduce this? It turns out if you go look at integral points, so like even already in the simplest case where A1, where you look at A1, which you think of as P1 without infinity. So you look at this. So, you look at these individual points, and you are and what you do is you don't look at them at the standard chart, but look at them at the chart at infinity. So, at infinity, integral points are exactly one over n, where n is some integer. And so, you look at them and you see that they look like this. So, we see that almost all All of the integral points tend to be concentrated at very close to infinity. And more generally, it turns out almost all of the integral points tend to be concentrated near to like such substrata, which we think of, but we have multiple infinite places, so it really turns out to be concentrate next to these faces of the Clement complex. These phases of the Clemens complex. And actually, more generally, most and using quantum sense, so basically 100% tend to be integral points, of course. Near maximal. So the posted structure is order is by inclusion. So like just the visor, they are small faces, but if you look at smaller, if you look at smaller and smaller intersections, they become maximal faces. And I say tend to be because it's not always. Yeah, yeah. I guess it's yeah, always 100%. And sort of this is what shows up also in the charm to include uh things. They noticed that these um integral points tend to be constrained in their faces. But what they sort of didn't notice is that that can be Sort of didn't notice that there can be certain obstructions at certain phases to integral points being close to them. And I mean, there's actually a very simple example. So look at P2 blown up at X is Y is zero D is Is so you take some line disjoint from the blow point and you take the exceptional divisor then I mean then U is A2 without its origin and E is basically lying out of origin. And so if you go look closely to E, you see, I mean, these are basically integral points. I mean it's a basically integral point. Um so the points close to E are the points near the origin. But if you I mean if you take a small boundaries at the origin, there's only one point. So somehow there's some kind of obstruction to being close to this E. And so, this is what Version noticed. And he basically takes this slightly fancier example. There's some again, there's more. There's another kind of, yeah. It's basically the example of only as this bit, but you're just which is one dimension higher, basically. It's not somehow. It's not uh somehow okay okay, so why is it some more important if you have these abstractions? A section of a stratum of the bar. Yeah, sorry, yeah. Yeah, stratum yes. Yeah. Yeah? No, no, that's yeah. No, no, that's yeah, very at least like photographic varieties, so somehow you just like photoic varieties are not always funnel, but somehow I can still always find points of them. Oh yeah, I got the condition. Okay, no, yeah, sorry. You should assume this. Sorry. Yeah, you should assume that there are over F-bar, there are no global invertible. Bar, there are no global invertible sections. In this case, yeah, this works. Okay. Oh, yeah, thank you. Any other things? No. Yeah, also very important assumptions. So, this is the challenge tool don't have something like this. Instead, they assume something like, so they don't assume log final, they assume that. They assume that Laurentian quality is big. So, under the assumption, Booho is not actually true. The Laurent technical visor is not always big, but it's let's say almost true. And so, it's close enough to almost true that somehow you can still count on them. Yeah. But yeah, you can afford it to, yeah, with a little assumption, you're right. There are examples where this doesn't work. Yeah. Okay. So because of this, it is reasonable to count close to a few. To a phase and to a phase. So you fix one phase and it's at one to all interpoints, you only count those interpoints which are close to this phase. And for this, in this case, Shamar Val and Schinkle, they basically have this paper on the Gusa integrals. And in this, they more or less justify, give some. Justify, give some heuristic basically heuristic as a bit similar to the circummeth. The number of integral points close to A is of. Is of order B to order of magnitude. So you have B log B and then log power is the rank of the Picard group plus the dimension of A. So I've been defined, but it's not exactly the dimension of A is very, very closely related to the core dimension of the Z. To the core dimension of the ZV. It's not exactly the same, but it's very, very closely related. And so I'm not going to give a precise definition. But it's very closely related. But if you have like a construct, if you have an obstruction like in this, like Wilsch found, then obviously this can be true because you have no points or very little points close to this. And so, okay. Now let me go to the B. So the B. Let me talk to the B. So the B of Kyamartoir and Chinko, what they do is they say this the rank of the Picard group plus you take the maximum and you range over all faces of DIMA Yeah, so this depends on your numerization of DIMA and the nomination of the dimension of the face they use in such a way that if your face is like empty in some sense, or like then it's minus one. So yeah, that's normalization. And so basically, by if you account for this, If you account for this context of this obstruction of the village, instead, there is simply what you would expect. So the same thing, again, the rank of the Victor group plus the maximum over faces, but only over those faces with no obstruction. And so, in this case, there are two maximal phases. One is Z0, which has dimension 0. And there's no obstruction there, so this Q is asymptotic. And you have this other phase E, where there is an obstruction, and it has also dimension one. So, in this case, geometric and chinko are correct, might be and there be the same, but you can sort of. The same, but you can sort of push this example one dimension higher, and that's what village does. In this case, these two numbers are really different. And it's this one which is the correct one, and not this one. No, no, this is the dimension of the machine. Yeah, you're right. There's the same dimension. This is the dimension zero. This has dimension zero. And there's no intersection, so there's no strata intersection. But yeah, Will gives an example where there's some dimension one case where there's no obstruction, and there's a dimension zero case with no obstruction, and that's why they're different. And he also, I mean, he basically suggests that you should do something like this. Wilsh does this in his paper, that you should do something like this. But even there, so without this assumption, there's actually even a counterexample to this B, which is a bit mysterious, maybe. So yeah. Also, if it's not true, you should do something different on PQ, but okay, this is maybe a bit too far, what I say. Okay. Okay, and now I can also give some comments. I can also give some comments about this C. Yeah, I'm going to let it stand. So, the C, we want to interpret every kind of theta constant. So there So there are multiple obstacles to this. But yeah, it doesn't really matter fine. So the first one is around C alpha times beta times some kind of Brauer money set, right? So, issue one. What is alpha? Actually, this was more or less rolled by Welsh. So, I'm not going to give too many comments on this, but yeah, it's some kind of cone constant over a different cone than maybe. Of a different cone than maybe the naive effective cone. This is fine. A second issue is: I mean, so past constants mean true heights. Our heights, our anti-economical heights implies equity distribution. So, yeah, this is a nice fact that they're found. Somehow, yeah, you can modify your height at some kind of whatever primes you want, and then it's an equidistribution. With integral points, Points are concentrated near these phases. So you're not going to get into your pushing to this phase. So instead, yeah. Instead, Instead, yeah, so maybe I just replace you by also, yeah, sorry, I mean, of course, it should be, yeah, you should look at integral points, right? Your integral points, you should integral others, not the filters. So, what you do with the finite base, you should So, what you do is at the final pressure file, nothing strange happens here. But at different places, instead, the correct topology, so it can concentrate near the phases. So, again, you try to count near each phase separately, you get this thing. This thing. So you should instead put some kind of measure on this spaces, on this like space of the strata. Okay. But okay, also this is also fine. This was done by Shamarov Aranchenko. Shamarovanchenko. Also, in the Reguza intro paper. Maybe the last subtle thing is to be this is like some kind of algebraic bra group. So it's H1PEG, but it's also algebraic Brow group of something under constants. Modern constants. So this doesn't work. Why? So pairing, so Braumanning pairing is not necessarily defined on Z V F right. Right. I mean, yeah, it just didn't necessarily happen that if you have some problems in you, you kind of relate it to that.v because that we don't buy in you. Instead, take maximum subgroup where it is defined. So and this is the So, and this depends on this that depends on the face. I don't notice like this. So, it depends on your face, so XA. And lastly, yeah. So Is going to look at the infinite? And if the Brahmo is infinite, then like the analog of the volume of the Brahmo man set will always turn out to be zero. So if you have like, okay, some constant times infinity times zero, this doesn't make any sense. So the Lush. So, the Lucian, so sort of implicitly already in this paper of Shambatova and Shanko, although they don't mention it explicitly. The notion is to take you take finite elements of the Barao group, finite surface of Bragg, sorry, and then you do like the side model constant. You look at the size of B times the Romage measure of this modified space with respect to this B. So you only got like the Ramanujan with respect to the finite subgroup. And in this case, what happens is somehow if you the B and B be bigger than this number, this limit, this limit converges, and then you see you get, yeah. Yeah. This is already somehow implicit in this geological term. But okay, after these steps, we have to make all this issue with making this test constant generalizing this. Okay. So let me now make some comments about how I prove this theorem. So So, I'm going to go to the next one. So, the first question is: how do you get to deal with these counterexamples by these obstructions at infinity? And actually, somehow, sorry. And so, to get the total, so C depends in this case, the thing I wrote down depends on the phase. And to get the total C, you should sum over all possible phases which are maximal and has no obstruction. So, how do I deal with this? Um, yeah, so obstacle one. How to deal with Willish measure somehow the solution is fairly simple counts points near each face separately. Separately. So at the start, you have to count over all possible integral points. And what you then do is you split the integral points depending on how close they are to each phase. And it turns out by waiting, you use some partition of purity argument, and then you wait by these partitions of unity to instead of counting all entry points, you only count North each separately. You know. You know, yeah. So if there is an obstruction, I mean, you don't have to count because you know there is an obstruction, so I mean, there aren't that many points. There is some purely genetic arguments. Otherwise, you can count. You can count. And so, our last comment, the last thing let me talk about the how we count. So, Patient Van Chinko and Chambertoir and Chinko use Harmonica Mouse is. Harmonic analysis. So you look at your torus and you look at the space of dalic points. And there's some locally compacted building group. And so there's some general theory of harmonic analysis on locally compact building group. And you can use this to count these points, at least in Material Chenko case. So in Chamatoa case, I wasn't able to get this to work. So instead, I use a different argument. So instead, I use different arguments. I use one based on universal torsors. What is the universal torsor? Let me give a definition which is not 100% correct, but more or less works. So let you So let's you a variety. So we assume two things, we assume no global invertible sections over the algebraic closure. So yeah, this is exactly why I need this assumption in my theorem because the way I prove things are using invertors and they only exist under this assumption. And I want the Picard group of I want the Picard group of LDT losers finally generated. Let's put TNS, which is known as the Neeron Socieri Torres. This is the Torres under the Torres Vivo Torrespica group. Yeah, it should be excellent. And then what the universe torsed TNS torso Y to X U Is universal if why so why has no of the adjoint closure? Y has no global and vertical sections and pick the pillback map. Map is zero. So, yeah. There is maybe not one option that I correct because a third part of the structural of this group, algebraic group on this variety. But under this assumption, there are multiple sex actions. And you then to define your order, you want really one particular action to be it. But I mean, I mean, this definition works. But I mean, this definition works, more or less. So, this definition determines why. It just might not determine the action of CNS you want. So, why are these universal tools interesting? So, the point is You can think of rational points on U. These are orbits under your Algebra group over the distance union. Universal. So for each universal torso, so you have some set of rational points, you have some action of your torus on it. Points, you have some action of your torus on it, and you want to look at orbits under this torus, but uh, you have to look at really all universal torus torsors. There might be multiple, but okay, it turns out they're all twisted of one another. So, if you know one, you know the others. Um, okay, so instead of counting points here, you count points here. And it's interesting in general because universal order are often much more simple. So If you is a total variety, then universal torsors are explicit, are complementary. Explicit are complements in some affine space of explicit coordination bigger than two subvarieties. Right. So instead of counting points on some arbitrary torus, instead you have to count points on some varieties. Yeah, just I mean, just am okay, plus you have this coordination set varieties. But because that's what explains it, you can actually, I mean, there's some kind of, you get some kind of copyright. You get some kind of co-parameter conditions essentially. So this is usually often much easier to count on, yeah, basically points on some affine space, model or some congress conditions, basically, which satisfy some congress conditions, which are modeled to. Okay, do you have time? Okay, maybe five minutes. Okay, so let me give an example. I swear, maybe you should mention to the store barriers. Okay, so examples. So if you look at the productive space, universal torsor is you look at a n plus one without the origin. And how does this map this maps x one to xn to and like I mean what is true, thank you yeah I mean what is the standard way to count points of regular space? You take an element here and you choose some representative here. I mean equivalently you you look at Equivalently, you look at orbits and the multiplication by constants on here, and you try to count them. And maybe a slightly more complicated example is P2 blown up at X is Y is zero. So my example is so X. My example is so x is this, then the universal torso is um a4 minus okay some explicit quadrant two variety, which is maybe a bit, yeah, which you can write down, but it's not one point easy. And this maps to uh so to x. And so what kind of so on x you have your relative coordinates. And you also have the coordinates from the blow-up. And this A4, you have just your four coordinates. And how does this map? So ABCD goes to the area of A C D C B C um uh D and then here is just A and B okay. And the quadrimation variety in here, the Z is exactly such that this is well defined, right? It's just the minimal set such that it is well defined. Yeah, so yeah, yeah. And so, yeah, that's all I wanted to talk about. Questions? Yeah. Yeah. Uh yes. Yeah, so this is um due to soundbag effect. Uh this is yeah. So Uh no, it's not. But uh it in general, I did it uh so yeah so these are rational points and interpoints are slightly more tricky, but um no, are they? I mean, okay, they have to use different yeah, many rational points are maybe a bit easier. Um Rational points are maybe a bit easier. What happens in rational points is so you look at the image of so you range over yeah, so H1 TNS and look at the corresponding universe torsion and in terms of how isomorphic as abstract is. Isomorphic as abstract varieties, but just in maps which are different of the Delic space. This is exactly the Brown mindset. Okay, but it turns out, so you want to think somehow of this volume as some kind of this volume, okay, some kind of the volume of. Okay, some kind of the volume of some kind of innovative domain of TNS acting on this volume. Volatile 3 also have to do something else. But also, yeah, this is over count. Yeah. And for integral points, not finite, but you only count integral points. And so you have to lose like, yeah. So this set is not necessarily finite, but you. That is not necessarily finite, but you are only counting like points which somehow map to the integral atallic points here. And if you did this, then the A here, such that the image of this hits any kind of points here, is finite. And so yeah, you only have to create a finite number of universal torsions. Yeah, yeah. This is impossible. No, not under this assumption of this thing. Yeah, so yeah, I mean, somehow you can see this from the fan. I mean, if it was true, right, then you would have that every integral points that are very little increments everywhere. And so, but with another assumption, and so this somehow not possible. Yeah, there is some example that is filled. Yeah, this is not true. There are some examples, like the example is I think even the GM yeah GM over in P1. In this case, there's an obstruction at every phase. There are two faces, one at infinity, one at zero. And in both cases, you have an obstruction. And so, I mean, over Q. So over, if you have more real places, then you have more complex places. Complex cases. So, um, I mean, you see, I mean, integral points is one and minus one, so there are a little of them. Yeah, yeah, finite even, yeah. Maybe, um Maybe. Right. Yeah. So I mean, the thing I was thinking of doing in this case is in this case, if this is not true, then there is some map from U to G torus so that each fiber has this property. So, I mean, yeah. So basically, you look at these quotients, these findings. You look at its quotients, this finds some the dual is on torus, and this is G, you have to move from U to G, and each fiber has a property that this is true. I thought maybe you could sum over this, but I won't, yeah, I won't duplicate this work. Okay, so maybe you should take this oops. Yeah, it's also. Yeah, yeah. It's actually also, this also happens in this case. If you take some Toronto variety with a multiple fundamental group, um so there yeah, then maybe then maybe we have something similar here. Then you have something similar here, but that's where that's where you have the same procedure. So you look over finite subgroup of the brow group, and then you take a limit. And so for counting, it's not very useful, but in this case, still, this here will still be finite. So somehow. And yeah, no use now. Maybe we should stop now and any further questions be done and during the next question. Let's take all the speakers.
