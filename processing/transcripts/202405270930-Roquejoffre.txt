So first of all, thank you to the organizers for inviting me to this conference. So this is a joint talk with Ming Ming Zong, who is going to talk later on mathematical properties on this model on which we've been working together for one year. So it's joint work with Gregori Fai and Ming Ming. And meaning. So, first of all, let me tell you about the model. If you know it, of course, it sounds very natural to you. If you don't know it, it may look very strange. So let me take some time to explain it. So the unknown function is a function that I call rho of time, space variable x, and some other variable i. So x is in R and I is positive. R and I is positive. And so inside the domain, it satisfies a very simple transport equation. dt rho plus di rho is equal to minus gamma f i rho so it's a very simple transport equation with some initial data and at the boundary i equal to zero it satisfies a very strange non-linear devotion condition rho of tx zero is equal to a function of a big integral. A big interval, interval between zero and plus infinity of beta of i times a function k convol with rho. And I integrate with respect to i. So once again, if you know the model, it's very natural. If you don't know it, why am I looking at that? So before explaining to you in some detail why I'm interested in such a model, let me give you some assumptions. So sorry, the function f is positive, increases. F is positive, increasing, concave, and f of zero is equal to zero. So the kernel k is non-negative, infinity, even, compactly supported, and with unit mass. And the functions beta and gamma are non-negative or positive, and they are both C infinity. And the initial data rho is compactly supported both in X and I. So once again, In X and I. So, once again, a very simple transport equation inside the domain, so it's R2, let us say, and a very, very peculiar Dirichlet boundary condition, which couples the function to its inside values. And so I'm asking for the sharp asymptotic behavior of this thing when t goes to plus infinity. So, the outline of the talk is a fluid, so I will start. Uh is a froid. So, I will start. Uh, I mean, I will talk about the motivation, then the main result, and then if I have time, a brief discussion of some analogies between with other models. So, it's really focused on the motivation and the presentation of results, and Ming Ming will tell you more about the mathematics that are behind that. Okay, so the motivation is the so-called Kerr-Mac McCondric model for spatial sprays of. For spatial spread of epidemics. So it was very fashionable some time ago. Quite fortunately, it's a topic that is a little bit less fashionable now. So how do you model, I mean, deterministically, how do you model the spread of an epidemic? Well, you need two ingredients. The first one is a contamination mechanism, and the second one is a diffusion process. And I'm going to discuss both. So So let me talk about the full model. So it's not a young one, it's already, it's almost 100 years old. So essentially it says that the contamination mechanism highly depends on an infectivity rate and a removal rate, which themselves depend on the infection duration, how much you've been infected. This is a Infected. This is a key word. So let me call S of T the density of susceptible. So suppose you have a virus circulating around, and S of T is the density of people that can catch the virus. And capital I of T and I is the density of infected individuals that have been infected for duration I. So once again, the model is due to these two gentlemen, Kermack and McKendrick, so you see their dates. And so the And so they wrote this extremely fascinating paper in 1927. I mean, of course, it's extremely illuminating, but also it has a very, very interesting historical value. I mean, I highly recommend to read it, although it can be difficult to read at times. So you have these two unknowns, and let's see what we can say with them. So the first thing you say is So, the first thing you say is that the infected for duration A are removed. So, what is the philosophy behind that? Suppose you are infected in the morning. In the evening, if you are still infected, your infection is one day older. And if you're removed either by healing or more tragic, more tragic outcome, then you are removed with the rate. removed with a rate that is called gamma of i. Okay, then every day, at every instant, there's a new arrival of infected. So the number of infected at time zero, with duration zero at time t, is assumed to be proportional to the number of susceptibles. And you integrate, I mean, and you say that an infected with duration I. With duration i, it can infect you with transmission probability bet of i. And of course, you integrate the whole thing between zero and plus infinity. And the last thing, the last thing you say is that you update the susceptible population and you just say that s dot is equal to minus the number of infected with duration zero at 20. Okay. Time t. Okay, so this is the Kermat-McKendrick model. And at time zero, put a small amount of infected, and maybe some have already been infected for some time, and you ask what happens when time goes to plus infinity. So before answering this, let me show you a very well-known model. So let me assume that beta and gamma are constant, and let me Are constant and let me look at what we obtain. So let me integrate capital I for all durations. I call it I of T and here's the system that I obtain. It's just a very well-known system which is called the SIR model. So S for the susceptibles, I for the infected. So you just say that the variation of infected The variation of infected is proportional to S and I, removed with rate gamma, and S dot is just once again the update of the susceptible population. S at zero is S naught, I of zero is I naught. And to study the system, you just look at the cumulative density of infected, which is just the integral between 0 of T. Which is just the integral between 0 of t and t of R of S. If you do that, you obtain a very simple differential equation. U dot is equal to S naught 1 minus exponential minus beta U minus gamma U plus I naught, which I call F of U plus I naught. Then let me define this parameter. Of course, any coincidence between all, between any existing character is, of course, Character is, of course, totally intentional. And so essentially, if one studies S01 minus exponential minus beta u minus gamma u, if r0 is larger than 1, it has a positive slope. So this function has a non-trivial zero that I call u infinity. And if r0 is less than 1, then there is a negative. Negative slows from the start. And so, what you very easily show is that when R0 is less than one, then the cumulative density infected goes to a very small, very small density, which is so essentially a few unlucky people get infected and most of them get away with it. On the other hand, if R naught is larger than, strictly larger than one, R naught is larger than strictly larger than one, U of T goes to some asymptotic density, which is strictly larger than U infinity, and the epidemic takes its toll. I mean, the population of susceptibles goes down by a very positive fraction. Okay, so this is a very simple asymptotic study. So what happens when you analyze the Kermat model in the light of this? Model in the light of this. So there's a very remarkable feature that you can integrate between zero and t, the density of infected for duration i. You can integrate duration by duration. You have a non-linear function f of rho, which is s01 minus exponential minus rho. So please know that it is positive for positive rho, increasing, concave. So it satisfies all. So it satisfies all the assumptions. And the system you get is hardly, I mean, it's of course a little more complex, but it's very reminiscent of the system that I studied, that I posed at the beginning. Essentially, you get a transport equation in I. dt rho plus di rho is equal to minus gamma of i rho plus some i naught and rho at t Rho at t and duration zero is f of the integral between zero and plus infinity of transmission rates times the cumulative density of individuals infected for duration I. So it's a slightly more complicated system. System. And what can we say about it? Well, in fact, it can be studied. It's of course a little bit more complex than the S-Iron model, but it's not impossible to do by any means. So there is another R-naught, which is, okay, it has some expression. And if it's larger than one, switch larger than one, one can prove that there is a unique steady state. A unique steady state, rho s of I naught. So this steady state, rho s is always positive. It is an asymptotic state for the transport equation. So this is a little bit more involved. I mean, it's not so difficult to prove. You just proceed with sub- and super solutions. And so for every duration, Duration, rho of Ti goes to the steady state, and in the end, the population of subsetible once again drops down by some significant ground. I put as a remark the fact that R0, the definition of R0, is consistent with the definition that I gave when beta and gamma are constant. It's just a little. It's just a little bit more complicated. So that's the analysis of the Kern-McKerlick model. And so for, I mean, the homogeneous, and now let us see about diffusion, because of course the Kermit McKenzie, the SIR or the Kermit McCormick model has no special spraying mechanism. So the idea that So the idea that goes back to candle, so once again it's not new, is the following. We just declare that an infected is going to infect people in some range. And so we just replace SI by S times K control with I, and K is some kernel, which I just declared to be compactly supported, even with mass one. So essentially, you Mass one. So essentially, you sit there and you can be infected with individuals around you. And the probability of being infected is weighted by this kernel K. And the system that you, the SIR system that you obtain is DTS is minus beta SK control with I, DTR is beta SK control with I minus. SK control with I minus gamma I. Still, with so we assume that the population at time zero is homogeneous and we introduce a very small amount of infected at time zero. And I know it is completely supported. So you introduce at some very localized place, introduce a very small amount of infected. It is a remarkable fact that you can do the same Can do the same operation as the homogeneous SIR model. You can look at the cumulative density of infected, but this time you just integrate I with respect to time. And what you get is an equation which is ut is equal to S naught one minus exponential minus beta chi convolved with u minus gamma u plus I naught. And this thing Ionit. And this thing has a fiscal KPP structure. And it may not be obvious at first sight, but it does have a fisher-KPP structure. And to convince oneself of this, one can linearize the equation around zero. And one can find Vt plus S naught beta times V minus K convolve with V. And V minus K convolves with V is a non-local is just a non-local diffusion operator. Just a non-local diffusion operator, and we see our old friend gamma R0 minus one times V, and which is a gross term. Okay, so if now we apply the Kendall's idea to the full Kermach-McKend model, so R at tx0 is equal to, so we just say that it is S of Tx times the interval between zero and plus infinity once again. 0 and plus infinity once again. So you integrate all durations. But now you say that an infected person can infect people around him or her. And so you can roll with the kernel K. So one can define the curated density of infected for duration I. Use DT. Use dts is equal to minus i capital I of S 0 x and what do we find? We find the Dirichet condition that looks so strange. So rho at T x naught is equal to F of interval between zero and plus infinity of beta of I, K convol with rho and integrate with And integrate with respect to the duration. And the transport equation for rho is the same. I mean, it's just integrating the transport equation. So it's very easy. Okay, so let me explain to you the main result. So let me review what happened with the SIR model with non-local contaminations. And then let me tell you about what happens about the sharp asymptotic. What happens about the sharp asymptotics for the transport model? So, the comment I make here is that the epidemiological relevance is very questionable because what is the interest of looking for sharp asymptotics when there is a very high uncertainty on the propagation speed. On the other hand, it's an interesting mathematical a very it's an interesting mathematical question okay so let us look at the uh at the first at the the s ion model so let me recall uh once again the equation so let's suppose that the that r naught is larger than one so the so the theorem due to candle is that when r naught is larger than one there is invasion so essentially the the asymptotic state uh u infinity invades invades the Invades the whole space. So there is a speed of spreading. So you look for linear waves to the right. So in KPP equations, linear waves are always standard objects. So you linearize the equation, looks for solutions of the form exponential minus lambda x minus ct, plug this into the linear equation. So what you get is a transcendental equation that you can study. And so Can study. And so essentially, it's just a little bit more complicated than in the KPP equation. So it's a transcendental equation to solve. And there is least speed, which I call C star, with exponential stars. So there is a minimal C star such that you have a spreading speed. You have a spreading speed, exponential minus lambda star x time x minus c star t. Okay, and so and so okay, and so the results is the following. So contrary to Francois, the geometry is very simple. So I just look at x of t, the furthest point to the right, such that u of tx is equal to u infinity over 2. There the serendi. There's a theorem by Aaronson saying that x of t is c star t plus little o of t. Okay, so of course this model was, I mean, there were many generalizations of this model, but sharp asymptotics were not so fast to come. In fact, I guess I was the I proved the sharp asymptotics. X of t is equal to C star T minus three over two under star log T plus X infinity plus three to the O of one. Infinity plus 3 to the O of 1. And there's a companion result, which says that in fact you converge to traveling waves with exact asymptotic location. Okay, so as I guess my talk has been finished for five minutes already, so I am just going to give you the result for the Kermot Mechanic model. So once again, let me So, once again, let me record the system. So, it's a transport equation on the upper half space with the Ruchet condition that couples in a very non-linear fashion, in a very non-local fashion, the values of the unknowns at the boundary and inside, put an initial datum that is compactly supported, assume that R0 is larger. That R0 is larger than one, strictly larger than one. So there is a steady state, a non-trivial steady state. X of t is the furthest point to the right such that rho of t x0 is equal to rho infinity over 2, rho s over 2. And so once again, there's a theorem, not so young, which was proved independently by Dickon and Tim in 1979, which says that once again, Dai's sister. Once again, does C star such that x of t is equal to c star t plus little of little o of t? And so the result that Mimi is going to present is the fact that there is Long destroy such that x of t is equal to C star t minus 3 of over 2 Long destar log t plus big O of 1. So I don't think I have time A even time. So, I don't think I have time, even time, to go into discussion. So, what I'm just going to do is finish here. And thank you for listening. So, Michelle, thank you very much for your very nice talk. Do you hear me? Yes. Okay, thank you very much. Very much. Very wonderful talk. An old model revisited in a much more detailed aspect. A very nice talk. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? Yes. Tamisha, what should we recall as a definition of Lambda star? Lambda star. Ah, okay. Sorry. So, uh, of course. Uh, so let me share again the screen. Uh, ah, uh, okay. Ah, okay, okay, okay. Can you see the screen? Yes. Okay. So, uh, let me uh let me show it to you on the on the On the non-local SIR model. So you look for waves, linear waves of the form exponential minus lambda x minus ct, right? And so take the linear equation and plug exponential minus lambda x minus ct inside the in the equation. So factor out the exponential and you get a transcendental equation. And so what you and so And so you try to solve this equation. So you have the graph of 2s0 beta, so it's a very complex function, which you try to equate with st lambda minus gamma r0 minus 1. So this is this. And so you have the choice with the slopes. You can either shoot, I mean, you're very weak. If you shoot very weakly, you don't intersect the graph of the. Very weakly, you don't intersect the graph of the exponential. If you shoot very strongly, because the exponential is a convex function, you intersect at two values of lambda. And there is a critical value of the speed, C star, for which you are tangent to the graph. So, and for when you're tangent to the graph, you only have one lambda, which I call lambda star. Oh, thank you very much. Now, I understand. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, thanks for asking. I agree that it was a little bit fast. So, thanks very much for asking. Thank you. So, are there any other questions? Some quick questions? Okay, Cole Gram, asking. Yeah, just one. Can you hear me well, Dr. Shal? Yep. Hello, Cole. Maybe I missed at the end, but do you anticipate that they were traveling? But do you anticipate that there are traveling waves in this system? Ah, yes, yes, yes, there are. There are indeed traveling waves, which is once again not such a it's not such a new result. Once again, Dickman and team had more or less understood it. What we did, however, was to understand the uniqueness and asymptotic behavior of the basic wave, which is not such a trivial task. But yes, there are indeed traveling waves. Yes, they are indeed traveling waves, and there is a companion in this CRM saying that, in fact, the solution is going to be tried between two traveling waves, two traveling waves, in the correct reference frame. Okay, thank you. And I should add that asymptotics with respect to, I mean, more precision is a work in progress. There are still Is a work in progress. There are still a few things we don't we still need to understand. Okay, thank you very much. So I think now I have a short question, if I may. Yes, we have to. This is, I think the time has come, and I would like to thank the speaker. The speaker, one second. Thank you very much. Yes, someone is making a question. Oh, okay. So if there is some question, okay. Okay, one more question. Can you hear me? It's uh, it's Luca. Hi, Luca. Luca, Luca. Please. Hi, first of all. Hi, first of all, I would like to greet everyone, and I'm very sorry not to be there. Thank you, Michela. I have a question about the last thing that you were saying about the little O of one. So it's working progress. So you expect this to be a little O of one at the end. Yeah, so essentially the. Okay, so let me try to once again. Let me try to once again share this screen so I should I should be able to do it now. Oh yeah, okay. Uh so so normally there should be the I mean in this big O, there should be a constant that should depend on I in a way that we still need to understand. In fact, in fact In fact, behind that, there is a Dirouch-heat kernel that we still need to understand. And this high dependence that we don't fully master yet. So it's work in progress. But essentially, what is in this big O of work? is in this big O of one is not totally something we don't totally know at the moment. Am I answering your question? Yes, perfectly. Yes. Thank you, Ramita. Thank you very much. So let's thank the speaker once again. Thank you. Thank you very much.
