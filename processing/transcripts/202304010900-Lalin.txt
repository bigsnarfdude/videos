Okay, thank you very much for the invitation. I'm very happy to be here. For those of you who don't know me, I'm an ex-Anberton. I used to be in Edmonton. I spent three years there before moving to Montreal. Okay, so I'm going to be talking about distribution of values of cubical functions of S equals 1 over the rational. So, I'm going to start first a couple of lines that are very, very basic, but just to remind everybody what the digital character is. So, we have a multiplicative function defined over the units of modulo D and it can be extended by to the integers, by periodicity, and with the condition that evaluated that the number is not compliant to D. A number that is not compiled into D gives you zero. Okay. Um, a digital character. So, when you have a digital character like that, we say it's modulo D, but then any division character modulo D can be viewed as a division character modulo, any multiple of D. So it's more organized to just care about the minimum D that works. That works to define the character, and that's going to be called the conductor. We are going to say it's a limited character of this conductor to meaning that it's not a character arising from some smaller models. What we are interested in is the L functions that we can build from these characters, so basically using the character as a coefficient. As a coefficient on the sum, and as we know, these functions. Okay, so in principle, if we define already as a sum, this is convergent for a real part of s greater than one, but then it can be analytically continued and has a functional equation that we relate s to one minus s. It also is expected to. It also is expected to satisfy the generalized Riemann hypothesis, meaning that the so-called non-trivial zeros, so the zeros that are inside the critical strip, real part of S between 0 and 1, then necessarily have to be at the real part of S one half. And for us in this talk, the only thing we need to remember that when I say GRH, it means generalizing my hypothesis. So, having the generalized remote hypothesis allows us to make very good estimates, so much better estimates of things. So, often we have results that are conditional on GRH. So, from time to time, I will say conditional on GRH or under GRH, meaning that we're using, we're assuming the GRH when we do the proof. What we are interested in are What we are interested in are values of these L functions at s equals one. So a motivator for this is if we start, say, with quadratic characters, this value by the Dirisa class number formula will be related to the class number of the quadratic field associated to the L function. Okay, so as an initial motivator, but then So, as an initial motivator, but then, of course, we can ask the question in general: what happens to the distribution of values of these functions as s equals one, even if chi is not, even in the case where chi is not a valid chi. So, what is known? Oh, before that, some notation. Okay, so this is very much an additive number theory notation. So, when I write log k of x, I mean k of x, I mean log of log of log k times on x. Don't worry in this talk, I think the worst thing that appears is log four of x, such as four logs nested within each other. But of course, I'm not an analytic number analytic number theories by racist as an analytic number theory. So for me this notation is extremely annoying because I think Is extremely annoying because I think it should be when I read it, I think, so it has nothing to do with that. It's annoying, but it's convenient. So I'm not going to avoid it. Okay, so just to be clear, if I take this potential of, say, log 2 of x, that just give you log of x. It doesn't give you x to the log 2 of e, which is what I would think normally. Okay. Um okay. So now a bit of um history of of this type of problem. So this this um idea of studying the L function at one kind of started with Lieder Wood, who assuming the GRH proved that the absolute value of the L-function at one for a general Dirica, not just quadratic, is bounded. is bounded um above by okay so what do people in oh what do people in zoom see what is better if i want to point they won't see the laser but um will they see me or they see you they see me okay okay so the this a value that we want to understand is bounded above above by essentially Q into the gamma log Q log 2Q. Okay, so this is log log Q. Q is the conductor. There isn't a small log of 1, so the formula is a bit more complicated than that. But essentially when Q goes to infinity, this becomes a 2, so we can ignore that. And the gamma is the Euler-Maceroni constant. Euler-Macheloni constant, so I'm not going to do much with it, just it's there. And it's bounded below by something that is a very similar formula. So if you ignore the small log of one is the inverse of what we have as an upper bound. So it's one over two e gamma log two cube, but there is also a constant multiplying a set of two. So that's the Riemann set of function of two. Okay. Okay, so that's what a little book was. And also, okay, so also he got the following complementary results. So for, if you look at now fundamental discriminant, meaning that you are looking at quadratic characters, then he proved under GRH that there are infinitely many t. Me t such that the L function is bounded below by essentially one times e to the gamma log two of t. Okay, so this inequality should be compared with the upper bound. So what this inequality says is that, okay, the upper bound maybe is not a two, but if it's below a two, okay. Okay, so if you need one, it's not good. There are infinitely many that are bigger than one. Okay, so it's somewhere between the one and the two, in a sense. And also a similar idea for the lower part. So there are infinitely many okay, so the lower one plus one half, one half times blah blah, okay, but there are infinitely many that are uh lower than one times blah blah. Lower than one times Pogla. And just as a comment, Chogla was able to remove the GRH condition of the person equality. And so the open question kind of is these factors of two between the extremes. So maybe one can remove these two and say, okay, there are something that... Except something that we can control. Okay, so there are infinitely many that we go over outside, but maybe we can control that. And the same for the one-half. So can we remove the true and the one-half? Can we remove the truth in the formulas in certain ways? So can we be more precise? Okay, so that's sort of open. Many, many years after, Mongolian Bongan, Among Bomani and Bogan, built a model of random variables to study this problem and made several conjectures on the proportion. Okay, so being a bit more precise, before that, let me go back, make a comment. So this type of inequalities are called omega results. This type of bound, it could be all, right? So we are saying that somehow Saying that somehow, if we put a set of these numbers, I mean, if we consider families characters, I'm saying we take an average, this will give like a big O estimate. And this is called omega because it's sort of a lower estimate. Okay, and I will be using this expression. Okay, so mango ni ambogana masas. Monbogi and Bogan as I said they did the model in random variables and made several conjectures more precise about what's the proportion of L values that satisfy this omega estimate. Okay, so this omega results. And basically the model of Random Varymov predicted that the one is really closer to removing the truth. To removing the truth, the good band that one wants to write. Okay, Lambda and Sam proved several of these Montgomery and Baughan conjectures by computing or looking an asymptotic formula for the distribution function of L1 chi in this case of quadratic. Quadratic. And they studied the tail of the distribution and showed that this double exponentially decreasing. I won't give you the details of that because what I'm going to present today is kind of similar, so you will see the type of formula that I'm going to get. It's a bit technical. And I wanted to mention that there are more results, follow up results on this, on studying the distribution, for example, with real quadratic extensions. Real quadratic extensions, quadratic function fields, etc. So that's for quadratic. Now for characters of general order. So there is a result of Lamsuri, where you fix an order, so order k, and he has an omega result, okay, basically that there are at least That there are at least a certain number of characters of conductor up to x that satisfy this lower bound that is essentially the same that I showed you before for quadratic characters. Okay, so understanding this, okay, so what does it mean this thing in blue? So it's x times some exponential, negative exponential, etc. So the way to think about this is like this is some. About this, is like this: something like this is smaller than x, okay? And the proportion, the number of characters up to x with the conductor q up to x is x. So this is how we can understand this. But of course, one wants to be yeah, one wants to be very precise on what these numbers should be. Okay, so the more precise, the better the result. The better the results. And let me just mention that it is conjectured that essentially the maximum is given by this number. So the maximum possible value should be given by of n1 chi, should be given by e to the gamma log 2x, essentially up to some small. Small correction. Okay. Now, our question, so the beginning of our project is whether we can give more precision for cubic characters. Whether we can get results that are kind of analogous. Okay, I didn't give many details for quadratic characters, but much more is known for quadratic characters and general characters. And so we wanted to see if we can. So, we wanted to see if we can recover the quadratic character resulting in the QB case. Okay, and we can. So, first, let me mention the omega results because those are the ones that I gave you very explicitly. So, under GRH, so for X slash, okay, there are at least a sport of X At least sport root X characters of conductor, prime conductor up to X, such that here I'm giving more precise, I'm giving more details to the result than what I gave you from the quadratic, but it's sort of the same kind of result, which alpha quadratic I didn't write all the details, okay? The L1 in pi absolute value bounded below by e to the gamma log 2x. Gamma log 2x. If you want, I can say log 2x plus some small log of 4. Because this log 3x grows much lower than log 2 of x. So this is the kind of standard I was ignoring also in my statements for the product. And also for the other direction, there are at least eight. Are at least x to the one-half cubic characters of prime conductor to x, such that the function is bounded at all by something that before we have set of two divided by e to the gamma log 2x. Now we have set of 3 into the gamma log 2x, and we have square root also. So this is kind of a new feature that we have a square root. So there's some sort of a single. Have a square root. So there's some sort of asymmetry there. In the quadratic cases, everything is very symmetric, and in fact, the proofs are pretty much the same. So let me mention a bit more in detail a comparison of what we have in the quadactic versus cubic. So for the quadactic, this is what we have for the mega results. So there were infinitely many, and one can be more precise. Okay, and one can be more precise. I say infinity many because that was a statement of what he found, but rather than found they have a very precise proportion like the one I shall describe for Q. And so there are infinitely many chi that will satisfy these inequalities. And then for the cubic we get the same case, so we get for the upper bound we get the same. For the upper band, we get the same, but the lower bound is different. Like I said, it's a square root. The set of three is not so surprising, but it's a square root. So what I want to say, I repeat it, it's written, okay? So the maximum value behaves in the same way as the quadratic, but the minimal value is dashed. Because we're taking the square root, something that fascinates Something big in the denominator. And very roughly, why this happens is there isn't a symmetry of what happens to your function when you look at the character. When you have a quadratic character, you go between 1 and minus 1. So the maximum, roughly speaking, will be with 1 and the minimum with minus 1. So it's very symmetric. Because very symmetric. However, when you talk about, when you take a qubit character, the maximum will be with one, but the minimum will be with minus one half. Okay, so the real part of the cubic roots of unity. And so that's basically what's happening. And in a sense, this minus one half, this one half, this two divided, sort of translates everywhere. Okay, so let me describe a bit. So, let me describe a bit more what are the cubic characters. Okay, so a bit more explicitly. Basically, the family of cubic characters, you can think of them as products of characters of conductor P, okay, with P congruent to one mod three. And so, for a character of conductor P, the way you define it is in the same way as you define biometric characters. So, you take So you take the cell root of your element modulo of P. And this is extremely badly written. For quadratic practice, this is here because it's one minus one and you just take your one or minus one. Here this is badly written because I'm getting the cubic root of a cubic root inside F. So what you need to do is you need to kind of make a convention of how the cubic roots in F P correspond to cubic roots in the convention. Correspond to cubic roots in the complex, complex cubic roots, and then define the character like that. So this is very kind of a sloppy way of writing things. There will be a choice in your college book, and that's okay, you just need to kind of be consistent with the choice you make. Okay, so for each brand, you make a choice, and then when you form your character, obviously, you can choose a QB root or Can choose a cubic root or the conjugate, so you will take a square, you choose a conjugate. And so, this is why we have exponents that can be one or two. So, for each plant, we take either chi or chi squared to account for the choice of the universe. Okay, and then we often talk about characters whose conductor is up to x, and so that we know that. And so that will be known as by f of x. And the goal is to study, say, the proportion of characters such that the function is bigger than certain constant or smaller than certain constants. And here we are normalizing the constant in this way. So the way we're normalizing the constant comes from the omega. Constant comes from the omega results, as I just showed you. Okay, so it's very natural. Maybe let me remind you. So these are the omega results. So this stands in a very natural way. So a bound below by E, well, an upper bound with E, but E to the gamma, and then they set a 3 over E to the gamma as product of that. So following that, So, following that, we follow that normalization. So, this e to the gamma is just a constant. So, you can think the variable here is the tau. So, you want to bound the L's that are bigger than tau, but you would like this constant because it's convenient to convert results. And here it's below 1 over tau, okay? So, we're interested in studying these functions. These functions. Okay, so the way we're going to do this is by modeling with random variables. Okay, so following these ideas introduced by Mongov and the Bogan and then exploited by many Lambie and San and Suri and many other people. So the idea is that you replace a function, okay, so the Euler film with function. The Euler product with function by the Euler product replacing the character per certain random variable, and the way the random variable, okay, so here I'm giving you the definition of the random variables. In the next slide, I'm going to explain why. I'll give you some idea of why. So, when this is for each p you get a number variable, okay? And so, when p is congruent to two, mod three or t is equal to three. or t is equal to 3. We're going to say that it takes a value 0, which probability 0, or 1 omega omega square, omega square is a root of unity, with probability 1 over 3. And when p is convenient to 1 dot 3, if we take the value 0 with probability 2 over p plus 2 and the root, the surrogate of unity would probably take p over 3 over 3 times p plus 2. Over 3 times P plus 2, each of them. Okay, and then if we follow this analogy with the other product, we could develop this into a sum and then you can think of that you have random variables for each end, okay, defined by the fundamental theory of arithmetic. Okay, so the first question is why we define the Is why we define the random variables like this? Okay, so a short answer is because it works, but we can also need an interesting justification. So here is an holistic argument. If you're looking at characters, okay, so we're going to be looking at characters of conductor n, where n is a square free and is only supported on primes that are congruent to one mod three. This is what we needed to do. This is what we needed to define these key characters. And so, if we want to be more precise, we are going to be looking at chi n. It's going to be written as chi n1 times chi n2 squared. So remember that in this character we have to chi p or pi p square. And this n1 and n2 are square free, okay, because we don't want to take. We want to counter this in once. They are also co-prime, because we start repeating them again, we have higher powers and we don't care. So they are co-prime and like we are saying, they are supported on planes 1.3. Okay. So now we want to, so it is easy to compute the probability that this, okay. That this, okay, give an argument of the project when this character is different from zero. Okay, so this is a hellistic argument. So I'm thinking of this in terms of choosing my n1 and n2. So in general, if I want to go over the characters and I look mod P square, okay, N1 and N2, if I look at them mod P square, okay, P square, okay, their condition that they are square free will translate that they cannot be both, they cannot be zero. Actually, each of them cannot be zero, modulo, zero modulo p squared. And the condition that they are coprime means that p cannot be by both of them at the same time, and so we will have something like m1 cannot be. Like N1 cannot be zero monp or N2 cannot be zero mod P. And so this is a model of thinking, okay, going over the characters. And now if I want to impose the condition that chi of P is different from zero, well, then in general, that condition will be, okay, p doesn't divide a one and p doesn't divide a two. So in a sense, the idea is that if I compute, if I But if I compute, if I count the number of n1s and n2 modulo p squared that satisfy the numerator and denominator, I should get some proportion, some way of modeling what's happening in the picture. And in fact, it works. So if we take p con to one mod three, then what happens is that if you're looking at n1 and a two, there are products of primes of the form. Lots of primes of the form 1 plus 3. By the change of the Meiner theorem and the Dirichlet theorem in alimentic progressions, you can reach anything more a square in principle. And so this condition doesn't tell you anything, and you just kind of count what you get here. Okay, this is again elementary counter. When you do the computation, you get p over p plus 2. And that should give you the And that should give you the probability that the character is zero in P. Okay, this di wrote chi t q equals c. Because I'm learning the q is root of infinity. That's why I took the q. However, if you consider p congregent to 2 plus 3 or p equals 3, then these conditions become empty because empty because see the pieces by in one are all congruent to one mod three. And so if you're looking at this modulo prime that is not one mod three, then I mean this toy scene that we're doing here, they become empty. And so everything is not zero, essentially. And so you get temporalities one. And so this is this is how one How one can justify this choice of random violence? Okay, so what, like I said, what we are interested is in these two functions, okay, that basically they are going to count the proportion of chi for which the n function is bigger than certain parameters. Bigger than certain parameter or smaller than certain parameter. And the idea is that to model these two functions with the probability that the L function that we build with the random variable satisfies the same inequalities. And then, okay, so using this, we can prove that under certain range Range the two functions that we want to compare, they are essentially the same. Okay, so there is some correction time here that is okay. But so what we are saying is that this phi from functions and this phi coming from the normal variables are essentially the same and the same for the And the good thing is that once we have the random variable, we can actually find exactly what this, well, exactly with some again, some connection term, but we can find what this we can describe what this takes are. Okay, so the probability with the function defined from the random variables, the probability that it's bigger than certain constant or smaller than certain constants. Or smaller than some. So these are all very concrete. And these numbers are actually given by concrete formulas. I mean, I'm just writing, yeah, I could write what the formulas are, there are some integrals, they are very precise. I'm just giving the approximation to give you an idea of the number. So, in sum, if I have to describe this result, you put it together with the preview. If you put it together with the previous page, okay, we watch the relationship with the phi coming from the function and the phi coming from the function. What they tell is that there is an exponential, double exponential decreasing. So double exponential, so there is e to the tau, minus e to the tau, something, and exponential. So that's what we mean by double exponential decreasing. And these formulas are very And decreasing, and these formulas are very similar to what one gets in the quadratic case. So, the quadratic case is not true here, and well, the constant will be different, but essentially it has the same shape. Now, for the C, okay, so for the lower bound, the decay rate is different. So, that's the part that is interesting. So, instead of depending on tau, it depends on tau score. So, the tau So the tau the way we bound the things, okay, so it's one over tau. So it's the same, we have the same tau here and here, but suddenly the decay depends on, oh sorry, the decay depends on tau squared. And so this is a new feature for the cubic case, again coming from this asymmetry between max. Asymmetry between maximum and minimum. I just want to mention that we also have a more precise result in the sense that, okay, so the formulas are the same, but it's a better result because it works in a bigger range for tau. And I explain later why this is interesting. interesting okay um it works in a bigger range because here we have log 2x plus log 3x and before we have log 2x minus 2 log 3x but i explain but essentially the idea is that with this result one can prove the omega results that i will at the beginning now the omega result one can prove the Now with Omega results one can prove them independently. So I'm going to mention that a bit. And this is under Chigar H. The previous one was not under Chigar H. Okay. Okay, so some ideas in the tool. Okay, so one important thing is that there are two ways of viewing these types of characters. So one way So, one way is the one I described before that we use to use a heuristic or everything for the random variables. Another way is to see them as avatars of characters on Q of omega, where omega is just a root of unity. So you can see them as, in other words, you can see them as a cubic symbol, okay, in Q omega. Okay, you omega sonanu something that takes values that evaluates in things in the in the extension. So it will be modular now an element in C adjoint omega, both the integers, with certain conditions. So n congruent to 1 mod 3, a square 3, another. Is quite free and not divisible by any rational plan. Okay, so before it was divisible by p coming to one was three, now you are kind of going to the extension and taking one of the primes that lie on top of p, but not both of them. And the way this goes down is that if you take the norm of n, you get an integer number. An integer number, this is your Q, which is the conductor of your rational curve. Now, why look at that? Because it's a bit easier to do a systematic count of the characters if you look at them in the extension. Okay, so one starting point for putting all these results has to do first with counting the characters, second with Second, we're doing an average of the characters. And so these formulas, you can prove them by taking generative functions and applying pronouns formula. And so when you do, you get that the count of the characters is some constant times. And the sum of the characters, okay, but it will fix number will be zero. Will be zero, essentially zero. It's an error of them, but essentially zero is the number you ever begin it, it's not a cube. And when it's a cube, you will get the constant times x times some product of the time dividing your number m that are congruent to 1 minus 3. And this factor p over p plus 2. And here is a real reason why we. Here is a real reason why we're using this random value. But I give you a realistic argument, but basically, in real life, what you do is you do this count, you see this number coming up. Okay, this is telling you that when p is congruent to one mod three, you should take p over p plus two, and when p is not congruent to one mod three, you should take one. And so basically, that's how you come up with the random variables, and then you try to. Random variables, and then you try to give a holistic argument of why this is not random. Okay, another element in our arguments has to do with computing the moments. So my experience up to this project, before this project, always had to do with looking at moments at the center of the critical sweep. Of the critical three, so at one half, and those moments are very, very hard to compute. And in cubic characters, you are super happy if you can compute the third moment. But here, looking at one, everything is great, and you can compute infinitely many moments. Okay, so you can compute the C moment, which is a complex number, bounded by certain. Okay, so you cannot go to every possible C, but it will be bounded by. But it will be bounded by a log of x, but still, I mean, you can get a lot. And so we get a, well, it's a technical expression involving the divisor function of t, but the bottom line here is that we can relate the moment with the moment of the function with the random value. Basically, after this technical expression, After this technical expression, what we get is a relationship between the two, which was not surprising. And then the other thing that we use is something that is called the Saddle Point method to actually get an expression for this CMC. So the idea here is that the way I defined before The way I defined before phi and c, it was just L bigger than gamma tau or inverse less than this quantity here. But we can always take a real positive power and the condition is the same. So you have an inequality, you raise it to some positive power, you still have the same inequality. Have the same inequality. And so the idea is that you can play this choosing the value of R. So choosing the value of R to evaluate these probabilities in a smarter way. And the smart way to evaluate these probabilities is to choose the R such that this, if you take the derivative, so you take the Take the expected value of the function to H2R divided by this bound, okay? You take the derivative, give you zero. So you are evaluating at the critical point of this inequality, and the same for the other one. And those are subtle points. And it turns out that this allows you to give a very precise evaluation of. C M C, okay, evaluating at that precise sample point. And with these evaluations, we can manipulate them. Okay, so there are many, many pieces of computation, but we can use those evaluations to actually give the formula data false, okay, to express them in a precise way, and also to relate the VMC with the random variable to the original one. Variable to the original one connected to the function. So basically, that's kind of the idea behind how this works. Now, I mentioned that we have a stronger result under GRH in the sense that we have a wider range of for tau, okay, so wider range where things work. Since work. That result is obtained by instead of working with the full Euler product for the L function and for the L function and the random variables, we cut them. We work with what is called short Euler products. So we do the product up to certain constants. So we take the primes up to certain points, and the same for the random variable. And well, this is quite technical, okay? Technica, okay, but again, the idea is similar. One has to compute the moments and then you start to relay the phi and the phi using the standard one method in the same way. Now this comparing these two quantities becomes quite integral. So I wanted to mention a couple more things. So far I Things. So, so far, I told you a bit about how we completely stays. The other thing that I haven't told you much about yet is this other result that I mentioned at the very beginning, this omega result. So, how do we get those? Okay, so those we get them completely independently of what I mentioned before. The idea here is The idea here is choosing characters in a smart row. Let me go back to the statement and reflect a bit. Okay, so what we want is to find many, many, many cubic characters such that the L function, say, is big. And similarly, we want to find many, many, many character chi such that the function is normal. The function is normal. And so, what we have to do is kind of choose the characters that work. And so, the idea is that we consider the characters and we force them to take certain values at primes up to certain points. So we take all the primes up to certain, say, Z, okay? And we are going to prescribe the value of the character at all of these P's. That all of this p is okay to be some okay, some epsilon in general, but obviously this epsilon can be you know one omega omega square. And so, but for a fixed choice of these values, we can estimate the sum of log of the conductor, the sum of L1 chi log of the conductor, the sum of one over L log of the conductor. So, okay, so there are some ugly formulas. Okay, so there are some ugly formulas, but the point is that we can do these sums assuming GRH, okay? So, assuming something big, and then what we do is to maximize the value, we choose, we force all the values of the character to be one, okay? And then to minimize the value, we choose them to be omega, or we could do omega squared, it doesn't matter. Square, it doesn't matter. And so that, then we play with inequalities, okay, and playing with this against these or this against this. This is how we get the omega results. Okay, so let me give you a bit of a summary of what we done. Okay, so in a certain range, we proved that the proportion of the functions given by bigger than certain constants, okay. Certain constant is given by this formula. And similarly, in a range that, okay, again, there's a square root of this asymmetry with the cubic character, we again prove that the proportion of n functions bounded by 1 over tau is essentially given by in this double exponential decay. So this we prove. So this we prove without GRH. If we include GRH, then we get bigger range. And with GRH, we prove this omega results that I showed you before. And so I wanted to mention a bit. So when you write this, okay, so if you look at is L1 bigger than E gamma times this, okay? And here, so you could in principle think about replacing. You could, in principle, think about replacing tau by this, but in that range, you can't. And so, this is why this result is not enough to put this. If this result were enough to do this, we would have this range. So, you need a larger range to be able to replace tau by log 2x plus log qx. And that's the better result. And that's the better result that I mentioned before. It's a bigger range, but at the expense of its in GRH. So obviously, what should come next is try to remove GRH on that. And in fact, it's not, I mean, it's going to be a lot of work, but it's not impossible. In the work of Grambill and Sam, Of Grambling and Sound, they actually have results in GRH. They use some character estimates given by Graham and Diverse, where they do non-trivial estimates on character sums where the conductor is small, meaning that you control the biggest prime dividing the conductor. But that, unfortunately, Unfortunately, okay, so all that work is very, very technical and the UN over rational. And here we really are working on the extension with Q omega. And so we have to recover these sort of estimates by Graham and Greenrose in this more general context of Q omega. And so that's a whole paper that should be written somewhere. Okay, and with that, in principle, one should be able to keep in mind. Principle one should be added to the ng add. So, with that, I'd like to thank you all for your attention. Thank you so much. Any questions? So, there's asymmetry between the lower and upper body. Uppercut. I suppose if you go up, this is what you're going to get worse. If you look at printed characters, for example, or something. Yeah, that's a good question. I think I'm not sure it's going to get worse because I'm thinking, okay, this is really speculative, right? But it has to do with. Is the real part if you okay? So, if you want to minimize the value, right, and you take the real part of the fifth root of unity was the minimum value. So, if you think in terms, okay, so if you think in terms of the geometry, right? Okay, so the zero roots of unity are here, but the fifth root of unity Of unity, okay. So, here is where I embarrass myself in the pen tower. Okay, so they are smaller. So, I mean, the problem here is that we get one half against one, but here we get something bigger than one half against one. So, I think the asymmetry won't be as bad. So, that's interesting. So, you have nothing for two, and then you sort of move. The truth, and then it goes sort of really bad, and then it gets better again. Well, yeah, that's I'm completely out of my brain right now. I mean, I haven't thought about it. I mean, it's a super good question. I haven't thought about it before. I'm just thinking that intuitively, what happens, I mean, when we do this omega results, it's this choice of epsilon that we do. And so, if we choose not omega phi but omega phi squared, it seems to me. It seems to me that we are going to have something that is, you know, in absolute value bigger than one half. And for higher roots, we should be able to be closer and closer to minus one. However, okay, that's in terms of the values you can get, in terms of the frequency, though. Sorry, this is very interesting. Sorry, this is an interesting question. The frequency, though, will be less, right? Because you are saying, okay, we avoid this value. So it will be much less character. It's a good question. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the value can be closer to minus one, but the frequency is less. Okay, so I guess the answer is: I don't have an answer to your question. Thanks, Sora. Thanks for asking. What is the main obstruction or difficulty to just replace a cubic character by any current character that is five or more? It seems that a lot of things could just plug in the key. There's soft but fully some of you could use that. Yeah, I would say I would say to me the biggest difficulty, the first difficulty that comes to mind is finding a good description of the characters. Like this game that we play between, you know, having a cubic character defined over the integers versus going to extension, I think it will become tricky. Trickier. Well, the decryption itself, you can do it. You know, you will have, say, for Kintrik, you will have, you know, the free fruit of Unity and blah, blah, but then, I mean, there is a lot of things I find under the carpet, like, you know, the CB. You have to, when you do this sum, for example, estimating the number of characters, doing this character. Characters, doing this character sum. I mean, we are going over, you know, this N1 and N2. And now, if you have Kintik, you have to go N1, N2, and 3. Okay, so N1, N2 to the 2, N3 to the 3, N4 to the 4. And for example, all of them being co-prime well, all of them will have to be co-prime with each other, so all three that's going to be very difficult to assume. Very difficult to see. I mean, both in the conditions of the civil questions for the yeah, calculating uh don't sound sentence gives a duplication about the problem with About the problem. Can you speak up a little bit? My question was: Was there any usage of reciprocity for communicating? Reciprocity. Yes, we use it all the time and to the point that I don't know anymore. Chi M of N or Ki N of M. Yeah, we use it all the time. I think for the extension of the K to K torture characters, those will be. Yeah, that's hidden there. Yes. Yeah, yeah, it's true. In the extension, the In the extension, yeah, the point is alternative description we use, I guess. Any other questions?
