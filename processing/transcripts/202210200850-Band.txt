We can see all good. Brilliant, thank you. So, today I'd like to talk about the hormone gibberellin and some ongoing work from my postdoc, Christian Karadiev. And this is together with three different experimental groups. So the group of Ilan Shanai, who's at Tel Aviv University, Hussam Hassan Nureldin, who's at Copenhagen, and Patrick Ashard, who's in Strasbourg. Ashard, who's in Strasbourg. So it's really well established that gibberwellin affects growth. And as you can see in these pictures, gibberalin affects growth of many different plant species and many different plant organs. And so these are all showing examples where the GA pathway has been perturbed. However, the cellular mechanisms behind this growth regulation are not well understood. And I'm keen to use modeling to try and understand the mechanisms behind this growth regulation. Mechanisms behind this growth regulation. So, the experimental literature has given us some insights into this. So, in 2008, Susannah Rubate, Thomas, and Malcolm Bennett showed that perturbing GA signalling, specifically in the endodermal layer, affects root morphology and reduces root growth. So, the endodermis is the third layer in of the Arabidopsis root. Then, in 2013, Elanchanai and Mara. In 2013, Ilan Chenai and Mark Estelle showed that using fluorescent GAs, these fluorescent GAs accumulate specifically within the endodermal layer. And then these fluorescent GAs were used to identify GA transporters. So this NPF 3.1 was shown to be a GA influx carrier, and this is specifically localised to the endodermal layer. So this is all making sense. So GA accumulates and acts in the endodermis. And apse in the endodermis due to the presence of these influx carriers. However, is often the way, more data came along and suddenly the story got a little bit more complicated. So for the next few slides, I'm going to show you the experimental data. And as you can see, this is a little bit unintuitive, and we needed a model to help understand what was going on. So Yolante and I continued investigating GA transporters, and he discovered. GA transporters and he discovered some additional transporters. So he found that the MPF 2.12 is present on the pericycle membrane. So this is the third layer, sorry, the fourth layer in here. He then found that 2. NPF 2.13 was also on the cell membranes, and this was in the chute. And grafting experiments showed that this affected the delivery of GA from the chute to the reed. And finally, he found licking the same clade, so these M. And looking in the same clade, so these MPFs are a really large family of transporters. However, 2.12, 2.13, and 2.14 are all closely related on that tree. So he then looked at 2.14 and really excitingly, he found that this was actually a vacuola transporter. So this is present on the tanoplast, which is the vacuola membrane. So as you can see from this picture here on the left-hand side. And this was specifically localized to the pericycle membranes here. To the pericycle membranes here. So we now have a family of different transporters that seem to be acting together to control the GA distribution. So looking at mutants in these transporter lines, Dylan found that if we knocked out 2.12 or 2.13, these have reduced endodermal GA accumulation, as you can see from these images here. So these were clearly having. So, these were clearly having an effect on the GA distribution. And really excitingly, he also found that there was a novel phenotype with these mutants. And this was to do with suberinization. So, superization is the formation of suberin, which happens in the mature regions of the reed. And this is laying down of additional components within the cell wall, which is really important for pathogen, stopping pathogens getting into the reed vasture and also preventing water loss. And also preventing water loss. Looking at the additional transporter, so this is the 2.14, and this is present on the tonoplast on the vacuole cell membrane. This time when we knocked it out, Yolan observed an increase in the endodermal GA accumulation. However, surprisingly, he also saw a reduction in the superization. So, in all three knockouts, the superin So, in all three knockouts, the subarin was reduced. However, 2.12 and 2.13 had reduced accumulation, whereas 2.14 had increased accumulation. So, this seemed very unintuitive, and we needed a mathematical model to try and explain and understand what was going on. So, these experimental results really led to two key questions. First of all, are the observed NPF localizations sufficient to explain? Sufficient to explain the GA accumulation? And secondly, how does the MPF 2.14 tona plus transporter increase GA levels in the adjacent cell layer? So this transporter is in the paracycle, where it's the GA in the endodermis that's increasing, whilst also being essential for the superisation. So it's these two questions which we wanted to use modelling to Which we wanted to use modelling to investigate. So, just to describe the model components. So, this was a two-dimensional multicellular model, and we used real cell geometries. So, we obtained this experimental image of the REACLAS section and integrated this geometrical data into our modeling framework. On this geometry, we prescribed rules for the carrier distribution. So, we have the endodermal cell membrane. Cell membrane, the pericycle cell membrane, and the NPF 2.14, which was on the tonoplast, the vacuole membrane here. We then wanted to have rules and rates, transport rates for these different NPF transporters. And for this, we used some URCE experimental data. And so we developed like a simpler model, an USIT model, just a sphere, and integrated all the parameters. And integrated all the parameters in the experiments, say the pH and the membrane potential, and then use this simple UCIT model to estimate effective permeabilities in these transporters from this sort of UCIT data. So, having to set up the transporter part of the model, we also had to think about where is GA coming from. So, GA is delivered from the sheet to the root through the phloem, and this is mediated by the two. And this is mediated by the 2.13 transporter. But this is a precursor of GA, and then this is converted to GA. And we thought that the GA synthesis enzymes were localized to the steel. So we essentially have GA synthesis within these blue cells of the steel. And the model also incorporated finely cell water fusion. So with this model, we then had a system of parameterized ordinary differential equations for the GA concentration in every cell, every vacuum. In every cell, every vacuole, and every cell wall compartment. So, as you can imagine, this is quite closely related to the auxiliary transport models that both we have done and many, I know many of the people in the audience have done. However, we made like two key developments of this. First of all, introducing the subcellular compartment, which was a novel feature that we were keen to explore in our model. And secondly, actually using Eurosite data to estimate the Data to estimate the permeabilities associated with the different transporters. So, putting all this into the model, and I should say with this Eocyte data, each of the parameters in the model is estimated, so we didn't have to guess any parameters. So, using this data, we could then predict the distribution of GA at the steady state. And very nicely, we saw that we were getting an accumulation in the endodermal layer in good agreement. In the endodermal layer, in good agreement with where we see GA in the using the fluorescent GAs. If we remove the NPF 2.12, which is on the pericycle cell membranes, we thought a reduced accumulation. So this suggests that these transporters on the pericycle membranes were allowing the GA that's synthesized in the seal, steel, to actually get to the endodermis. Removing Removing 2.13 from the model also saw a reduced GA accumulation. And this, I guess, you would expect because it's the 2.13 that's important for actually delivering the GA from the shoot to the root. If we remove the endodermal GA transporters, so this is the MPF 2.31, we again get reduced GA accumulation. So again, you guess you might expect that. And finally, very nicely in agreement with the data, we actually. Finally, very nicely in agreement with the data, we actually saw that if we removed the 2.14, we saw accumulation in the endodermis, again in agreement with the data. So this suggests that the NPF 2.14 is allowing the GA to be stored within the vacuole, so actually reducing the amount that is reaching the endodermis. So we have concluded that the observed transported That the observed transporter distributions are sufficient to create the observed GA distribution. And actually, that each of these transporters was necessary to create this distribution, because if we removed one of them, we weren't seeing the same pattern. So it's suggesting this is a clade of transporters that are acting together to produce this GA distribution with higher GA levels within the endodermis. So, to go on to think about our second question, and this is about, well, Second question, and this is about: well, why is the superisation reduced in NPF 2.14 knockout, even though the GA levels seem to be higher in the endodermis? And thinking about this, we realised we needed to think about the dynamics. So the results on the previous slide put all the steady state. But if we actually think about the dynamics of this process, these cells are moving upwards within the root. And so if we start with, say, And so, if we start with, say, no GA in the cross-section, and then we have we put in the synthesis of GA in the steel, we would see this kind of gradual increase in the GA levels. And so, these this graph on the left-hand side is showing the average cytoplasmic GA concentration, specifically in the endodermis layer. And so you can see the blue line is wild type, and the red lines the 2.14 knockout. So, we So we see delivery of GA, we're getting an increase with time. But during this time, these cells are actually essentially moving away from the root tip. The root tip is growing down, but the cells are essentially moving away. However, because of this, the cells are eventually going to be leaving the phloem and loading zone. So there's a specific region of the reed tip where the phloem is actually delivering water, hormones, everything into the reed. Hormones, everything into the reed. But this is only about half the elongation zone. So at a certain point, the synthesis of GA or the delivery of GA is going to stop. And as we see from our steady state predictions on this right-hand side, at this point, the MPF 2.14 knockout has higher endodermal GA levels than the wild type. However, at this point, if we look at the vacuola concentrations, the knockout. The knockout doesn't have the GA in the vacuole because it's this transporter that's actually pulling GA into the vacuole in the paracycle layer. And this means that the wild type has the GA in those vacuoles that then can be slowly released. And so causes a much more gradual reduction in the endodermal layers compared to the knockout where there's no GA in the vacuoles. So the reduction. So, the reduction is much less. So, this means that even though our steady state, and here the MPF 2.14 knockout has higher levels of GA, actually, by the time these SARs have reached further into the mature zone, the levels are actually higher in wild type. So, this provides an explanation for why this knockout actually has less subarin compared to wild type. Compared to wild type. So, just to kind of conclude this, the NPF 2.14 creates a vacuola store of GA in the pericycle. And this enables the GA levels to be maintained once cells leave the phloem and loading zone and there's no longer a direct source of GA. And this allows the wild type levels to be higher in the mature parts of the reed where sebarin forms. So, in conclusion, So, in conclusion, we've created a multicellular mathematical model for GA transport within the Arabidoxis Reed cross-section to understand the role of these new GA transporters. The data was quite unintuitive, and the models provided more understanding of what these transporters are doing. The models reveal that the observed transporter distribution is sufficient to create the observed GA distribution, and that each of these transporters are necessary. Of these transporters are necessary, so the transporters are working together to cause the buildup of GA in the endodermis. The model provides an explanation as to why seburization does not occur in the MPF 2.14 mutant, despite the endodermal GA levels being higher. And the modelling suggests that the pericycle vacuoles play a significant role in storing the GA and then providing a slow release that mediates superinformation in the mature zone. So, this work is in an introduction. So, this work is in an interdisciplinary paper and it's under review. You can find it at this link on archive. And just to finish with a kind of future outlook and future work, when we do this project, we realize that this idea that time is related to the space in REIT, it is a simplification. There's lots of things that are kind of missed from this interpretation of, like, well, as time moves forward, the cells are moving up. And we're keen to kind of address, you know. And we're keen to kind of address, you know, what we're missing in this model. So we're kind of thinking about: well, how do the carriers affect the longitudinal transport? How do these subcellular compartments affect the effective diffusivity along the reed? How can we create a three-dimensional model of the reed? What, if we do create a three-dimensional model of the reat, what other biological processes and organs would such a model enable us to study? And, well, finally, I'd start. And well, finally, I started talking about the presentation talking about how GA affects growth. And actually, we haven't got any further because, actually, even though in these mutants, the GA buildup, the GA accumulation in the endodermis is much less, they don't actually show a GRAIDE phenotype. So I guess ongoing thoughts are really around, well, how does GA affect BRAY and how can we understand this data showing that GA signalling in the endodermis is essential for weak RAID. Miss is essential for week break. So, um, thank you very much for listening. Thank you, Leah, for this lovely talk. We have time for one or two questions. Hi, thank you for the nice talk. I had the question actually on the last point you raised there. So, what are the phenotypes of strong GA biosynthetic mutants? They're like J1-2. Mutants there like J1-3, for example. So the GA biosynthetic mutants have reduced root growth and much shorter roots. Okay, and the timing of the effect of the gene, I mean, because you discussed a bit time and space in the context that you have there on that diagram, but what about as the seedling grows? Like, is it known when you? Like, is it known when you first start seeing a phenotype in those mutants, the GA biosynthesis mutants? Because presumably, that takes you the time to go and look for the distribution of these transporters and their possible biological functions. Yeah, I mean, that's an excellent That's an excellent point. I mean, I'm not sure if this actually inducible lines with the GA biosynthesis. Well, you could start by looking at just the first time in development, the first time point after germination where the biosynthetic mutant starts showing great effect. I mean, of course, one could do induced design. And of course, one could do inducible line, but to rescue any mutant inducible, but it could start seeing. Yeah, that could be, yeah, that certainly could be something quite interesting to look at and quite kind of interesting to model as the as the as the develops and grows. Can I tell you what time in the world wants to sort of start looking first and do the model? Yeah, I mean there's kind of inducible mutants. I mean there's there's kind of inducible mutants where you start off with a synthesis mutant and then induce induce the synthesis. So that's some work from Alexander Jones's lab and I think then the weak growth restores within I think about 15 hours and so that gives us some idea of time scales but that's certainly something we could yeah would be kind of interesting to look at from a model. Okay we may have time for one short question. Is there any? Is there any? Angela. Angela? I could ask a quick question, Leia. I don't remember this work well, but when Richard Smith modelled the effect of GA in the root or hypocotyl growth of the seedling, there was this effect of geometry, cell geometry, on when the hormone signal was having its effect. That seems important. Seems important, you know. That seems one thing that you could find from your 3D, or you know, there would be a motivation for your 3D model, I guess. Have you thought about that, or is it? Am I on the wrong track? I think I'd have to go back and look at exactly what was in which is this work. But yeah, I mean, that sounds like an interesting, yeah, something interesting to look at further. It's not something I specifically thought of at the moment, but it's certainly something I'll I'll have a look at. I'll have a look at. Thank you very much again, Via. I know we can move on to the next speaker.
