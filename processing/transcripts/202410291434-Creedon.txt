Really, to kind of try to focus in on the historical context of this problem and then kind of build up to what our main theorem is. It's quite technical, so I'm probably going to spend most of the time just explaining what the result is supposed to mean, as well as how you're supposed to interpret it and how it kind of connects to some of the previous numerical computations that have been done for this problem. And then, if there's time, and maybe I'll do like a little poll about halfway through, we can decide whether you want to see some of the details of the proof. You want to see some of the details of the proof, or maybe we just ended a little early and you guys can grab some coffee. We'll see which way it goes, depending on how I'm feeling and how you're feeling. We'll kind of keep that open-ended. So, here's a picture that I'm sure you haven't seen before. I say this every time I give presentations on Stokes Waves, as a community, we really got to go out and get better pictures of these things. I mean, it's nice that we have this one because there's a reason we use it. It's very good, it's very illustrative of what we're talking about. Very illustrative of what we're talking about. But, you know, maybe at one of these future conferences, we can go out to a pond or a lake or the ocean or something and maybe get some better photos of these things. But anyway, these are the Stokes waves. They're the periodic traveling wave solutions of Euler's equations. They've been talked about extensively. Bernard talked about them extensively. They were talked about yesterday extensively. And really, for the purposes of our talk, the important thing that you have to remember here is that we're assuming very little variation in the direction perpendicular to propagation. In the direction perpendicular to propagation, which I will call that the transverse direction. So, in theory, there's very little variation that's happening there until we destroy it later with an instability. But for now, it is assumed to not have much variation. And of course, the work of Stokes Waves goes back to the pioneering work of Stokes. He was the first one to write down the expansions for these things. It was a really impactful result, especially given the timeframe was the 1840s that he was doing this stuff. But, like a lot of major scientific achievements, Like a lot of major scientific achievements, kind of was on the back burner for 120 years and there was very little follow-up work with it. There was some stuff later in the 19th century where Stokes followed up on his work and talked about the steepest wave. There was some stuff in the 1920s to make Stokes' arguments rigorous, but really had to wait to the 1960s before people picked back up on the Stokes wave. And really in the 1960s, the big question on everybody's mind was: are these solutions stable? And so the classic story, which, again, And so the classic story, which again, we've heard many times, so I'll give the abridged version of the story. I wasn't there, by the way. I know I've aged myself in this postdoc, I wasn't there. But what I've been told the story goes is there were laboratory experiments being done at the time by Benjamin and his student Fear. And they were looking at these, presumably, approximations to Stokes waves in these tank experiments. And after a certain amount of time, kind of unfolded as these waves traveled down the tank, they were losing their shapes. Losing their shapes, essentially. They were disintegrating into other things. And so that kind of tipped off Benjamin that, hey, maybe these things might not be as stable as we thought they were. And then a whole host of other mathematicians kind of got on that same wavelength. And by the end of the 1960s, we had a very clear picture that in sufficiently deep water, if you take a Stokes wave and you perturb it by some function that has nearly the same period as the Stokes wave itself, then you will get modulational instabilities, kind of like what this little schematic. Stability is kind of like what this little schematic is supposed to represent here. So, in other words, your Stokes wave goes from being nice and periodic to kind of having this modulated amplitude look, this sort of beat-like structure. At least for a short time until the nonlinear terms kick in, and then other things can happen. And we've kind of seen illustrations of what can happen in that case. So, that was the end of the 1960s. However, for as wonderful as all these results were in those times, the Lighthill paper, the Benjamin Fear paper, The Lighthill paper, the Benjamin Fear paper, Widem Zakarb, all those papers, for as pioneering as they were, they weren't rigorous. They were all formal in one way or another. Either assuming formal assumptions about the Hamiltonian of the problem or assuming some sort of expansions for the linear spectral problem, for the stability spectrum of these waves, but there were no rigorous results, no precise mathematical statements. And so we had to wait quite some time to actually get clear, rigorous results. Clear, rigorous results concerning the stability of Stokes waves. And in my opinion, these are probably the big six that we know of to date. That is just my opinion. You can take it with a grain of salt if you want, but I would say there's probably some consensus, at least with some of us in the room that are really familiar with these papers, that these are the super duper important results. And almost all of these results concern this picture right here on the left, which is basically a schematic of what we call the stability. A schematic of what we call the stability spectrum of Stokes waves. These are the collection of eigenvalues that you get when you linearize the full water wave equations about the Stokes wave solutions. It has a nice sort of quadrifold symmetry that's coming from the Hamiltonian nature of the problem. It's a continuous spectrum, which can be decomposed actually into a countably infinite spectrum using the flow k theory. But it is purely continuous if you don't add the flow k stuff in there. And of course, you can kind of see in the schematic that there are places. See in the schematic that there are places where eigenvalues enter that right-half complex plane, and what that's communicating is I can find perturbations that grow exponentially in time away from the Stokes wave solutions, kind of indicating that there is some sort of instability that's happening. And so Bernard talked at length about what's going on in this schematic plot. What we now know is at the origin, there's a figure eight curve there, and that corresponds to Benjamin-Fear instability or the modulational instability. And then there's stuff that's happening away from. That's happening away from the origin in this plot, these little bubbles of instability, that we now know correspond to the high-frequency instabilities. And pretty much every single one of these papers completes the rigorous theory of this picture. With exception to one, actually, this paper by Chen and Tzu is the only one that braves and dares to do a nonlinear stability result, which is very impressive. And for more of that, you can actually see that paper. But everybody else here is just doing spectral stability. Everybody else here is just doing spectral stability because that's hard enough. And so basically, we know everything there is to know about small amplitude Stokes wave stability. Or do we? There is something that's kind of a fundamental assumption in all of these results. They're all longitudinal. So in every single one of these papers, when you go to set up your theory, you were assuming that you were perturbing the Stokes wave in the direction of wave propagation, which is a natural place to start, because then all of your analysis. Start because then all of your analysis happens in a cross-section of the Stokes wave. So it's kind of like a 2D problem instead of doing the full 3D problem. We are going to be the first to remove this assumption and ask what happens if you perturb a Stokes wave perpendicular to the direction of propagation and not just in the direction of propagation. And we're going to do this basically for all depths, infinite and finite. So that's the core of our result. But before we get there, I have more pretty pictures to show you to kind of motivate this. Show you to kind of motivate this problem. Why would we care to do this? What's the importance of doing this? Well, it's because in the real world, when you look at waves, they're not just these nice little Stokes waves that have no variation in that transverse direction. It's very clear that you can have waves that have something going on in that direction. Albeit in this picture, it's kind of small, but I think this picture does a good job of illustrating that. And shout out to Mariana. I don't know if you're watching right now, but I shamelessly stole this from one of your talks at iSERM. Stole this from one of your talks at ICERM. And actually, Bjorn was asking if you took this in Providence. So maybe later you can answer that question. We wanted to know: is this your picture or is this somebody else's picture? Who took this picture? And maybe we need to get some other people to take some more pictures kind of similar to this. But in any case, this picture is meant to illustrate that there's interesting dynamics that are happening in that transverse direction. And so again, maybe it might be interesting to look at the instabilities that could potentially happen in that direction. So this is the rough setup of our problem. So, this is the rough setup of our problem. We're going to take x to be the longitudinal direction. That's the direction that the wave is going to be propagating. The transverse direction is going to be this y direction. That's the direction where we're going to apply our perturbations. And then z, of course, is going to be the depth variable. This might be the only times where I really show you this big picture. I'm not even going to write the full water wave equations, just because the major focus of what I'm going to do is the spectral problem that's associated with this. The spectral problem that's associated with this. So, I'm going to kind of flush over some details, but it's good to have this picture in the back of my mind. Now, before I sort of build up kind of the things that I've been working on with Walter and Hui about the transverse problem, it would be kind of remiss of me not to mention some of the numerical results that are out there already. And again, this could be a point of contention, so don't shoot the messenger here in this case. But in my opinion, probably the most impactful numerical result happened in the early 80s. Numerical result happened in the early 80s by McLean. And what Maclean managed to do was take a Stokes wave and perturb it by a function that has both a longitudinal and a transverse component. And I've shamelessly stolen a very important figure from one of his papers. And what you're looking at here on the x-axis is sort of the longitudinal wave number of the perturbation that he's applying, or the flow k exponent, if you want to use that terminology. And then on the x-axis. And what we're going to do. And what we're going to do is bring it up to this axis and start talking about what's happening here. We're not ready, by the way, for what's happening everywhere here. The analysis is not there yet. Unless you really, really love TDS expansions, maybe Italian group will figure out that problem next year. Who knows? They're very prolific, so we'll see. But that's where we're going to focus on. That's what our result is going to be concerned with. Can I find an interval of transverse wave numbers that generates an instability? So, with this picture in mind, So, with this picture in mind that sort of completes the theory of what we're talking about, let me tell you how we kind of set this proof up. So, the first step is you've got to get your Stokes waves, which here I'm using the notation eta star for my Stokes waves. This x is already in a traveling frame. So I'm already moving with the Stokes waves, so we're not going to worry about time. Everything is time independent at this point. And without loss of generality, you can always scale your problem to assume it's a 2π periodic Stokes wave, and we're going to set the amplitude. And we're going to set the amplitude, however, you define that. We usually define it as the first Fourier cosine mode, but you can define it however you want. We'll take that to be epsilon. And we're going to work in any finite depth, like I said. Finite depth, infinite depth, doesn't really matter. So that's our starting point. You grab those Stokes waves, and then you perturb them. And the conventional theory for how you perturb these Stokes waves is you assume that your perturbation has exponential time dependence. That's because you can kind of separate fairly. Dependence, that's because you can kind of separate variables. And then, traditionally, if you were doing the longitudinal problem, you would appeal to flow k theory. And flow k theory would tell you that your next little piece here would look something like e to the i mu x, and then something that depends on x. But here I want to isolate the transverse component and not worry so much about the flow k theory stuff. So, essentially, what we're going to do is we're going to set the flow k parameter to zero and add in a little bit of a transverse perturbation. And so, this parameter out. And so, this parameter alpha is going to be very important. It's basically the transverse wave number of my perturbation. So, you take this setup, you take this Stokes wave perturbation, and then you go ahead and you do your linearization process. You go through all these tedious calculations, which I'm going to spare you of today, since it's a lot of work. But what you will find at the end of all of this is a spectral problem. And the eigenvalues of that spectral problem are going to tell you about the exponential growth rate. Problem are going to tell you about the exponential growth rates of your perturbations. They're going to tell you about this lambda rather. And this linear operator, it's a 2 by 2 matrix integra differential operator. It's quite complicated, even though it is a linear operator over the function spaces it's acting over. It has incredibly non-linear dependence on the amplitude of the Stokes wave epsilon, as well as on the transverse wave number of the perturbation I'm applying to my Stokes wave. And in fact, it turns out that everywhere in this operator region, In this operator, where you see a transverse wave number, it's actually squared. This is due to the fact that hiding in this operator is a Diraclet and Neumann operator that's related to a Laplace equation. And all of the y derivative terms are second order. So you only get an alpha squared that shows R. And so to make things a little bit easier, we'll just go on to the next letter in the Greek alphabet and call alpha squared beta, just to make things a little bit easier when we get to the tedious expansion portion of our results. So you have this linear operator. So, you have this linear operator. It's, again, it's quite a complicated beast that you need to figure out. And really, the goal here is: can you find me some choices of a transverse wave number that guarantee that there are eigenvalues that have positive real part in the spectrum? That's the main ticket. That's the main goal. And so if you remember nothing else from this talk, here's the informal statement of our major result here. And it's actually pretty simple to state, but in a minute, I'm going to give you the technical statement, which is. In a minute, I'm going to give you the technical statement, which is a lot more than this. The big punchline is: you give me pretty much any finite depth you want, except a few isolated depths where unfortunately our perturbation calculations don't have such nice properties, and you have to do a higher order calculation. But for pretty much all finite depths, including infinite depth, what we can conclude is that there is an epsilon-dependent interval of transverse wave numbers. So there's not just one transverse wave number that's going to give you an instability, we're going to give you a whole Going to give you an instability. We're going to give you a whole interval. And if you think back to the Maclean picture, that should make sense because on that y-axis, there wasn't just one transverse wave number, there was a whole interval. And that interval depends on epsilon. And so that's what allows us to essentially conclude the transverse instability. Pick these transverse wave numbers in this epsilon-dependent interval, and I can guarantee you there's going to be an eigenvalue of a positive thread. Now, here's the technical mumbo-jumbo. It comes in three parts. It comes in three parts. Keeping with the theme of learning how to crawl before you walk or walk before you run, before you go off and solve this problem for a Stokes wave with amplitude of some sufficiently small quantity, you're going to start with the zero amplitude Stokes waves. And for that problem, everything's super duper nice. I can tell you the spectrum explicitly. It's just imaginary eigenvalues. But on that imaginary axis are special eigenvalues that are degenerate. Eigenvalues that are degenerate. There are multiple eigenvalues. In particular, there are double eigenvalues that you have to sort of worry about. And so the first part of the statement is: for pretty much all depths, when I set epsilon to zero, I can find a double eigenvalue on the imaginary axis. Now what happens is when I turn on the epsilon parameter, the eigenvalues that were on top of each other on this imaginary axis will peel off. And one of them will enter the right half complex form. And in fact, I can tell you even more. And in fact, I can tell you even more. I can give you an explicit or a semi-explicit formula for what those eigenvalues are that come off the imaginary axis. I say semi-explicit because, of course, they're written in terms of these functions, capital T and capital delta. These are some functions that are real analytic in the variables that you see here. And really, to understand and appreciate them, you have to get expansions for them. But we know that they exist. They are, they exist. And another important thing that I almost forgot to mention, and this is really important. Mention, and this is really important, and I can kind of almost see it in Bernard's face: is that not only are we expanding in epsilon, but I've introduced this other little parameter, little delta. So not only am I expanding in the amplitude, I'm also expanding the transverse wave number. Why is that so important? Well, if you choose not to expand the transverse wave number, if you just fix it to be whatever the zero order problem tells you it should be, the resonant value at that order. Be the resonant value at that order. What happens for most finite depths is that for sufficiently small epsilon, that transverse wave number is no longer in that small interval that's giving you your unstable eigenvalues. So in terms of a picture, I apologize for those that are at home right now, you can't see this, but maybe in the recording you'll be able to see this and kind of appreciate it. If this is my beta parameter and this is my epsilon parameter, when epsilon is zero, you might have a resonant beta value right here on this axis. Value right here on this axis, when you turn on epsilon, and from this point, you get a Hulk interval that comes out of this. But the problem with this problem is that this interval looks something like this. And if you fix your beta value like this, you're not in that interval that you need to be in. So it's super, duper, duper important for most of these problems, if you're ever going to try to tackle them theoretically, it's not just about the amplitude, also in your wave number. Also, in your wave number space, whatever that may be, whether it be longitudinal or transverse or both, you are going to need to expand in pretty much everything. You have to. And okay, so getting to the sort of the punchline here, the last part of this theorem concerns what happens when this capital delta function is positive, because at the end of the day, that's what's going to give me the positive real part. And in order to do that, what you have to do is choose that little delta parameter in a very smart way. Delta parameter in a very smart way. So you have to choose little delta so that for all sufficiently small epsilon, capital delta is positive. And so that begs the question, what's the right choice for the little delta? Well, it's right here. And it's kind of written in this cryptic form. So let me kind of unpack this form a little bit. What that form is really telling you is that, first of all, there's not just one singular delta, little delta, that's going to make capital delta here positive. That's gonna make capital delta here positive. There's in fact a whole small interval of little delta values that make capital delta positive. And it turns out that the midpoint of that interval goes like epsilon squared. That's what that first term is that you see here. And the second term is controlling the width of that interval. So what this statement is really saying is that this correct choice for little delta is a small interval that has a midpoint that drifts like order epsilon. Midpoint that drifts like order epsilon squared and whose sort of radius goes like order epsilon cubed, which is again in keeping with this picture right here. This drifts off like order epsilon squared. The width here is order epsilon cubed. So for all sufficiently small epsilon, again, that resonant beta value, not in the interval, you will not find it. You will only get stability if you do that. So that's the main statement of the theorem. To kind of bring some concreteness to this result. Concreteness to this result, and to give you a little bit of confidence that we sort of know what we're talking about, kind of. Let's actually take that little delta, maybe I should go back just one slide, take this little delta, plug it into capital Delta. Now you have an explicit representation for your eigenvalues that depend on basically two parameters. One is epsilon, of course. The other is this theta parameter right here, which is essentially a free variable that's just Which is essentially a free variable that's just constrained in some interval that's parameterizing your unstable eigenvalues. If you then take the real and imaginary parts of that exact expression and you do an expansion in epsilon, you can eliminate the theta variable from the real and imaginary parts. And what eliminates in the complex spectral plane? And so what I'm showing you in these pictures in the orange curves are what the theory predicts. Curves are what the theory predicts, or what the unstable eigenvalue should look like. The blue dots are numerical computations using a totally different method, using the Fouquet-Fourier-Hill method, to be exact. And you can see the agreement, no matter what sort of depth regime you're really looking at, and I could have added H infinity here if I no lazy plot, on all accounts. So, this gives a lot of confidence that previous numerical computations of the spectrum were on the right track here, and also we kind of have a sanity check. And also, we kind of have a sanity check on our result to make sure that we're, you know, being honest with some of the expansions that we had to do to get this result in the first place. Now, this is the critical moment in the talk where I have to decide whether it's worthwhile or not to give you some more of the details of this proof. But I'm guessing that, you know, if I wanted to let you guys go to coffee at the time that was on the schedule, maybe I should stop here. But this is a democratic process, so maybe I'll just go based off of. Maybe I'll just go based off of your faces and see that perhaps people want their coffee. So, what I think I'll do, if you're very interested in this, I'd be more than happy to. I'll be the dictator and give you two minutes. Two minutes. All right, so you're asking two minutes for a proof that took four and a half years? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. So, I'll just kind of wrap it up here because, to be quite honest with you, again, it is a proof that it was a long time in the making. That took a very long time in the making. A lot of mistakes were made, a lot of knowledge was gained, but unfortunately, I don't think two minutes would be a good amount of time for me to give you the full details of it. So if you're really interested and you're dying to know, happy to talk about it at the coffee break, or if you want to talk to me anytime during the remaining time I'm here, I'm happy to give you a little bit more. But thank you so much for being an excellent audience, and I'll entertain any questions you guys have. Thank you. Any questions? Yeah.
