And thank you so much for the organizers who have for inviting me. And so yeah, my talk will be shorter because initially it was scheduled for 20 minutes so that Oleg Gaspchuk, my graduate student, also had a slot. In fact, his talk was yesterday. And I will refer to his talk because some of the results His talk because some of the results that I mentioned are connected to what he presented. So, but let me start with some introduction. So, we start with an Hilbert space, separable, and with basis on H and then with a set F of unit vector, generic unit vector, right? And for every N, capital N, we consider the mixed set. We consider the mixed set formed with n vector of the set F and the rest of the vectors are from the Ritz basis. And we ask which assumptions on the vectors WJ ensures that the sets Fn, you know, the mixed sets. You should scroll down for the next slide. We see just the first. We see just the first screen. Really? That is. You can just scroll on the right. Yeah, I know. I'm scrolling, but oh. So, oh, okay, so I'm so sorry. It's always, you know, so frustrating when this. Apparently, you didn't share the correct file. There you are. Yeah, I think there's. Yeah, I think that may be okay. This looks different, so maybe this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that is the file I was looking at. Okay, so now back to what, okay, can you see it now? Now we see two files. Yeah, now we see the yellow. The yellow, but it's not the default? No. You need to. No. You need to change. I am really sorry. So I am really sorry. Now, let's see. So, what you see, like this, I mean, you see the right now, we just see the background. See the backgrounds, the background beautiful flowers. You see the flowers. Okay, what about now? Maybe, maybe. For some reason, okay, so let's try. Go to the next slide, Justin. Let's try again. Yeah, so now the next slide. Okay, that's okay. This will be obvious. Okay, can you see the next slide? Okay, can you see the next slide? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay, approve. Yeah, let's see. I don't know. I never had these problems before. I don't know what's happening. I think it's okay. So, is it working? Can you see the So, is it working? Can you see the slides? Yeah, I am not. Interestingly enough, I mean, I do all my teaching remotely, but I never had these problems. I've been sharing my screen. I'm so really sorry for these hiccups. So, anyway, where was I? Yeah, so back to the problem that you might not have seen. So, we consider it's Uh so we consider a Ritz basis and a set of uh generic unit vectors with no assumption on the WJ except that they are unit unitary. So we consider the mixed set made with n vectors of the set F and then the rest of the vectors from the basis. And the question is which assumptions on the set F of the generic vector ensure Of the generic vector ensures that the Fn and the set F itself are a Ritz basis of H. So the definition of Ritz basis, as everybody knows, is one of the many definitions is that it is a minimal frame. So there are constants a m B greater than zero for which the frame inequality holds for all the vectors H and the set new. And the set new ceases to be a frame if one of the vectors is removed. So that is one of the many possible definitions of RITS basis. So the replacement process, I use this word waving in the title because when my co-author and I submitted this paper, we learned that this process of replacement had been already described in a paper by Benrose, Cassatz, Agroni. By Benrose, Cassatz, Gronik, Lammers, and Lynch. That was titled Waving Frames. So they used this term waving to indicate a mixture of a mixed set formed with two frames. The problem of mixing frames and then determining conditions for which the mixed set is a frame, is again a frame, it is motivated by problems in signal. Problems in signal theory. So, for example, if a signal X is measured by two sets of numbers, one that comes from a frame V and another set that comes from a frame W, say, and both sets allow recovery of the signal. So, can we like recover the signal if some of the data that come from frame one is replaced by data that come from frame two? And so that is a And so that is a very nice problem and there are a lot of cases in the paper that you just cited. However, our problem is different because our set F is not necessarily complete. In fact, our main goal is to find conditions that ensure that the set F, the set of the generic vector, it is at its basis. So in fact, we have So, in fact, we have this main theorem here with my collaborator Julian Edward. So, we consider its basis of H and a set of unit vector F and we consider the mixed set, like I said before. So, then the set F is at its basis if the maximum omega values of the Grammy matrices formed with the inner product of the WEWJ's. The WEWJs are bounded above by a positive constant independent of n, and the minimum singular values of the matrix formed with the products of the WE and the VJ, you know, this elements of the bona fide basis, are bounded below by a positive constant independent of n. So if these two conditions are met, then the set F is at its basis itself. Is at its basis itself. So the remark, so let's remark. So here is the theorem again. Let's remark that the FNs, so the mixed sets, that is well known, I mean it is in various places in the literature, that Fn is at its basis if and only if the matrix Mn, the matrix below here, is non-singular. And also another interesting And also another interesting thing to remark is that we consider conditions on the finite Gramian matrices UN, but the invertibility of the infinite Gramian matrix with all the inner products that itself doesn't guarantee the completeness of the set F, but it guarantees F being a real sequence, but it is not enough to st to guarantee that it is also a frame. It is also a frame. So now I'm changing design here because I'm kind of slightly changing the problem. So this paper actually was, you know, took finite form two years ago in 2020. But in reality, we have been, I mean, been thinking for a little bit longer than that about this problem. And one of the examples we, Julian and I, Examples we, Julian, and I found of applications of our theorem was with piecewise weight on a RITS basis. But that gave origin to a more general problem that, in fact, I discussed with Oleg and we decided to dig into it for more because it seems really interesting. Because it seems really interesting. So, the problem is the following: this is an abstract setting. So, considering we consider a Hilbert space, say L2D, where D is a set, but it can be also an abstract space, like I will say later. And we consider an orthogonal projection P from H to H. And so, the question is whether we can find arbitrary constants, say i and bi. Ai and Bi, which are complex constants, for which the set Ai P of the vector Vi plus Bi times the complementary projection I minus P of Vi, it is still at its basis or frame for the Hilbert space. So, in other words, instead of scaling the vectors of the frame, we kind of take two projections, you know, the two are Take two projections, you know, the two orthogonal projections P and one minus P, and we scale each with different constants. So this problem of scaling frames, it is well-known problems, even though there is not too much literature on the infinite-dimensional case. In fact, I cited here a very interesting paper by Ben Hadcock, who is in this conference. Who is in this conference and Milena Gataric and Hansen? I don't remember his name. So, anyway, it is about scaling a set of exponential functions and finding appropriate constants so that it will be, you know, with an appropriate density, so that it will become a frame. So, that paper was, it's quite interesting, but, and, you know, if you find if you know of other papers about scaling a space. Papers about scaling, especially scaling with non-constant weight, please let me know because I wasn't able to find anything really in the literature. So the piecewise scaling in particular, you know, it is what interested us especially because as Oleg mentioned yesterday, scaling a basis, an exponential basis in particular And exponential basis in particular with piecewise constant weights, it is related to the problem of finding frames or bases of exponentials on disconnected domains. So that is specifically, I mean, by if we consider a basis of exponentials on a connected domain and we are You know, we disconnect it, we apply like translation to different pieces. Then the basis gets translated into a basis scaled with a constant that depends on the domain. And that forms a basis on the new piecewise domain and the new disconnected domain and vice versa. So, you know, the two problems are connected and that was very interesting for us. For us. So, in fact, with Julian, with my colleague Julian Edward, we proved, you know, a few years ago, before in fact, I started working with Oleg, we proved the following result. So we considered like this projection, the L2 of the interval minus 1, 1 into the L2 of minus 1/2 0, which is just the restriction. Which is just the restriction of a function to the minus one half zero. And then one minus p, of course, is the restriction on the other half interval, right? So we consider two sets of constants, alpha n and beta n, which are complex constants, that satisfy alpha n squared plus beta n squared equals to one. That is just for convenience, it's not a serious, a terribly serious assumption. So this set we proved. So this set, we proved that the set alpha n times the projection of the exponential, standard exponential function c to the 2 pi i n x, you know, the Fourier basis on the interval minus one half, one half, plus the beta n times one minus p of the um exponential function. It is at its basis it is still at its basis on the whole interval, minus one half, one half. minus one half one half if and only I mean if no sorry not if and only if if just if there exists a delta greater than zero for which either the real part of the product of alpha n and beta n the conjugate is greater than delta or the inf or the infimum of the imaginary value the imaginary part of alpha n beta n conjugate is greater than delta so that in other Greater than delta. So that, in other words, we want the product of the constants alpha n and b n conjugate to stay away from zero, right? Either from on its real part, the real part or the imaginary part. Right? Because of course, if it gets too close to zero, then one of the projections might become irrelevant, and that is not what we want. So, and we proved this result using our. This result using our theorem, but you know, using actually the result that are in the preprint of Oleg and my other student, Vladimir Dresdel, who is actually still an undergraduate, by the way. We can also prove the following result. So, if we consider, you know, these are So if we consider, you know, these are like special cases of the weights I showed, the constants I showed before, you know, sine Tn and cosine Tn are, of course, you know, the square of the norm of the two is one. And then there are two exponential functions, e to the two pi in A and e to the two pi in B. So this set, you know, This set, you know, weighted with these weights is at its basis on L2 minus one half, one half if there exists a delta greater than zero for which the sine of two tn times the cosine of two pi a plus bn is greater than delta. And that will be the real part of the product of the constant that multiply each projection or the other. Or the other inequality comes from the imaginary parts. We want the imag either the real part or the imaginary part that needs to be away from zero. But the part B is interesting. So the set, the weighted set with sine at n on the characteristic function of the interval that I sketch a little picture above that goes from minus a minus goes from minus a, minus a half to minus a. And then the cosine of tn on the other interval, you know, the separated, on the other interval formed by splitting the interval minus one half, one half, it is at its basis on L2 of the split interval if these two conditions hold. So that is not, of course, that is like a sample model, you know, it's It's an example of what we can do with this technology. And of course, our goal is to extend this result to weighted split domain, considering that there is very little in terms of basis, explicit basis, for example, on split intervals or on other set of or other split domains. You know, split domains. Okay, so let's see how much time I have, considering that I wasted some precious time by trying to figure out how to share my screen. So, I wanted to talk briefly about another problem that has to do with piecewise splits, piecewise scaling, and that has to do with finite frame. Finite frames in a REN. So, of course, a Percival frame is a frame for which the frame inequalities hold with A and B equals to 1. One of the an important problem in finite frame theory is to make a frame scalable, that is, is to see when a frame is scalable, that is, when there exists a constant such that by Such that by dilating the vectors of the frame, we can turn it into a parsable frame. Having a parsable frame is very important in the application, and if a frame is not parsable on its own merit, then the next best thing is to see whether we can make it parsable by a non-invasive, you know, like by dilating the vectors. Unfortunately, frames, scalable frames, are very difficult to come by. Here I've cited a paper by Gita Kutni of Caspian. Paper by Gita Kut, Neov Casso, Codyu, and other authors. And so, you know, the scaling frames might be oftentimes pretty difficult or impossible. So, in a paper with, in still paper with Cassatza and Pet Cassatsa and Tintran, we defined what is a piecewise. We defined what is a piecewise scalable frame. So we consider again it's the same definition I gave before. We consider a projection, but this time is from a rand to a ren. That's our Hilbert space. And different sets of constants Ai and Bi such that Ai times the projection of the vectors of the frame plus Bi times the other projection forms a passable frame for a Ren. So having some flexibility, I mean like having to differentiate mean like having two different projections that can alter the vectors of the frame. Of course it has tremendous advantage. Here is a theorem, you know, unitary transformation preserves scalable frames and you know in our preprint we gave a number of properties of this transformation. But I'm kind of skipping because you know my time is almost over. So let me tell you what is the punchline of our you know what is our main Our, you know, what is the main result of our investigation? So frames in R2 are always piecewise scalable, and that's not true for the regular scaling, because if the frame, for example, two vectors that are not orthogonal cannot be scaled in any possible way in R2. Frames in R3 are always piecewise scalable, too, and that is also kind of super. And that is also, that was kind of surprising for us. So we thought that also maybe also in R4 that will be true, but then we turn it out that is not non-true. And in fact, we found one example of non, you know, like a sufficient condition for a set of four vectors to be piecewise scalable, but that turned out not to be just sufficient. you know just just sufficient right and and then we proved that in dimension n greater or equal to to four so there are there is actually a very strong criterion that says when frames are not when a frame is not scalable that is the vectors cannot be too close to one another so if the vectors are the difference of any two vectors of the frame Difference of any two vectors of the frame is less than one over 64, then the frame is non-piecewise scalable with any projection of rank between 2 and n minus 2. So that doesn't quite settle the matter because we cannot say anything about projections of rank n minus one, for example. We don't know what's going on there and we are still working on it. There and we are still working on it. We are also talking about generalizing this investigation to consider more projections, more than two projections, but that is still a work in progress, idea still in the making. Anyway, for today, I'm stopping here and again. I apologize for the technical, you know, for the clumsiness with my sharing of the slides. Thank you. Any quick question from here or from the Zoom people? The Zoom people? No questions? So thank you again. Thank you. We will resume almost immediately.
