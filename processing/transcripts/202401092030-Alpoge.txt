All right, so I guess we can get started. First speaker today is Levantal Pozzi. He's going to talk about the average size of the two-Selmer group in the families y squared because x cubed plus something. He's going to count. Yes. Is this too loud? I don't know. Seems okay to people. Okay, cool. I will try to not speak too loud because it sounds kind of overwhelmingly loud to me. So, okay. Oh. Loud to me. So, okay. Oh, okay. That's better. Okay. Okay. So today I'm going to talk about the average size of the two Soma group of these kinds of curves. I just wanted to say, for me, it's an enormous honor to be invited or come to Chennai because actually my best friend's family is Tamilian. And this means that I know, for example, lots of nonsense words in Tamil. And instead of kind of listing them off, yeah, well, anyway, I will just. Yeah, well, anyway, I will just get to the math. So, um, uh, so I'm going to be talking about uh this average, and yeah, this is. I was trying to kind of think about what should I speak about. I don't want to kind of bore people who have already seen maybe some other talks. And in fact, I chose maybe the talk that would have been seen the most times by people in the audience, because this actually will be roughly a talk that people might have seen already. But anyway, this is the version of the way I wanted to get. Anyway, this is the version of the way I wanted to give the talk from the beginning. I'll explain why. So I yeah, so here's the theorem. This is really a talk about the cases. Okay, so like this. Let K be an integer, then the average size of the two Selma groups in the families, in these families, is given as follows. Is given as follows. Actually, this is really a talk about the cases like k equals 1, 2, 4, and 5. I hope I didn't screw up the other cases, but anyway, 2 of k is 0 mod 6. Okay, so first off, this is like a lie by telling the truth. I wrote this average. Here's the family of elliptic curves, y squared equals x cube plus b to the k. And I said, for all, you know, k and z, really, this only depends on k mod 6. Okay, so anyway, when k is 0 mod 6, Okay, so anyway, when k is zero mod six, this is just one curve. Let's say b is non-zero. If I remember right, it's like infinity when k is three mod six. But anyway, it's a quadratic twist family and has already been studied in those cases. And then in the other cases, k not congruent to zero mod three, the average is three. And this has the usual meaning, meaning, well, I'll just write it like this: be up to some x. To some x, you know, zero, and then this is this, this average is this plus little o1 as x goes to infinity. The little o1 is really small already. Okay. So the tool, the principal tool, I think is kind of appropriate for this conference. The principal tool will be the circle method for quadrics. The circle method for quadrics, and it'll be a very easy version of the circle method for quadrics, but anyway, um, yeah, so I'm gonna skip K is zero mod three. Um, for K is one mod six, this was at least the upper bound was treated in work of Sam Ruth in his PhD thesis. For K is two mod six, this was used in recent joint work with between myself, uh, Between myself, Manjubhargava, and Ari Schnidman, on sums of two rational cubes, like the proportion of integers, or how many integers are or are not the sum of two rational cubes. And yeah, this is, I'm going to kind of reduce to those two cases. This is the, it's like a little bit of a funny little bit of trickery that I'm going to talk about. Okay, but anyway, to get to that point, I'm going to set up the set the Set the stage. So here's the theorem Burton Swinnerton Dyer. Okay, so let AB the integers such that delta AB, which is minus 4a cubed minus 27 squared, is non-zero. Is non-zero. Then, so this is a talk about the two-somme group of elliptic curves. Birch and Swinnerton Dyer, actually, I may have forgotten history, but anyway, in trying to compute, in trying to see something about ranks of elliptic curves, so to speak, on average, or at least get some statistics about ranks of certain elliptic curves within a family, they were led to try to figure out how to actually, on a computer, especially. On a computer, especially a computer with the computational power of those days, to actually compute, for example, the size of the two-sommer group, to try to approximate the rank in some way. And they came up with this bijection. So this is in bijection with PGL2Q equivalence classes of binary quartic forms. So I'm going to write something that is going to look strange, but anyway, sim4 of 2 of Q. So this. Of two of Q. So this is binary quartic forms. This is, I'll explain what that is. Okay, such that they're everywhere locally soluble. And they're two invariants. I'll explain what I mean by this. But I is A and J is B. And actually, this is where I'm going to say I'm ignoring absolute constants for the entire talk. So like I is actually like. Talk. So, like, I is actually like minus 3a, and j is like minus 27b or something in this case. But anyway, these I'm just going to ignore all constants. So, um, don't take the equalities I write down too seriously. You may have to modify them by factors of like two and three. Okay, um, yeah, so this is the kind of bijection. And what does it mean for f to be in sim4 of two? I mean, the notation is maybe self-explanatory. Um, you know, that you take a two-dimensional vector. You know, you take a two-dimensional vector space, take its symmetric fourth power. That's kind of giving, or at least the dual of that, that's kind of giving binary quartic forms. So that means that f is of the form, f of xy is ax to the 4 plus bx cubed y plus cx squared. I'll maybe I'll read it out, whatever, cx squared y squared dxy cubed, ey4. Okay, so what it means to give a binary quartic form with rational coefficients is just to give five rational numbers, A, B, C, D, and E. And these I and J, I'll use this board. No, I'll just stick it into the corner. Okay, if you take this space, sim4 of two, so to speak, let's just say C, and you mod out by the action of out by the action of SL2C and you take the kind of polynomial ring. I'm being a little bit, yeah, okay. You take this space and you take the invariance under SL2C, you get a polynomial ring and two polynomials, so polynomials of A through E. And I'll give you an example of one of them. So example. So in other words, these are the generators. These are the generators for the ring of invariance, invariance meaning polynomial combinations of A through E that are invariant under changes of variables by SL2, the ring of invariance for SL2. So for example, the I invariant of Ax to the fourth plus dot plus EY to the fourth is 12AE minus 3BD plus C squared. And so if you go and you pick your favorite element of Go and you pick your favorite element of SL2. And I guess I should write down precisely what the action is, for example. Let's say G in SL2 acts on the space, acts on an F in sim4 of two, by G dot F is the binary quartic whose values are take the row vector x, y, and apply g on the right. Okay, so if you go and you take your favorite element. Okay, so if you go and you take your favorite element of SL2, I'm claiming that you write down 12AE minus 3BD plus C squared, and then you do this change of variables and you write down 12A tilde, E tilde, et cetera, you'll get the same value. Okay. Okay, so that kind of sets up. Oh, yeah. And I wanted to say one more thing. Should have blended the board space a little more intelligently, but I'm going to write in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer bijection. This was already observed by Mordell. I don't actually know if he ever wrote down an explicit formula, but anyway, already observed by Mordell. If you take, let's call this curve EAB. So this is EAB. If you take EAB of Q mod 2, well, that's supposed to have a map to the two-solmer group. What is the map expressed in terms of binary quartics in terms of this explicit stuff? The map is as follows. If you take a point little x, little y, it produces the PGL2 equivalence class of the following binary quartic form. Capital X, maybe I'll call the point AB. I don't know, just for because it's easier to see on the board. Just because it's easier to see on the board. I'll call x little x little y and I'll put capitals. Okay, capital x to the fourth minus six little x times y squared plus eight little y times xy cubed plus minus four a minus three x squared times y to the fourth. So this is, it's really the PGL2. So mod. So, mod. It's really the PGL2 equivalence class of this, but anyway, this is a binary quartic form. Oops, that doesn't, that arrow doesn't make sense. This is a binary quartic form with the kind of claimed invariance up to factors of 3 and 27 and minus 1. Okay, so that's a kind of magical map, but nice. And let me observe that if x and y, maybe not over q, because Maybe not over Q, because maybe the chances of finding an integral point aren't great, but suppose you're over like QP, for example, and X and Y are chaotically integral, then you've produced a chaotically integral binary quartic form. And that's going to be relevant in a little bit. So I'm just pointing that out now. Piadically integral in the sense that it has piadically integral coefficients. Anyway. Okay, so this bijection is relevant, and there's another bijection. And there's another bijection which is relevant, which in this case is the theorem of Bhargava. You know, I know the pronunciation, and it comes out the way I used to pronounce it when I was in college. But anyway, and Weiho. So the theorem is as follows. It's the same sort of theorem. Let A2 and A6 be integers such that, oh man. Such that, oh man, the discriminant such that the relevant, I'm not going to try to write it, so the relevant discriminant is non-zero. Then, actually, yeah, then the two-summer group of y squared plus a2 xy plus a6y equals x cubed over q. This thing is in bijection. This thing is in bijection with the following. So I'm just going to kind of lazily write G as SL2 squared mod a diagonal mu2, diagonally embedded mu2. And I'll show you what kind of G actually is. But it's in bijection with G of Q equivalence classes of elements in, okay, again, weird notation. I'll explain what this notation is, but okay, again, if you imagine taking the dual of a two-dimensional vector space, taking a symmetric third power, I wrote a subscript, ignore it for a second. Then you get a binary cubic form, tensor with a two-dimensional vector space. You get a pair of binary cubic forms, you can imagine. And there's an SL2 squared acting. It's acting, so to speak, on both the twos, each SL2. Each SL2 is acting on each two or whatever. Anyway, so a pair of binary cubic forms, but I'll write it more explicitly, such that, okay, something is locally soluble. That's the analog of this thing, which I wrote here, which I'm going to explain both of them at once. And okay, so in this case, there are two polynomial invariants. I don't think I want to write either of them, but I can, I'll write A2 maybe, or to be explicit. But anyway, A2. A2, well, okay, bad naming, but whatever. Such that the polynomial invariance, the explicit polynomial invariance, which you can write down in the same way I wrote down I, and in principle, you could write down J. Anyway, those explicit polynomial invariants of this pair of binary cubic forms agree with these coefficients. And again, there's some constants. I think in this, I don't remember actually off the top of my head what they. This, I don't remember actually off the top of my head what they would be in this case, but let's act like two and three, like physicists. Let's act like two and three equal one. Um, so anyway, okay, I need to tell you what locally soluble means. Yes, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you, thank you. Sorry, I almost forgot. So, um, uh, V is in, wait, this is the board planning. Uh, maybe I'll put it there. Yeah, yeah. Uh, so V. V in two tensor sim3 of two, let's say of q means that so v is a pair v1 comma v2 and the vi are binary cubic forms. So they're of the form a, I don't know, I'll call it a i, a i x cubed, b i x squared y c i x y. Ci xy squared, di y cubed. So to give an element of this strange notation is to give eight rational numbers, in this case, because I evaluated on q, it's to give eight rational numbers. Yeah, so binary cubic form, two binary cubic forms, binary cubic, meaning binary in two variables. And I'm sorry that I capitalized x. Let's do it like this. Like this in two variables, cubic meaning cubic polynomial, form meaning homogeneous. Okay, and the reason I wrote sim lower three is actually, so to speak, threes in notation. So I mean, you know, over Q, it's meaningless. It's just a small change of coordinates. But if I were to write like Z here, then that would mean that there are threes in, so to speak. That the B's and C's are divisible by three. So that's selling. C's are divisible by 3. So that's telling you something about the integral structure that I'm implicitly imposing. Yes, so that's what an element of this space is. G is SL2 squared acting by, well, you can replace a pair of binary cubic forms by taking a linear combination in each slot. Okay, so that's one way an SL2 could in principle act. And then another way an SL2 could act is by change of variables in the X and Y. Change of variables in the X and Y. So, in principle, you could act on the outside. This is by like, you know, replacing V2 by V1 plus V2. So, that's like an action by a unipotent on the outside. And then, and you could act on the inside by another SL2 by changing X and Y with a formula like this. So, again, SL2 acts in both ways. So, you get an SL2 squared action. It so happens that the diagonally embedded minus one acts trivially. Okay, that's. Minus one x trivially, okay, that's why SL2 squared mod mu2. And then if you take the ring of invariants in the same way, so to speak, over c, you get two polynomial invariants, two explicit ones, a2 and a6, that have no relation between them. So you get a polynomial ring. Okay, that's what I want to say, I think. Oh, yeah, and there's a, there's like, so to speak, Kuber map. And I'm going to write it in an ugly way. Yeah, ignoring kind of inner. Uh, yeah, ignoring kind of integrality just because it's much like really easy to write down. So the Kubernetes map is as false. Let's say I have x and y. Oh, yeah, maybe I'll. Okay, so it's this is not even, it's like calling it a corollary is a strange thing to do. But anyway, let I'm just going to specialize to A2 equals zero. Oh, yeah, maybe I'll say it like this. So I want this to be relevant. Want this to be relevant to this problem. So, for example, now I'm going to step back and look at this bijection. What does this buy me for that problem? So, for example, I mean, it buys me parametrizations actually in every family, in every case. So, you know, there are cases. The cases to consider that I will consider in this talk are K is, well, let me just do K equals one, two, four, and five. So it buys me a parameterization in every case. So it buys me a parameterization in every case. Maybe, you know, maybe it's impossible to work with kind of to compute averages, but anyway, it buys me a parameterization in every case. For example, when k is 1, it tells me that I just need to go and look for binary quartic forms which have a equals 0, or in other words, which have this, so to speak, a equals 0, meaning binary quartic forms where this I invariant vanishes. Okay. If I took k equals 4, then I would have to go and Equals four, then I would have to go and maybe look for binary quadratic forms where not only does this I invariant vanish on them, so not only is this combination of A3E zero, but also somehow I have to be able to tell, is J a fourth power? And you can imagine that's not like the kind of easiest thing to do analytically. But whatever. I mean, it gives me a parameterization. And so, for example, when k is 2, yeah, I mean, you could try to directly imagine counting. Imagine counting directly. I'll get to what it means to count because I've only talked about things over the rational numbers, but you can imagine trying to count directly when k is 2, you're trying to count those binary quartic forms where i equals 0. That's good. That's a quadric and five variables, easy peasy. But also, j is a square. I don't know how to do that. So, yeah, that looks bad. So, maybe go find another parameterization. Here's another parameterization, which is conveniently written. Another parameterization which is conveniently written on the board. Well, let's look at this. So, pairs of whatever this is, it's not so bad. Pairs of binary cubics, at least something explicit. It's like eight coefficients, two pairs of a through d's. And you have to find those with, well, I took k equals two. Okay, so here, if I had a2 equals zero, I could complete the square and I get something of the form y squared equals x cubed plus a6 squared over four. A6 squared over 4, but I'm ignoring constants. Anyway, so you get y squared equals x cubed plus a square, and that square is kind of allowed to vary freely. So look, wow, I wrote down this parameterization, and it happens to be the one that looks much better for the purposes of analog number theory for the case k equals 2. So that means I'm going to specialize this, and I'm going to kind of explain. But anyway, let me specialize this to a2 equals 0 for that reason. Specialize this to a2 equals 0 for that reason. So a6 is free, a2 I'm going to force to be 0. So then, just to be maximally explicit, so y squared equals x cubed plus a6 squared over 4, I completed the square with the constant, right? Is in bijection with rational orbits of rational pairs. Weird notation. Actually, I'm going to call this one. Actually, I'm going to call this one V, okay? So V of Q. I'm not going to call this one V, don't worry. But anyway, so V and V of Q such that eight locally soluble, I'm going to explain what this means still, but A2 of V is zero, and A6 of V is our given A6. Okay, so like, yeah, in the, okay, uh. In the, okay, just so it's kind of, yeah, we're setting one variant equal to zero, but then there's no condition kind of on the other invariant because we're averaging. So it's like, for example, if I wanted to compute the average size of this, that means that will mean that I will have to look for pairs of binary cortex elements here where A2 vanishes, but then because I'm averaging, there's not really going to be a condition on A6 besides some kind of bound rather than an inequality. Inequality. Okay. So, no, I did it wrong again. I want to write the Kubernetes here, but I'm just going to erase the theorem because the average is three in all the cases being considered. I knew where this was. Did I forget? Is it here? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Okay, so the A, I mean, this is like a bad version of the Kumarat, but anyway, so if I have X Y in, for example, I'm keeping this notation in this elliptic curve. So I'm supposed to tell you, you know, where the globally, so to speak, globally soluble classes, the classes that actually come from points go under this. Go under this bijection. So they're supposed to go to G of Q orbits of some pair of binary cubic forms. And it's like, so I'm going to write mod G of Q here. But anyway, here's the pair. Look, I'm even being careful about constants. Something like this: 2y minus A3 inverse. Here's this pair. 0 minus x probably comes first. Now y comes first. y minus a3 over 2 x 0. Yeah, something like that. Okay, so this is a pair of binary cubic forms that has, I didn't tell you what A2 and A6 are, so I could have written almost anything, but anyway, it happens to have the right invariance. And yeah, I mean, the way I set it up, it's not. Yeah, I mean, the way I set it up, it's not obviously piatically integral when the x and y are piadically integral, but that's okay. It'll be okay. Okay, so I want to say, ah yeah, yeah. Yeah, in this talk, I'm getting maybe more into the basics of the kind of counting method. Of the kind of counting method in arithmetic statistics, because actually you'll see that the k equals four and k equals five cases, I'm going to reduce to k equals one and k equals two by like a little bit of tricks, kind of not really difficult tricks, but anyway, you'll see kind of how I reduce it. So that's why you're seeing maybe more of the like there exists an integral representative. So this is what the lemma is going to say. If let's say v is in v of q and actually Actually, let me get to that in a second. I want to define local solubility finally. So, what is local solubility? Or everywhere local solubility. So, if I have F and SIM42, let's just say if Q. So let, I'll just write definition. Then F is locally soluble. F is locally soluble at P. That's a good way of writing it. F is locally soluble if and only if z squared equals f of xy has a qp point. I mean, after all, this is what the two-sommer group is parametrizing. It's parametrizing two, so to speak, two covers of these elliptic curves, which are of the form z squared equals f of xy for f a binary quartic. And so, F a binary quartic. And so, yeah, you may go and count the binary quartic by forgetting the fact that it came from an equation of this type, but local solubility means at P, so means that this curve as a QP point, this genus one curve with Jacobian, this, except for the factors, the constants that I've heard. Yeah, this is definition. Yeah. Sorry, this word is supposed to be def. Yeah. And then def. Yeah. And then definition let V and V of U P then V is locally soluble if and only if okay, if and only if I'm I'm going to produce by some magic a binary cortic attached to a pair of binary cube. A pair of binary cubics. So there's a constant that I'm writing down for some reason, but anyway, there's a constant. But basically, you take the discriminant of the, well, anyway, you take a discriminant. This discriminant is locally soluble. Okay, so if I have a pair of binary cubics, here's one way to get a maybe at the moment, a non-invariant way a priori. A non-invariant way a priori of getting a quartic polynomial out of here's a way of just getting something that's quartic in the coefficients of like V1 out of a binary cubic. You can take its discriminant. So V1 is like A through D, Ax cubed plus da da da. And the discriminant of a cubic form, cubic polynomial is quartic in the coefficients. But okay, that's not going to be invariant when I like replace V1 by V1 plus V2. But if I take a linear combination, But if I take a linear combination, this linear combination, a generic linear combination of V1 and V2, and take its discriminant, then when I replace V1 by V1 plus V2, for example, I'm moving the linear combination. I'm changing variables on the inside, so to speak, of the binary quartic form. If I change variables on the outside of the VIs, if I change variables on the inside of the VIs, then that doesn't move the discriminant. So if I just took the discriminant of V1, Took the discriminant of v1 that was that's like kind of invariant, it's invariant by one of the sl2s, but not both of them, because the discriminant is an invariant under changing variables inside of a form. But yeah, that's a way of producing and kind of I don't know what to call it, the invariant binary quartic form. There's a minus one over 27 that's related to the fact that threes are in to keep things integral. But anyway, this is the definition of. This is the definition of local solubility. Okay. Oh, yeah. So now I want to say dilemma. Not erase this. I will erase this. Oh, wait. I'll leave that up still. Okay, the lemma is: I've, you know, there was a binary quartic form that was pi-adically integral there, I promise. Anyway, the lemma is that, so let, for example, let's do it for F first. So let F be a binary quartic such that let's just say I and J. Let's just say i and j again, I'm ignoring constants, but whatever, are integers and locally soluble. Then, so a priori f has rational coefficients. Yeah, let me step back as I'm stating the lemma. How could you possibly imagine using just these bijections, counting anything? Because you're trying to count rational orbits in a rational vector space. You know, you need some integral structure to. You know, you need some integral structure to say, like, I'm going to try to count things of bounded size. And anyway, this is how you count things: you produce, so to speak, integral representatives in the rational orbit. So then there exists a G in this case, PGL2. I didn't give the action of PGL2, but anyway, in PGL2Q, such that G applied to F, which I did define earlier, is integer. Is integer, integral. And so then, so then to compute something like the number of elements in the two-summer group, just writing kind of informally, just have to compute, just got to compute like the number of Let's say g of, well, g of z orbits, so pgl2z, let me just do sl2z. SL2z orbits of f's that are locally soluble of integral f's. Sorry, this was supposed to be informal, and somehow the notation is getting really long. Informal, sorry, locally soluble f's with i is a and j is b. And J is B weighted by something like the number of SL2Z orbits in the PGL2Q orbit intersect VZ, or sorry, in intersect the integral binary cortex. I don't know if that made sense, but kind of this. I don't know if that made sense, but kind of this is converted. The fact that there is some integral element in the orbit converts the problem of counting the rational orbits into a problem of counting integral orbits with some weight. Because, yeah, you may overcount. There may be like 100 integral. It so happens that you're going to be able to count SL2Z orbits, not PGL2Q orbits, a priori. But anyway, there may be like 100 SL2Z orbits that in the PGL2Q orbit. In the PGL2Q orbit that intersect the integral points, but that's fine, that's just like some function you have to wait by. Turns out to be an okay function. Okay, so that's this is like also classical, but um I'm gonna show you a method of proof exactly, exactly, yeah, yeah, exactly. So, this is really a local local statement. The class number is one, the class group vanishes, and therefore, yeah, you may. Yeah, you may as well do it over at P. And you can even ignore. I mean, I write, so this is okay. I write integral, but I don't care if there's like a little bounded denominator because it's kind of the same, the same kind of counting setup. I just need to work on some lattice to be able to count. And then I can change the weighting and impose some congruence conditions mod that denominator. So actually, if I said like bounded denominator. Said, like, bounded denominator, bounded denominator here, which I will in a second, then it's even easier. You don't even have to worry about small primes. So you could just say, I only care about primes larger than 10 trillion. And then for those, what am I going to do? So, okay, let me write this down. But yeah, exactly. And hint, that's why I wrote these Kumar maps down. So or proof sketch, whatever. Proof is by, so class number, the class group of class group. The class number is one. And so to produce such a G. Such a G suffices. So this this proof certainly exists in Bartlow. So to produce such a G, it suffices to produce just an idyllic class because look, I mean, if you get it wrong, you know, to produce a rational G, you're going to try to approximate the idyllic class. You're going to get it wrong by elements of GZP. That doesn't change the integrality, so that's okay. So it suffices. So that's okay. So it suffices to produce GP in GQP, oops, in this case PGL2 QP such that GPF is pi-adically integral. And actually, because I wrote bounded denominator, so it suffices to produce for p larger than a constant, essentially this is bounded periodically integral. There's something you have to say when p is bounded. To say when p is bounded, when p is smaller than this 10 trillion constant that I chose. But anyway, it's easy. Okay, and then local solubility means what? It means that I guess I should write this, but anyway, local solubility at the at no, now we pick a prime. Let's call it P. So now, because F is locally soluble at this P. This has a QP point. So, actually, this is coming at least locally from one of these Kumar classes that I wrote down before. So, local solubility means F, already we know F is FXY. Let me write it like this: F is in the image, or GQP, F, just to remind you, is in the image. Of the Kumar, the local Kumar classes of EQP mod2. So it suffices to just do the, to prove this thing for these classes. And, okay, there are like almost a ton of, I mean, it suffices to just show that, so it suffices to show. So it suffices to show that given a point, a piadic point, you can modify by an element of two times the piadic points to make the x and y coordinates. The x and y coordinates in, for example, zp. And how are you going to do that? Well, there are tons of points on the special fiber and tons of them. I mean, even if, like I write E of, I didn't write E of Z P, but anyway, even if you have bad reduction at P, there are tons of smooth points on the special fiber, which lift to QP points. And so this is really an argument about working mod P. An argument about working mod p because p is so large, you have plenty of room to just move so that you're not reducing to infinity. Hopefully, that made sense, but okay, so that's so just by so done by Hensel, and I guess the right thing to say is Vay or Davenport, actually, but anyway. It's okay. Actually, you can even guarantee X and Y are in ZP cross, or that they avoid any kind of bounded set, mod P, if that makes sense. And that's why I didn't care when I was writing this down. So I could just say, whatever, make it so that 2y minus A3 is not divisible by P, and then this is a unit. And so this is pi-adically integral. Okay, so that's. That's the lemma. And so, oh, yeah. Sorry. Once X and Y are in Zp, for example, I wrote down this formula, which is here behind the, or has been erased, for a binary quadratic form with the right invariance. And it is obvious just from the formula that it has integral, pi-atically integral coefficients, once x and y are piodically integral, and a and b are pi-adically integral. Okay, so um Yes. And this same argument, because of this modification where I wrote X and Y and Z P cross, or I'm allowed to avoid any bounded set, the same argument gives the same result for the same for pay. Four pairs of binary cubic forms such that A2 A6 are in Z and locally soluble. Yeah, so it's the same kind of story. Okay, that's like known. It's fine. You can count these things. These things, this kind of converts you into a problem about counting integral points. And like I said, because I'm forcing these invariants i and a2 to vanish in these problems, now it's a problem about counting integral points on a quadric, which, okay, it turns out that your favorite form of the circle method will work great in this context. I did want to write, I'm actually happy that I'm not going to, but I did, I did. That I'm not going to, but I did allow myself in my notes to write down like the delta method expression once, but it's okay. I think you'll believe me that a quadric and five variables is easily amenable to the circle method, especially in this context. You have to do some smoothing, but anyway, it's fine. But okay, now I want to get to the point, which is, yeah, like this, this kind of tells you that seems tells you that seems quite reasonable to try to count y squared equals x cubed two summer elements of y squared equals x equals b and y squared equals x cups b squared. What about k is 4 and 5? Okay. Yeah, eight variables in this case. Even easier, exactly. Yeah, so it's five variables. This is a five variable quadric, and this one is an eight variable quadric. No, I don't think so. It's just every, it's extremely clean to write down. So, yeah, there's a smooth weight function. Yeah, so it kind of inserts very easily into the delta method, but yeah. I don't personally see kind of an advantage, but yeah. Anyway, what was I going to say? Yes. Yeah, so here's the yeah, this is kind. Yeah, this is kind of amusing. But anyway, here's the reduction. So we're also going to parametrize in order to do the cases k is four and five. So this, I didn't really prove the cases k is one or two, given what I've written down, but I've kind of indicated why it's quite reasonable to expect that at this point, the argument will go through. Once you have an integral representative, you're now dealing with integer points. You have to do, I mean, there's still some. You have to do, I mean, there's still something to do, which is a little bit of like talk about reduction theory for your groups for the GZ points acting on the VQ orbits or the VR orbits. Sorry, the VR points, I mean, the GZ orbits acting on VR to do reduction theory there. And then you're faced with some integration. And yeah, I'll save that. But I want to talk about what to do for K is four or five. So Or five. So now I'm going to erase this, but the point was: this was a local question. Class number one meant, class number one for these groups meant that it was a local question. The local question was solved by basically by Hensel and the Vaybound, by having enough points to be able to move around a Kumar class by like as you please to avoid, for example, Y vanishing mod P or Y being a. Or Y being A3 mod P. Yes. Oh, yeah, yeah. So I have to do. Here's what I'm going to do. So a priori, I have a parameterization, which is, as I mentioned, I have two parameterizations which look great for the cases k equals 1, k equals 2. This is the parameterization for k equals 1 that you use. Okay, great. You get a quadric and there's no condition on j. When k is 2, you're like, well, how am I going to encode the fact? How am I going to encode the fact that J is a square? But then you go to the other parameterization, which I erased, and then you kind of automatically encoded the fact that B is a square, and you just need to verify that A2 vanishes. So you're on a quadric, as I mentioned, and eight variables. But what about K equals four, for example? So the lemma is as follows. It's a reduction from, so now reduce from k to k minus 3. And so really the And so, really, the thing I really am talking about is actually the case k equals five. K equals four, there's another parameterization by Hessians of binary quartic forms. It's even also follows immediately from what's written in my joint paper with Bhargava and Schnidman by a trick. So, the Kaggles 4 case is it falls in a number of different ways, but the Kaggles 5 case is the thing that I found really amusing. That I found really amusing. But it's a little hairier, I guess, to write down, but okay. So, for example, so let's just say B is square free just for psychological ease. It doesn't actually change the argument. So, let B be square free. Which case did I do? Yeah. Let F be a binary quartic rational such. Such that I of f is zero and j of f, let's do integral, sorry. And j of f is, let's just say b to the fourth or b to the fifth, and f is locally soluble. Then there exists a G in PGL two Q. Q such that not G.F but G dot F divided by B is up to a bounded denominator integral, something like that. And again, it's a local question. So this is what this is really about. So really about So, really about what's the word? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I should. Okay. So, first, even before saying that, this is a binary quartic form. So, you know, g dot f of xy is a binary quartic form. Its invariants are, okay, i is still 0, and j goes down by b cubed. So, for example, if j was b to the fourth, this would be the case k. Was b to the fourth, this would be the case k equals four. Um, then it has a j invariant of b looks great now because now you don't have to encode anything, you just have to just change the local solubility condition from so um i don't know how to put this in brackets so that you kind of don't associate these two, but anyway, the new local solubility condition when you're counting, let me call this F tilde, just so it's something different. The new local solubility condition when you're counting binary quartic forms. When you're counting binary quartic forms, in the case k equals 4, for example, the new local solubility condition will be that bz squared, or sorry, you don't know what the kind of b is ahead of time, so to speak, j of f times z squared is your f tilde is locally soluble. So that's the associated curve to a binary quartic form with i equals zero and j is kind of arbitrary. And then when in the case k equals five, so you have j is b to the fifth. So you have j is b to the fifth. This again reduces the invariant by b cubed, and then you're in the other case. Anyway, so I'm going to erase this because so the proof of this lemma, the existence of integral representatives in the case k equals 4 or k equals 5, is that same proof as above when p does not divide j of f. J of F and if P divides J of F then claim so either okay if P divides J of F done P divides all the coefficients of F and else else F has some kind of reduction mod P it has so else claim F mod P as splitting type so-called one cubed one, meaning that f mod p has a simple root. Yeah. And or claim without loss of generality. I don't know how to write this. Anyway, claim you may reduce. This anyway, blame you may reduce to the case where f has a simple root, and the reason is where do we erase? I'm just gonna erase this because I have like a minute. So, like I said, you can arrange so that, okay, so first off, F is locally soluble. So, mod, so at P, it is the, it is G of QP equivalent, or PGL2QP equivalent. Equivalent or PGL2QP equivalent to a Kumer image. It itself, you know, this weird other curve that I wrote down may not be locally soluble a priori, but F is locally soluble. So it's equivalent to, so F is equivalent to an FXY mod PGL2QP. Good. And I said by this like Hensel and Wey type argument, without loss of generality, X and Y are in. Generality, X and Y are in, may as well assume they're in Z P cross. And then when you write down, so then f of x y itself, like evidently, is not 1 to the 4, doesn't have a fourth order root. And also, since, so because p divides the discriminant of f, because p. P divides the discriminant of f because p divides j and i is zero. So the splitting types are in, so the splitting types, possible splitting types are the one we want or a bunch of splitting types where you have only a double root, two squared. I think that's it. But then the thing to note is if you only have a double root, so if you imagine Have a double root, so if you imagine putting the root at zero, then let's say alpha beta gamma. Then this I invariant, if you look at the formula, is gamma squared. And because it's supposed to vanish, this forces this gamma to be zero. So in fact, if you have a double root, it forces the vanishing the I invariant forces a triple root. And so these are not possible. So you have to be one cubed one. So you have to be one cubed one. So because it has spilling type one cubed one mod p, that simple root can be lifted by Hensel to a root over Qp. So f has a root over Qp. And so this curve I wrote down, J of F Z squared Zy is also locally soluble. In other words, this thing is locally soluble at P, and then you run the argument as before. And then you run the argument as before. Then you've produced an integral representative in the case k equals 4. There's no condition on j anymore. It's just that you have a weird, different local condition. Case k equals 5, you've moved to the other parameterization. And that's all I wanted to say. Thank you. Ah. Um, I didn't think of it in that way. Um I didn't think of it in that way. Yeah, I mean, you're, I don't know. I didn't think of it that way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no. I think it's probably a completely reasonable way of looking at it. But yeah, yeah. Okay. So maybe a higher level, what you're doing is you're saying, like, look, I'm in, okay, this, I should have said this from the beginning because this would make it obvious that something like this has to exist. If I take E0B and E0. B and E0 B to the fourth. Okay, they're kind of evidently quadratic twists. So if I do this, these are isomorphic. And if I take H1 of this and this, okay, good. They're the same. And so Selmer of this guy sits inside here. And the two-Selmer group of this guy sits inside here. And, you know, this is the same kind of vector space. So the two-selmer of this guy sits inside. So the two star for this guy sits inside here. So this guy has to sit in here somehow with some local conditions. And I'm just writing down what the local conditions are. So, like, rationally speaking, it's obvious. But then you fight a little bit or you do a little bit of nonsense and you get an integral representative. But yeah. Yeah. Other questions? Yeah. Yeah, I haven't thought about it. Besides saying, besides this kind of, oh, wait, no. Yeah, I haven't thought about it. I haven't thought about it. But yeah, I was just trying to, I was going to say the bound that Wei and I gave gives you, just directly applying kind of blindly, gives you an O1. gives you an O of 1 to the, anyway, it gives you like a x to the epsilon, if that makes sense. But yeah, I haven't thought about it to kind of think about how to do better. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, that's the thing. Okay, so I think that's right. Anyway, the reason it would be infinity, if I actually wrote that down correctly, is there's a Is there's a two torsion point. So there's a two isogeny. Then you compute the Tamagawa factor, the Tamagawa factors attached to like the two isogeny is dual. And that forces the Selma group to be at least something like a constant to the number of prime factors that are something mod something. It's like that. Let's say two to the number of prime factors that are, I don't know, seven mod 16 minus the number of prime factors that are 11 mod 16, something like that. 11 mod 16, something like that. And then that automatically has average infinity because there are kind of tons of B's that have plenty of prime factors that are 7 mod 16. And so I'm not really saying anything besides just Tamogawa factors force divergence.
