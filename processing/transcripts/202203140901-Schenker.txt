So, let me say a few words about the workshop and the organization of things, and then we'll get started at 10 past the hour. I'll try to stick to times just because if people are arriving at a specific time, I don't want to start before they get here. So, the sort of goal of this meeting is to bring together some researchers from the quantum information theory community and some from the And some from the mathematical physics, sort of Schr√∂dinger operators or statistical mechanics community to talk about interesting things in quantum and maybe even things with some randomness. This was conceived of initially by Ramas and me in a collaboration that we started a few years ago on exactly some things related to that, random quantum channels. And we thought it would be really interesting. You know, that collaboration went well for both of us. We really enjoyed it and we thought it would be really interesting to bring. Enjoyed it, and we thought it would be really interesting to bring together people from these different communities. We got together with Simona and Cecilia to put together a proposal for a meeting. Obviously, the meeting is not quite going in the way that we'd hoped. We hope to have everybody there at Bears, but it's very hard these days with COVID to sort of make plans to travel. Although I think it would have been nice at this point, but when people were making plans, it was hard to see how things were going to be in March. So I think there's lots of interesting. I think there's lots of interesting things we can say to each other. I hope we can have a nice collaborative meeting and that there will still be some time and room for discussion, even in the online format. So yes, that's what I want to say. So the talks will be streamed. The schedule, we've kept it fairly light because I know these online meetings can be quite exhausting. So we have three talks a day. We'll have a panel discussion tomorrow, which should prove. Discussion tomorrow, which should prove quite interesting. Ramas, actually, can you remind me who our panel speakers are? I've forgotten the whole list. I don't want to leave anybody out. Yeah, sure. Yeah, it's going to be Seth Lloyd, Vladimir Korapin, and Jared McLean. All right. Thanks. Seth is from MIT, and Vladimir is from Stony Brook, and Jared from Google, AI Quantum. Excellent. Thank you. Excellent. Thank you. So let me just share a couple of things to sort of have you the information about what's going on. You should have all received an email from Burrs that looks something like this. It's got the Zoom meeting links and a link to the website. So all the talks are going to be at this. All the talks are going to be at this single Zoom link. If for some reason you get there without the password embedded, the password is just the code, is just the numbers from the meeting. There is a Slack set up for the meeting, which we can use to communicate. A few people have joined it. So if you need to send a message to somebody, you can send it that way. Or of course, during the Zoom meeting, you can use the chat. If we need some collaborative whiteboard, Google Jamboard is a nice option. Google Jamboard is a nice option, and there's one set up for the meeting. And we do have access this week to a screening for The Secrets of the Surface: The Mathematical Vision of Mario Mirsakani. I think we'll set up a time when we could sort of have a watch party to watch it together if anybody's interested, but you can also simply stream it yourself from this link using the password. I would appreciate it if speakers are willing to, if they upload their slides. To if they upload their slides either before or after their talk, so that we can share them. I know people often request that. So, if you're willing to share your slides, please upload them at this link. During the talks, you can simply share your screen to present your slides, however. Okay. So, the schedule for the meeting here, you can peruse it today. We'll have talks by Mario Sagetti. Talks by Mario Zagetti. We'll have a break after that of a couple hours. It's lunchtime here on the East Coast. So I set the break there. It looks like Vladimir has a question. Just a moment. Then we'll have two talks this afternoon, Nicole Younger-Halpern and Ilya Kachkovsky. Okay, yes, Vladimir, you have a question? I'm a speaker tomorrow at 11 o'clock of my East New York time. So I have I New York Times. So I have a PDF file. Can I just send it to you? Yeah, you can send it to me and I can upload it for you. But during your talk, you can stream it. You can simply share your screen from your computer. Yes, I understand. Yes, of course. Thank you. But if you email it to me, I'll upload it for you. Absolutely. Okay. Okay. So that's all I have to say, introduction-wise. Let's take a few minute break and start at 10 after. Few minute break and start at 10 after to with the first talk. And Mario, in the meantime, if you want to try sharing your screen to see perfect, fantastic. So it works.  So, do you hear me by the way? Yes. Very good. Thank you. Reminder to stop recording.
