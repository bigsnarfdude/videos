So this is okay. Yeah, so thank you for the opportunity to talk about what I've been working on. And so I was originally planning to talk on behavior because that's something that's very close to my heart. And I've been doing a lot of behavioral modeling. But then as I was preparing my presentation, I decided to kind of change the presentation because I felt like. Change the presentation because I felt like, you know, behavior is an important component, which I'll talk about, but there are so many other things that we also need to think about when we're putting together mathematical models. And I was also thinking that it was great that Odo went first because maybe the message of the workshop is going to be that we need to move away from comparemental models and develop more sophisticated models. Sophisticated models that can tackle some of the challenges and opportunities that we have been facing during COVID-19. And so, yeah, so I wanted to kind of provide more questions and answers and also kind of provide some potential approaches that we could consider. But there's a lot of more work that we need to do. More work that we need to do. So let's okay, okay, there. Okay, so I first I just wanted to start with this slide, which presents a history of pandemic. And as you see throughout my talk, I think heterogeneity is going to be the main theme. Theme. And, you know, we have had so many different pandemics. And here are some of the major ones that you can, it's probably kind of hard to see, but maybe you can see some of them. And, you know, some of the majors include plague, smallpox, cholera, the Spanish flu, HIV-8, and most recently, COVID. And one of the interesting things is the heterogeneity and transmission routes from all these. From all these major pandemics. So we have, you know, the Spanish flu and COVID, which is more direct contact and transmission. We have plague, which is transmitted through insects. And then cholera, which is a foodborne infectious disease, and HIV/AIDS, and most recently, also, you know, monkeypox that are sexually transmitted. Transmitted. And so we've seen that previous pandemics have different transmission routes. And as such, mathematical models have been developed to tackle these different transmission paths. And so the traditional epidemiological model, you know, the compartmental model breaks the population into different groups. And one of the major And one of the major assumptions, and I think the limitations is the assumption of homogeneously mixing populations and homogeneity in terms of how the risk of infection and also just, you know, all most of the parameters I think that go into epidemiological models assume homogeneity and uniformity. And so, but And so, but one of the major, there's been so many lessons I think learned from the current pandemic, but one that I wanted to highlight is heterogeneity and the outcomes have been highly heterogeneous, you know, from incident mortality, economic impacts, demographics. We've seen the impacts by age, rage, and many. And many different low-income populations that have been disproportionately affected. Policies, which I'll go into in a little bit more detail later, mandates and compliance have been heterogeneous not only across different countries, but also within countries. Vaccination access, we still have a lot of disparities and access, limited. And access, limited access around the globe to vaccine. And even in countries where vaccine is readily available, the uptake has been heterogeneous and limited and capacity in terms of healthcare access and testing. And I think at the center of all of this is obviously the virus has been the variants that have been changing and emerging. Changing and emerging. And therefore, now our assumption of just a single kind of transmission rate is no longer valid because now we have to make sure that our models are accounting for changes in the transmission of the virus. And so we've been analyzing a lot of the data that has Data that has become available now during the pandemic. And there are different organizations that have put together, this is a composite of government response, which includes masks and closures and stay-at-home mandates and also testing and many other responses. And here there are six different There are six different countries, and our paper has been accepted in PLOS One, and so it's a multi-dimensional resilience paper. And you can see a little bit more details there. But I wanted to highlight the heterogeneity. And we're just looking at six countries here for presentation purposes so that you can see the heterogeneity. But we see. But you know, we've seen how some countries have taken a more aggressive response, some have taken a more laid-back response, and some of them have been very reactive. And so you see kind of waves of government responses. There's also, and even within the United States, we've seen high heterogeneity in terms of responses from, you know, South Dakota all the way to New York that has. That code out all the way to New York that has seems like has been more strict in terms of policies. And then we've also, and I think there's going to be a talk later this week on how we can integrate cell phone mobility into modeling so that we can capture the heterogeneity and emergent behavior. And here, also, you can kind of see different countries and how. Different countries and how people were moving around during the pandemic. And we have been using this kind of data as a proxy for behavior and for compliance. And so this just demonstrates the heterogeneity. And you can see in the United States, we have all 50 states. You can see how heterogeneous the mobility was during the pandemic. The pandemic. And so, and then, in terms of the variance, you know, we saw the emergence of alpha in the UK, then beta in South Africa, Delta in India, then gamma in Brazil, and then most recently, Omicron. And I think this is something that, in terms of our modeling, for flu, we had capture. Capture two strains, and we had developed models with multiple strains, but not more than a few, I guess. And now, with this current pandemic, we've seen the emergence of many different variants. And I think that the takeover of the variants has been what's most challenging because things are changing so rapidly whereas before we used to be able to model or. Be able to model or make assumptions about the timing of an outbreak and say, you know, in the absence of, if I just assume that I'm modeling flu for one year, I don't really have to worry about an additional strain. And I think my model would be valid. But now with COVID, the variants are emerging very rapidly. And so our models obviously need to take that into account. And here, the first panel on the The first panel on the right, it's the global, and then you have New York, the United States, and Texas just for presentation purposes. And so going back to the force of infection, you can break it up into three different kinds of pieces. And this is what we typically do in mathematical models, right? We have a number of Models, right? We have the number of contacts per unit time, the probability of disease transmission per unit time, and then the fraction of contacts that are infected. And when it comes to the probability of transmission, disease transmission, there's a lot that gets combined into that parameter from susceptibility of an infected person, infectivity of the infected person, duration of contact, and many other things that you can probably put together in that parameter. Together in that parameter. And so, in terms of capturing heterogeneity, given what we've seen during the pandemic in terms of behavior and equity and heterogeneity and also government responses. So, we can capture some of that in the C compartment. I mean, the C parameter, which is the changes in behavior, we have. The changes in behavior, do we have beta which you can account for the vaccination or variance or susceptibility or infectivity? And also, in terms of fraction of people that are infected, you can probably somehow account for that with a parameter about isolation and quarantine. And so in the past, what we've done and what we, you know, some of our And what we, you know, some of our papers have basically broken the population into several compartments to account for behavior. And so this is just a simple representation of what we've done in the past, which basically you assume that you have two different types of populations. One population changes their behavior, the other one doesn't change their behavior. And so you can assume lower. Behavior. And so you can assume lower risk to the population that's changing behavior versus the population that is not changing their behavior. And obviously, this is a simplistic representation because there are many different, it's a spectrum, I guess. It's not just necessarily two. And then the other piece I think that is super important is the movement between these two compartments. And when it comes to face masks, for example. Face mask, for example. People could be wearing a face mask. I was wearing a face mask, then I take it off. And so then you, people are kind of moving between these two compartments on a regular kind of basis. And during lockdown, maybe you, it was simpler to make these assumptions about, you know, you either have people in one compartment or on the other. And so then they, for the most part, stayed in that path. But otherwise, then people move back and forth. Otherwise, then people move back and forth. And so this movement can be represented either as a rate, or you can also do it as a function. What we did in the past was to model it as a function of the infected population. And so basically, as risk perception goes up, more people are moved to the behavior compartment. And as the risk declines, then more people are moving into the non-behavior or higher risk compartment. Or higher-risk compartments. So, this is one option. And you obviously also have, you know, the meta population. And this is where I think cell phone data has become super useful to see movement rates and see how different you can basically add heterogeneity in terms of contact pattern and contact rates in a mathematical model. But the other Model. But the other option, which I wanted, oh, and so when you add movement, then you're able to get waves in your model. And this is some of the some work that we've done in the past where, you know, on one, the right, I mean, the left, your right or my, I don't know, my left figure. Figure where we use a step function. And so basically, we just assume that people, you know, they were in one compartment for one, you know, for a duration of time. And then eventually we stopped the behavior and then everyone kind of went back to the non-behavioral. And so then you can kind of see these ways, or you can also model it as a tent function. And so basically, it was as the epidemic went up, then people Up, then people change their behavior, and then as the disease declined, then people stopped doing their behavior. And so now I wanted to go into this power law distribution. And so that was a simpler, a simple way, I guess, of capturing behavior and heterogeneity in contact patterns. But what we've seen in many different surveys. Many different surveys and people who are collecting data about contact patterns, they have found that our contacts actually follow a power law distribution. And what this means is basically that on average, a lot of people, you know, most people have like, in this case, it's 22 contacts a day, but that there are some people, and you can see, you know, the number of contacts is on the one on the x-axis. Is on the what on the x-axis, and then on the y-axis, you have the number of people with those number of contacts. Um, there are few people that have hundreds of contacts, and those few people could be, you know, people, I don't know, flight attendants, or it could be mathematicians that are traveling to a workshop. And so, and, you know, and so they're so the the the The formulation of just breaking the population into different high risks, but still assuming homogeneous mixing within those risks are not really accounting for the heterogeneity that we observe in real populations. And so, here, this is for some of our simulations that we have, that we have at Los Alamos, where you have a simulated Simulated population agent-based simulation. And you can see that on average, people have 22 contacts, but there are some with hundreds of contacts. And then if we close the schools, if we close all the schools, the number of contacts reduce, but not by much. The average number of contacts is 19.9. And you might be wondering, like, why posting the schools didn't make a huge The schools didn't make a huge impact on the overall contact patterns, and the reason is because we only assume school closures might not after school activities, and so that this the simulation assumed that the kids will continue to go to swimming and football practice. And so there's a lot of after-school activities where the schools interact, where the kids interact. And so, therefore, just closing schools alone was not. Schools alone was not enough, and you need to, you know, kind of also close all the after-school activities. And so, but if you assume that 50% of the population decided to stay home because they were, you know, fearful of getting infected, then you significantly decrease the contact pattern. And so, then your average number of contacts goes down to eight. Goes down to eight. And so the question was: how could we incorporate this kind of behavior or this kind of contact patterns in epidemiological models so that we move away from the homogeneously mixing patterns and assumptions and then go into more heterogeneous mixing, and also maybe what we typically observe in populations with this, which is this power. This power law. And so some of our colleagues at Los Alamos, Phil, came up with this kind of formulation. And so he basically took the force of infection and you have, you know, S, which is the susceptible population. And he used P, which is the initially susceptible population. And you can see the And you can see his actually derivation and formulation of this approach in his paper. But what he observed was that if you actually group S over P and then you raise it to some exponent, you may be able to capture the power law distribution and then incorporate that in a compartmental type. I mean, in the compartmental. I mean, in the compartmental type formulation or in an ODE formulation. And so here are some of the results from his paper. And so basically he used our agent-based model as you know as a representation of our real population. And so we have different cities, Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago. And in the green line, which is The green line, which is uh, let's let me see if I can use. So, here you have the green line, and that is actual the traditional epidemiological model without without the exponent. And then here, and here you have the simulation, basically, which is those blocked circles, and then in red, you have. In red, you have the approximation using an exponent of 1.7. And then for Los Angeles, he found that the exponent was 2.06. And then for Chicago, it was 2. And so this is just kind of another way that we could potentially think about incorporating heterogeneous contact patterns into our models. Into our models. Obviously, that estimating the exponent is a little complicated because then you need to have information about how the disease is spreading in a population and make sure that you're able to estimate those numbers. But the other point is also that it's not going to be the same for every city or every country or every region that you're modeling. And so estimating. Region that you're modeling. And so estimating that would be, it can be complicated, but I think it can be done. And so that's one piece that I kind of wanted to highlight. The other thing that we've been working on and I think it's been super important is the variants, obviously. And we know that the variants not only are changing the infectivity, mortality, the clinical presentation, and Mortality, the clinical presentation, and vaccine resistance. And so, how do we incorporate a dynamic virus in our models so that we can more accurately capture what we are observing in the real world? And so, one way that we've okay, so and I wanted to kind of show some of the, these are So some of the, these are one of our postdocs, Lauren Beasley, who's been, we're working on trying to integrate variants into our models. And so this is, these are some preliminary results on how we're trying to kind of see what happened with Delta. And we have Delta on the left and then Omicron on the right. And you can see the peaks across different Peaks across different countries and so in different continents and different regions. And so if you look at the map of the relative timing of case peaks by country, you can see, oh, and I think I forgot to put the color map. And so, but basically, red means that it took faster, and then green, it took Faster, then green, it took, if I remember correctly, and then green, it took it's less time basically for the peaks. It's yeah, I think that's that's what it means. Anyway, so what I wanted to kind of show here is the difference in the different variants. And so, this is obviously heterogeneity that we need to capture. And so that we, when we assume that we have, you know, that the variants are obviously acting the same way or transmitting the same way that we're not going to be able to kind of capture the heterogeneity. So one way that people have been modeling the impact of variance is obviously as you can just start with two compartments, and this is kind of similar. Compartments, and this is kind of similar to the behavior model, but it's slightly different. And this is also what's been done for flu, where you can assume that susceptible population can be infected by two different variants. And then when they recover, they can basically get infected with the other variant. And so, and then more sophisticated, I guess, or Sophisticated, I guess, or more general approaches account for, you know, if you have n variants. And so then how would that look like in the modeling world? And obviously, this can get really complicated because once you recover, you can get infected with a different variant. And so then keeping track of what you have been infected with. What you have been infected with in your ODE system, it can get very, very messy, but it's tractable. And so this is another way that we could think about variants. And so we've been using also these types of approaches to see how we could model variance in. And how we can account for the impact of variants. And this is just an example of some of the results that we have about vaccine efficacy against an oval variant, which is on the X axis. Then we have vaccine acceptance percentage on the left, and then the cumulative COVID-19 deaths by thousands on the right. And so you can see that. Right. And so you can see that reduced efficacy against a novel variant obviously increases the number of COVID deaths. And one, a very important piece has been the vaccine acceptance, which we know there's a lot of hesitancy against vaccination. And so as the vaccine also wanes and then we have hesitant Hesitant, vaccine-hesitant populations, I think that that combination can be very detrimental for the spread of COVID. And so I think in summary, I wanted to have a discussion about how do we make our models more sophisticated and how do we develop modeling approaches that are able. Develop modeling approaches that are able to answer the questions that we are getting from decision makers. And most of the decision makers come with questions about, you know, who should we vaccinate first? And it's not just general population, but it's about communities. And especially when you're working with local public health decision makers, they have limited resources and they want to make sure that they That they use that information into that they take information from the models so that they can more optimally deploy resources. But if our models are not accounting for the heterogeneity in the population, then I think it can be very difficult for them to make decisions. And so, heterogeneity, I, you know, heterogeneity in contact patterns, I think it's one important piece that I would like us to see. I would like us to see incorporating our models heterogeneity and susceptibility. And so, you know, we have age structure models, meta-population models, but we need other types of models that can account. If we start building all these metapopulation models with like age, race, gender, occupation, then they're going to get super complicated. And so I don't, yeah, that's something that we need to think about. The dynamic transmission to The dynamic transmission to capture variability and effectivity, I think, is also very important. And so, you know, I showed you how we've done in the past and how we are modeling variance, but we could also think about making the beta maybe into some kind of function that is dependent on what's transmitting basically in the population, although it becomes. Basically, in the population, although it becomes more difficult to solve that system. Emerging human behavior, including misinformation and disinformation. I think Dylan talked a little bit about that, but I think that's something that we all know that we somehow need to be able to incorporate that hesitancy and lack of protective behavior into our models and accounting for disparity. And accounting for disparities in healthcare access is also important because then that creates more heterogeneous impacts. And then one final thing, which we also need to take into account, and this is something that we haven't really been doing a lot in the math community. It's about, it's not just accounting for the clinical or the healthcare impacts, but also. Or the healthcare impacts, but also accounting for the economic impacts of all of these different mitigation strategies. And that's something that I think we didn't, we hadn't done the work at the beginning of the pandemic and with the lockdowns that impacted many different populations and then pushed many people into poverty. And so, and also healthcare, mental health, and some other things. And I feel like the cascading impacts of some of the media. Impacts of some of the mitigations need to be incorporated into the models. And so that's basically what I wanted to discuss. And I wanted to leave enough time for us to have a Q ⁇ A for and what your thoughts are on some of these provoking questions, I guess, and provoking approaches and what we need to do as a mathematical modeling community. Thanks.
