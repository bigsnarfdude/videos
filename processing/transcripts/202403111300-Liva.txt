Five to ten minutes left uh so I can uh end up in uh on on schedule. Uh well first of all I would like uh uh to thank Wei, Jean-Francois, Yuri, Victoria and Cynthia for the invitation to give a talk to this workshop. I will definitely remember it as the workshop with the most beautiful scenery uh I ever had. So I'm really sorry for the people that attend online because they're going to miss Then online because they are going to miss the beauty that is out there. So, I will start my talk in a bit of an unconventional manner. So, I prepared a list of disclaimers that I want to put forward. And since I have a very bad memory, I wrote them here. So, first disclaimer is that I'm not a 3GB standard expert. So, we had to go through the standard to understand what to do in this work. What to do in this work, and I apologize in advance if I got something stronger from this time. But we try to do a work best. Also, the approach that we are going to propose.
