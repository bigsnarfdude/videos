It's all good. Okay, so yes, today is cat and phase day, loosely speaking. And this is the first talk that we're going to hear about this. So, cat and phase invariance, I'm going to relate that to invertible TQFT. So, this is a project that I did with Matthew Shenbawas a few years ago. So, it's essentially already published. But I still think it's an interesting topic. It's an interesting topic. The first notion that I heard about this connection between cat and paste invariants and TQFTs, I heard from Matthias Kreck. And essentially, this is an idea that he was developing together with Daisna and Stoltz. And so, well, I had heard about this, but this was something that they hadn't written up or anything. So we worked on it. And we worked on it. Okay, so we worked on it and then you know discovered other interesting uh aspects of the of the idea okay sorry we sorry oh really that's uh yeah it's making sure it's her mic and this is nothing oh but I can use another microphone. This is all This is all. Yeah, it's a sub-participant for me all. Oh, that's a participant, maybe the meal. I think it's this computer. Oh, yeah. Yeah, right now I think it's okay. I don't hear it. I mean. Yeah, that's okay. Yes. Okay, so then we just move on. okay okay so then we just we just move on okay so okay so so um so catampes groups uh featured already yesterday in bernado's talk and also in eric's talk so i'm going to give just for clarification this is not really an introduction but more like a clarification of which groups we're talking about so the group that featured yesterday was this um sk bar specialty in dimension two over the vg and uh The VG, and that was the Vulcan of multiplier. And then Eric explained very nicely why that's the right thing to consider because you're killing the total classes in here. This braid of exact sequences, it's a way of displaying short exact sequences. They are like featured by different exact sequences highlighted here in colors. So a little bit gives us an overview of the different zoo, the health zoo of cattle-based crops and how. Of cattle-based groups and how they relate to cobaltism. For example, the most relevant exact sequence for yesterday's talk would have been this blue one, because here we have like ordinary cobaltism group and what Bernardo explained was that this SK bar group is really a cobaltism group where you have kills all of the mapping tori, all of the toro classes. So this is like a geometric interpretation of this, of what was happening here. The groups that we are going to be focusing on today. Groups that we are going to be focusing on today, Julia and Renee are going to be talking mostly about the SK group, and they're going to define it and also define some variations of that group that we've defined of like these groups with boundary. And for my talk in particular, the SKK groups here are going to be the most important ones. So as I said, this is not meant as a motivational introduction. Here's like throwing at you all of the different groups and all of the. All of the different groups and all of the notation that's going to be defined in the talk. But just to make a clarification that there's like different, several different cat and base groups and that they're not exactly all the same. You know, there's going to be differences in definitions. Okay, so let's get started with this definition we're going to hear more than once today because this is the definition of like SK groups, cut and paste. Like SK groups, cut and paste the most basic one. So, what is the operation? So, the operation here is that you're going to start with a closed manifold. That's you can follow on the picture on the right. We start with our closed manifold M. And we're going to find a chaodimension one smooth sub-manifold in that manifold M that has a trivial normal bundle. Okay, so we're going to cut along that manifold, and since we have a manifold, That manifold, and since we have a trivial normal bundle, we're going to ensure that these new boundaries that we have created have nice colors. So now we can choose a diffeomorphism of the boundaries and paste these two pieces back together. If you paste it, you know, if you paste that along the identity, you could get the original thing, but you can do something clever and choose a different different morphism so you get something, a new manifesto. And this is what you. Manifold. And this is what you call a cut and paste relation. So you could say that your original manifold M up there and your manifold that you've constructed out of those two pieces and with the gluing map, so M1 and M2 glued via some differmor fission 5, you would say that those are cut and paste equivalents. Okay, so this is a slightly more formal definition. So, how do we define the group that is defined down here? But, first of all, notation for what this thing here means: that the monoid of diffomorphism classes of smooth, closed, oriented, n-dimensional manifolds and the disjoint union. Well, you're going to take the Grotendig group of that, and then you're going to quotient via some relation. And the relation is exactly the relation. And the relation is exactly the relation that we just saw on the previous slide, which means that if you take two pieces and you glue them along a diffeomorphism V of an orientation preserving diffeomorphism of the boundaries, that's going to be in the same class in your group as gluing via a different diffeomorphism. So if you have the same pieces and you glue via different diffeomorphisms, you're still going to get the same element of the same class in the group. And that's how you define your SK. How you define your SK group, which Bernardo already explained, stands for Schneiden und Cleven, cut and paste. Okay, so we've seen a very abstract picture of what cut and paste means, but I also wanted to give you kind of a geometric picture of something that also appeared in Eric's talk yesterday. Again, the notion of, you know, how do you get Teutoric from Atorus? How do you get Atorus from Tutorium? A torous, how do you get a torus from Tutori? So, this is a slightly different construction from what he explained, but it boils down to the same thing. I'm just going to very basically perform a cut and based operation on the torus up here. I first cut it into different pieces, and I'm going to rearrange those pieces, and I'm going to choose how I'm gluing those boundaries. So, the result here is after pasting, I'm getting those two. Getting those two tori. So, what does that mean for the group? Well, for the group, it means that the class of one torus, the one torus that we see up there, is going to equal, under the cut and paste operation, is going to equal to the class of the discharge union of two tori, so two tori. Of course, if something is going to be equal to twice itself, the only possibility is that it is equal to zero in the group. So then we see that a torus will. We see that a toro will represent the zero class in this cut and paste group. And this concept that we have here doesn't only work in dimension two. I mean, the picture just suggests a torous, but this is something that helps in general for any dimension. So instead of like thinking of that as a toros, you could be thinking of it as a mapping torus, like take any manifold, sigma, cross it with. Manifold sigma, cross it with I, and then you have this manifold cross an interval, and then you're going to glue the two ends together via some diffeomorphism, and you get a mapping torus. And that's a map in Taurus. You can play exactly the same game with the mapping torus, and you get a mapping torus being twice a mapping torus. So, again, any map in Taurus of any dimension that you choose is going to represent zero in the SK group. Okay, things that. Okay, things that we're interested in: pattern-based invariance. That's a very important thing because now you have a, just as you're interested, for example, in coordinate invariance, you're also interested in SK invariance. And what do SK invariants do? Well, they are invariants because you're taking two cut and paste equivalence manifolds. Like here, I have N and M prime, Lloyd V, N and M prime as well, Lord Via Psi, a different diffimorphism. So these two manifolds, they have, I'm evaluating. Two manifolds they have I'm evaluating, they are k-equivalent. And now I have this lambda, which is a person and Sk-inference. So that means that when I evaluate it on those two manifolds, they give me the same result. Essentially, the difference is zero. Right, so that's the theory. What do we know about cat and paste invariant? Well, we know that the Euler characteristic is a cat and paste invariant, and also so is the signature. So maybe the signature has a Maybe the signature has a slightly more difficult proof, but it's maybe easier to understand in a sense, because this is just the fact that the signature is a cut and paste invariant just boils down to novicoff additivity. So Novikov additivity tells you that your choice of gluing diffomorphism doesn't matter for the result of the signature. It's just what's the signature of the pieces. The Euler characteristics. The Euler characteristic is maybe you have to use a little bit more of your knowledge of grade duality, is because you know, whenever you take the Euler characteristic of a space, you would say Euler characteristic of n plus the Euler characteristic of M prime minus the Euler characteristic of the intersection of these two things. But of course, that intersection is one dimensionless. So now play with functor duality and you get the result. Okay, so these are kind of Pacific variants. In fact, Euler characteristic. In fact, Euler characteristic and the signature and linear combinations of those are the only SK invariants. Now, what next? As I said, we want to, for my talk, we're going to have, it has a little bit of a lag, so coming. Okay, so for my talk, these are the invariants, the slightly more complicated invariants, they call the Schneider-uncleven Controlier invariants. So again, they are cattle-based invariants, but they're controlled. That they're controlled. Controlled by what? So now we can look at the difference between these two equations here. Again, I have two cut and paste equivalent manifolds, and now I'm evaluating them on a different invariance, a cut and paste controlled invariance. When I evaluate that, I don't quite get zero, but I get an error term. And that error term depends only or is controlled only by the diffeomorphisms that you use to glue the pieces. To glue the pieces. So, yeah, so there's an error term, it doesn't quite give you zero, but you have a control on what you're talking about. Now, what are invariants in this case? Well, obviously, the Euro characteristic and the signature are still there because your error term could just happen to be zero. And in that case, those invariants are also controlled invariants. You have more invariance, though, because you're allowing this flexibility of the error term, and because you're allowing And because you're allowing that flexibility, again, there's a little bit of flag. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. Trump rolled here. Well, I'm going to say, so we're getting, we're getting, okay, here we are. Bodism. Bodism is a cat and based invariant. And a very interesting invariant, which I think Julia is going to talk about, is the semi-characteristic. Yes. Oh, control. Yes. So control. Maybe I haven't, let's see, maybe. Maybe I haven't, let's see, maybe if there's too much lag, we'll see. But essentially, is that it's controlled by, so you could somehow write an expression here that only depends on whatever your choice of gluing diffomorphisms is. So the control kind of like refers to that, that it's not just some random error term that you don't know what it's going to be. It's an error term that depends on what you. An error term that depends on what you chose as gluing different. Is it an isotope enduring? Yeah, I think so. Okay, and the ecosemic characteristic here is probably unreadable from the back of the room, but it's a little bit related to the Euler characteristic. We're going to see an example in a second. Okay. So we had a moment ago, we had a little picture for what the SK definition was and how you were gluing your piece. And how you were gluing your pieces and everything. SKK also has this nice geometric formula. It's just a little bit more complicated, but let's go through it. So, again, again, I'm taking, just as for SK, I'm taking my monoid of diffeomorphism classes of oriented and manifolds, taking the Groten group of Z, and now I'm taking a relation. And the relation, as you see, is slightly similar, but it has more terms. So now we have, we're playing here with the same plane with two. We're playing here with instead of playing with two pieces. We're playing with four pieces, M1, M2, M3, and 4. And on this side, you see that I'm bluing by first time, they all have the same boundary. So all of these pieces have diffomorphic boundary. And now I'm choosing two diffomorphisms, phi and psi. And I'm saying that if you interchange those diffimorphisms, the resulting manifolds are SKK equivalents. And this is one of the ways to express. One of the ways to express the relations in this group is not the only one, but this is kind of like the very, very classical way to express this. So we have here M1 and M2 glued via first glued via phi. On the other side, I'm gluing it via the upside. So you see what I've done with the maps. They are swapped. The pieces are still in the same place, but the maps are swapped. Saying that the error depends symmetrically via side? You have to work a little bit. So, for example, with the A little bit so, for example, with the semi-characteristic semi-characteristics is very similar to an Euler characteristic. Essentially, you use Poincaré duality, and you see that the remaining thing in the middle dimension ends up just depending on the diffeomorphisms. But yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe a little bit. Maybe it has, I hadn't thought of it in that way, but maybe there's some way to do it. Right, no, no, no. No, nope, nope, nope. Okay, so this is our definition of SKK, just to understand a little bit what manifests are in there. And well, okay, so just by thinking of the invariants, this exact sequence, which is a classical one, it appears in the very early book on cut and paste, which was written by the four authors, Karas, Craig, Neumann, and Ossa. They explain why this exact sequence works. And well, this group is now known to us. This is just. Known to us, this is just ordinary covariance groups. They actually do these constructions both in unoriented and oriented situation. What I'm writing here is the oriented situation right now. And that's it. So this group actually subjects onto cobaltism and it fits into this short exact sequence. The kernel is actually generated by spheres. And well, you know, intuition kind of already tells you that. Kind of already tells you that, of course, this has approved, but you can intuitively see that, well, maybe some spheres or something generated by spheres does not necessarily have to be zero in here, but as soon as you get to cobaltism, spheres are always going to be boundary. So they're going to disappear there. And here's a computation that's already done in the classical book of what this kernel is. So we have z, the integers, in dimensions 0 and 2, mod 4, and mod 4 and when you're 4k plus one dimensional you get a z2 this is an interesting z2 is actually detected by the semi-characteristic and when it's dimension 4k plus 3 you get zero okay um so let's see an example of this exact sequence in action i'm going to do the example for you of this is very pretty i think it's a worthwhile example of how the exact sequence works in dimension five Sequence works in dimension five. Okay, so first of all, let me write down what the actual computation of those groups are. So we know that cobaltism in dimension five is D2. It's generated by the Wu manifold. SK, we know that from the previous slide, we know that this kernel is Z2. And we also know, we didn't know from the previous slide. Also, know, we didn't know it from the previous slide, but I'm telling you now that this sequence is actually split by the Euler semi-characteristic. So, what we get in the middle group is C2 plus C2. So, now what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you what generates each of those C2s that appearing here in the slide. So, the first C2, the first C2 here, that we have two similar constructions here. We have CP2, which is a four-dimensional manifold. We're going to cross it with I. We're going to cross it with I. Now we're going into five-dimension. And here we're going to be gluing doing this construction of the map in Taurus. We're going to be gluing via the identity. Okay? So that gives me a five-dimensional manifold. This other manifold here is construction is similar. It's again CP2 cross I, but now I'm gluing via complex conjugation. You have your CP2, you're identifying that via complex conjugation. Now this Now, this manifold here is actually the same probability plus as the Bu manifold. So, this mapping tolerance of complex conjugation is going to be a generator in here. And that can be detected by using, for example, Stifel-Whitney classes, or you could also go and compute the RAM invariant, which detects this. The RAM invariant, which detects this group. The other one, the other one, well, I've already given you a hint: this sequence is split by the semi-characteristic. So you could go ahead and use the definition of the semi-characteristic to compute the Euler semi-characteristic of this manifold. And it gives you one. So again, on this side, we are getting one. So the sequence always splits. The sequence always splits. That's very cool. Always split. That's very cool, yes. And it splits in a very beautiful way in, like, in with this very interesting invariance in the dimensions 4k plus one. And this is just an example. This is probably a very beautiful example because you really see like the C2s as you go up in dimension, it's going to get more complicated with more percentages, but this is essentially how it works. Okay, and again, in a tiny font so that you can't read it. Here's the semi-characteristic. It's just what it's It's just what it's saying here is just count the betty numbers only up to the middle dimension and count the mod two. So, you know, if you just do it to do an exercise on Kino's formula computing the homology of the homology of that product, you're going to be able to compute your one. That's an easy one. This one is a little bit more fancy, but that one is any student can do it. Okay, so as promised. So, as promised, I was going to relate these SKK groups with quantum field theories, or at least with impatient quantum field theories. So, even if they featured a little bit yesterday already, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to start from scratch, give you the definitions, and tell you which axioms we need to make sense of this connection. So, what is an n-dimensional TQFT? Well, it's just a functor. It's a symmetric monoidal functor that assigns to That assigns to each n minus one dimensional manifold, you're assigning a finite vector space. So, here we can follow from the picture to this sigma naught and n minus one dimensional manifold, we're assigning a vector space. And to each bodism, we are assigning a linear map. So, up here, we have the geometric information of a co-bodism. Again, in the talk from yesterday, of course, you have you're thinking about oriented. You have you're thinking about oriented manifolds, you're thinking about your inward manifold and your out manifold. So, essentially, this comboism does have a direction, and that direction tells you what your map here is going to be in the algebra, vector space, and you have your linear map right there. So, okay, so this is the super basic definition of what a DQFT is. And of course, Adida axiomatized DQFTs. Tikhovtis. This is an old paper by now, but still very valuable. He actually wrote a certain number of axioms. I'm only going to go through the ones that are very, very important for us right now. Not that the others don't play a role, but just to, you know, just as a presentation strategy here, is to just talk about the ones that we need. Okay, so first one is that, what does the first one say? So we have a glued cobaltism goes to Goes to composition of linear maps. So essentially, it's saying that it does what we want because up there, you have going to try to point with my pointer. So up here, we have our, well, we have a repetition of what was in the form in the previous slide. We have a sigma naught goes to a vector space, sigma one, another vector space. And now we are gluing a different cobodism here. And eventually we get to sigma two manifold, which goes to a third vector space. Sigma 2 manifold, which goes to a third vector space. So the interesting part of this axiom is that if you compose the linear maps that result from evaluating the cobodisms, you are going to get, you do this composition, you are going to get the same results as if you look at the whole glued cobordism as a whole, and then you evaluate the TQFT on a hell, what does it give you? So that MN here refers to the already glued. And here refers to the already glued cobodism. And it's essentially the same. It does what you want. It does that, that when you evaluate the TQFT on your glued cobodism, you're getting the same result as if you composed linear, did first the evaluation and then composed those linear maps. So that's important. That's important for us. You can see why we're talking a lot about gluing and we want things to be well defined. Okay, now another important Now, another important feature of our axiom of TQ of Ts is that the empty manifold gets sent to the ground field. Now, why is that important? Well, if that's the case, then I could consider any n-dimensional closed manifold as a covalent between the empty manifold and the empty manifold. There's a trick here because the empty manifold is a chameleon. So, who knows how that's hold here in Mexico? Who knows how that's called here in Mexico? But a chameleon is this little animal that just changes color when it's like, you know, if it's in front of a green tablecloth, it's going to turn green. So if you wanted to see here a boundary which is n minus one dimensional, this empty set is going to be n minus one dimensional. So it depends on the context. You can choose any dimension you want. So yes, we can consider n dimensional cobodisms from this n minus one dimensional. This n minus one dimensional empty manifold to this other n minus one dimensional empty manifold. Now we're evaluating our TQFT, and this axiom tells us it's going to the ground ring, this is going to the ground ring, and what I have in the middle is a linear map. But of course, if this is a, you know, now that linear map is a homomorphism from k to k, so you can actually identify that with a scalar. And what's happening here now is that this manifold This manifold, this manifold, the TQFT is assigning to a closed manifold, is assigning a scalar. And what does that remind you of? Well, that's a manifold, that's an invariant. And so that's a connection between this definition of TQFTs and manifold invariants. Okay, so a little bit of more category theory. So we are now considering the, if we want to consider the category of TQFTs. That the category of TQFTs, that we're going to think in a lot of lots of n-dimensional TQFTs, that category would have objects, n-dimensional TQFTs, and morphisms are going to be natural transformations of TQFTs. Okay, so now we are thinking about TQFTs of the objects, and then morphisms between them are going to be natural transformations. Remember that the title said catampist invariants and invertible TQFTs. Invertible TQFTs. So within all of the objects in this category, I'm interested in the invertible objects. What would that mean? So we know that there's a tensor product operation here. And what we want to see is that if I take a certain TQFT and I tensor it with something else, I want to be able to find its inverse. What would that mean when you multiply a number times its inverse? So you multiply this big. You multiply this TQFT times its inverse, what you want to get is the identity TQFT. So that's how you can search for at least identify when you're getting an inverse. Okay, so we have our objects, we have our invertible objects, and then we can go ahead and define what an invertible TQFT is. So an invertible TQFT is And invertible to QFT is, well, this is, of course, there's more complicated definitions, but this is pretty accessible, it's correct. So when you have an invertible to QFT, one feature is that when you evaluate it on one of the boundaries of your manifold, one of these n minus one-dimensional manifolds, what you're going to get is a one-dimensional vector space. And the invertibility has to do with the fact that. Has to do with the fact that the linear maps that you get when you're evaluating on the globalisms, those linear maps are invertible. So, those are two features, important features of the invertible DQFTs. And again, since you have this notion of tensor products, you have inverses, you have all of this, you can actually check that the set of invertible TQFTs forms a group under this tensor product. This tensor product operation. I'm going to be denoting that as TQFT, because it's going to be an N here at the beginning. That's because, well, just to keep track of the dimension of the TQFT. So that's my notation for the group of invertible n-dimensional TQFTs. Okay, so now for the pastor original theory. Now, for the first original theorem, is that all invertible figures of T's determine SKK invariance. So, that's put in words. If you want to put that into a little bit more mathematical language, you can, what we wrote down was this exact sequence. Now, it looks like it's nothing at the beginning, but let's analyze what this is saying. It's just a short exact sequence. The first, the middle term here is the group of n-dimensional invertible TQFTs. Invertible TQFTs, and then we have this subjective group homomorphism to work. So, what do we have here? So, we have a group here, home. And you can see that this is a group of invariants because this is just, you're taking things in SKK and you are evaluating those things into, well, we took the reals, there's a reason for that. So, it's real-valued multiplicative SKK invariance. Okay, but nevertheless, all of these things fit into this exact sequence. Maybe the easiest term here is obviously the kernel and what we could interpret what the kernel is by thinking of, well, actually TQFTs, you could think of the TQFT or even as a SKK invariant. But the thing is that something in here, if you look at it in this, what would happen in here. What would happen in here is that it would just be the zero. Well, we do multiplicative, so any invariant, any SKK invariant that evaluates all manifolds to one since it's multiplicative. Those are things that sit in the kernel. So we have this exact sequence. I want to give you a little bit, not the whole proof, but at least a little bit of notion of Notion of why that exact sequence is true, so some motivation. So, here comes an idea of the proof of that exact sequence. Okay, so here we have two manifolds, and this construction might look a little bit familiar from what we saw at the very beginning with cattle-based manifolds. So, you see, here we have manifold M1, manifold M2. Again, on this side, I have the same pieces, and I've glued via a diffemorphism. I'm using instead of like. I'm using instead of like just gluing, just gluing, I'm enlarging that gluing a little bit. So, what we see in the middle is a mapping cylinder, but essentially it's exactly the same construction. It's just that you've enlarged a little bit the part of the glue so you can see something. Okay, so those two things are cut and paste equivalent. Now, what happens if I take an invertible TQFT and I evaluate it on And I evaluate it on the first manifold. So, this is a cobalism again from the empty set to the empty set. So, I take my composed cobaltism that's composed of M1, the mapping cylinder, and the M2, and I take that and I evaluate. So, I get here a linear map. Since it's from empty set to empty set, this identifies with a scalar. Okay, so we have that now. So we have that. Now we're working multiplicatively. So I'm actually going to be dividing, but I could do the exact same thing with the other manifold and get another scalar. And I'm going to divide, but I'm going to divide by this. Right. Okay. So now let's use the axioms that we learned about a moment ago. So we know that this is a linear map. That is, if I scalar, but you can think, think, you know, this is a linear linear. You can think there's a little bit of like abuse of notation here. For some of the work that I'm going to be doing, I want to think of this as the linear map, but I'm still going to be getting like scalars all the time. So a little bit of abuse notation, hopefully doesn't, you know, still understandable. So, okay, so I know that the composition of these linear maps means that it's the same as the TQFT evaluated on each of the Evaluated on each of the pieces. So that's what I'm going to do next. Okay, so we do it on both the top and the bottom. There we go. And now we see that there are some terms that are actually the same thing. Since we're identifying things with scalars, we can reduce all of that. And what we get, what the result that we get is a, well, it's a result. And you can observe here that the philosophy behind this term is that it really only depends. That it really only depends on your phi and your opsi. So, this is an error term, an error term or a term that just depends on what the gluing diffomorphisms were because it only depends on the mapping cylinders. Right. Now, that could sound familiar because we have already seen terms that only depends on the gluing invariance. So, it really only depends on those diffomorphisms, phi. On those diffeomorphisms, phi and psi, and that's just exactly what happens with SKK invariance. In fact, if you remember the formula, the SKK invariance, which we call rho, I can take my rho and evaluate it on the first manifold minus the other row evaluated on the second manifold. And that doesn't give me zero, but it gives me this error term that only depends on phi m psi. This is now an skk invariance, and that invariance and that you see the you can see the connection from from between that and what we just done with the tqfts um details here details details this is done additively but of course you know here i'm working multiplicatively so that's why the minus sign becomes the operation of of dividing the okay so that's that's the idea of the connection between these between these things okay Okay, so here we are back to the exact sequence. The exact sequence is well, it relates those involved to Q of T's and the SKK invariants, but not just that, the sequence actually, the sequence splits. And I think that's an interesting feature of this sequence. And I wanted to spend maybe the last few minutes explaining a little bit why that sequence. Explaining a little bit why that sequence splits. Right, so let's get into that: the splitting of the exact sequence. Okay, so let's see. So the SKK invariants that we're considering, we're considering them multiplicatively and they are real valued. So that's our setup here. Now, the computation of that, of course, is connected to the computation of SKK invariance and computations that are known. So, real valued, we're actually killing some of the invariants. The semi-characteristic gets killed because the good line C2, we're looking at R right now, so no torsion. And let's see, so that guy with the star has to do with the Euler characteristic, but not just the Euler characteristic, not additively. We're composing with the exponential map because we're working multiplicatively. So, that would be this. So, that could be this is a group that could be the group as well generated by those invariants that are, let's say, multiples of the Euler characteristic compounds with the exponential map. That's for dimensions 4k plus 2. Now, in 4k dimensions, we have something slightly more complicated. We have this homomorphism from the cobaltism to the cobolism groups to the reals. And if you want to construct And if you want to construct the splitting, well, let's let me point on my slides. If you want to construct the splitting, we have in each dimension, like you have dimensions here, in each dimension you want to be able to prove this. So essentially, it's like a case by case or dimension by dimension splitting. And when you get to like four k dimensions, so in this n congratulation to zero module of four, you get two things to prove. Where you get two things to prove. And the interesting or the slightly more difficult proof comes from this subgroup here. But this is actually something that sits inside of this group. So we are essentially trying to see that the splitting works on this subgroup of that. The rest is not very difficult. Okay, so let's try to see how it splits on that subgroup of the cobalisms going to the Rios, the homes from going to the Rios. Rios, the homes from K to the Rios. So, what do we have? So, we have, say, some element in this home group. So, it's a cobalt invariant. So, we are given that. We don't care exactly what it is, but we are thinking of some invariant, non-trivial invariant there. We're given that. And since we're trying to find the splitting, we're trying to find the map back. We're trying to find something. You know, give me a cobaltism invariant. And then I should be able to construct an invertible to Q of T out of that. The QFT out of that. Okay, so in order to do that, we're going to use the following fact: that the 4K minus one dimensional cobalism group is finite and is finite of some given order. Of course, depends on which dimension you're here. So, for example, I don't have to give an example, but this is a fact. It's some order. I don't want to make a mistake. I don't want to make a mistake. So maybe, maybe no example. But it is true. It is true. 4K-dimensional probabilism gives you an infinite group. But this is of order L, whatever that order is. So what does that mean for a group? So you have your representative, one representative in here, and that's going to be some 4k minus 1 dimensional manifold. And of course, it's a group and it's of order L. So if I And it's of order L. So if I take that representative and I take L copies of it, what am I getting? I'm getting zero in the group. What does it mean to be zero in the cobalt group? Well, what it means to be zero in the cobalt group is that something that is zero bounds. So something that is zero has a four k dimensional manifold that has that thing as a boundary. Right, okay, so I'm choosing this manifold that is in here, this psi here. This side here, and suppose that this order was two. Suppose that that order was two. So now I have two copies of the same thing, and I can construct this four-dimensional manifold that has these two things of boundary. And that's connected to the fact that we have a certain order. Okay, so that's part of the trick here. Now, suppose that I have this random 4K. Random 4K dimensional probabilism, and it has boundary. So we are going to have a bunch of incoming boundaries and a bunch of outgoing boundaries. Not necessarily, you know, these things could be different from each other. So that's the notation, sigma i's, sigma j's, they could be interest different. And now with this knowledge of the fact that 4K, the 4k minus one-dimensional Copolism group is finite, I'm going to be able to construct a closed manifold. A closed manifold out of this one. And the way to do that is what I'm going to do: I'm going to take L copies of my cobaltism. So in the picture, we said L was going to be two. So now that's where you see two copies of this cobaltism W4. And now, since I have two copies, now this, I choose, for example, this particular sigma, but I know since the group has order or L in this in this. has order order l in this in this picture it's two i know that i'm going to have its it's you know it's uh it's it's its corresponding other uh manifold there so i'm going to be able to construct these bounding manifolds out of the out of the fact that i have enough copies of the of the of each of these boundaries and i do that with all of them and now you see here that the result is now a closed four-dimensional manifold so now i've been able to construct from the original Construct from the original W, I've been able to construct some 4K-dimensional manifold which is closed. So now result is a 4K-dimensional manifold. And I'm calling this manifold, I'm going to call it CW. And CW, well, choice of words here, because it's like you're. Of words here because it's like you're closing off your manifold, your coordination, your W, you're closing it off in this way, right? Um, since it's a 4k-dimensional closed manifold, it could be very well a manifold that's a representative in one of those of those cobaltism classes. So that's my CW sitting in four k-dimensional cobaltism. And now I take the original invariant that I had, I take my psi there, and I evaluate it on that manifold. And I evaluate it on that manifold, and that gives me a real number. So, from with that construction, you can define the homomorphism. Remember that now this xi is something that lives in here. So, you're going to be able to take S of Xi. Now, you're getting a TQFT. And now, what does TQFT do? It evaluates things on the coordination. So, we're going to be able to evaluate it on our original. Able to evaluate it on our original W. And that you can identify with the coordination invariant, evaluate it on your closed manifold, but you are counting too much because here you had taken L copies of this to in the picture. So if you just say it's equal, you get, you know, you're getting you're counting too much. So that's why there's this power here, you have to take the power of one over L so that you don't. L so that you don't kind of like double count everything, okay? And uh, well, okay, so of course, this now you can check that it does satisfy the axioms of the degree of t. So you can say, see that this actually is an n-dimensional degree of t and you can put in the work. That's the easy part of the argument, just doing the check. It's actually done carefully in our. Actually, done carefully in our paper. Um, the checking that this composite actually gives you the identity on the original manifold, so you can check that this is actually a way to see the splitting of the exact sequence. I don't think so. Oh, okay. Uh oh, that's actually true. Oh, that's actually true. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it is at least closely related to it. Okay, so the source of chi is in 4K dimensional globalism. For us, we were working mostly with oriented manifolds, so yes, it should be point-dragging classes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, true. And yeah. And yes, actually, that's true. One more thing I wanted to say is that, of course, this is not of course that it's a, it's a, the construction is not, it's not canonical, you know, you could, it depends on choices. But that doesn't mean that the sequence doesn't split, it's just that it's not a canonical way of, you know, you could, you could, it depends a little bit on choices. So is there any way in which, so you're saying it's not canonical, I agree, it depends on choices, but is there any way in which Is there any way in which one might try to formalize that it would be natural? Because I don't really know what the structure is around that you might be natural with respect to, if that makes sense. Yeah, it does make sense, but I don't know how to make it natural. Yes. So, yeah, I guess I don't know what the word natural would mean in the terms. Well, you know, there's something to talk about, but I don't think it's something that we were able to formulate. And, you know, to just say we did, we did find the splitting, but then, of course, just thinking. The splitting, but then, of course, just thinking a little bit more. We even have an example of making choices and seeing why it's at the very least not canonical. But is there any other way of going around this splitting and getting some other constructions that maybe he has even has better properties? Could be, could be, could be. So, well, we're almost like here at the end of the talk. We're also kind of close to the end of the time. So, kind of close to the end of the time. I wanted to mention a little bit more about SKK. And so, there are SKK, as you probably by now realize, is an interesting group in the sense that it's a big group. It's a rejection to COVID-19. So, in a sense, almost anything that you would like to see from COVIDism is something that's also interesting in the SKAK world. There are other interpretations in the literature that coincide. Interpretations in the literature that coincide with SKK. In fact, this is the first one, it is very old. It was proved by Reinhardt. So they said this isomorphism between this geometric version of the cat and paste version of the group and Reinhardt's vector field bodies on groups. So that's what it is. There's also an identification. This was done by Boxed and Spain. Oxid and Spain. And it was also proven maybe in a slightly easier way by Johannes Ebeth, this connection between the SKK group and this kind of like homotopy version of spectrum here, the MTSL spectrum. Again, probably unreadable from the back. There's a reminder here of what MTSL is. You just, you know, you have just, that you have the construction of the MSL spectrum, you have your canonical bundle and everything. For the NTSL spectrum, what you're taking is the author. Which are taking is the orthogonal complement of that bundle. Anyway, so long story here. It's a very serious papers to do this identification here, but it's very interesting to see that just as with cobalism, you get kind of like the geometric version of the group and the more homotopy theoretic version of the group. And interestingly, as you see, all of these, I've written isomorphism, all of these groups actually coincide when you are talking in the When you are talking in the, when you, when you, you know, it's non-equivariant, these groups coincide, no problem. But a little bit like what happens with the Cobodism, what we were already hearing yesterday, is that when you take a, say, you know, a finite group, you take a finite group and you try to look at these groups with manifolds with a G-action. Well, you can define equivariant SKK or GSKK. You can actually. You can actually define equivariant vector vis-voltism. There is an interpretation of this, but pretty recent by a student, Gergen Six, a student of Soren Galatius. His thesis was about giving a good interpretation of this spectrum. It's a genuine spectrum of this spectrum with the G-actions. So there's a very interesting framework right now for asking the question of how do this Asking the question of how do these groups relate when you have a G-action? And this is something I'm working on right now. It's known, there's some papers from the 80s, maybe in the literature, that already tell you that equivariantly, these things do not coincide. And depending which conditions you put on your group, maybe you get isomorphisms up to some extent. But just as we saw yesterday, in the docs yesterday, there's kind of like a equivalent, there's a mismatch. This kind of like equivalently, this mismatch between the geometry and the homotopy theoretic version. Um, so that's what I'm trying to figure out now, you know, correct definitions, trying to see a little bit how these things work. And of course, one of the main difficulties is transversality, maybe, you know, that's already from the basic definitions and seen how these things work. It's the fact that transversality doesn't work equivariantly just kind of like halts this is. Just kind of like hurts this isomorphisms quite a bit. But yeah, it's a kind of exciting student topic to see how things relate. And yeah, spoiler alert maybe for maybe, maybe, maybe, or maybe not spoiler alert for Renee's talk. She's working on a topic that sounds similar, but it's not the same. And computations of like spin versions of these SKK groups. So that's a different. So that's a different way of thinking of things equivariantly. For example, here we're thinking of oriented manifolds. You could just as well think of spin manifolds or other tangential structures. It doesn't mean exactly the same of what I'm doing, of trying to put group actions on the manifolds geometrically. Okay, so I think I stop there. Thank you very much. Hey, thank you, Parmen. Any questions for Parmen? Okay, should I take this off? Yes, yes. Because you mentioned this paper about Boltzmann Spain. Is it the same paper geometric interpretation of groups? It's probably that one. We can look, we can no migrate. Also, in this paper, there's a way to find the fundamental group of the coherent category that we can understand as the automotive group of the category of fractions. So maybe as you are giving a way to interpret it. Giving a way to interpret a TKFT, but either infer to only once. So, well, but I think we just have to go to the spectra as well. Yeah, exactly. And maybe we can just make all the contour that's a really good question. So maybe Arun knows quite a bit about this. So, but there is a data of Christian priests where. Freeze, where he talks about this MTSL spectrum and vertical TQFTs, and somehow you could essentially extract this connection with SKK from that paper, in a sense. His framework is, you could say, more powerful because he can do extended securities. And I think that the you know, understanding the question that's it. I think that's that's a good question. So I think that's that's a bit question for people. Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is good. More questions? Yes. I was just wondering if sort of interpretation is SKK. Let's see. So maybe something to think about in literature about SKK is it's not that much. So, you know, like, of course, if you compare it, like, not groups of literature. So you can extract the things from there. The things not there, but there's not a lot of so maybe like seeing that geometrically on the SKG because it's something that it's not it's kind of like something should be there, but it's not written out exactly what it would be geometrically or what would be like from the current base of the squash. So I don't think it's written. You were talking about invariance of the signature, so manifolds are assumed to be simply connected? Not necessarily, not necessarily. So it's so the straightforward forward answer is no, you don't need simply connected kinetic. But maybe maybe you're thinking about something in particular. In particular, uh for advantage usually, if you don't you if your manifold is not simply connected, you you have to consider the well I think that maybe that maybe the point is that uh the point that uh okay maybe I should go back to the very very original very little slide yeah so so Yeah, so I think that, right, so like even here in this notation, it was Fernando heard yesterday very beautiful picture about this where you saw the phobolism, you're sort of like swimming in a different space. In that sense, you would need to keep track of like, you know, what's the group of that ambient space, and then you would be like pulled back, those, those, like that, that action. So that's right. So that's right. In our groups here, what I'm considering is essentially reference to a point. Just like this, this proposition groups. Ordinary computations would be getting with reference to a point. The the the original reference of the four author paper, the of Os above Garas, Craig, Nomad, Nomad. Both above Garris, Craig, Nomad, Noma, NASA, they do some computations, or at least they also define the framework of all of these groups for, you know, with reference maps to a certain space. And of course, then the computations are not so key. It's a very interesting thing to consider, which reference next to someone else. But that was maybe a little bit of in what we did with this. In what we did with this. Thank you. More questions? I had a question. So you worked over R. Can you do this over C? It's problematic. It's problematic because of the. Oh, is someone is maybe I just answered? Let me ask. Oh, so there are questions on Zoom? Okay. So, there are questions on Zoom, okay. Maybe I can answer, yeah, answer my question. Yeah, so, um, let's see. So, the question was: uh, you get a problem because then this is actually discussed in our paper, it's a slightly long explanation, but you get a problem with the object of the semi-characteristic state because the semi-characteristic doesn't give you a it doesn't give you a state. So, if you want to consider this. So, if you were going to consider this over C, then somehow your formulation of the Short Example sequence would be possibly different. Somehow, C star is not simply connected? Like the units and C is not simply connected. Okay, so I think there are maybe questions on Zoom. Yeah. Anyone on Zoom, you can chime in now. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Is there a way to modify the argument in the proof of the exact sequence between the SKK groups and the invertible TQFTs to get something relating more general TQFTs to SKK invariants, so not necessarily invertible TQFTs? That would be great. I think that the argument depends a lot on the fact that you get invertibility because of this. You know, you can see in the motivation. This, you know, you can see in the motivation. I'm scrolling back to the slide that I want to point out. You know, when you look at this idea of the proof, it seems to be like very, very, very, like, very ingrained in the idea of how we are relating these groups. The fact that you need invertible, because if you didn't have an invertible dqft, then, well, you know, essentially you're dividing, you're essentially dividing to two numbers here. And if this is not invertible, this could very well be zero. So, you know, you know, you. zero so you know you know you would frighten the calculus students when it was zero so so i think it's very much ingrained in the in the in the in this connection that it has to be invertible so i have my talk i have a kind of sophication oh that's so cool i i actually know this like you could think we work together julia is going to talk about a collaboration with with mona and with uh george rapstis and that i know nothing about Yeah, that I know nothing about. So now I'm super excited about that. So, you know, tune into Julia's stop. Definitely, maybe she answers your question. Awesome. Thank you. Again, I think the category, you can always use the category of fractions. And that you have any coverage category, you can use the category of fraction instead of in order to define the invertible TQ of T and then well. Invertible to QFT, and then well, you can see the chimera relation and in the context. In with that, you can just extend all this procedure to anything. That sounds really cool because let's hear Julius talk. And maybe let's speak a little bit more later about this. It sounds like a very interesting question. Any more questions on Zoom? Just a quick follow-up. Just a quick follow-up. I'm sorry. In the argument, it sort of feels like you're using invertibility of the linear transformation somehow, well, very strongly. But the fact that it's a scalar, maybe not as much. So maybe not invertibility in the categorical sense, but maybe invertibility on the linear transformations. That would be, I don't know if that's something that's worth thinking about. I'm not sure. That's worth thinking about. I'm not sure if that's even. Yeah. Well, anyway, yeah, thank you. The answer is I don't know about, but it seems like Julia should be here and got lots of ideas on this. Yeah, thank you so much. Great. So I think that's most of the questions. I'm sure you'll get more after. So I think we have coffee until 10:30. Week, we have coffee until 10:30, so that's about 25 minutes. And yeah, enjoy.
