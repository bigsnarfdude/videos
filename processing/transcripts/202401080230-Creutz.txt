Okay, welcome everyone to the afternoon session of today. And our first speaker is going to be Brandon Krauts from University of Canterbury in New Zealand. Yeah, and the title of the talk is Degrees of Points and Varieties over Hence Alien Fields. So, yeah. Great. Thank you very much for the introduction. And also, thank you to the organizers for. The organizers for inviting me to speak here. I'm very, very excited to be here. So, the talk that I'm going to give, this is all joint work with Bianca Vere, who's at the University of Washington. And so the title is Degrees of Points over Henselian Fields. I've decided that I'll talk mostly about degrees of points over piadic fields rather than the more general setting of Hencelian. Rather than the more general setting of Hensalian fields. Basically, just to kind of simplify things and reduce the cognitive load a little bit, everything that I have to say just about will work over Henselian field, meaning the field of fractions of a Henselian discrete valuation ring. But I'll just focus on the p-adics for the most part. And maybe a little bit more motivation to kind of situate this in the context of the In the context of the workshop. So, this is really about points over local fields. But I think sort of the main motivation here would be new directions and rational points over global fields. But of course, one of the main tools we have is local global type principles. And as we saw already earlier today, if you want to understand what's happening in the global case, you first need to dig down and understand what's happening locally. And in some sense, that's how this. And in some sense, that's how this project got started. We were interested in zero cycles on certain kinds of varieties over global fields and started looking at some examples computationally over p-adic fields. And we discovered something that was a little bit surprising, or I guess I'll tell you what it was in a little bit, and you can decide for yourself whether it's surprising, or maybe I'm just a little bit naive. And then, and then, once we sort of encountered this, we wanted to figure out what was going on. So that's. Wanted to figure out what was going on. So, that's what this talk will be about. So, let me start off with a little bit of notation. So, I'll let X over K be a variety over a field. And I'm going to define three sets that are going to feature in the talk. So, the first In the talk. So the first, what I'll call S of X over K. So the S, the S is for like splitting fields or something. This is going to be the set of field extensions of K for which we have a closed point on X with that residue field. So this is the set of finite extensions L over K such that X has a Has a closed point with residue field L. Okay, so I don't claim that I can actually compute this set in all but maybe the simplest examples, but it should carry a lot of information about the arithmetic of x. So the next set that I want to define is d of x over k. So this is. So, this is what we'll call the degree set, and it'll be the sort of main thing that I'm going to be talking about today. So, rather than looking at all the fields themselves, we just want to know about their degrees. So, this is the set of all degrees of closed points on X. So, here L over K is in S.        If you had two conjugate lines which meet in the point, it may have index one because it has just the one rational point. Index one because it has just the one rational point where they intersect. So that's where that comes in. Okay, so this is the situation over finite fields. You get all sufficiently large multiples of the index. And this is true over global fields as well. So this is the next result that I want to state for you. So this is the situation. Well, let me just state it here. So if. So if X over Q is regular and irreducible, and again, you want the dimension to be positive, right? Obviously, this kind of statement couldn't be true if the dimension is zero, dimension positive. Then again, the degree set. Is a co-finite subset of the multiples of the index. Okay, so this is, I'm not claiming this as my theorem. I don't know exactly who is best to attribute this to. I think something like this has probably been known for quite a bit. I think something like this has probably been known for quite a while. You can find a proof in a paper by Gabber, Liu, and Lorenzini, which I'll mention again a few more times later in the talk. And they prove this more generally for any, not just Q, but for any Hilbertian field. Okay, and I'd like to sketch the proof to give you a sense of how. Give you a sense of how this goes. So the first step is really to reduce to a simpler case. So it's pretty straightforward to reduce the case that it's not just irreducible, but in fact, geometrically irreducible. So if you pass to some unramified, well, so not unramified, some appropriate extension to get one of your components defined over that field, then you're in the position of. You're in the position of just working with this geometrically irreducible component. Okay, and then the next step is to reduce to the case where it's not just any variety, but in fact a curve. So you can reduce to the case of a geometrically irreducible curve C. Call it C okay, and right the idea is: you know, once you've got your component defined here, if you've got some points, maybe these are some closed points, some closed point of degree two, some closed point of degree three, you can find a curve which passes through these points. Your curve, you know, your curve may be singular or something, but you can arrange that those points, those closed points on your variety lie. points on your variety lie in the in the smooth locus of the curve and and then you can you're not you're not claiming that this curve is proper or anything so you're just going to take the the the remove the singular points from this curve okay so this these closed points should be some closed points whose gcd is the index of this variety x and so basically what you've done is find a curve with the same index sitting inside your your variety right so so maybe i mean the reduction is is that that uh I mean, the reduction is that x contains such a curve with index t over q equal to the index of x over q. So it's enough to show that this curve has closed points whose degree is all sufficiently large. Is all sufficiently large multiples of that index. Okay, and so then to do that, you just use you use essentially it's Riemann Roch. So for this curve to have this index, say call it I, right, means that it has some divisor of degree I. So there exists some divisor of degree I on this curve. And then And then you're going to use Riemann Rock on the Riemann Rock spaces associated to multiples of this divisor. So by Riemann Rock applied to these divisors and D, or maybe to the spaces L and D, we find functions Functions from the curve to P1 of degree n times I for all sufficiently large n. Okay, so D is some divisor which realizes the index, and then you're going to apply Riemann Roch here. Okay, so now you've got maps of degree ni, and we're working over. And we're working over this field Q. So Hilbert's irreducibility theorem gives us infinitely many points of degree ni. Okay, so use Hilbert's irreducibility theorem. Okay, and then the remark: I think I maybe already said this, but this same proof or this idea for the proof works for any Hilbertian field. So, in the case when the field is not perfect, you have to do a little bit. Field is not perfect. You have to do a little bit more work, but the details are certainly in Gabrieloo and Lorenzini. Okay, so that's the situation over finite fields and Hilbertian fields. So then what I want to talk about really in the rest of the talk is over piadic fields or        This is defined over Q. Okay, this is a genus 2 curve. The condition here, so this is a, sorry, this is meant to be a cube, not a square. This is a quadratic polynomial in X cubed, and this condition says that it actually factors as a product of two linear polynomials in X cubed. So this polynomial on the right has some. This polynomial on the right has some roots of degree three over q. And so you're going to see that you get basically what I want to do before doing the local thing is compute the global degree set. So from the degree three roots here, you're going to get points of degree three. So you're definitely going to get that three is in there. And well, you've got a double cover of P1, so two is. Double cover of p1, so two is also in there. So you've got these two relatively prime numbers, so you know the index is one. Uh, and if you come back to this to this theorem, basically playing with with Riemann-Rock, and you figure out what sufficiently large actually is, depends on the genus. And in this case, this is enough to conclude that actually you get all integers at least two, right? So this turns out to be. So, this turns out to be. Well, at this point, I haven't proven that it doesn't have any rational points, but it in fact does, and it has a local obstruction at P. Okay, so you get all integers greater than one for the degree set there. And so, if you look at the degree set, I can do it up here. Yeah. If you look at the degree set. If you look at the degree set over Qp, well, we find again that it contains two, three, four, but there's some integers it doesn't contain, so it's not locally soluble. And we found that it didn't contain five or seven or 11. You know, you can fill in what's going here. So all of this is just done, at least initially, was computationally on some example that looked a bit like this. Example that looked a bit like this. And this to me was very surprising. I don't know if you think it's surprising or not, but this curve defined over Q has infinitely many quintic points, say, but it has no quintic points over Qp, which is not what you'd expect. And so, what must be going on for these quintic points over Q is that there's some local condition that the prime p has to split, and in fact, has to split as a Fact has to split as a prime of it's a good thing it's a chalk talk, yeah. Um, okay, and similarly for 7-11, and we couldn't go much further. Um, so this was the kind of example we wanted to understand. Um, maybe I'll put over here, I have one more example that I'd like to refer back to. Refer back to later. So I'll just write it up here: it's C prime py squared x squared plus p times x to the fourth plus p. So here the degree set. Oh, this is wrote X. This should be a C. Sorry. Okay, so the point is, in this case, you know, you check that it doesn't have any rational points, but for all larger degrees, we could, at least all the ones that we checked, we could find points. So this is sort of more in line with what you would expect based on. Based on the theorems for finite fields and Hilbertian fields. So, the goal was to understand this example a little better. So, any questions before all right. Okay, so um what I'll tell you about before I tell you about how to to compute this this degree set is how you can go about computing the index. So here's a theorem, which maybe I'll call the index theorem. Maybe I'll call the index theorem. And there's a number of people that I'll associate to this. So there's a paper by Polio Tolen and Saito, a paper by Bosch and Liu, and then another, Gaber Liu. Blue Lorenzini. So these were, I think, sometime in the 90s, and then this is like 2013, maybe, came a bit later. Did things in a more general context. So the idea is, of course, you want to talk about. Is of course, you know, you want to talk about points on p-adic fields, so you're going to work with some kind of proper regular model over Zp. So this is proper, flat. What else do we want to assume? X is regular and the generic fiber. And the generic fiber is geometrically connected. And write, we're going to look at the special fiber. So that's X of F P. So as a divisor, we'll write this as a sum of some components with some multiplicities, like this. So here's the picture. There's spec ZP, and you've got spec FP spec QP. So here's the generic fiber is in some sense the object that I'd like to talk about. And then your special fiber, you know, maybe looks something like this, where these are the irreducible components, which are my EIs, and each one. Eyes, and each one may appear with some multiplicity, etc. Okay, and in fact, we take the index of the regular. You take the index of the regular locus of this. So, you know, this theorem would allow for my components to have some, you know, singular points or something like this. Okay, now the value in this is that computing the index of some varieties over finite fields ought to be a lot easier as we talked about. And so you can sort of work this out in most cases where you have such a model in a fairly straightforward way, and then you've pieced it together. Way, and then you've pieced it together to get the full index. Okay, so let me say a little bit about what goes into this theorem, the proof. Um so the I think the the argument of of of Bosch and Lou gives gives um so you prove to prove this you prove that these are equal by proving you know they each divide one another um so they give they give one direction of this and the idea is if you And the idea is: if you have a closed point on the generic fiber, the degree can be computed using intersection theory on this variety. So if you take your closed point on the generic fiber, if you look at its closure in all of x, then you get some cycle of codimension one, and the degree. The degree of this point is going to be equal to the intersection multiplicity of this cycle with the special fiber. Okay, and then the point is that the special fiber you write is this sum here. So, this is going to turn out to be some kind of. So, this is going to turn out to be some kind of sum of the form involving some mi's and some p intersect the EIs. And the point is that these terms here, well, I guess that's going to break up again as a sum of the individual points of intersection over Qp. Points of intersection over Qp or Henselian field, it'll actually intersect in a unique point, which is the reduction. But so this is going to turn out to be the degree over Fp of some closed point, say here, whatever, some point like that. Okay, so whatever the degree of a closed point on the generic fiber is, it's going to be some linear combination of these numbers. Or I should say that it's. Or, I should say that it's uh, it's not equal to this degree, it's a multiple of this degree. So, maybe I'll write it like this. Okay, and so this tells you that the G C D in the in the theorem will divide the index of the generic fiber. This doesn't. Yeah, and this doesn't actually, the argument doesn't even really require that spiadic field. This just works in general. Yep. Yeah, this is some closed point of degree D. So, you know, if you like, you can draw. You know, if you like, you can draw it like that or something. Does that make more sense? So it's a point whose residue field is some extension of QP, it's not a QP point. So the EI are irreducible, but not necessarily geometrically irreducible, components. This drawing is better like that or something? Is it better like that, or something? So when you take P, if it's a closed point, and if the field is Senselian, then the it could be at a singular point. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'll come to that. That's a key point. So I will later. I will later, but at this stage, no. So maybe here's a. So this is the argument of Bosch and Liu, something that Gabrieliu and Laurentini did to kind of beef this argument up, is that in this context, you can always find a cycle that's rationally equivalent to P, which avoids the singular locus. Yeah, and that's, you know, I'm not. And that's that's you know, I'm not going to use that, but that's that's their contribution, really. Okay, so the argument for the other direction, I think, first appears in this work of Kula Tlin and Saito. And so, there, the picture that I have in mind. The picture that I have in mind is the following. So you've got some point X, so given X on the special fiber, a closed point on the special fiber, which is a smooth point on the reduced special fiber. So it's not one of these intersection points, and it's not some point where one of the components itself has a singularity. They show that there exists some. They show that there exists some point P on the closed, so this is a closed point on the generic fiber with degree. So this component, say, has multiplicity m, whose degree is actually m times the degree of that closed point x. X. Okay, and the idea, I'll maybe come back to this a little bit more later, but the idea is that if you look at the scheme X there, so the whole model X, at that point locally, it should look like it's given by an equation of the form t to the m, where m is the multiplicity times some unit. Some unit times p. Okay, so locally here means, I guess, you know, if you look at the completion of the local ring at this point, it should look something like that. And so you take some unramified extension of this degree to get a point that's rational there. And then it'll be given by an equation like this. And to solve this, you basically need to take something like an mth root of something. So that gives you the m. So that gives you the M. All right. And so this should tell you that the index of so for any number like that, I can construct a point like that so that the index should in fact should divide the GCD and the theorem. Should divide the GCD and the theorem. Okay, so let me look at the two examples that I had above and see what this. And see what this theorem that I'm erasing says about it. So, in this case, the minimal regular model looks like this, where all of the components are P1s, and the multiplicities are. Are the following. Okay, so this is the special fiber of the minimal regular model of that curve there over Zp. And so what that theorem says is that in this case, the index should be one because you have components with multiplicity two in index one and multiplicity three in index one. So the G C D of these is one as the index, which we already knew. Is one is the index, which we already knew because we found quadratic and cubic points. And the argument here, if you follow it through, it allows you to construct lots of closed points, but all of the closed points that you get come from a component of multiplicity two, three, four, or six. And so the proof basically only tells you that you get. Basically, it only tells you that you get 2n union 3n. So you can get multiples of 2 and multiples of 3, and it's not clear that you'd get anything else. For the other curve, the special fiber looks like this. Okay, so some components, multiple cities two, three, and four appearing. And so again, it would tell you the proof there tells you that you're going to get points that are multiples of two and multiples of three from these components. But of course, in this case, we know that there are quintic points and septic points by direct calculation. Calculation. And so, what you conclude is that if you have a quintic point, it has to reduce to some of these singular points. So, if you want to know where those quintic points go, you have to see what's happening at these singular points. And similarly, I guess the other way around is if you want to know why there are no quintic points here, you have to figure out what's going on at the intersection points there. Okay. So I can get to stating our result. Let me let me define. So for with notation, as I had before, for a close. As I had before for a closed point on the special fiber, I'm going to define n of x to be the sum of m i n as the i is ranging over the components which contain which contain x. Okay, so let me just give you the example to show you what I mean here. So if you look at this point here, where these two intersect, it lies on two components. One has multiplicity two, the other has multiplicity six. So n of x would be two n plus six n. And so for me, n is natural numbers, does not contain zero, but this is all numbers that are two times a positive integer plus six times a positive integer. A positive integer plus six times a positive integer, so the smallest one is eight, and then you can get 10 and 12, and so on. Okay, whereas maybe one more example, if we do this point here, n of x is 2n plus 3n. And so the smallest integer here is 5 and then 7. Seven, eight, and then nine, and you can get everything else. Okay. So the theorem, so this is this is joint with Bianca is so with notation as in As in the index theorem, and also the assumptions: regular, irreducible, geometrically irreducible, generic fiber, etc. And what we want to assume, in addition, that the special fiber has strict normal crossings. Okay, if you know what that means, great. If you don't, all the pictures that I've drawn have strict normal crossings. But then the theorem is that the degree set of the generic fiber can write as a union over the points in the special fiber of so for each point you look at. So for each point, you look at its degree over Fp, and then times n of X. So that's the formula for the degree set. And each one of these terms appearing here depends on some X. This is the set of degrees of points reducing to X. Reducing to x. Okay, so you're really computing the degrees of all the points which reduce to each particular x, and then you take the union over all the closed points on the special fiber. Okay, so if you come back to the examples, you see what's different here is that whenever you have two components which intersect, their multiplicity. Intersect, their multiplicities have a common factor. So here they have the common factor 2, and here they have the common factor 3. And so these sets n of x are always going to be contained in either 2n or 3n. And so you don't get any new points. And so in fact, this set is equal to 2n union 3n. So you miss out on all the primes bigger than 3, which is what we were seeing. Seeing computationally. Whereas in this case, so you're going to get degree two points, say, from this component or from that component, and degree three points from one of these degree three components. And then you get degree five points reducing to here, and seven, eight, nine, and so forth. So in this case, you actually get that the degree set, I'm sorry, is everything. Is everything bigger than one? Yes, yeah. And the proof is a little bit easier, but we definitely make use of this. So it has a stronger hypothesis. And the theorem is not true if you don't have the SNC hypothesis. If you don't have the SNC hypothesis, it's easy to write down an example where that fails. Okay. All right, so I want to give one corollary of this, which is that if you Which is that if you fix the genus, there are only finitely many possibilities for the degree set of a smooth proper genus G. A smooth proper genus G curve. And for g equals two, you can actually work this out. So it's one of the So it's one of the following. Either you have rational points, in which case you get all degrees, but all degrees larger than one. There are curves of index two, and then it can be two n union 3n. And there's the example that felt very weird, but now you understand it and it makes sense. But now you understand it and it makes sense. It's sort of what I want you to take away. So, how do you get the corollary from the theorem? It's basically some kind of classification of the possibilities for a minimal regular model. And in genus two, at least for small characteristics, small residue characteristics, there's an explicit list due to AUG, Namikawa, Ueno, et cetera. And that's where, you know, that's where actually. That's where actually you can find these. I mean, you can compute these. It's not too hard to compute them by hand or using magma or something. And in higher genus, there's no explicit list, but there are some results about the finiteness of the sort of possibilities for how things come together. And if you go through that list, you can work this out. Okay. So maybe I have about three or four minutes left. Is that right? Yeah. Okay. So maybe I'll just very quickly try to say something about the Very quickly, try to say something about the proof. So, here's the sketch of the proof of the theorem. So, the main point was to. The main point was to focus in on these singular points. So I've assumed strict normal crossings. So any of the singular points on the reduced special fiber are going to be where two components meet. And the idea, maybe I could write this out more precisely. So if X is a closed point on the special fiber So, I'm just going to look at the case first, or maybe only, and then I'll wave my hands at the other case, but with residue field FP, so it's an actual rational point where these two meet. Then locally, what this scheme looks like at x, so if I look at the local ring of x at x, after taking the henselization, After taking the Henselization or completing, I guess it's very similar in the Pieta case, this will be isomorphic to something that looks like the equation, an equation similar to what I wrote down before. So let me just write this down. So if the two components are, say, multiplicity m and multiplicity n, you get an equation like s to the m t to the n minus n minus up so this is the the hensilization of the polynomial ring in the variables s and t over zp and then this is like the equation defining the the variety at that at that point and so i mean where this isomorphism comes from is okay this is as in the picture when it's say a curve if it's a higher dimensional variety you'll have more variables but the same Dimensional variety, you'll have more variables, but the same applies. This is the basically coming from the strict normal crossings hypothesis. And then once you know that, you're basically trying to solve this equation. And it's, well, it's, I don't necessarily really have time to go through it, but there's really nothing challenging. You just find that the way to solve this is basically you can find a solution over, if you take a dth root of this. dth root of this, if d is some integral linear combination of m and n, then you can find a root over the field obtained by taking a dth root of this uniformizer here. And the only real subtlety that I'm sort of glossing over is this unit here is not a unit in Zp, but actually a unit in this much larger ring here. So you have to do a little bit of So, you have to do a little bit of extra work there. In the paper, we just argue using the Weierstrass preparation theorem that you can basically handle it all. But that's, yeah, maybe that's where I should stop. Thanks, Brendan, for a nice talk that had almost everything. For a nice talk that had almost everything that we could imagine. But yeah, so the theorem that I stated just doesn't have any, there's no requirement on the dimension. The one thing that's dimensionally dependent is the strict normal crossings hypothesis. For curves, you're guaranteed such a thing exists and you can compute it. In higher dimensions, I don't know. Yeah. Anybody else? So, this is maybe a short one, maybe not. So, what if I wanted not just the degree of the extension, but I wanted to know something about the Galois group of the extension? Would this be adaptable to any problems of that form? So, I could say a little bit in that the extensions you get, there's naturally some. Extensions you get, there's naturally some unramified part coming from having to get a k-point on the special fiber, and then the rest of it is totally ramified. And if you can make this isomorphism explicit, you can actually write down the Eisenstein polynomial that's giving the extension you want. I don't know how to make that so explicit, but that would be the thing to do. So at the start. So at the start, you also define the set S. Can you say anything about the S's in all of these scenarios? Yeah, so in the finite field case, really knowing S and knowing D is the same thing. So there, it's okay. In the p-adic case, it's similar to what the question that was just asked: you want some more refined information. It really comes down to knowing at the particular point. I mean, if you can make this. Particular point. I mean, you can make this isomorphism explicit. It's giving you the polynomial defining the extension. I haven't really looked at it. Yeah, I think maybe in some examples you could probably do something. I'm not sure what a general statement would be, but yeah. Any more questions? So, if I understood the difference would be you might allow an inseparable base change of the residue field or Ah, so I guess for me, for me, so if I could understand, if I had this example here, if I didn't have this condition on the discriminant, these two components would actually be one component and conjugate. And conjugate. And I would say that's not SNC. It would only become SNC after the base change to the quadratic extension. And the theorem, as stated, wouldn't be true prior to doing that. But it's clear what to do to you would blow up to get it to be SNC, and then the theorem would apply. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So if these two were conjugate, you'd actually have index two. Yeah. Yeah.
