For the invitation and for their work on organizing this event. So, I will talk about convex bodies of constant width with exponential elimination number. And this is motivated by study of Borsuk's number, which is the smallest integer such that you take any set of diameter one. Of diameter one in n-dimensional include space, and you can split it, or equivalently, you can cover it by this number of sets of smaller diameters. So if you look at the simplex, regular simplex, you cannot, if you take two vertices, you cannot cover them by anything of smaller diameter at the same time. So it needs to be at least n plus one. And Borsuk asked if it actually is equal to n plus 1. It actually is equal to n plus one for all dimensions and proved that himself for the first crack cases, which was later followed by Perkal, who established the affirmative answer in the three-dimensional case. But as usually happens with high-dimensional problems, our intuition fails and the And the asymptotic lower bound, which is exponential in root n, was first established by Han and Kalai. And then the base of the exponent was improved by Rygorotsky a little bit. So when n is large, this means that the answer is negative. And right now, there is a separate question like finding of the smallest end when this fails. Smallest, and when this fails, and the current record is 64. So, there is a 64-dimensional counterexample. So, that's about lower bounds. So, we have this exponential in root n, lower bound. So, how about upper bonds? So, for the upper bounds, we have two results: one by Schrum and the other one by Borgain and Linderstrauss, which show an upper bound. show the an upper bound of root three half to the power n. So there is an exponential upper bound. And to illustrate the difference, we can look at the simplest case, say, of triangle on the plane. So the approach of Schram was essentially covering the triangle with smaller homothetic copies. So in a way, we are employing the fact that if you take a small That if you take a smaller copy of the set, it's similar to the set and that may allow you to cover a lot. And the approach of Borgain and Linderstrauss is to use disks or balls, if it's n-dimensional space of smaller diameter. And a ball is good because by the it's among all the sets of having fixed diameter, it's the set that has largest volume. Volume. So these are essentially how this estimate was proved, two different methods. And let's look at the details. So if we denote by G of n this quantity of the smallest number of balls of diameter smaller than one needed to cover arbitrary set of diameter one in n-dimensional space. It will, this G of n will upper bound B of n. And first, by the res from the results of Rogers. From the results of Rogers, it follows that one can prove this exponential bound with root 2, and Danzer showed that there is an exponential lower bound of this quantity. So the behavior of G is exponential. And then this was followed by Borgen and Linden Schraus, who improved both the upper and the lower bound. So they established the upper bound of root three-half power n, and they also improved the lower. Also, improved the lower bound, and we will return to this lower bound later in the talk. Now, the other approach, the approach that Odek Schram used relies on the concept of illumination. So if you have a convex body in n-dimensional space and you take a point on the boundary and you consider some direction, ψ. So that point will be illuminated by the direction. Will be illuminated by the direction ψ. If you start a ray at that point and just go in the direction, in that given direction, that ray has to have interior points of the body. So in our case over here, all these blue points are illuminated, but all these black and even those two that are on the sides will not be illuminated because this ray will miss the interior of the body. Interior of the body. So, this is what we will say illumination. This is the concept of illumination. And the smallest number of directions that one needs to illuminate the whole boundary of the convex body, we will denote I of K, and we'll call it illumination number. So, if we now denote H of K, the smallest number of smaller homothetic copies of the body, like if you recall the picture with triangle. Like, if you recall the picture with triangle, we use three smaller triangles to cover the triangle. So, that's generalizing that we introduce this quantity fk, h of k. So, Boltiansky showed that this is equivalent, that I of k always equals h of k. And the intuition here is that, say, this blue part, which was the part that's illuminated by that direction, you essentially, if you shrink your convex body a little bit. Your convocation body a little bit and move a little bit in the direction opposite to the direction of illumination, it will pretty much cover that part that is illuminated. But one can take care of those pretty much like these inconsistencies by using compactness because we only have finitely many directions or finitely many translates. Okay, so this is related. We'll come back to this later, but there is a well-known problem, Levi-Hadwiger, Gochber, Marcus. Well, this suggests some people who are often associated with this question is to establish what's the smallest value of the elimination number or equivalent of this number of smaller homothetic copies needed to come. Copies needed to cover the body. One can see that for the cube, it's two to the power n, but the question is if this is the worst case. So is cube the worst body in terms of elimination? So this is still wide open, as only was done in the planner case when n equals to two. So we'll get back to this a little bit later in the talk. Now, to see the relation with the Borsch. Borsuk's problem, which deals with sets of finite diameter, we need the concept of bodies, convex bodies of constant width. So if a projection of your convex body onto any line, any one-dimensional direction has the same length, then we say that the convex body is of constant width. Or equivalently, you can look at two supporting hyperplanes, which are parallel. They have to always. Parallel, they have to always be the same distance apart. And the relation is that once you have an arbitrary set of diameter one, you can extend it. You can find a bigger by inclusion set, which is going to be a convex body of constant width one. For example, if you have equilateral triangle, like just the vertices, say, even just the vertices of the triangle, and you build Triangle and you build like these three arcs. So you take one vertex as a center and build this arc, and build these three arcs. That will be the well-known Rillot triangle, which is probably the most well-known example of convex body of constant width, which is different from a ball. That means that for us, if we are studying Borsuk's number, it's sufficient to only look at bodies of constant weight. So we look at convex bodies of constant weight. At convex bodies of constant width, and if we can split them or cover them by pieces of smaller diameter, somehow that will give us an upper bound on the Borsuk number. And this is precisely what Schram has done. So if H of n is the smallest, is largest number is the largest elimination number or the number of Number or the number of covering by hermothetic copies, smaller homothetic copies of a convex body of constant width and dimensions, we have the upper bound. And Schram has shown an upper bound of root three-half to the power n on this quantity and also on the Borsuk number. So unlike for the case of covering with both, the only known lower bound was the same as for the Borsuk number, which is that exponential in Which is that exponential in root n. And Jul Kalai asked if there exists an exponential in n lower bound on this quantity h of n. And our main result is that we answer this question in an affirmative. So there are convex bodies of constant width which have exponential elimination number. And to show And to show, to explain the idea of the proof, we begin. So here, just note that cosine pi over 15 is smaller than one. So this thing is indeed bigger than one. We do get some constant that's bigger than one here. So our main ingredient for this construction, so we actually show the examples of these bodies, well, with some probabilistic arguments. With some probabilistic arguments involved, is the following. Take unit sphere, take unit sphere, and fix some angle alphas. If you have a point on the unit sphere, and you take also the points which a distance took a sine alpha from that fixed point x. So that will be this bottom point. So this is what we will call qx alpha. So this is the basic ingredient that we will. Ingredient that we will use to construct our counterexample. And another way of looking at this is cones. Like you can think that from the origin to x, this is your axis. Alpha is the angle. And you just have the cone where x is the apex and the angle is alpha. So that will be like all the points that form the base, the base of that cone. So we have the apex and we have the base. And we have the base, and this is our main ingredient that we will use to construct a body that's not going to be well illuminated. So we also need some more notations here. So theta is just the angle between two directions, directions of x and y. And if x and y are from the sphere, this is just geodesic distance. And the CX alpha. And Cx alpha is the spherical cap for X on the sphere. The cap of radius alpha on the sphere will be known as Cx alpha. So again, here alpha is measured along the sphere. So our main geometric ingredient is the following lemma. It says the following. If you have a convex body which has a diameter. Which has a diameter equal to two cosine alpha, which was also, if you recall, the diameter of our basic element of this vertex and the base of the cone was also had diameter to cosine alpha. And if it contains this Q, then the point X is on the boundary in, and any direction that illuminates the point X has to come from a specific cone of radius pi. Of radius pi over 2 minus alpha. So we do have a certain spherical cap, and only the directions from that cap may illuminate that point x. So the proof of this lemma is actually quite simple geometrically, because if you have a vector psi that's not in this, not in this cap, then the angle from that psi to the line from the origin to x is going to be. From the origin to x is going to be big. It's going to be bigger than pi over 2 minus alpha. So if you look at that two-dimensional plane through this business, through x and xc, in that two-dimensional plane, your cone, this qx alpha, will have two more points. And we can choose the one which is like, say, here, if we have a counterclockwise direction from c to minus x, we'll continue in that direction. And there will be a point y. Will be a point y so that this angle yx0 is going to be alpha. So all together, all together, you'll have an angle which is bigger than pi over two. So if you look at the half space through x in the direction yx with the normal vector yx, the vector c will be on the opposite side. And of course, because we have the diameter. Of course, because we have the diameter of our set k equals to the distance between y and x, you can build a ball of radius to cosine alpha that completely contains x, centered at y, and that ball is inside the half space, so c is in the opposite half space, and it completely misses the interior of our convex body. So, that's the these are the ideas there. So, once we have that, Once we have that, what we will do, we will take a union of finitely many such sets Qx alpha. So we'll vary X and we'll take in union of finitely many of them. What we want to do is to control the diameter of the union. And that is achieved. So here we'll be taking the union. And this is achieved by the following separation lemma. So basically, if we can control So, basically, if we can control the angle between the points, then we can achieve that the diameter of the result is not big, it's still two cosine alpha. So we need kind of six alpha separation between the directions of the points. The proof of this is just triangle inequality for the angles. And after this, after we're done with that, we just need. We need the following. So we need to choose actually the set X. We need to choose the set X capital. And it's done with the help of the following lemma. So if you have an angle phi, which is between 0 and pi over 2, you can find this many, like root n over sine phi to the power n. So here and everywhere below, if I have a constant. If I have a constant without any other specifications, then the standard means it's an absolute constant, which doesn't depend on anything else. So if you have an angle, you can find this many points, which are phi separated. So there is separation of phi. And every point of the sphere is covered by no more than n log n caps of radius phi centered as though. Radius phi centered as those points x chi. So we call this thinly spread subsets of the sphere. They are spread because there is separation between them. And it's also in a thin way because each point of the sphere is covered by not too many caps. And that number over here that bounds the number of our points is essentially just one over measure of the spherical cap. So if you if you take Spherical cap. So, if you if you take probabilistic measure on the sphere up to an absolute constant, this expression is just that measure, so it's natural in some sense. And the proof of this lemma relies on a result of Borodsky and Winscher, which is an adaptation to the spherical case of the results of Erdős and Rogers, where they are constructing coverings of the space of the sphere with. Of the space of the sphere with controlled this quantity so that each point shouldn't be covering, should be covered too many times. So we start with that set, and for that, you just take, it's enough to take uniformly distributed random points on the sphere. And we remove some of them to make sure that the property A is satisfied. So, this is the general scheme. So, this is the general scheme of the proof because if you just take that, you might have two points that are too close. So, you need to remove the points that are too close. So, now the proof of the main result is just an application of that lemma to 6 pi over 14. And 6 pi over 14 is because, remember, from the separation lemma, we needed 6 alpha separation. So, if you choose alpha equals pi over 14. Alpha equals pi over 14. This is like six times bigger. So we take that thinly spread subset of the sphere, we construct these cones, take their union, we get a set which has the same diameter, and then we extend it to convex body of constant width. And after that, again, why was it 6π over 15? Because remember from the illumination lemma, from the The illumination lemma from the geometric ingredient, the size of the caps from which the illumination directions have to come was pi over 2 minus alpha. So we have to have that pi over 2 minus alpha equals to 6 alpha. So if you solve that, this is where pi over 15 comes from. So basically, after this, the elimination number is bounded just by the number of elements of our thinly spread set divided by the Divided by the thinness or density of this cover. So that's how we get this root n log n in the bottom over there. And of course, it's going to be true without that if you take any smaller exponent. So this is the proof. And shortly after we published a preprint of our work, Alexei Blaziri noted that you can push the value of this exponent. The value of this exponent a little higher by taking the basis of the cones, not from the same sphere, but to take slightly smaller sphere and concentric. So apexes will be taken from a bigger sphere, basis from the smaller sphere, and by technical computations, you can optimize the parameters involved and push this a little bit to get a little bit higher value. Value. Now, another application that we have of this thinly spread subset of the sphere is a new lower bound on G of n, which let me recall is the number of balls of diameter smaller than one that one needs to cover arbitrary set of diameter one in n-dimensional space. So, Bergen and Linde-Strauss had this bound immediate, rather immediate application of Application of lemma 3 is the following bounds. So we improve the value of the exponent from 1.06 to roughly 1.15. And this 2 over root 3, you can easily guess, right, that this comes from pi over 3. So you just need to use lemma 3 with phi equals pi over 3. Now, there is no need for the basis of the cones. You only use the upex. The cones you only use the upper axis, so you just use the upperxis. It's easier to control the separation if you want to control the diameter. You just need two alpha, essentially pi minus two alpha separation. So this is what we do. We take alpha pi over six, then two alpha is going to be over phi, which is pi over three. And then the diameter of the resulting set is going to be at most root three. And the thing is that if you take And the thing is that if you take a spherical intersection of unit sphere with a ball which has diameter root three, you get a spherical cap which is exactly of radius pi over three, which is exactly pi over two minus alpha in our case. Okay, and it's it's equal to phi as well. Okay, so we get the same, it's the same story. We have this many caps, we divide. We have this many caps, we divide by the density, and we get the following results. It's rather immediate, and the key here is that again, spherical caps here are intersections of smaller ball with the sphere on which our counterexample lives. Now, we actually prove a little bit more precise version of the existence of the seamly spread subsets on the sphere, so with slight abusov. Sphere. So with slight abuse of notation, I will denote mu phi the measure, the probability measure of the cap of radius phi on the sphere. So what we actually prove is the following. Here we take psi separation and phi covering. So we introduce second parameter. So we want the centers of our system of points to be psi separated, but we are covering with But we are covering with caps of radius phi, and then we get the following lower bound. Now, if you just plug ψ equals phi, then this second term is smaller, and this is how you get the statement of lemma 3 that was stated previously. And in the general case, so now I will just say a few more words about the way this is proved. So, in the general case, So, in the general case, what we do is the following: we begin with a certain specific number of uniformly distributed points on the sphere. That number guarantees that with high probability, we will have property B. Okay, so just repeating a part of the proof from Brodsky and Winsha, we automatically get part B then. Now, with high probability, so the second thing we High probability. So, the second thing we do, we now have to control condition A. So, we introduce these two element sets of bad centers, of bad pairs. So, if two points are too close, either directly or pi minus. So, if they violate condition A, this is going to be our set B set of bad points. So, we know that a pair of points from this Y, because it was randomly constructed. It was randomly constructed, will be bad with probability p, which is just two measures of psi of psi cap. So we can calculate the expectation of the number of elements, of number of bad pairs. So it's bounded like this. And we can pick, now we pick a specific set which will have. Which will have a certain upper bound on the number of bad pairs. So after this, we just have two cases pretty much. If Pm is at most one half, that means that number of bad pairs is smaller than half of number of points that we have. And then you can just delete a point from each such bad pair, and you will obtain at least m over two points remaining, which is enough for our purposes. Which is enough for our purposes, and it will give this bound with n log n. Now, the case that's not as good is if Pm is big, and then we just need to do one more probabilistic construction. So we take a point from Y with certain fixed probability, and we can then calculate the expect. Calculate the expect bound, the expectation of having a good set. So, this expectation here, so this is the size of the subset that we considered, and this is the number of bad pairs. So, we can, because from each bad pair, we can remove a point, and then we get a good set. So, this is like expectation of a good subset. So, size of a good subset is at least one over 4p, and that will give you. P and that will give you the second term over there. So either one of these two cases will work, and this is how we get, this is the outline of the proof of the existence of this thinly separated subsets on the sphere. Okay, so now let's see some applications of this second term. So far we've seen only that first term. Let's see what this second term. Now let's see what this first term. Now, let's see what this first term can do. Note that it will be applicable, like if psi is strictly smaller than phi, then for sufficiently large n, this will be smaller, this will be, sorry, this term will dominate. And then what happens is n log n just cancels, and what you get is the lower bound on n capital in. Lower bound and in capital in terms of the measure of the cap, which is phi cap, which is up to an absolute constant, actually, is going to be sharp estimate on this number of such caps. Okay, so now we'll to see an application, we'll get back to illumination problem, to the classical illumination problem. So we'll just forget a little bit for the time being. For the time being, let's forget about bodies of constant weights. Now we have convex bodies. And we'll look at convex bodies that are close to a ball. So here Bn is the unit ball, and D is a parameter we denote by K and D, the family of all convex bodies which contain unit ball and are contained in a ball of radius d capital. So Martin Nassodi proved a very nice result that. Proved a very nice result that there are poorly illuminated bodies in any neighborhood of unit ball, so to say. So for any d close to one and sufficiently large n, the elimination number is lower bounded by an exponent like d to the power n and some absolute constant over here. And there is also an upper bound which has the same exponent. Which has the same exponent, also d to the power n, but some polynomial factor over there, this bound will be valid for any d bigger than one. So, for this range, essentially, this result shows the behavior of elimination number for such classes of bodies. So, we are really grateful to Carly Besdek, who asked a couple of weeks ago: like, what's the relation of Ago, like what's the relation of things that we do with this specific result? And that led to the material in the remainder of the talk. So to explain the relation, we need to look at the construction. So the construction here is that we take a discrete subset of slightly bigger sphere and this ball, the unit ball, and take the convex hull. And take the convex hull of the result. So, the so-called spiky ball. So, we take these blue points from slightly bigger sphere, sphere of radius d capital. So, we'll have this, the convex hull will consist of such cones. So, the difference here, here we have cones kind of on outside. When we were doing bodies of constant width, we kind of the cone was through the body. Here, the cones are on outside. So, we want the cones not to overlap because we want those cones. Because we want those cones to be the cones, because this is what will allow us to control the illumination. And so that the cones don't overlap, you need to alpha. If alpha is this angle, the size of that cap, which is the base of the cone, we need to alpha separation between the centers, between these directions. And for the illumination, you also it's easy to see that illumination. That illumination, directions that illuminate this point have to come from a cap of size pi over two minus alpha. So you see similarity to what was done before, but the bottom line is you need certain separation and you need to control how you need to control, like you have bigger caps with the same centers and you want to know how they cover the sphere. Like you want to know uniformly if this is stained. Uniformly, if this is stained, like if you take a point, how many times that point can be covered? So in his work, Martin also constructed a system of points which satisfies similar properties, but the construction was slightly different from what we do here. So using our theorem three, we can get the following. Theorem 3, we can get the following. When D is strictly between 1 and 2 over root 3, and n is sufficiently large, we get a lower bound with an extra square root of n factor. So we cannot, of course, improve the base of the exponent because there is an upper bound, but it is possible to get the extra root n and it is possible to extend the range of applicability. So here the upper bound to ND was roughly root 5 over. Roughly root 5 over 2, and we can push it a little bit higher. And this root n, it's very easy to see where it comes from because, as I said, n log n will cancel them. So we'll divide this number by this number. So n log n will cancel. You'll just have one over measure of the cap of radius phi, and that measure has one over root n, so that root n comes to the top. And this is how. comes to the top. And this is how you get the root n over here. If you want to push it to the value d equals 2 over root 3, then the other term will get in, and then you would have to divide. So it's possible to extend it to d equals 2 over root 3, but then one wouldn't have the root n, one would have that one over root n log n factor in front of d to the power n. So that's for the illumination. For the illumination, but the natural question is: what happens if we now try and do the same thing for the case of bodies of constant width, which are close to the ball? So, here we denote by W and D the family of all convex bodies which have constant width, contain the unit ball, and are contained in the ball of radius D. So, what we do is the following: for certain range of parameters D from one to certain. Parameters d from one to a certain number, as you can recognize pi over 14, and you know where it comes from now. We can show like our construction. So just that here we don't really, so the interest here is d close to one, of course, but essentially that means that lemma three, we had phi equal psi essentially. Here we will move them apart. So that's the difference, but still, like theorem. But still, like Theorem 3 works in that case and allows us to get this lower bound. And it's, you see, it's, of course, worse than for the elimination. Here we had the exponent d to the power n, but it's natural because the class of bodies is more narrow, right? And but is maybe this is just so constructing counterexamples are harder if you if you have an amonero. Harder if you have a more narrow class, but the question is: like, maybe we were just not doing well enough, but actually, we can show an upper bound with the same exponent. So, using certain control of how the unit normals for bodies of constant width that satisfy this condition, how those unit normals behave. It's not very hard to show that there is a. That there is an upper bound with the same base of the exponent, and this would be valid for any d bigger than one. So, essentially, we solve the elimination problem for bodies of constant width, which are close to the ball. And here, this number can probably be increased using the construction of Alexaglazirian. This probably can be increased a little bit. So, the range of validity of the Range of validity of the lower bound can be pushed up a bit. Now, we also, of course, can look at the same question for covering by balls. And here we'll denote by G of K, where K is a body from that class, for convex body of convex of constant width from that class. We can look at the number of balls which have diameters smaller than the width of the body that one needs to cover it. And we get a simple. It and we get similar results. So we get lower bound with the same form of the base of the exponent and an upper bound with the same form, with the same exponent. What I want to say is that in this last two theorems, the upper bounds were achieved in a universal way. So the set of eliminating directions or the set of covering balls, they were not. Balls, they were not depending on the body itself. They would only depend on the parameter D. So, like to establish this, it's enough to cover the ball of radius d capital with balls of diameter smaller than d plus one. And here, we just need certain, we need control of the angles, but pretty much the directions are kind of homogeneous. Are kind of homogeneous. They uniformly distributed on the sphere, and they will do the job of eliminating a convex body of constant width, which is in that ball. So we also, our lower bounds, they are true not only for the elimination of a covering by ball slate, you could. By both, like you could over here, we can construct examples of that both, if you try to mix and match, because if you are solving Borswak's question, you are allowed to cover by anything of smaller diameter. So if you mix and match and cover by both of smaller diameter and smaller homothets, you still cannot break through exponential lower bounds. So our lower bounds will be also lower bounds for such. Also, lower bounds for such mix and match approach, and it would be interesting if one can use that, but still, our lower bounds are far from root three-half. So, it would be very interesting to see if one can push this root three-half, perhaps take a part of the body of constant width and cover it with smaller homothets, and the other part would be covered with balls of smaller diameters. So, maybe that is possible. So, that's an interesting question. Although, like, I mean, this question, any method. This question: any method that will improve this bound would be of interest, of course. But what we have here is we have two different things, like there is this upper bounds of Schram and of Borgen and Linder-Strauss, and there are results on the behavior of elimination number and just this number G of K for the bodies of convex dance width close to a ball, they match. So it would be also interesting to see. Also, interesting to see if you have a body of constant width, does it have to be that the elimination number equals to the number of balls of smaller diameter needed to cover the body? Maybe if this is not true, maybe they are of the same behavior after some polynomial factor in dimension, because there could be some reason why we have like we are seeing the same results for these two different. Results for these two different methods, well, quite different methods on the first site. So maybe there is a relation. So I'd like to end with this. Thank you. Thank you very much. So we have time for a quick question from live people. Onliners, please just shout. Don't raise a hand. Just turn on your MICAND. Say your question. Meekend, say your question, remark, complaint. Okay, so that's okay. Check that. Yeah. All right. Thank you, Andre. Thank you very much for your talk. Thank you. And we continue right away with the
