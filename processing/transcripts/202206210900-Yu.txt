Okay, thanks, Isaqueo, for the introduction. And also, thanks. I want to thank the organizers for the kind of invitation. It's a pity that I cannot go to the conference in person, but hopefully things will get back to normal very soon and we can have regular, we can have normal meetings just like before the pandemic. Okay, as Isaguel said, today I'm going to talk about global surfaces of section. Global surfaces of section and periodic orbits in the spatial isosceles three-body problem. So, this is the joint work with Xi Jing Hu and two of his students, Lei Liu and Yuo. So, in the three-body problem, so when two of the masses are equal, there is an environment sub system now called where the where the three masses form. Where the three masses form an isosceles triangle all the time, so with the two equal masses symmetric with respect to the z-axis, while the third mass moving along the z-axis. Now, this system is, so if you consider a spatial problem, it is a system with three degrees of freedom once you fix the center of mass, because once you know the position of M1. Know the position of m1, then the position of m2 can be find through the symmetry. Meanwhile, the position as well as the velocity of the third mass m3 can be find through the by the fact that the central mass is fixed at a region. So, this is a picture of this isosceles three-body problem. Now, this is a problem. Now, this is a problem actually studied by many people. For example, when the third mass is zero, this is the so-called Sidnikov problem, as Terry mentioned yesterday. So it was studied by Sidnikov, Alexev, and Mosa, where the first examples of oscillatory motions were found and proved. Now, for the unrestricted case, it was studied by Dervini, Mocho, as well as Simo and Martinez. So, mainly these. So mainly they use, they mainly use, for them, they mainly use the McKihi coordinate and collision manifold to investigate all kinds of different orbits, in particular those getting close to triple collision. Now for Davini and Simon and Martinez, they studied the planar case and for Moko he studied both the planar and the spatial case and actually he also proved the existence of Proved the existence of oscillatory motion for the spatial case. Of course, not for all methods, but for some choices of methods. Okay. Well, in our case, our study mainly focusing on a periodic orbit, so the orbit will be bounded, not oscillatory at all. Okay. Now, here we first make some standard coordinate change. So Change. So we're introducing this mass matrix M. So we make this coordinate change as here. So the purpose of this is basically to standardize the kinetic energy. Now in our case, actually, it's more convenient to working with the cylindrical coordinates. So we further use, introduce the cylindrical coordinate, which is RC times Z. So this is a normal cylindrical coordinate. So in this case, we get corresponding. So, in this case, we get corresponding LaBlange. Now, using the Legendre transformation, we can find the corresponding conjugate variable PR, P theta, and PZ for R, theta, and Z. So, in this case, then we get the corresponding Hamiltonian H. Now, as we can see, clearly, the Hamiltonian is independent of the angular variable theta. So, the angular So, the angular momentum is the first integral along the solution. So, if we fix the angular momentum, so in our case, actually, the angular momentum is just P theta. So, it's the variable P theta. So, if you fix it to be omega, then what you get is you get a reduced Hermione Tronian system with only like two degrees of freedom. Okay, so our main focus will actually be studying this reduced Hermione. Should be studying this reduced Hamiltonian system. Okay, so now we will study periodic orbits of this reduced Hamiltonian system. Of course, those periodic orbits will corresponding to relative or reduced periodic orbits of the original isosceles three-body problem after modular rotation respect to the z-axis. Okay, now first we have this result. First, we have this result if you fix the further fixing the energy. So you get some results, which is essentially due to Boca's paper in 1984. So for the case when the energy is negative, we have these four different types of the energy surface. Okay, so the first case is the energy surface, it's just empty. The second is just a point. The third case is the energy. Point. In the third case, the energy, the surface is homeomorphic to a three-dimensional sphere, S3. Now, in the last case, the energy surface became unbounded, particularly along the Z direction. So actually, when you are looking for oscillatory motions, you have to study the last case. But for us, we will actually focus on the third case. So throughout the talk, we will always assume the parameters that The parameters satisfy this condition, so that the energy surface is homeomorphic to a three-dimensional sphere. Now, actually, you can find a contact form on this energy surface corresponding to the vector fields of this reduced Hamiltonian. So, therefore, it is possible to apply results and techniques from contact topology to study this problem. But, of course, this is not what we do. But of course this is not what we do in uh in our paper in some sense. Okay, so this is the first results in our paper. So we prove that there are like two, there are two disk-like global surface of surfaces of sections, which is given as sigma plus and minus. So essentially if you look at it on the configuration space, if you look at the projection of this of those two global surface, it's just Global surface is just corresponding to an interval on the horizontal line. So the configuration space now for the reduced Hamiltonian system is basically half plane. So the vertical variable is Z and the horizontal variable, which is R. But here, R is always positive. So it's a half plane configuration space. Okay. Now, so we can find these two global surface subsection. Of course, for people who are not familiar with Of course, for people who are not familiar, we have the definition of global surface cross-section given here. So, so we are only so for us, so if you have a vector field which is non-vanishing on the three-dimensional sphere, so this is then so a global disk-like global surface of section, so it's an embedded closed two-dimensional disk, which satisfy the following three conditions. The first is that the vector field is tangent to the boundary of Is tangent to the boundary of the disk, then the secondly, the vector field is transverse to the interior of the disk. The last condition is the most crucial one. So, if you are, it says that if you start away from, if you have an orbit starting away from the boundary of the disk, then it always comes back to the interior of the disk as time goes forward or backwards. Okay, now here's Okay, now here is a picture of those two global surfaces of the section when you have the mass parameter. So, beta is the mass parameter. So, E here is actually the eccentricity of the corresponding OLA orbit. So, actually, if you look at the boundary of those two global surface of section, but actually it's nothing but the OLA orbit. So, for the isosceles three-body problems, you get this OLA orbit, which you know. Get this all L orbit, which you know, all the three bodies is essentially on X Z plane, X Y plane, so on the horizontal plane. Okay, now once you fix the energy and the angular momentum, now you get essentially one, you get a unique OLA orbit with a corresponding eccentricity, which is determined by the energy and the angular momentum. Okay. Now, okay, so there are some previous works, of course. So, there are some previous works, of course, which even goes back to the work of Hungarian and Burke by this idea of global surface of section. Now, there are also some results by Connolly and McGehee from the 1960s. So, where they constructed, they find some global surface of section for the planar circular restrictory body problem and use them, they find some periodic solutions. Now, then recently, there are some also. Recently, there are also some works by those people. They use like Albert, Fish, Thunfield, Hofer, Von Cot, and also von Cott and Marino. So they use the technicals like holomorphic curves from synclectic topology to find the global surface obsections for both the planar circular restricted three-body problem as well as the spatial circular restricted three-body problem. Now, in our case, actually, the existence of those two global surface subsections is actually quite straightforward to see, as I will see maybe after later in the talk. Now, the idea is we want to use this global surface observation to find out all kinds of different periodic orbits. So, now to distinguish those different periodic orbits, we will need to use introduce the Hughes region. The Hills region. Now, the Hills region is what you get when you project the energy surface to the configuration space, which is essentially the half-plane I mentioned earlier. Now, as you can see that here is a picture of the KLS region, which corresponding to different values of the energy H, when you fix omega, the angular momentum and omega and. The angular momentum and omega and the mass perimeter as those. Now, okay, so when you look at the Hills region, we know that the mass the particle has to move inside the, for the given energy and angular momentum, it must move inside the Hills region. Because if you go outside of the Hills region, because of the conservation of energy, then the kinetic energy has to be negative, which is observed. Observes. So, as well, if you look at the boundary of the Hills region, you get so-called Hughes boundary, and this boundary is actually corresponding to the zero velocity curve. Because once, when you are at the Hills boundary, the potential energy is precisely the total energy. So, the kinetic energy as well as the velocity must be zero. So, on the Hughes boundary, you get something called a breakpoint. Something called a breakpoint with a zero velocity. So, of course, here we are talking about, we see it is zero velocity for the reduced system. If you're moving back to original system, you still have angular velocity respect to the z-axis. Now, if you have an orbit which have two different intersections with a huge boundary, now clearly what you get is you get a special periodic orbit we call break. Periodic orbit, we call break orbit. So essentially, the orbit travels between those two different break points, but along the same path. Okay, so you get a periodic orbit called break orbit. Now, if you look at this picture here, you can further divide the hills region, the hills boundary into two different connected parts, two different parts. So depending on the sign of the z. Depending on the sign of the Z variable, basically, you can divide into the up half Hills boundary and the lower half Hills boundary. Of course, for the up half, you have a positive, you have a non-dictive Z. On the lower half, you have a non-positive Z. Very. Okay, now with this, you can further classify the break orbits into what we call the type 1 break orbits and the type 2 break orbits. So for a type 1 break orbits, the For a type 1 break orbit, the break orbit will travel between the up half kills boundary and the lower half kilos boundary, as you can see in the third picture here. Okay, now if you now for the type 2 break orbit, the break orbit does not travel in between the up half and the lower half Hills boundary. So as you can see in the fourth and the fifth picture in the figure. Picture in the figure. Okay, now, so this is the different type of break orbits. Now, there is another symmetry that we can use to further classify the, to distinguish those periodic hobbies. Now, if you look at the Hamiltonian, the potential energy here is the V omega, it is symmetric with respect to the Z variable. So, what you can get is actually, if you have an orbit which hits. is actually if you have an object which hits the horizontal line which is where the line z which is corresponding to the z z equal to zero line so if you hit it horizontal orthogonally so then you have the p r equal to zero then what you do is you can extend the orbit by just reflecting reflect it respect to the z-axis so you get a symmetric what we call z-symmetric orbit so the precise relation can even So, the precise relation can be given by this identity here. Now, what you can get is, for example, if you have a break orbit which happens to be Z symmetric as well, so we get what we call a Z symmetric break orbit, which is given in the first picture here. Okay, now the first now actually here you can see that if you have a Z symmetric break orbit, it must be type 2. So, it must go from up half to the lower half. Lower half. And if you have a type 2, it can never be symmetric. Now, of course, there are also periodic orbits which are only this symmetric, but not break, which is given, which is given in the second picture here, in the figure. Now, the last one is some periodic orbit, which is neither break nor the symmetry, the symmetric. Okay, now we, the first result, the second result we have. The second result we have, or the first result we have about the existence of periodic orbit is we can always find a Z-symmetric break orbit, which starts from the up half-hills boundary. Then as Z goes to, then Z will decrease monotonically, then it will hit the horizontal line orthogonally. Then you get like Z symmetric, the symmetric orbit just reflected respect to the horizontal. Reflected with respect to the horizontal line. Okay, so this is the simplest symmetric break orbit we can get in the sense. And actually, such an orbit will form the hop link with OLA orbit inside the three-dimensional sphere that we have for the, which is the energy surface in our case. Okay. Now, so we use the, so this is the simplest periodical, but you have. Periodic orbit we have. Now, to get more orbits, the first thing we notice that you can, with the Pongarium return map, we can define with the Pongari return map, you have an area preserving homeomorphism from the interior of the global surface of section to itself. Okay, but what you can do is now you actually can extend this map continuously to its boundary. Continuously to its boundary. So, in the third theorem, in the third result, we show that you can extend this map continuously to its boundary. So, basically, to the OLA orbit. This is something not, it's not always possible if you look at the general Hamiltonian system. Okay, in our case, we can. We are able to do it. Now, with such like such area preserving homeomorphism, so such a map, now this map, this homeomorphism. Now, this map, this homeomorphism is defined on a closed disk. Now, in the previous results, with this break, this symmetry break orbit, we actually also have a fixed point of this. So, because this break orbit actually goes through the global surface of section, okay, and the intersection of it with the global surface of section, which we Global surface of section, which we denote it as this zeta BZ. We call it BZ, it is as we call it the symmetry break orbit. So this point is actually a fixed point of this map G. So now you have like an area preserving homeomorphism on a closed disk with a fixed point. If you further blow up this fixed point, then you actually can get an area preserving homeomorphism. Area preserving homeomorphism on a closed annulus. Now, with those two, with this closed annulus, now of course, if you restrict this map to the two boundaries of this closed annulus, you get two orientation preserving homeomorphins. So who has well-defined rotation number? Well, the two boundaries of the annulus corresponding to, so one of them corresponding to the Ola orbit, the other corresponding to the break Z, to the Z-semi. Break Z to the Z symmetry break orbit. So we define the rotation number of those two orbits correspond as the rotation number of the map of this area preserving map on those two boundaries. So if you are assuming those two rotation numbers are different, so basically it's a choice map, choice condition, you can prove that the following two types, following four different types of break orbits, you all have them, they are all infinite, they are all infinite many. Are all infinite? There are all infinite many of them of these four different types of. So the first one is this symmetry break orbit. The second one is a type 1 break orbit, but not this symmetric. Not this symmetric. The third one is a type 2 break orbit. The last one is a non-break symmetric break orbit. Okay, but all these are under the condition that we have this twist condition. But unfortunately, this condition is actually. Into this condition is actually quite difficult to verify analytically. But numerically, it seems not so difficult to verify. For example, if we given the corresponding values of the parameter, mass parameter, and the angular momentum and the energy as those, then numerical computation shows that the rotation number of the Euler orbit is 6.89 something, but the rotation number. But the rotation number of the symmetry break orbit is actually 0.85 and 0.86, so which are clearly different. But as I mentioned, this just numerical, it's numerical verification. So here are some more examples of like more complicated this symmetry barrier orbits. So here S represents the number of Represents the number of intersection of the break orbit with the global surface of section in one period. Okay, now even though in the previous theorem, we have to assume this condition, but if you weakening the results of the theorem, so essentially if you only want to prove that there are infinitely many periodic orbits, we are actually be able to prove that generically for generic parameters. For generic parameters, they are always infinitely many periodic orbits. So, to be more precise, when you look at the dynamics on this energy surface, so it is determined by these three parameters. The first one, the mass, then the angular momentum, and the energy. But actually, so here we can replace the mass parameter to another mass parameter, which is beta. But actually, the Which is beta. But actually, so the parameter of the angular momentum and the energy, you actually combine together, form a single parameter, which is actually can be determined by the eccentricity of the Eula orbit. This is essentially due to the homogeneity of the embody problem. So the two parameter is essentially one parameter. This is actually something people know. Okay, this is actually something people know a long time ago when you study the integral, the topology of the integral manifold of the general embody problem, of course, the three-body problem and n-body problem. So in our case, as I mentioned, we always assume the energy surface is homeomorphic to a three-dimensional disk. So in this case, the two parameter has to belong to this region D. So it has to satisfy these inequalities. Now, the last theory, the last result we prove is that. The last result we prove is that this region has a dense sub-region, which we call DR, which has positive measure such that if the parameters are from this region DR, then the rotation number of the Euler orbit is actually rational. Then, actually, using some classical result by Frank, we can show that there are always infinite many. They are always infinite many periodic orbits. Okay, so those are the main results. Now I'm going to, I think I still have like 15 minutes to talk about, maybe I spend 10 minutes to talk about some of the proof. Okay, so the first proof is about the existence of the global surface of section. So as I mentioned, it is actually quite simple in our case. The proof is quite straightforward. So the global surface of section corresponding to a horizontal line. Of section corresponding to a horizontal line, as I mentioned, where the z variable is zero and pz is also equal to zero. And what you basically need to notice is that is this second order equation here, a second order ODE. So what it says is that basically if you have the mass M1 above the XY plane or above the horizontal line. horizontal line. So the grav, so the then the gravity gravitational force will always pull the 4M1 downwards until it pass through the horizontal line. But when it is below the the when M1 is below the the the the horizontal line or the xy plane, then the gravitational force will pull it up until it passes through. Up until it passes through the horizontal line. So, as we assume, as we are only considering the case, the energy surface is compact, you can show that the third condition in the definition of the third condition, which is the most difficult one to verify, is always satisfied in our case. So, this is how we can show that the sigma minus and sigma plus given defined before. Plus, given defined before is actually two global surface of section. So, this is the result we have in the current version, a current version of the paper that you can find on archive. But actually, during the reversion, we think we can prove a stronger result, which is the following. What we think we can prove, which will be given in the next version, is that the energy surface actually have an open, will actually have. have an open we have actually have an open book decomposition with the with the OLA orbit being the binding of the book now the leaves and the rest of the manifold of the anti-surface is foliated by the leaves given as sigma s so it's a family of disks and each of those page each of those disks is a global like global surface of section of this reduced time Of this reduced hymnatoning system. Okay, now for people, so this notation, this thing called this thing, this open book decomposition is something from contact topology for people who are not familiar here as a definition. So an open book decomposition of a closed-oriented three-dimensional manifold, M, is a pair of fibrous And the binding. So, where the binding B is a one-dimensional sub-manifold, and the fibration is over an S1 such that each fiber or each page is given as this. And all the pages has a common boundary, which is a binding. So, in our case, it's the OLA object is a binding. And we can find And we can find explicitly those pagers as here. Okay, now, so this is, we think we can prove in the next version of the paper. Now, for the other three theorem, so to prove the results, what we need to do is that I mentioned, we already have the map, we already have the boundary map defined on the interior of the global surface of section. Of the global surface of section. So we need to extend it continuously to its boundary. So, what the so to do it, we need to consider the linearized system, or the linearized system along the OLA orbit, which is given as this. So, this is the linearized system of the OLA orbit. So, BE here is just this diagonal matrix. Okay, so the system can be, so this linear system can be decomposed into the Be decomposed into the following two linear subsystems. Okay, now what we do is if you look at the second linear subsystem, now it is equivalent to this second order linear system. Now, using this, we can extend the map continuously to the boundary. What we do is that if you look at a particular point, so we are from the So we from the OLA orbit. Now, here we assume capital Te is the period of the OLA orbit. So if you look at a particular point on the OLA orbit with a corresponding bonding time T lin T0, so which one is T0, okay? So if you have a corresponding time with a corresponding time T0, now what you have is you look at this second order linear equation. Now with a corresponding initial condition at T0 as this. Condition at T0 as this. Now, this will have a new unique solution. Now, such a solution will have many zeros. So, of course, T0 is a zero. Now, we let T2 and T1 be the next two zeros after T0. So, what we do is we will map on the olive orbit corresponding to the time T0 to the point on the olive orbit. Point on the OLA orbit corresponding to time t2. So, this is how we define, extend the map from the interior of the global surface of section to its boundary, which is all out. And we can show that it is a continuous extending extension. Now, with such extension, so we get an area-preserving homeomorphism on the closed disk. So, if you then you restrict it to the boundary. It to the boundary, then you get an orientation-preserving homeomorphism, which has a well-defined rotation number. And as I said, we call this, we define this number as a rotation number of the ELA orbit. Okay, now so for the proof of the second result where we prove the existence of the simple is this symmetry bird orbit, the idea is basically from this picture. So, we use a shooting method. So, you starting. So you starting, you look at a sequence of initial conditions from up half fields boundary. Then you let it convert, goes to the left end of the boundary. You tracking the first time it hits the horizontal line. And the way to tracking it is again is to follow into actually to using the second order system, linear system we given before. Even before. Okay, what you can do is you can show that now those times will converge, we have a, we converge to a finite limit as you have sequence of initial time goes to the left end of Hills boundary. And you can show that the limiting time, the limit of the first time it hits the horizontal line, it converges to a time which is strictly smaller than the first time. Smaller than the half period of the OLA orbit. Therefore, what you know is that if you move a little bit away from this left end, so when you hit the horizontal line, so PR or R dots must be positive. It will going back, it's going right. It's going along the positive direction of the R axis. And similarly, And similarly, if you choose the sequence of initial conditions converging to the right end of the uphalf Hills boundary, you will know that now if you are very close to the right end of Hills boundary, and if you trace the orbit when it first hits the horizontal line, the corresponding value of PR or R dot will be negative. So in the middle, you will have a particular initial condition. particularly initial condition it when it first hits the horizontal horizontal line it must hit it orthogonally so then you get uh the you get a symmetric symmetric break orbit as we mentioned before so here this is a picture here so this is essentially how we prove the second theorem okay now as i mentioned with the second theorem you get a fixed point of the of the uh area preserving map on the global Map on the global surface of section. Now, what you can do is you can blow up this fixed point to get an area preserving homeomorphism on a closed annulus. So, this is, here we follow an construction basically from a paper by Franks. So, first, what you do is you introduce a map Per side from the standard disk to the two-dimensional. Disk to the two-dimension disk of the global surface obsection. Then you get a GTOTA, which is now from the standard disk to itself. Now, what you do is then you can introduce a map psi from this annulus with only one closed boundary to the disk without the region, with the deleted origin, as a map of this. Then you get a map. Then you get a map. If you using this phi, you contribute the phi with G charter, you get FG, so as this. So this is a map that you defined on this annulus, but with one open boundary. But then you can extend this map Fg to this boundary corresponding to S times zero in this way. Times zero in this way. So in this way, you get, as I mentioned, an area preserving closed map on a closed annulus. So it's closed on both boundaries. And one of the boundaries is corresponding to the OLA orbit. And one of the boundary here, so the boundary with corresponding to S times zero is corresponding is obtained from blowing up the fixed point. So it's corresponding to. Fixed point so it's corresponding to the break uh this image this image break of it and we have a rotation number which is the infinity uh ethical rotation number and we define this number as the rotation number of the symmetry brake object now here the is the now with this so once we we have the twist twist condition or the the diff we have the the condition that the two rotation and number are different then we can prove the result Then we can prove the results that there are all kinds of infinitely many different periodic orbits. So the way you do it is, again, you look at the Hills boundaries. So you further divide the Hills boundaries into, like here, the up half is B plus. So we divide it to B plus one and B plus two using this image break of it. And lower half to B minus one and B minus two. Okay, then what you do is you follow in the image of You follow in the image of those curves on the Hills boundary when it first hits the global surface of section, and correspondingly denoted them by C plus and minus I with I1 and 2. And also you have another curve inside the global surface of section, which corresponding to the where PR equal to zero, so which corresponds. are equal to zero. So it's corresponding to the symmetry curve. So basically all the three all these curves they intersect at the point where the symmetry break orbits the simple symmetry break orbit intersect with the global surface obsection. So once you blow it up you can get like six different curves connecting the two boundaries of the closed annulus. Now because Now, because of the twist condition, after you iterate the map enough time, those curves will intersect each other. And basically, essentially, because of this, you can prove there are infinitely many these type of periodic orbits. Okay, I think I have three minutes left. So, let me just mention that the last theory is basically proved using this result by Frank's. So, once you know the rotation number of the Ola orbit is ratio. orbit is rational, you know that there is at least one periodic orbit on the boundary. Then this theory of Frank said that then you can know you know that there must be infinite many periodical inside the in the interior of the annulus. So this is how we prove the result. Now here to prove the generic condition and the fact that the positive, the mass, the parameter The parameter type positive measure, we have to use the mean index to compute the, we have this relation between the mean index and the rotation number. And then here the proof are quite technical, so I'm not going to talk about details. So at the end, I'm just going to show the picture of this. So here is a map, a picture of the orbits that we have after iterating like 400. Like 400 initial conditions 500 times. So I think I'm going to stop here. Thank you. Okay, thank you, Goy. So there are questions? No. Okay, I have a question in the condition on the rotor. your condition on on the rotation number of uh Euler and visit in page 14 I think you have a no the follow yes this is a numerical computation but you can prove that you have the difference of this rotation in a numerical sense But you can say that these values are different for generically values of omega. No, no, we cannot say that. What we can see is generically, the first number, the rotation number of the ELA orbit is always rational. That's what we can see. It's a rational number. We can see it's generic. This number is rational. Yeah. We cannot yeah, that's what we can see in the in the in the in the in the in theorem four. In the in zero and four. Okay, thank you. More questions? Okay, thank you, Goe. Thank you, okay. Thank you. Okay, I'm going to stop sharing. Okay. So we continue in three minutes. So
