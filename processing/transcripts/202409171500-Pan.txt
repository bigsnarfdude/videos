I will talk about some observations of the connection between superconductivity and domain topology, and talk about some results on the existence of non-minimal solutions of Kensington-Lambda equations on multiple connected domains, and also on the massless states. States on multiply connected domains. Let me mention a little bit about the relation between superconductivity and domain topology. Topology of a superconductor has important effects on its superconductivity, which was shown by the lithopark experiments. And we also know that superconductivity has Tuberculosity has mutual interaction with electromagnetism, and the electromagnetism depends on the domain to approach, which was shown by the Hanunov-Born effects. Therefore, this known effects motivated our study on the effect of domain approach on electromagnetism and on superconductivities. And we know that. And we know that all such physical models are described by the partial differential equations involving the Q. And actually, we know that there is a relation between Q and domain topology. So, let me recall a few facts. Okay, let me just skip the little park and okay. So, suppose we have to. So suppose we have a domain omega, which is in the three-dimensional space, and assume that the boundary of omega has m plus one connected components. The number m is called the second bed number of the domain omega. And we also assume there are n two-dimensional manifolds, sigma j, such that removing this sigma j, the remaining. this sigma gene the remainder of omega is simply connected and the number n is the bd number and these two numbers m and n actually topological properties of the domain associated with these two numbers actually we have the so-called the space of neumann fields h1 which is the set of all field fields in l2 such that q of u equals zero direct Q of u equals zero, diversion equals zero in omega and normal component of u vanishes on the boundary. Here nu is the normal vector of the domain boundary. And we also have h2, where the boundary condition is tangential component equals zero. And in my talk today, I basically consider h1 and maybe we call it the space of Neumann field fields. Feld fields. And the dimension of H1 is exactly the M, the first BD number. Of course, the dimension H2 is M, the second BD number. Then we know that the divergence-free vector fields can be decomposed into the image of Q and H1 or H2, depends on the. Or H2 depends on the boundary condition. And my talk today, the second one is more useful. So let's look at this one. So Q of H1, or if you require the diversion equals 0 and normal component equals 0, then the image is H gamma, which consists of the well fields U such that divergence of U equals 0 is domain. divergence of u equals zero is domain and the integral of the normal component over each piece each component come connected component equals zero so this is an image of the queue and okay now we go to the ginzebecker lambda function of multiple connected superconductors and in the past many years the ginzebecker lambda systems are The Ginzburg lambda systems on simply coordinated domain has been very successfully studied with very rich literatures. In fact, among the participants of this conference, there are many experts in this field. And we investigate the effects of domain approach on the existence of non-minimal solutions of the Ginzburg-Lambda system or multiply connected. Or multiply connected domains, and we try to see something different. And my talk today is based on the paper published this year in GFA. Okay, let me talk about the energy. And suppose the superconductivity is described by the order parameter pi psi, which is a complex value function. Is a complex value function and a which is a real vector field. We call it a Psi odd parameter and A the induced magnetic potential. And the energy consists of two parts. The first is related to Pi. So this term is actually grading pi minus I lambda minus kappa A Pi, defined here, square minus Pi square plus what. Square minus Poisson square plus one half Poisson force. And these three terms are exactly the same as a classical Ginza picker lander energy. Now we have the integral for the magnetic part, magnetic energy. So you have lambda qA, which is induced magnetic potential, minus HE, which is applied magnetic field. And we have the integral of this term over omega. And let's mention that. And let's mention that in the classical Ginza Pegger lambda energy for superconnecting three dimensions, this term, the magnetic energy, is integral over the whole space. And in our study, we consider this integral over the domain omega to emphasize the domain effect. And actually, actually, this form of energy can be derived from the usual nano functional by letting functional by letting lambda q of a equals h e away from the omega outside omega and and this function of g loses the competitiveness through gauge transformation because this energ also has gauge invariance and because the domain may be multiply connected so this energy also lose compactness along the space h1 Along the space H1, the set of Neumann vector fields. Okay, so we're looking for the clear points of this functional on the space in which the vector fields are divergence-free and also going on to this set of Neumann space. As a result, the Euler-Lagalange equation will be a little bit different to the classical one. So the first equation is exactly the same as me. Equation is exactly the same as before. For the second one, and because Q of He may not be zero, so we may keep this one. And if Q of He equals zero, this disappear as people did before. But we have two terms, grading phi and H1. Phi has n-known function, real function. We call it n-known potential. And H1 is, you know, the Neumann. The Neumann field. And we have the divergence-free condition and the usual boundary condition. Okay, so the main difference is these two terms. So I needed to explain why or maybe explain what's the physical meaning of these two terms. If we compare our equation with the Maxwell equation for electromagnetism, then the Electromagnetism. Then the second equation now in the system 2.01 is actually the ampere rule, which can be written as Q of magnetic field equals current density. The border phase H is induced magnetic field, which is given by lambda Q of A for the N-known induced magnetic field, magnetic potential. And HE has And HE is a prior magnetic field. The current density J consists of two parts: G is the so-called superconducting current given by the old parameter. And we have E. E as the electric field. And compare our equation with the MPA law. Actually, we can write our E in this form, which is given by grading phi plus H1 over lambda one, right? One over lambda one. Now you see that the physical meaning of this potential is actually part of the electric field. More precisely, grading of phi is part of the electric field. And this equality also contains H1. And H1 is a Norman field which carry information of domain to collage. So actually, this equity tells us electric field actually. Electric field uttering depends also on the domain of parallel. Let me mention that such kind of equality uttering appears for the electromagnetism in the content of the Mesoisto system. We have a similar equality. Now, in the following, we assume that the omega is a boundary domain R3 with C2 boundary. with C2 boundary. And the applied manifold is in the space H gamma, which is the image of Q. But this condition is not really matter because for any L2 wet field, you can always decompose one part is in H gamma and another part does not affect our Y equation. Okay, then given omega and given HE, you can always and given HE, you can always find a vertical field u, say u should be e, such that lambda q of u equals h e and diversion of u equals zero in the domain and normal component of u equals zero on the boundary. And you can always find solution, but it may not be unique if the domain is multiply connected. So if domain is really multiple connect, we assume that u is also going to the set of Neumann. The set of Neumann fields, then this U is unique. Okay, now we have the first conclusion about the minimum solution of our Ginsburg-Lana system with potential. And if we talk about a minimum solution, actually phi will be zero and H1 will be zero. In other words, for the minimum solution, the equation actually is the same. Same for simply connected domain and multiple connected domain. Let me quickly review the proof. Actually, we needed to consider the equation in the whole space, compressed H1 for pi and H1 for real-wheeled fields. But because this energy lose competitiveness in this large space, we restrict our function in the smaller one, Z. C here will require the value fields to be divergence-free and Neumann condition on the boundary. The normal component vanishes on boundary and also going to the set of Neumann space, Neumann fields. Then on this set, Z, our functional G has the competitiveness, so it has a minimizer. Okay, minimizer in Z. Okay, minimizing z, say pass are zero and tilde is zero. Then using the gauge invariance, we can actually show that using gauge invariance, also using the minimality of this precise A0, this one is actually also a minimizer of the G of the larger space Y. However, it may not be the minimizer on the whole space X. So we consider the function fixed size zero. Fixed size zero, fixed A0 plus H, and let H varies in the space H1 set of normal fields. But this H only has a finite dimension. So this function achieves its minimum at some point H0 or at some better field. Then we let A0 equals A0 tilde plus H0. Then plus R0 A0 is. Then, pi0 a0 is a minimizer of the function of g over the whole space, and actually it is a minimum solution of the equation. And now, phi equals 0, and it's one equals 0. So, this situation is quite similar to the simply connected domain. But if we consider non-minimal solution, the situation will be a little bit different. And the certain connection, we actually can show that the games. We can show that the Ginz-Bay-Lambda system has a non-trivial solution Pa Phi H1. Non-trivial means the order parameter Pi is not identical to zero. And Pai A is not a minimized out function of G, but we also have phi and we have H1, and they cannot be removed from the equation. And let me explain the condition gamma E. So for any e. So for any L4 vector field U, we can define this integral gradient pi minus I u pi L2 norm square over L2 norm square. Then you take infimon for pi in the compressed etchron space. And this gamma u is actually the lowest eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian associated with u. Then now we can see Then, now we consider for the giving magnetic field He, the applied magnetic field HE. So you find UE, as we explained before, then plus any Neumann field, they have same Q. Then you consider the lowest eigenvalue for UE plus H1 and take a supreme of H1 in this space, and this gives us gamma E. And this gives us gamma E. Okay, so if gamma e is bigger than one and the integral of h g square times lambda square is small, less than one half, then our system has a non-trivial solution. Okay, and this condition is not only about the apply manifest, but also about the domain topology because grammar is defined using the Using the Neumann fields. Okay, let me explain the proof. So, because the gamma E is bigger than one, so you can always find one value field H1 in this space, such that the lower segment value gamma UE plus H1 is bigger than one. Then we change the variable from A to U. So A equals U plus U E and U E equals Tebu E plus H1. Kev UE plus H1, okay, where this one gamma UE is bigger than one. And we rewrite our functional internal view. So we get functional J in the same space Z as we explained before. Now we can show that because divergence free and because also going to H1, this function of J has compelledness. It satisfies the Palisames condition. Smith's condition and because this condition 2.5, we actually can show that you have such kind of inequality, and then you can verify the conditions in the morning pass lemma of M plus A D and Rabbulo H. And we conclude our functional G has a critial point pass u in the set Z, in the space Z. And the critical point given by Morning Parson lemma is non-true. Is non-true. And Z is not the whole space. So we can only have the weak Euler Lagano equation for V in this set. Then we needed to modify our minimizer. Actually, we write on G, the image part of this term, the so-called superconducting current. Superconducting current. Then for this G, we take the orthogonal prologation of MALS G on the Neumann field. Then H1 is given, then we take the solution phi of this equation in the weak sense. Then we can verify pi A equals U plus U E and Phi H1 is a solution of our system. So because this G may not. This G may not be orthogonal to H1. So little H1 may not be zero, and 5 may not be zero. So these two terms cannot be removed. Okay, we can explain that in many situations our conditions are satisfied. So it is possible to have such a solution. But let me skip this part detail. Me skip this part details. Now we go to the massless states of multiple connected superconductors. And we know that a massless state means that the superconductor is in the perfect superconducting state. So the old parameter does not vanish at any point. So we can we write down pi in this form, A in this form. You can choose chi such that this board face. This board phase A is divergence free. Then we change the energy from passa A to F A. Then this is energy for real value F and for value A in this form. Okay. Okay. Then if we talk about the minimum solutions, actually, we can see the minimizers of this function E in a space. E in a space x0 and the real function f and the vector field a which is divergence free and the normal component equals zero. And actually, the minimal solution, minimal solution satisfy the following Euler Lagrange equation with actual term grading phi. And this diversion A equal comes from the gauge, fixing gauge for the number equation. For the disability number equation. So we have the following conclusion. So if HE is in the sublive space, you always have a minimum solution, F, A, phi. And in general, you cannot remove this phi. And the proof is actually similar to the proof of theorem 2.1. So let me skip it. skip this proof and let's go to the non-minimal solution and for non-minus minimum solution actually we have actual term grading phi plus h1 right and okay so so we to get a solution we can see the energy and if omega is multiply connected and if the applied manifold is not very big or not very big or lambda is not very big then the system has a non-trivial solution non-trivial solution means f is not identical zero not identically one but we cannot avoid phi and h1 and fa is not a minimizer and this result is for the multiple connected domain but if omega is simply connected then uh we do not have We do not have mu E, we only have mu u E. And if this one pays on one, we can still have a solution. Now, what is this mu? Actually, for any real field field U, we can define such integral and ratio and take infimum for G in the real H1 and then replace U by our capital U plus H. u plus h h is h1 and the you know that lambda q of u equals h e and if you add a h from h1 it does not change the curve then we can show that if omega is multiple connected the mu e is infinity okay and then you can find h1 such that this mu is bigger than one this u is This u is original capital U plus this H1. Okay. And we change the function of log B to J for F and U. And then we follow the similar proof as we did before to find the critical point by using the mountain pass lemma. Then, because this Z is not the whole space, so we needed to have So we needed to have phi and have h1. Okay, now we can also consider the large carbon limit because for the for the mass states, mass equation on simply connected domain, the case when kappa go to infinity, I give you a simpler looking equation, but a more difficult equation. Anyway, so. difficult equation anyway so we consider kama ka go to infinity and we derive the limiting energy now the limiting energy depends only on u right and then we need another number sigma sigma lambda and this is the ratio lambda square q square plus u square over u n four square and then we can have the following count We can have the following conclusion. If the L2 norm of a prior magnet field is not big enough, so bounded by this number, then our function norm has a clear point A and associated with A, we can find phi such that A and Phi satisfy this equation. You can compare this equation with the usual mass equation. Mass equation. In that one, we don't have identified. Okay, and but in our case, because the divergence-free condition, we can not avoid this fine. And we have some regularity result. Maybe I use one minute to talk about the proof. And we consider V0, divergent zero, and divergence zero and normal component zero is V zero. And in that space, by using like divergence Q grading inequality, we can verify that this norm is actually the equivalent norm, equivalent to the sublife norm. Then we can show that our functional gm satisfies the PS condition. And then we, because our condition 3.4 here, because this condition, and we can This condition, and we can also verify the condition in the mountain path lemma is satisfied. Again, we have a clear point in the space V0. And from V0 to whole space, we needed to add some gradient phi. And this phi is specially chosen to satisfy this equation. And then we can verify that for any w. can verify that for any w in the sublime space h1 we decompose w into v and grading phi n such that v is in our set v0 and then because phi satisfied this equality so actually we can verify for for this any doubling um the the the weaker equation also holds so uh a is a phi is our solution Is our solution of the equation 3.5? Maybe I mentioned last result that actually we can show that sigma lambda is bounded if omega is multiply connected and it's got to infinity if omega is simply connected. So we can show that if either omega is simply connected or if Or if omega is multiply connected, but L2 norm of H is suitably small, then the system has a weak solution for large lambda. In our proof, actually, we use some regularity and estimates for the Mega Stoic system, but I think I used the time. Thank you very much for your attention.
