And thank you for giving me the chance to talk at the workshop. I was present at the workshop four years ago, unfortunately. This time it was a little more complicated to get there, but I hope it will be still very exciting for all of us. So, the topic of my talk is approximation by homogeneous polynomials. And basically, I want to address the question. I want to address the question if approximation is possible at all if we restrict ourselves just to homogeneous polynomials. This will be an overview of maybe about last 17, 18 years of working on this problem. So, the main motivation is the Weierstrass approximation theorem. It's a very classical thing. If you take it If you take a function continuous on interval a b and the positive epsilon, you can always find an algebraic polynomial which deviates from the function in the subnorm by at most epsilon. This was basically the starting point of approximation theory, this theorem. And I kind of like to make this historical remark here that Weierstrass proved this theorem when he was 70 years old. And now Old, and now that I'm getting not that far away from 70, it kind of gives me a good feeling. And you also can say that this approximation theorem was a counterbalance to a famous example that he found of a continuous function which is nowhere differentiable in an interval that he did about 20 years earlier. And that example, it kind of caused a sensation. Caused a sensation. I have a quote here from a letter which was written by Hermit to Stiltias, and Hermit was quite upset that people have found functions which are continuous but still nowhere differentiable. In a way, he was very, very upset by this event. But Weierstrass, who discovered that continuous function can be very non-smooth, he, on the other hand, proved his approximation theory. And proved his approximation theory, which basically fixed the problem because it is saying that even though a continuous function is very much non-smooth, it can be very non-smooth, you can approximate continuous functions by very smooth functions arbitrarily well. And well, later on, Weierstrass's theorem was generalized by Picard, and this time we have a compact in the D-dimensional Euclideans. The D-dimensional Euclidean space. You take the space CK of all continuous real-valued functions on K, the usual soup norm again. And you consider polynomials in D variables of total degree at most n. This is going to be a standard notation, P and D, polynomials of degree, total degree at most n in d variables usual linear combination of monomials. P to the exponent D is the union of all polynomials. So these are all algebraic polynomials. And well, as I mentioned, these are polynomials of total degree at most ends. So for an integer d vector k, mod k denotes the sum of coordinates. So Picard actually proved that polynomials are dense in CK as well. So you can go from Well. So you can go from one variable to several variables. And of course, a very significant generalization was found by Stone. It came from topology, basically. And the Stone theorem says that if A is a subalgebra of CK, by saying subalgebra, we mean that it's a linear subspace which is closed relative to multiplication. So if you are given any subalgebra in C of K, Algebra in C of K. And this sub-algebra satisfies two additional properties. It separates points in K, which means that for any two distinct points in the compact K, you can find an element in your subalgebra which takes distinct values at these two distinct points. That's one property. And the other property is that the subalgebra does not vanish on K. That is, for any point in the compact, there is an element in your subalgebra, which does not vanish at this x. Does not vanish at this x, then the closure in uniform closure of your subalgebra is all of Ck. And of course, this Stone theorem it includes Weiersas and PKR because polynomials satisfy all the properties listed here. You can go from this Stone theorem to a little bit more general version, and I'll call it the Stone-Weierstrass theorem now. And this more general version is This more general version is going to be kind of a theme which is going to come back again and again on this talk. So now I'm looking at a subalgebra in C of K, which still separates points, but I kind of drop the second property here that the subalgebra doesn't vanish on A. I allow the subalgebra to vanish on compact K on S. algebra to vanish on compact K on a certain point. And I denote by Z sub capital A the set of all those points in compact K where every element of your subalgebra vanishes. So this is the set, this is the zero set of this whole subalgebra. And then it turns out that the Stone theorem can be slightly generalized. You can say that the subalgebra A is going to be dense in the set of all those continuous functions which vanish on. Which vanish on the Z sub A. Of course, the condition that functions must vanish on this Z sub A is evidently necessary, but it is also sufficient for the density. So now we come to a basic question. Do we need all the monomials x to the power k in order to approximate continuous functions? Well, of course, you can give a trivial observation that if you take a span of If you take a span of monomials x to the k, where k varies in a certain set omega and omega is closed to summation, then this span is still going to be a subalgebra. So you can apply Stone-Wehrstras' theorem and you can get away with this smaller set of polynomials. But this is kind of trivial because you can simply apply Stoneware to a theorem. A more exciting example. A more exciting example is the lacunary case when you look at the span of powers of x to the lambda k k goes from zero to one and so on and lambdas they start with zero and it's a growing sequence of real numbers don't they don't even have to be integers and then the classical moon theorem states that this space m sub lambda is going M sub lambda is going to be dense in C01 if and only if the sum of the reciprocals of this exponent lambda k is infinity. So, in a way, this condition, it imposes a certain density condition on lambda k's. They cannot be very sparse. So, for instance, if you take lambda k's to be prime numbers, they are going to satisfy this condition, the sum of the reciprocals is infinity, you still have that. is infinity, you still have density. But if you take lambda k's to be perfect squares, lambda k is k squared, that's now too sparse and the density will fail. But the interesting remark here is that this is now not related to the Stone-Weierstrass theorem because the space M sub lambda of the lacunary polynomials, it is still a linear space, but it is not closed relative to multiplication in general. In general. So the Stone-Weierstrass theorem is not applicable. And here is another example: the so-called theta incomplete polynomials on interval 0, negative 1, 1. You fix a parameter theta between 0 and 1, and you look at this set P and theta, which is the span of all monomial x to the k, where k varies between theta n and n. So in a way, you drop, roughly speaking, the first theta n power. The first θ n powers here, and you look only at the linear span of the remaining powers. Now it turns out it's a well-known result that a function continues on negative 1, 1 is a uniform limit of this theta incomplete polynomials, if and only if this function vanishes on the integral negative θ zeta. So you have this new phenomena here that you need to have an exceptional set where your function has to vanish. Where your function has to vanish in order to be able to approximate by CETO in complete polynomials. And again, a very important remark here is that you cannot apply this. You can do anything. It's not those rectification. And actually this is a special case of problem when you look at the we are losing your audio, so maybe you can turn off your camera. We see that your internet connection is low. Okay. Is it better now? Is it better now? Can you hear? Right now we hear Andres, but it can be better. It might. Yeah. All right. So the CETA incomplete polynomial, just a special case of so-called weighted polynomial. Of so-called weighted polynomials, when you look at the set of functions of the form omega to the power n times p, where p is a polynomial degree at most n, univariate polynomial degree at most n. And sita incomplete polynomials are just a special case of this sort of functions when your weight omega is a is of the form x to the some power gamma, the gamma. X to the some power of gamma, where gamma depends on theta, and this problem is very well studied. Depending on the weight, you may have density and you may not have density. So, here is one last example related to this. If you look at weighted polynomials of the form omega to the power of n times p, where again p is a polynomial degree at most n. And the weight omega is the Gaussian weight here, e to the negative x squared. Here e to the negative x squared, you approximate on the whole real line by this weighted polynomials, then a continuous function on the real line is a uniform limit of this weighted polynomials, if and only if this function vanishes outside of the interval negative one, one. So it's supported on negative one, one. And that's again something that we are going to see again and again, that you have to have an exceptional set where the function must zero in order to be able to approximate. So after this historical So, after these historical remarks, let me go to the problem that I want to consider. So, instead of looking at the polynomials of total degree n, I look at the homogeneous polynomials. So, h sub n to d denotes homogeneous polynomials of exact degree n. And hd is the union of all homogeneous polynomials. These homogeneous polynomials regularly come up in different areas of analysis. Of analysis, so it is kind of natural to try to approximate or consider the wire stress approximation problem just for homogeneous polynomials. Okay, the homogeneous polynomials are evidently zero-symmetric, so a natural choice for the domain where we want to approximate is to be that the domain also has to be zero-symmetric. So, I'm going to assume that the compact K in the D-dimensional space. In the D-dimensional space is zero-symmetric and star-like, which means that if you have a point x in k, then the whole interval negative x also has to be inside k. And here comes a simple observation that if you have a homogeneous polynomial of degree, exact degree n, and you look at this polynomial along a line tx, t is a real parameter here, you can simply pull out t to the power n. So your polynomial at tx. your polynomial at tx is going to equal t to the n times the value of the polynomial at x. This is going to be true for any x and any real parameter t. So if, for instance, you have a fixed point A in the D-dimensional space and you have a sequence of homogeneous polynomials which attain value one for every n at this fixed point a, then clearly if you replace x here by a and a X here by A and H and A equals 1, then you can see that for when you are inside interval negative AA, that is when T is absolute value of T is less than 1, your polynomial inside this interval will have to go to 0. And similarly, H and X will have to go to infinity for T strictly bigger than 1 or strictly less than negative 1. So in a way, if you look at this domain, At this domain K, intersect it with design, you can hope to approximate only on the K. You can approximate inside K. So that's a fact of that. If you want to study the density of homogeneous polynomials, this should be on the boundary of K, not on all of K. Homogeneous polynomials. Homogeneous polynomials, that's a non-linear set. That's the problem, in a sense, because since the set of all homogeneous polynomials is non-linear, the Stonewire-stress theorem is not applicable. So this poses a real problem. This set is closed-related application and composition, which is very important, which are very important tools. So we have So we can multiply and we can take compositions, but we cannot add them. And another observation is that if you have a homogeneous polynomial and D, then this polynomial parity is n. So if n is even, then h is going to be an. If n is odd, h is going to be an odd function. So since in general, a continuous function doesn't have to be odd or even. Other, even you cannot hope to approximate with one homogeneous polynomial. You need at least two in order to be able to approximate. So here comes the problem then. And this is what I call the Weierstrass type approximation problem for homogeneous polynomials. For which zero symmetric star-like domains K in Rd, the set Hd plus Hd is going to be dense on the boundary of K. In other words, Of k. In other words, which are zero-symmetric star-like domains, which have the following property: if you take any continuous function on the boundary of k and you take any epsilon, you can find two homogeneous polynomials p and q so that the sum of these two is going to approximate your continuous function f on the boundary up to the epsilon. So this is. So this is this if this red line here would be the equivalent of the weierstrass approximation problem for the homogeneous polynomials. Let's look at an example. Just the most natural example to look at is the unit sphere in Rd, the Euclidean unit sphere. If you look at the little L2 norm of x, of the vector x, and you raise it to j's power where j is even. Power where j is even, clearly you have this expression, and that's just a homogeneous polynomial of degree j. So, if you make this observation and you look now at any polynomial p of total degree at most n, you can write it as sum of homogeneous polynomials from degree n up to zero. And now you split this sum to the sum of h sub j where n minus j is even plus the sum of a sub j where n minus j is odd. where n minus j is odd and you can insert this mod xl2 norm to the power n minus j or to the power n minus j minus one because i'm looking at the my polynomial just on the unit sphere and on the unit sphere what i inserted here is just equal to one so that's why we can go from the previous sum to the next sum and now these things that i inserted are just homogeneous polynomials of degree n minus j and n minus 2. n minus j and n minus j minus one respectively. So clearly the first sum is going to be a homogeneous polynomial of degree n and the second sum here is going to be a homogeneous polynomial degree n minus one. So it shows that if you restrict your polynomials of total degree n to the unit sphere, then you have this equality that on the unit sphere, the polynomials of total degree n, they can be written as homogeneous polynomials of degree n plus. Polynomials of degree n plus homogeneous polynomials of degree n minus one. And since by the Weierstrass theorem or Picard theorem, the homogeneous polynomials of total degree are dense on the unit sphere, you automatically get that the set Hd plus Hd, so pairs of homogeneous polynomials, are going to be dense on the unit sphere. So unit sphere gives you the first positive example of when the density of an The density of homogeneous polynomials is going to be true. So, based basically on this observation, some time ago there was a conference in Marathea in 2004, and on this conference, I mentioned this conjecture that if you are given any zero-symmetric convex body in Rd, then the set Hd plus Hd is going to be dense on the boundary of this convex body. This convex body. This would be the analog of the Weierstrass approximation theorem for homogeneous polynomials. In other words, if you have a zero-symmetric convex body, then it is conjectured that pairs of homogeneous polynomials approximate every continuous function on the boundary. After this conjecture was posed in following five years, several important cases were solved. Cases were solved. First of all, the complete conjecture was verified when d equals 2. So, when you have a two-dimensional situation, you are given any zero-symmetric convex body in R2, you can approximate by pairs of homogeneous polynomials. Second important case which was settled was zero-symmetric convex polytops in Rd for any D greater than two as well. So, any convex So any convex polytope again gives you a positive solution to the conjecture. And finally, the third relevant result here corresponds to this so-called regular convex bodies. Regularity means that you have a unique supporting hyperplane at any point on the boundary. In other words, the boundary is differentiable. So if you have zero symmetric irregular convex bodies in Rd, D can be strictly greater than two. Greater than two, then again the conjecture is true. So these are the three main cases which were settled. And it is interesting to know that the second case, polytope, is a non-smooth situation. The third case, regular convex body, that's a smooth situation. So in a way, you have smooth and non-smooth cases when the conjecture is verified to be true. But the Verified to be true, but in full generality, it is still an open question. And another observation that one can make is that basically the methods which were used in verifying the conjecture for regular convex bodies, they can be used to verify the conjecture in L P norm when P is strictly less than infinity. And that's because when you have a convex body, A convex body, the set of non-regular points, has zero surface measure, and therefore dealing with L P approximation is a little simpler. So you can verify the conjecture for any p greater or equal than or less than infinity. So the uniform norm is the difficult one. And now I would like to mention another contribution which was made by Wilmos Stotig, who introduced Who introduced a different concept, which he called epsilon regularity. Epsilon regularity of convex body means that the angle between any two normals at a given point is at most epsilon. So you don't assume regularity in the sense that you don't assume uniqueness of normal, but you assume that the angle between any two distinct normals at a given point. Any two distinct normals at a given point is at most epsilon. And then he proved the following theorem. If you have a zero symmetric convex body in Rd, and you assume that there is a fixed integer eta, which depends only on k, such that for any positive epsilon, your set your domain k is an intersection of at most eta k epsilon regular zero symmetric convex bodies, then pairs of Then pairs of homogeneous polynomials are dense on the boundary of this body. So you should be able to write your domain as a finite intersection of epsilon regular convex bodies. Then you are fine. Then you can use, then you can verify the density of homogeneous polynomials. And it is interesting that this theorem, it implies all the three major cases when the density conjecture. Major cases when the density conjecture was verified, which were listed on the previous slide. For example, if you have a regular convex body, then of course it's epsilon regular with epsilon equal to zero. And eta k you can simply take to be one since it's a regular convex body. And then automatically from this theorem, you get the conjecture, you get the statement for regular convex bodies. Furthermore, if you have a zero symmetric polytope, Polytope in Rd with 2M faces of dimension d minus one, so it has two m d minus one dimensional faces, then it's very easy to see that you can represent your polytope as intersection of m zero symmetric regular convex bodies. So this parameter eta k in this case can take into be m and m is just the number of d minus one dimensional faces. And again, then the Phases and again, then you get the density for polytopes from the above theorem. And finally, in two-dimensional case, it can be shown that every zero-symmetric convex body in R2 can be represented as intersection of four zero-regular convex bodies, four, sorry, epsilon regular convex bodies. So you can choose eta k to be four in this case. At a k to be four in this case. And again, you get what we already know: that in two-dimensional case, the conjecture is verified. So it's interesting that this epsilon regularity, it included all three major situations when the conjecture was settled. But on the other hand, unfortunately, it didn't lead to discovering new interesting cases of density. For instance, if you look Density. For instance, if you look at circular cones, then it's not hard to see that this parameter eta k for circular cones is going to be infinite. So you cannot use Totic's theorem to check the density on the circular cones. And well, I think I'm running out a little bit of time, so I just wanted to mention here on this slide that. Wanted to mention here on this slide that, in order to verify the identity of homogeneous polynomials, it suffices to show that the identity, you can approximate identity by even homogeneous polynomials as n goes to infinity. And using this observation, you can very easily show that even though circular counts were not covered by the previous theorem of Todic, still the conjecture is true. The conjecture is true for circular count as well. So you can use composition of certain homogeneous polynomials to verify the conjecture for circular count as well. So what is more interesting for me now is to look at the question what happens on certain non-convex star-like domains. It turns out that in general convexity is necessary for density of homogeneous polynomials. You can give various examples of non-convex zero-symmetric starlight sets for which Hd plus Hd is not going to be dense on the boundary of K. And let me first, in this respect, mention a general result here, which I recently proved, and it kind of points to the main problem here with the non-convex star-like domains. Star-like domains. If you have an arbitrary zero-symmetric star-like domain K in Rd, there always exists a zero-symmetric set zero of K, such that if you take any continuous function on the boundary of K, the following two statements are equivalent. First statement is that this function f can be approximated by pair of homogeneous polynomials. Second is that the function has to be zero on this exceptional set z of k. This exceptional set Z of K. So, in other words, when you have zero symmetric star-like domain, there is always a certain exceptional set that you can approximate on the boundary by homogeneous polynomials if and only if your function vanishes on this exceptional set. And of course, the convex conjecture that I mentioned before, it can be reformulated now by saying that this conjecture is equivalent to saying that the exceptional set of a convex set is simply Of a convex set is simply always empty. So basically, when you look at non-convex situation, you have to find this exception z of k, which tells you version needs to be zero in order to approximate. And it's hard to find exactly. There is one interesting exam where this was done. I look at the LR. Done, I look at the L alpha sphere in the three-dimensional alpha sphere is the set of those points in Rd for which their little L alpha norm equals to one. Alpha is a positive parameter here. Now, when alpha equals one, this is just a convex polytope. So you do have density because we know that it is true on polytopes. When alpha is strictly bigger than one, When alpha is strictly bigger than one, this is a regular convex domain, so again we have density. So, the interesting question is what happens when alpha is strictly less than one? In this case, this L-alpha sphere is a non-convex body. And it turned out, and this was done very recently, first in two variables and then subsequently for any d bigger than two, that the exceptional set That the exceptional set of the L-alpha sphere consists of all those points x on the boundary on the sphere on the alpha sphere for which the product of the coordinates is zero. So essentially, these are the points where your boundary is not smooth. So when alpha is strictly less than one, a continuous function on the L alpha A continuous function on the L-alpha sphere can be approximated by pairs of homogeneous polynomials if and only if the product of coordinates of the point of the boundary is zero. So these are exactly the points on the on the L-alpha sphere, which are the non-smooth points. For instance, if you take d equal to two, then the four vertices of your L alpha sphere plus minus one, zero, zero, plus minus one, these four vertices are going to give you the dx. Vertices are going to give you the exceptional set. That's why the function has to vanish. And another situation, another non-convex situation which can be kind of solved totally is the case of zero symmetric non-convex polytopes. As I mentioned before, Vario proved that if the zero-symmetric polytop is convex, then you can approximate by homogeneous polynomials. By homogeneous polynomials. So, the question is: what happens when the polytope is not convex? Now, let K be a zero-symmetric non-convex polytope, and I denote by delta k star the set of all those points on the boundary of k which are locally non-convex. So this delta k star, are those points x on the boundary of k such that the intersection of any small ball centered at x. Ball centered at x, its intersection with k is not convex. So, the in other words, k is not convex in any little neighborhood of point x. These are the locally non-convex points of the boundary. And for polytops, it's easy to see that this set delta k star is simply the union of all inner d minus two-dimensional faces of the polytop. When I say inner faces, those are the faces which are in the Are the faces which are in the interior of the convex hole of k. For instance, when d equals 2, all inner vertices of the polytope are going to give you this delta k star. And what can be proved is a following result that if you have a zero symmetric polytope in Rd, D is greater or equal than two, then the set delta k star, which I just defined, is always. Is always a subset of the exceptional set of k. Actually, when the polytop is not convex, this delta k star is always non-empty. So it immediately implies that if the polytop is not convex, then the exceptional set would be non-empty. So in order to have the exceptional set to be empty, it is necessary and sufficient that the k is convex. So in particular for the polytopes, the answer to the problem is. Polytops, the answer to the problem is that Weierstra's theorem for homogeneous polynomials holds on polytop if and only if this polytope is convex. And of course, it brings us to another question. Can we have density on any non-convex zero-symmetric domains? Non-convexity always implies that the density fails. implies that the density fails. It turns out that the answer is positive in the sense that you may have a non-convex domains for which you still have density of homogeneous polynomials. And here is a relatively simple example. It's not very hard to show that if you take h to be any homogeneous polynomial, any even homogeneous polynomial, and you look at the level surface of this polynomial, so you look at all those axes where this polynomial equals one, then Equals one, then a level surface of a homogeneous polynomial is always a star-like set, but it doesn't have to be convex. And sometimes this level surface is going to be compact, sometimes it is not compact, but it can be shown that if this level surface is compact, then Hd plus Hd is dense on this level surface. So this is an example of situation when you may have density on a May have density on a non-convex domain. And another question that I want to address now, well, the previous example, the level surface was a smooth domain. Can you have density on a non-convex and non-smooth zero symmetric domain? Can you still show that the approximation holds by homogeneous polynomials? By homogeneous polynomials. And here is something that can be done with respect to this question. Actually, Vario showed earlier that Hd plus Hd, if Hd plus Hd is dense on the boundary of two distinct convex bodies, then it is also dense on the intersection of these two bodies. This was the way he approached his. He approached his theorem for convex polytops. In other words, if you have, sorry, the convexity is not really needed in this statement. So convexity I should have taken out. So basically, the next line is the correct statement. So if the exceptional set of two k j's is empty, is empty, so if ZK1 and ZK2 is empty, then it is going to be empty also for the intersection. In other words, if you can approximate on two star-like domains, then you can also approximate on their intersection. And this statement I was able to generalize a little bit by showing that the exceptional set of the intersection of two domains is a subset of the union. Subset of the union of two exceptional sets. And this very easily leads to the conclusion that if the exceptional set of one convex body has an empty intersection with another one and vice versa, then the exceptional set of the intersection is going to be empty. So this gives you a way to construct non-smooth, non-convex bodies on which approximation by homogeneous polynomial. Approximation by homogeneous polynomials holds. Here is an example. I take a little L-alpha sphere in Rd, in R2, two variables, and I rotate it by 90 degrees. So I have two non-convex bodies, and for each of them, the density fails because the exceptional set of the first one of K1 is known to be of these four points. And after rotation, the exceptional set. After rotation, the exceptional set of the second one is going to be these four points. But the exceptional set of k1 will have the empty intersection with k2 and the other way around. And that's why when you look at the intersection of these two non-convex domains, you will get a set for which the exceptional set is empty. And in other words, approximation is possible. Even though this set is K1 intersected K2 is going to be non-configurable. K2 is going to be non-convex and non-smooth. And finally, this is basically my last remark here. How about zero symmetry? All the domains I discussed so far today were assumed to be zero symmetric, which is kind of natural because homogeneous polynomials are zero symmetric. But is it really necessary to consider the problem on zero symmetric domains only? And nothing is known in this respect. So I hear. Known in this respect. So I here posed two open problems, and it's very ironic that both of them are open. The first one says, does there exist a non-zero symmetric convex domain for which Hd plus Hd is dense on the boundary of the domain? Can you have density on any non-zero symmetric domain? And the opposite of the problem, does there exist a zero symmetric convex domain? Convex domain for which the density fails. Both of these questions are open. Even if you look at the simplest situation, you look at the sphere which is centered not at the origin, but at some point A, which is not equal to zero. So you shift a little bit the unit sphere. I don't know what happens if you can approximate on it or not. And that's all I wanted to say. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Andras. I'm sorry I had the problem with connecting, but anyway, now, are there any questions and any comments? No questions, no comments. Then let's thank the speaker. Thank the speaker. Thank you. Thank you, Andras. We can proceed. Sorry, I have one quick question. Sorry, there was a problem with the microphone. So this result that says that if you have that you can have non-convex bodies where you use the level surfaces of polynomials. Surfaces of polynomials. So, my question is: Does it work exactly the same way as this here, or is it more complicated actually? Almost. It's a little bit more complicated, but see H here, this polynomial, this homogeneous polynomial has a certain degree. On the sphere, you have a degree 2 level surface. This is some degree M level surface. So, you get a lacunary sequence, so you kind of have to fill in the gaps. That's the only little difficulty. Gaps. That's the only little difficulty that you have here, but it's not difficult to settle it. So it's the same idea like on the sphere, but a little bit more technical. Okay. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Other questions? If not, then again, let's thank André.
