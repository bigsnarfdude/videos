So what we're interested in my lab in general is, and if we kind of try to get numbers, we can see that usually we can find tens, somewhere between 10 and 100, few tens of different signals in these pathways. And they are activating very few one, twos. I know, for example, in the Jack Stat pathway. For example, in the JAX stat pathway, we might find 50 cytokines and six different stat proteins that are activated in the cell. So there's really a reduction in an order of magnitude between the extracellular signals and the intracellular encoding. That's what we're trying to understand: how the extracellular signals are being perceived intracellularly. What's the intracellular map that should kind of represent? That should kind of represent the information from the environment and how this mapping ultimately affects the cellular response. And today I'll talk about what we're looking at in the context of encoding the information from the end line. So when we think about signaling pathways, we have this kind of a linear nice. Kind of a linear, nice description or signals, bind receptors, and activate some or induce some change in the cell, activate some mediator protein. But that's not the full story. Signaling pathways are actually less of a pathway and more of the network with many ligands combinatorially or promiscuously. Or promiscuously binding multiple receptors that could activate downstream effects. And when we look at these kind of networks, we can notice, as was mentioned in the previous talk as well, that these are actually a feed-forward networks where information goes from one layer to the next in multiple parallel paths. And that's spherical management of neural network. Of neural network. So we kind of want to give more insight into the question of whether these signaling networks could be thought as neural network-like. Do they do some kind of information processing? Maybe they actually play active role in the decision-making if they can identify specific patterns in ligand space or other. Or other computational functions. And to look at it, one of the systems that we'll analyze in the ramp is the TGF-beta superfamily. It's a developmental pathway. It's a family of small diffusible molecules and it's actually one of the first developmental pathways in a sense. It's actually found in all metasoon organisms starting from the very early. Starting from the very early sponges and all the way to humans. There are about 30 different ligands. You can see the different ligands on the slides. And they are divided into different subfamilies. But overall, this pathway plays a part in almost any biological process you could imagine, in the immune system, in germ layer determination. I mean, germ layer determination, development of different tissues or tissues, and also during cancer progression and various other maladies. And within this family, we focus on the PMP subfamily of frequencies, which are a very interesting system to study this type of a combinatorial. This type of combinatorial signal perception because of several reasons. First of all, there are many different ligands, about 10 main ligands that appear generally during developments, and there are other less common ligands as well that bind a heterodynamic receptor composed of a type 1 and a type 2 receptors, which also have different isoforms. Isoforms. So, overall, this combinatorics really blows up, and you could get hundreds of different complexes, but all of them boils down to the same change inside the cell, where they all activate the same smartphone. So, this is kind of one reason there's a lot of electronic structure here, but in addition, this combination. But in addition, this combinatorial structure is not just theoretical, but actually many processes, almost most processes, you could actually find multiple BMP signals that are used together. And every process kind of uses a distinct combination of these signals. You can see here an example of six different developmental contexts in the eye. Developmental context in the eye, the lymphat, kidney, heart, during vascular jaunt formation. And when we look at the available data from the literature, we can analyze the RNA sequencing data sets and we see that it's actually the common scenario where multiple such signals, you can see even up to eight or nine different Different ligands are used together at the same time in the same tissue. So, what we wanted to ask, and this is in collaboration with the Elohim's lab, is we were trying to define what are the rules that cells utilize in order to respond to combinations of ligands and how those pairs or multiple ligands. Of multiple ligands composed together. To do that, we used a mouse mammary epithelial cell line that's highly responsive to BMP. So when we expose the cells to a BMP signal, they would form signaling complexes, phosphorylate the SMAD protein, which would bind various promoters. Promoters in the natural targets, and to these cells, we integrated a fluorescent repotose, a synthetic gene, with a binding element for the SMAD protein. And upon activation of the pathway, this synthetic gene produces a fluorescent protein, a yellow fluorescent protein, which we can measure using flow cytometry. And with this system, we can start exposing. System, we can start exposing the cells to varying concentration of the signals and measure quantitatively with high precision the dose response and across all different PMP ligands. And what we start to see here is that, as we saw in other contexts in previous talks, we see different, for example, different saturation levels here. Saturation levels. Here they're purple, BMP-10 has a lower saturation level, kind of along the lines that were suggested by Anton. Other thing is that different ligands might have different sensitivity, different concentrations that are required. But what we're actually interested in, as I said before, is to try and see how these signals can combine together and what are the rules that govern this structure. So we started. Structure. So we started to expose cells not just to a single increasing ligand. In this case, the color represents the activity level of the pathway as measured using our electrocutoportals. And we expanded this one-dimensional dose response to a full two-dimensional pattern. In this case, you can see that we found some non-trivial and non-additive. Non-trivial non-additive effects. BMP4 and BMP10. These are the two ligands that they are showing here. Both of them activate the pathway, and one could imagine they are activating ligands. They are equivalent. There's no difference between them. But we could see that while BMP4 is an activating ligand, in the background of BMP10, it actually becomes an inhibitor. And the way that the two ligands combine together. Way that the two ligands combine together when there is a mixture of signals, the pathway responds very differently than when there is only a single ligand present. Another way that signals could interfere with one another is demonstrated here by the pair of BMP4 and GDF5. In this case, increasing a non-activating ligand, GDF5 by itself doesn't do anything, but it could make But it could make the cells less sensitive to BMB4. It could attenuate the sensitivity of the primary limit. So overall, we tried to define kind of more quantitatively what types of behaviors we could identify in a system. And if we consider one a pink ligand and a blue ligand, we could imagine a case where there are complete We could imagine a case where they were completely additive, the total response to the pair of signals is just the sum of individuals. And this gives us kind of a reference level. So in cases where the overall response for the pair is lower than the minimal one, we call them a suppression. There is an active suppression of both ligands, each ligand on the other. On the other. If the signal is kind of in between the two individual ones, it means that one of the signals antagonizes the other. In the third range, there is general additive response. You add more ligands, you get more activity. And maybe due to additive, it's due to saturation, it's not proper additivity, but this would be kind of the additive range. But once we get a response. But once we get a response that's higher than the sum of the individual response, we consider it to be a synergistic behavior. And we could define an interaction coefficient that interpolates between these different regimes. So now the only problem is that we actually want to measure this coefficient for all pairs of all ligands. So if we have 10 ligands, we have 66 ligands. Ligands, we have 66 ligand pairs for each of them. We want to measure the entire kind of two-dimensional behavior. That's 64 times 66. That's a lot of experiments. And in order to do that, we utilize an automated liquid culture system that we now also have in my lab connected both to a flow cytometer and optometer and to an incubator which can actually really do a lot of these experiments automatically and for each pen we can now calculate the coefficient of the interaction so if we do it for bmp10 one of these ligands we can see how it interacts with every other bmp signal BMP signal. We can encode it with this color scheme. We see that generally BMP10 has kind of like a negative effect on many other ligands. And we can find this activity of interaction fingerprint across all other signals. Using this matrix of interactions, we can cluster the ligands and identify. Ligands and identify kind of equivalent groups. So each group represents a group of signals that are additive between themselves. There is no real difference between any ligands and any other ligand in the same group. But between these groups, there is some kind of an inhibitory, in this case, effect of one group on the other. So that's what we find in our. We find in our saline, NMG, the epithelial saline we were looking at, we identified the BMP10 as a strong negative ligand modifier that changes the effect of other BMP signals. But is this kind of a general pattern? What happens if we look at other cell types? So we went on and did the exact same procedure on another cell type, a mouse embryonic stem cell. The mouse embryonic stensors, which utilize BMP signals in order to differentiate and decide on the differentiation trajectory. And then we found actually a slightly different map for the interaction. And specifically, BNP9 seemed to detach from its group and started to act also as an attenuator and actually. Attenuator and actually as a positive attenuator. There were a lot of synergistic green interactions between BMP9 and other signals. So what could regulate this type of composition rules? The immediate suspect are the receptors. And when we compare the receptors expressed by the two cell lines that represented, we can see that there are definitely differences in the receptor. And we focused on the biggest and we focused on the biggest difference we saw. One of the receptors was definitely down-regulated in embryonic stem cells, and then that receptors is called ACVL1. So we try to actually take the epithelial saline, the NMG, and actively knock down this receptor. And when we do it, we actually see that BNP9 indeed differentiates itself from its cluster. Its cluster and starts to show somewhat positive effects on other BMP signals. So, just like if we did it on one receptor, we decided to keep going and see what the effects of other receptors in the system. And if these are the three matrices and maps that I showed you before, we extended it to other perturbations. We extended it to other perturbations, knocking down receptors that are expressed in the epithelial cell line or overexpressing receptors that are missing. And we can see that they can definitely change the type and the logic of interactions between the ligands in the system. So, what can we do with it? For example, let's look at this receptor, ACV RL1. It's a receptor that's very rarely used in Very rarely used in development, but one place that it is used is during a vasculature formation. And in this case, there was a paper that it's known that PMP10 is very important to generate a very early vasculature in the early forming embryo. You can see that when PMP-10 was knocked out, there were no vasculature forming and the embryo. Forming and the embryo was not viable. What they did is actually they tried to replace BMP10 with BMP9. And according to our map, BMP-10 and BMP9 are completely equivalent. And indeed, what they found is that replacing BMP9 with BMP-10 with BMP-9 can recover the vasculature formation and the embryo continues to develop. However, However, overall the embryo is still not viable because at a later stage the heart needs to develop and BMP10 also plays a role in heart development but then the cells profile, there are more epithelial cells which have a receptor profile closer to what we have in our epithelial cell lines. And in this cell line you can see that BMP9 and BMP10 are not in the same orbit and actually have a completely opposite Actually, it has a completely opposite functional effect. And indeed, in this developmental stage, the embryo was not able to develop due to a defect in the out wall, and overall the embryo was not fine. So, this type of maps could be used to start and understand and put some logic into the different combinatorial. Different combinatorial ligands that are used in actual developmental contexts. Another thing that we looked at is these seven different maps that we generated could be thought as different projections of a more complete view of the different ligands in the BMP pathway. And when we collect all this data, All this data into a single map, we can generate similarity values between the different ligands and generate kind of like a hierarchical clustering based on the composition rules of these signals. And it's interesting to compare it to a sequence similarity. Both trees nicely reflect each other, which might mean and be interesting to look where does the Look, where does the composition rules encoded sequence-wise? But one difference is that BMP10 and BMP9, which are the closest to each other sequence-wise, are actually very far away in the way they compose with other signals. As we already saw, the MP10 is generally negative attenuator while the MP9. Negative attenuator while PMP9 is a positive. So next, we wanted to see whether we could explain this type of computation using this network of binding, unbinding between the ligands and the receptors. So we generated a simple model where the ligands Where the ligands and the two subunits of the receptors can bind together to form a signaling complex. The affinity parameters regulate this part of the model, and it's controlled by the binding equilibrium equations and the conservation of mass equations. And once the complexes are formed, we also consider another type of parameters, which are the activity, the enzymatic activity. The enzymatic activity of the complex cells to actually activate the intracellular mediatral, and this controls the overall output from this system. We implemented the model for five different ligands representing the five different groups we found in the BMP pathway. And we were actually able to find parameters. To find parameters that completely recover all of the different behaviors, including the perturbations that we did. But we actually found more than one possible parameter set, which means that we don't have enough data to completely get a good fit for the data. And that's something that we're still trying to work on, generate other types of experiments that could better. Types of experiments that could better give us specific things. But there is one thing that we could still get from this type of analysis. We found some features that are generally happening across all parameters. And specifically, we wanted to see how much of the effect is generated by what percentage of the signaling complexity. Signaling complexes. If all complexes contribute equally to the response of the cells, then the more complexes we consider, the higher the output will be. But in a different case, it might be that very few complexes contribute most of the activity. And that's actually what we find across all parameters that gave reasonable fit to the table. A reasonable fit to the data. We can say that only 50 percent of the actually formed complexes really contribute to all of the output signal. And sometimes even 10 percent of the complexes are the ones that are relevant, which means that what happens with the rest of the receptors? And what we suggest. And what we suggest is that a significant effect in this type of networks is not just about activating the downstream pathway, but also in helping determine the overall distribution of receptors. And just to give you some intuition, let's imagine that we have these receptors, a light green receptor that can bind with different. Bind with different affinities to a dark or light blue receptor, and we expose our cells to this pink ligand, we would generally expect that most of the green receptors will bind the dark blue because it has higher affinity. Now, in case that actually the light blue has a strong enzymatic activity, I have some level of response inside the cell. Inside the cell. Now, let's imagine that we change or the cell starts to express this dark green receptor that can also bind this dark blue receptor, but does not have the ability to actually activate the downstream pathway. We might say that this is an irrelevant receptor, but actually, what could happen is that it would bind the blue receptor. Bind the blue receptor by competing the other light green receptors, it would redistribute these receptors across the complexes, forming more light blue complexes, which would overall increase the activity of the pathway due to this type of receptor redistribution. So, we see that changes in one node in this type of In this type of network, actually propagate non-locally to affect all or many nodes in the network. And that's a very interesting difference from naive neural networks, which might have new or allow new types of capabilities. So to summarize this, we first of all see that there is some kind of a combinatorial logic between the ligands in the BMP pathway. Ligands in the BMP pathways, they can have both activating but also attenuating walls, and that these effects depends or the effect of a specific individual signal depend on the signaling context in which it is being given to the cell. In addition, our ligand interaction maps is a useful way to summarize this combinatorial This combinatorial nature of ligands and the maps to cells encode the rules and the receptor context of the cells. And finally, this uncovers some non-local computational network where, in contrast to standard neural networks, changes in few nodes could In few nodes could propagate and affect many aspects of the network, forming kind of possibly allowing general or more generalized computations to be performed directly at this signaling network level. And that's not something that's unique to BMP. Also, the Jack Start pathway has a similar structure of promiscuous. Structure of promiscuous interactions between proteins in the pathway. So, with that, I want to thank people in the lab and the collaborations with the Eloids lab. And I'm happy to take questions. So, we have time maybe for one or two quick questions. Quick questions. So, anybody has a question. Yeah, very nice. Can I ask, on the very last slide where you show us the hypothesis for the redistribution, I'm trying to think through how that would happen structurally. Would it mean that one ligand has kind of equal affinity to the light blue and the dark blue? And that's why it has a low signal. And that's why it has a low signal, but then you have another ligand that has a strong affinity to the to the, you know, selectively to the to the dark blue. Is that right? But not the light blue. Yeah, so there are, so one thing that we found very generally, and we think it's very interesting, is that there's a lot of complexity that arises when the affinity and activity are And activity, I'll not cover it or even uncover it. And this, this, you know, I'm still playing with thoughts about how this could actually happen. You could imagine many things. For example, you could just imagine the same Kd with different K on and K off. And maybe you need a certain amount of time for the complex to actually exist in order to really be effective. Order to really be effective, but still the Kd could be high, even that it's just kind of forming unfoam. Yeah, or you might have different structurally in the BIMP pathway. Once the complex is formed, one receptor phosphorylates the other receptors, which then continues the cascade. So if different ligands actually just structurally keeps the receptors further away or closer together, Way or closer together, it might also affect differentially the affinity and the activity. So, have people, just out of curiosity, I mean, like, are there structures available or affinities between the ligands and the single chains that you could have a look at? There are some structures for the BMP receptors. I'm not sure about full three-way complexes. There is some data about affinities, but it's kind of a lot. Affinities, but it's kind of you could you could find different values, and mostly it's um it's not it's not it's how to get like a three-way, yes, but you could you could maybe approximate it, you know, by basically multiplying the KDs effectively. But yeah, anyways, yeah, okay, very cool, thanks. Maybe a very quick question by Antarcto Kirkal or Grigoire. And our talker, or Gregoire, very quick. So, fantastic, Jaron, as usual. Do you think there is any place for kinetic effect in this interaction between ligands? From your model, I understand that you are modeling everything at equilibrium right now, but if you pre-expose to BMP4 and then GDP5, is there some kinetic effect and some order which could be used to even enhance the code in the way you reorganize these receptors on the membrane? Receptors on the membrane? Yes, yes. So it's a great question. I don't yet have an answer. It's something that we're looking at, kind of like changing dynamically the effect, trying to see maybe there is some, we think we might see some kind of like a memory phase until it kind of gets back to a steady state. But I don't have yet a full answer. We're looking at both of that, and also there was like kind of like and also there was like kind of like an antagonistic effect for TGF ligands which we're also trying to look at and yeah though though this is kind of like the first step and those like the end things that okay great thanks a lot I think for the sake of time we should move on to the next speaker thanks a lot Jaron
