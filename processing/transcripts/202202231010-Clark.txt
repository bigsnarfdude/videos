Stanford advised by Jeff Kasef and Nicolette and today I'll be talking about the settling and dispersion of non-spherical particles in wavy flow. So some of the broader questions that we've been talking about this week are where are microplastics in the ocean? How did they get there? How long do they stay in the water column? And maybe slightly more specifically, if microplastics are being released from a source, how much will they spread? And how far are they going to travel? And how far are they going to travel? And as we've mentioned, these questions can be difficult to answer for one reason because microplastics don't necessarily behave like flow tracers. They can be many different shapes and they can be any density of plastic or even more densities due to biofouling. And even though they're small, they can be up to five millimeters in size. So they're not minuscule and Minuscule and we might expect that they'll have some inertia. And because of these things, we don't necessarily think that they behave like flow tracers. So what are, how do microplastics get transported? We've been talking about this in different ways. This schematic just shows some of the ways that they are transported in coastal areas. Microplastic, subtle, but they're also being mixed up by turbulence. By turbulence, if they're floating, they might be affected by wind. And waves can drive onshore transport with Stokes drift. And they can also be pulled back out with undertow. And today we're going to be focusing on waves, which are very important because they drive this onshore transport. In general, they're important in coastal areas and they're also important close to the surface. And we also expect waves to be important because they connect. To be important because they can affect particles in interesting ways. We've mentioned Stokes drift has been mentioned before. And because of Stokes drift, tracers will be dispersed more than they would in a regular flow due to a shear flow dispersion effect. And there can also be a vertical Stokes drift, as Nimish talked about yesterday, for settling particles. Settling particles. And so that can also affect their transport. Additionally, as Michelle mentioned, waves modify the orientation of particles. Particles have a wave-preferred orientation, and this can also affect their dynamics because based on their orientation, they're going to experience different drag. So that will impact how they settle and also can have impacts on their dispersion. So coming back to the broader questions that you mentioned, two topics that are relevant towards answering these questions, although of course other things are important too, are dispersion and settling. So dispersion directly tells us how much will microplastics spread out when they're released from a source. But the answer to that question also can help us understand. Help us understand better where microplastics are ending up and how are they getting there. This version is frequently used as a model parameter, and unfortunately, this often has to be done fairly coarsely because there's not enough information available about how are particle characteristics going to impact their dispersion or how will the presence of waves impact how particles are being dispersed. Dispersion is also important to understand in order to interpret. In order to interpret samples, if you're trying to understand how much microplastics are being released from a source and you sample a certain distance from it, you need to know how are the microplastics dispersing in order to interpret your sample correctly. Settling tells us how long are microplastics staying in the water column. And based on how long they stay in the water column, they have more time to, more or less time, to disperse and to travel farther. Travel farther. Settling velocities are also used as a model parameter, and that's often taken to be a constant value without variation for the flow or the particle characteristics. But we expect those things could be quite important. Settling is also helpful for interp understanding settling is also helpful for interpreting samples because if you sample close to the surface, but you want to understand what's true deeper down, it's helpful if you understand how quickly are these. You understand how quickly these particles are settling. So we'll start out with talking about dispersion. So we performed this experiment to try to understand how our non-spherical particles dispersed in a wavy flow. So we have a very weak current, five centimeters per second, so we're not expecting any turbulence. And we also generate waves and we release. Um, and we release the particles at upstream at the surface. We release negatively buoyant particles, so they travel downward and downstream, and then they land in this catch grid at the bottom. And based on their landing positions, we can say how much did they spread while they were in the flow. So now I'll just go through each of those components in more detail. So these are our waves generated by. Waves generated by this Scott Yoke-style wavemaker. We have linear surface gravity waves, which is good. Most waves in the ocean, obviously not breaking waves, can be approximated as linear waves. We have deep water waves, so that means they have circular orbitals. And these are our experimental microplastics. So we have three shapes. The first is discs, and we keep the long dimension fixed at seven millimeters. Dimension fixed at seven millimeters, and we vary the short dimension from one to two to three millimeters. Then we additionally have rods, and for the rods, we also have a long dimension of seven millimeters, and we again vary the short dimension from one to two to three millimeters. And as an intermediate case, we have cylinders. These large cylinders have a width and height of seven millimeters. To match the long dimension of the discs and rods, but those are quite large volumetrically. So, to better match the volumes of the discs and rods, we have two smaller cylinders with dimensions of three and four millimeters. So, this is our particle release. We release them from this floating funnel tip so that they're always released a fixed distance below the surface. And we release them one at a time so we don't expect them to interact with each other. And so they travel downward and then they land in the catch grid at the bottom. So this is what they look like once they've landed. We have the catch grid number, so we can take them out and know their positions. And from their landing locations, we can see how much they spread. So we take the standard deviation of Standard deviation of these landing positions. We take it stream-wise, and that tells us how much did the particles spread out while they were in the flow. So now let's look at those standard deviations. Okay, so on this plot, we're showing the standard deviations of the particles. Right now, I'm just showing them when there were no waves, and we're plotting against particle eccentricity, which is a parameterization of the particle aspect ratio. So negative values are disc. negative values are disks, positive values are rods, zero is the aspect ratio one cylinders. And the smaller markers correspond to the smaller particles. So the smallest circles are the smallest of the cylinders and the largest circles are the largest of the cylinders. Okay, so that's what the standard deviations look like without waves. What if we add waves? With waves is these red points. Waves is these red points. So we can see that the standard deviations are greater when there are waves than when there are not waves for basically all of the cases, except for the very largest of the cylinders. If we want to look at that more quantitatively, we can take the ratio between the standard deviations with waves and the standard deviations without waves. So that's plotted here. So that's plotted here. So, again, this is the ratio of the standard deviations of the landing locations of the particles with waves versus without waves. And again, the asterisks are these discs, are the disks, the triangles are the rods, and the circles are the cylinders. And the first thing to notice from the plot is the magnitudes of these ratios because they're very large. So the most extreme case is the thin. Case is the thin rods, which spread out four times as much in waves as without waves. And even the smaller values on here, such as these thick disks, are still pretty large values. So these thickest of the disks spread out 150% as much in waves as when there are not waves. The other thing to notice is that shape is clearly important. Is clearly important. So the rods in general spread out more than the discs or the cylinders, and the thinnest rods disperse more than the thickest rods, and the thinnest discs disperse more than the thickest discs. So shape matters. But one question that this plot leads us to ask is: we can notice how these thickest of the cylinders are much less dispersed by the waves. Much less dispersed by the waves than the smallest of the cylinders. And so that makes this question: what are the effects of particle volume? And so that's what we'll look at next. And we look at this using the Archimedes number, which is the ratio between the gravitational and viscous forces. This is the formula for the Archimedes number. Gravity, Lp cubed is the particle volume, density of the fluid, the density difference between the particle and the fluid. The density difference between the particle and the fluid, and mu, of course, is the viscosity. Um, and for us, the only thing that changes between the particles is the volume. So, looking at a plot against Archimedes' number is the same thing as looking at a plot against particle volume. The particle density also varies slightly between particles, and so that's captured by these horizontal error bars. So, what we see from this plot is that the higher Archimedes. Plot is that the higher Archimedes' number is, or the larger the particle is, the less dispersed the particles are by the waves, which is what we expected from our eccentricity plot. It also makes sense, considering the definition of the Archimedes number, larger particles experience stronger gravitational forces, so they're more persistent and settling when they're being pulled about by the flow. Also, intuitively, it makes sense. Intuitively, it makes sense. Larger particles are more inertial. So, we expect them to be less, their trajectories to be less affected by the fact they're being pushed around by the waves. One other thing to notice in this plot is there is still some spread in the data. So, we can say that definitely there's a trend that larger particle volume means the particles disperse less, but this doesn't negate the impact of particle shape. Particle shape is still important. Particle shape. Particle shape is still important. One question that this plot leads us to ask is: we see that the larger particles are less dispersed by the waves than the, or sorry, since we know that the larger particles are less affected by the waves, what if that's just because they spend less time in the flow? So they just have less time to be dispersed by the waves. Dispersed by the waves. And so we can investigate that by using the mean distance the particles travel. So up till now, we've only been looking at the standard deviation of their landing locations. So how much did they spread while they were in the flow? But we can also just take the mean dis the mean of their landing location. So how far did they go? And by taking the ratio between the means with and without waves, that's a proxy for. Can't that's a proxy for the time the particle spend in the flow with and without waves. So, looking at this plot, we can see that the particles do travel farther when there are waves, first of all. And partly that's explained because our depth average mean velocity increases slightly when there are waves. So that explains up to, it only increases a It only increases 10%. So that explains up to 1.1. Beyond that, the increase is likely due to how the waves are interacting with the particles. And as this mean ratio increases, the standard deviation ratio also increases. So the particles that are transported farther by waves do disperse more in the waves. However, However, if the particles were only dispersing more in the waves because they had more time in the flow, then we would expect that all of these points would fall on the one-to-one line. But actually, the one-to-one line is way down here and it's very flat relative to this slope. So there's clearly more going on here. The particles are not simply dispersing more because if Are not simply dispersing more because they've had more time to disperse. They're also dispersing more because of how they're interacting with the waves. So we can summarize these dispersion results. Waves clearly matter a lot. Particles disperse much more under weights than when there are not waves. This can be up to four times as much, we saw with our thinnest rods. We saw with our thinnest rods. Vertical shape also matters. The rods disperse more than the disks or cylinders, and the thinnest of the rods disperse more than the thickest rods, and the thinnest disks disperse more than the thickest disks. And particle size also matters. Larger particles disperse less under the waves than smaller particles. So now let's move on to talk about settling. Talk about settling and settling is related to dispersion. As we talked about with the travel time, we did see that even though it wasn't all that was going on, we did see that the dispersion increased with increasing or with decreasing settling time. And that makes sense, obviously, if the particles fall to the floor, they can't be dispersed anymore and they can't travel any farther. So it is important to have their dispersed. It is important to how they're dispersed and how far they go. So, this is a schematic of our settling experiment. It's somewhat similar to the dispersion experiment. We still have a wavy flow. We're generating waves, but this time there is no current. And we again release negatively buoyant particles close to the surface, this time from a swing, and they've Swing and they fall into the flow. But now we are imaging them as they fall so we can get their velocities and their trajectories. And we've also seated the flow with tracers. So we can get the flow velocities around the particles. So we illuminate the tracers with this laser sheet, and we also illuminate particles with these LEDs. These LEDs, and we can see them both at once near each other. So these are the experimental microplastics for this experiment. We have fewer this time. We just have discs, rods, and spheres as the intermediate case. For the discs and rods, again, they're matched with the longest dimension at seven millimeters. The spheres are a bit smaller at three millimeters. At three millimeters, and also slightly heavier, but just slightly. So this is what our images look like. So the large white spots are the particles and the small dots are the tracers. And from our images, we can get the velocities of the flow field, the tracers, and we can also get the velocities of the particles and their full trajectory. Particles and their full trajectories. Okay, so we're interested in how particles are settling. So we should look at the vertical velocities of the particles first. And we are going to normalize those by the quiescent settling velocity of the particles because we want to know what they do differently when they're at waste. So a value of one means that the particles are settling in the same That the particles are settling in the same way or with the same average vertical velocity in waves as in quiescent flow. And we're plotting this against a particle Reynolds number. And this particle Reynolds number, we're defining as the inertia of the flow at the length scale of the particle. So we're going to, this is going to be defined slightly differently than you may have seen it at other times. This is the formula that we're using. So, Lp is the longest length dimension of the particle. ν is the viscosity of the fluid. This omega A of Z is a velocity scale corresponding to the flow around locally to the particle. So, how we get that omega A of Z is from our tracer field. We have all the velocities of the flow. We have all the velocities of the flow, and so we can fit a sine curve to the tracer velocities at any given depth. And the amplitude of that sine curve is this omega A of Z. So basically what you need to remember is that this particle Reynolds number is going to be higher in the flow where the waves are the strongest and lower in the flow where the waves are the weakest. Beakest. So, right now we're just showing spheres on this plot, which are the circles. But now, let's look at what the disks and rods look like as well. So these blue asterisks are disks and these red triangles are rods. And just a reminder, the vertical velocities have been normalized by the quiescent settling velocities. So values greater than one mean the particles are settling more quickly in ways. Particles are settling more quickly in waves, and values smaller than one mean the particles are settling more slowly in waves. So the spheres, which are these circles, have an increasing vertical velocity as this particle Reynolds number increases. So when they're higher up in the flow, when the waves are stronger, they settle faster than they would in quiescent fluid. Fluid. The discs maintain a constant or their vertical velocity stays close to their quiescent vertical velocity up to a certain particle Reynolds number, but then above that, their settling velocity is also enhanced by the presence of waves. And so they are at the highest particle Reynolds numbers, they settle much faster than. Much faster than they do in quiescent flow. The rods are interesting. They start out actually having their vertical velocities decreased by the presence of waves, so they settle more slowly when there are waves up to a certain particle rounds number, but then above that, their velocities are actually increased as well. So they settle more quickly. So we'd like to understand better. So, we'd like to understand better: like, what are these velocities coming from? Why do the velocities look like this? And we can think of the particle velocities as coming from two components. The first is how are the particles falling relative to the flow? And the second is, how is the flow carrying the particles? So, if you look at these orbitals, the particles are going. The particles are going around in these orbitals because, or these are the particle trajectories. So, the particles are going around in these orbitals because they're being carried by the flow, but they're also falling downward and settling, and that's them falling relative to the flow. So, first, let's look at the relative velocity of the particles. So, this is how are the particles falling relative to the flow around them. So, basically, we can just Them. So basically, we can just take the difference between the vertical velocity of the particle, and then we can interpolate our flow field to the location of the particle, and then simply take that difference between those two velocities. So that's what we're plotting here. And as before, circles are spheres, asterisks are disks, triangles are rods. And again, we've normalized by the quiescent settling velocity. By the quiescent settling velocity of the particles, because in quiescent fluid, the relative velocity is equivalent to the settling velocity. So what we see is that there's no variation in the vertical velocities of particles with particle Reynolds numbers. So when we bend this way and we average the values, the average values are the same as they would be in quiescent fluid. So the particles fall. So, the particles fall relative to the flow on average in the same way as they would in quiescent fluid. So now that means we should think about how is the flow carrying the particles. In a wavy flow, a tracer is tracing out circular orbitals, and so the average value of that the tracer Of that, the tracer experiences is zero in the vertical direction. However, it's possible since these particles are inertial that there could be a difference between the flow velocities they're experiencing and the flu velocities that a tracer would experience. So we're interested in what is this difference. So here we've interpolated again our tracer velocity field to a location. Our tracer velocity field to the location of the particle, and we say what are those flow velocities the particle is experiencing at any given moment. And we again normalize by the quiescent settling velocity for consistency with our other plots. And we're still plotting against particle Reynolds number. As before, circles are spheres, asterisks are disks, and triangles are rods. And we see something very similar to what we saw with the vertical velocities of the particles. With the vertical velocities of the particles. So the spheres, as the particle Reynolds number increases, they tend to sample more downward flow velocities. The disks don't sample anything differently up to a certain particle Reynolds number, but then above that, they also sample more downward flow velocities. And the rods, again, are interesting. They sample more upward flow velocities for these intermediate values of our part. For these intermediate values of our particle Reynolds numbers, but then the higher the particle Reynolds number is, the more downward flow velocities they sample. So this looks quite similar to what we already saw with the vertical velocities of particles. So let's compare. And so here we're plotting the vertical velocities of particles against how the particles have sampled the flow. How the particles have sampled the flow. And we subtract one off the particle vertical velocities, which is subtracting off the normalized quiescent settling velocity. And basically all this data lines up on this one-to-one line. The dashed line is a one-to-one line. So we can say that the particles, even though they have a constant average relative velocities, because they're non-uniformly sampling the flow. Non-uniformly sampling the flow, their vertical velocities can vary quite significantly with their shape and with the particle Reynolds number. So to summarize overall, we saw with both dispersion and settling that waves are very important. When there are waves, particles disperse much more than when they're not waves. When you're higher, when the flow is more wavy, that means there's. It's more wavy, that means there's the particle Reynolds number is higher when you're higher in the waves, and that can lead to a lot of variation in the settling velocities of the particles. We also saw that shape was important. Rods and disks disperse differently from each other, and they settle differently from each other. And for dispersion, we also saw that particle size is very important to how particles dispose. Important to how particles disperse. So, I'm very excited for the upcoming talk about the impacts of particle size on models. So, thank you so much for listening, and I'll go ahead and take any questions. That's great. Thanks, Laura. So, it looks like Bruce, is that a hand up? Yes, it is. Yes, it is. And maybe Nimish is going to ask this question, anyways, but I'll ask first because I seem to have a habit of taking other people's questions. I was trying to put together your observations and the experiments with what Nimish talked about yesterday, where he was showing that the vertical Stokes strip acting on cetacling particles would increase the rate of descent. And yet, in some of your experiments, you saw that the rate of descent was slowed down, particularly for the rods that. Down, particularly for the rods at these somewhat small particle violence numbers. Can you help me just understand how I can put these two things together? Yeah, well, so for the spheres, the spheres are the same data that Nimish showed yesterday. So spheres, we see that when the flow, when they're in the waves, their settling velocity is enhanced. However, rods and disks behave. Rods and disks behave very differently in waves and spheres. And we can't fully understand the mechanism of why, but they can orient differently. That affects their drag, the lift forces they experience. So we don't really expect them to show the same exact things as spheres. But yeah, it's still an open question of exactly what's happening and why. Yeah, I guess so. The issue is the orientation might be changing. The orientation might be changing. I guess that brings to question when you're normalizing these settling velocities, say without waves and just quiescent fluid. Yeah, that would depend on the orientation you used when you took that measurement. So what did you use? Were you assuming the rods, say, were effectively horizontal or were they more vertical? Yeah, we simply released them at the top, similarly to how we'd release them, and we just took the total time and distance that they. Time and distance that they went to get the velocity. So, kind of a statistical average over lots of different orientations. Yeah. And that won't affect the shape of any of these results. So, we're just saying, like, oh, when they look close to one, they're basically doing the same thing as in quiescent fluid. Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot, Laura. Really enjoyed your talk. Yeah, thank you. Okay, Nimish. Hi, Laura. Yeah, really nice talk. Thanks. Hi Laura, yeah, really nice talk. Thanks. I had two quick questions about the dispersion part, the first part you showed. The first was something that I the results show something opposite to what I was thinking naively, so maybe you can help interpret that. The waves oppose the current, and so the mean of the dispersion, so the mu values, I would have expected these ratios on the horizontal axis to be less than one since the waves are opposing the current. So with waves, Waves are opposing the current. So, with waves, they travel less far on average than they do without waves. Yeah, we would have expected that as well. First of all, though, like the Stokes drift is only going to impact their trajectories at the top and they are settling. So that's part of it. There could also be just the reverse. We don't have very much reverse flow, but there could be a little bit. But also, But also, we don't totally know why they went farther. Like, this is what happened, and we're like, huh, interesting. But yeah, so. Okay, good. So, yeah, same intuition. Yeah. Okay. So, again, forgetting about the shape effects here, because that's more complicated, just looking at the cylinders, which are quasi-spherical. You know, in the work we did together that I talked about yesterday, we saw that the initial conditions, i.e., the phase of the initial release. i.e., the phase of the initial release matters a lot. So I wonder whether you've looked at that and have helped, you know, that maybe helps explain the greater dispersion in the waves. That we think is definitely a factor. But the amplitude of the waves is pretty small. It's only 1.5 centimeters. And so the excursion length is very small. But the amount of dispersion is over like half a meter. Dispersion is over like half a meter to a meter. So there's a lot more happening too. So we think that's one factor. And we think there's also other factors as well. But because the effective wave averaged initial position will be really sensitive. Right. Yeah. And so they're being released at different phases. And so that's definitely, yeah, we definitely think that that's an important factor. Yeah. Okay. Well, while we're waiting for other people to maybe think of questions, I've got one. You've talked a bit about having this mean current and these different, like these surface waves. Have you varied the sort of relative strength of your current? Like, I know that this is getting into a huge parameter space potentially, but have you thought about like changing? But have you thought about like changing this kind of background flow versus wave setup? Yeah, we have thought about that. Right now, we're in the like sweet spot where there's not turbulence, but the particles still go far enough that we can kind of see what's happening and they have time to disperse and whatever. So, yeah, it would be interesting, but we haven't looked into it. Also, But we haven't looked into it. Also, we're seeing that the waves matter so much that we think, even though turbulence will obviously matter a lot, simply current by itself might be less important in this case. Yeah, and mostly our pro, like our profile, like there could be some small bottom boundary layer effects, but we don't think that that's mattering very much. So changing it might just make have a big Changing it might just make have a bigger signal with if there weren't turbulence. But no. Okay. Claudia. Hi. Can I ask you, how do you change what you define in particle Reynolds number? Is that just looking at the particle at different height above the bottom as it descends? Or do you? Yeah, essentially, yeah, at any depth, it will have a different particle Reynolds number because the flow. Because the flow, the characteristic flow velocities will be different. So, and why for these cylinders, you have only three points and for the others, you have a lot. Oh, yeah, I'm going to mention that. They're smaller. And so their length, since the particle Reynolds number is multiplied by the longest dimension of the particles, that collapses that data into a smaller space. I thought there were seven millimeters. They were fielded by three millimeters instead of seven millimeters. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And they're also slightly heavier, so they settle faster. So that means we also have like a little bit of less data at any given. And I was wondering, why do you use the Archimede number and not something like the Stokes number to differentiate between, you know, these things that particles kind of settle different because they have a different mass, because they have a different volume. I wonder, didn't yeah, the Stokes number is. Yeah, the Stokes number is also would be good to look at. It's less obvious how to define it in waves. There's different ways of doing it. Michelle and Imish have both shown different ways, but for these, these are non-spherical particles in waves. And so it's not trivial to just define a Stokes number versus the Archimedes number is also commonly used for particles. And so, and it has a clear definition for us. Okay, great. For us, okay, great, thank you. Yeah, okay, any other questions, comments, thoughts? All right, well, I mean, you've got the floor for a couple more minutes, Laura, but thanks again for a really interesting talk. For a really interesting talk, and it's
