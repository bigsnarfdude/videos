I can't go to there, but it's my great pleasure to give a talk. So, thank you, all of you. So, today I'm going to talk about our recent work. It's about the spreading property of two species locavotera competition diffusion system. So this work based on this talk is based on the joint work with Professor Yihon Du, who is also here. Who is also here, and Tongyen Xiao, and Mao and Zhou. Okay, so let's start with this very standard and classical local terra2 species competition diffusion model. Let's say problem P. And here X belongs to R. And we consider the Cauchy problem. The first model, we actually will discuss two different. We actually will discuss two different types of problem. But firstly, we focus on this standard problem and associated with the initial condition, U0 and V naught are defined in R. And actually, we consider two different types of initial data, 1.1 and 1.2. So 1.1 is, let me draw the picture. Let me draw the picture. So here U naught is non-negative and it's of complex support. This is U naught. And V has a positive low bound. So V naught initially occupy the whole space. So we may simply consider V is something like this. So V naught is we can imagine. V naught is we can imagine that V naught is native species and U naught is invasive species. Okay, and the second one is two species are invasive species, invasive, so something like this. So we want to know the spreading property of U and V based on these two initial data. So of course I will show you later. So, of course, I will show you later. There are so many interesting work related to this model. Okay. So, the second model is slightly different. We discuss, so Professor Jong Seng Guo and Professor Yi Hong Du and myself, we spent time to study the problem Q. Here we consider the same problem, the same model. A slight difference is that A slight difference is that we consider here is Laplace R is means the user Laplace operator acting on frequency symmetric functions in Rn. So R is a special variable. So here, intrinsic growth rate here, R, we should replace it by gamma. And I mean, the different part is we introduce two unknown functions. Two unknown functions, S1 and S2, to describe the haptite of two species. So here the U naught is occupied, initially occupy a finite interval, something like this. And this is, we call it S10. And after time goes on, this point will move to the right. So it could be seen as the function. So, it could be seen as the function of t. So, we call it a spreading front. So, similarly, we have a v naught here and initially occupy this interval from 0 to 2. And then, after time goes on, it will evolve to a function of t. So, we have a known function s1, s2, and u, and the v. So, here. And u and v. So here u is a function of r and t. V is also seen as a function of and t. So we need to impose the condition to determine how s1s2 move. Okay, so here we use the seven condition. So s1s2, the rate of s1s2 depend on proportional Depend on proportional to the gradient U at the boundary. So it's called the Steven condition. And here, Bountin Du Kurakowski, this work explain, used the fixed law and introduce so-called traveling laws to explain how this condition appears in ecological models. And also, those and also it could be imaged we can imagine that if you have a very strong competit very strong competitor outside and V also has another very strong competitor outside but their competition rate is very strong so maybe we can consider linking problem to reduce this condition so related to this So, related to this, this is kind of a viewpoint of modeling. We can see the work of Hirholes, Ida, Mura Sensei, and Nomiya-sense. Also, Izihara, Monopen, and myself. Okay, so today my talk is trying to share with you some recent progress on problem P, which is a caution problem, and problem Q, which is a moving boundary problem. Okay, so. Okay, so let me show you some previous works. For problem P, troubling wave and entire solution are studied widely. So we can list very many interesting work. So sorry, I apologize that for those not listed, I can only show you some. Okay. And spreading property means that we consider crushed property. Property means that we can see the closure problem. So we give an initial data either 1.1 or 1.2. Then there are some works. So today we will focus on this case. This case is a case less than one and H is bigger than one, means the U is stronger species and the V is weak. So in ODE sense, one, zero is stable and zero, one is unstable. Is unstable. Okay. And for weak competition, Lien Li and Liu Liu Len has some works. And for bistable case, Career and recently Ray Pong and myself and Marlin Zhou has some progress, but we are not going to talk about this today. We only focus on this case. Okay, so. So also we have many similar issue, many interesting work, for example, cooperative systems or predator prey systems. And also even though the three species systems, we have many interesting work, reference that we can read. Okay. But for free boundary problem, the result is not like the Kutch problem. It's not like the Kutch problem. So we can only find a few papers about this. And today I try to say something about this case. Okay. All right. So let's go to the closure problem first. So everybody probably knows the long-time behavior strongly depends on the behavior of the traveling wave. Behavior of the traveling wave. So, if you know the traveling wave, then you can determine the long-time behavior. So, fortunately, Kang Long in 97, he showed that there is a minimum wave speed, C star, so that the problem P has a trouble wave solution as long as the C is bigger than or equal to C star. So, C star is called minimum sp and so we can draw. So we can draw a picture to show you the profile. This is U, this is V. And the U is stronger species, so C. So the wave will move to the right with speech C for any C is bigger than C star. And when C equals to two times square root one minus K. 1 minus k, we call it a profound case, or we can say C star is linearly selected. Otherwise, we call it a push front case or say it's non-linear selected. I think Mao Lin should have a talk about this. So I'm not going to explain this too much. But I want to say this problem is quite interesting, and there are so many references. So I can just sound then. I can just design them. Okay, so today we want to focus on the long-term behavior. So usually we can expect that if consider pushfront case, then if we consider KPP equation, then we know the long-time behavior. The convergence of a solution would be simpler than this case, because in this case, we would have a so-called Brown. We will have a so-called Brownson collection, right? So, today we only focus on this simple case, simple case. So, our first result is we try to extend the work of Rose who studied monstable equation, say single equation, to have a push-front case, long-term behavior of solution in the push-front case system. Push-front case system. So under this condition, and we consider the initial data is this is u not, this is v not, then we can expect the solution will converges to a travel wave solution. And there's no Brownson correction. So there's an edge which is dependent. There is the H, which is dependent on initial data, so that the U and V converges to the traveling wave. So it's not surprised. Okay. So in some sense, we can get a better understanding for the spreading profile. We improve the result of Louis Lee and Wamberger, who studied the spreading property for this problem. Problem and also, it's in some sense, we extend the work of Doroth from the single equation to two species competition diffusion system. And the key idea to prove it is firstly we should obtain some exponential decay estimates. So in some region, we show that the u tends to one exponential. tends to one exponentially and v tends to zero exponentially or u tends to zero exponentially and so on. So after we get this exponentially decay rate, we can construct a super sub solution so that after some large time t, the solution can be screened by a suitable super sub solution. So in some sense we can get the local local asymptotic stability. Local asymptotic stability. And for system, because it's a we have comparison principle, so we can use the sliding method to make sure the omega limit state has only unique elements. So we can prove this. Okay, so there are several, there are another way to prove. I think Professor Xiao Chang Zhao is an expert in this. He can use the dynamical system approach to show this. approach to to to show this result easily i think so when we consider um tools another initial data both species are invasive then it's more interesting so we should mention the remarkable work done by leo and andrew andrew in uh 2019. so we firstly we consider for single species case you spread Single species case, you spread at the speed 2. We call it Cu. And if without U, single species V spread at the speed C V, which is called the Q square root R D. Okay, so this is a minimum wave speed for U. This is U. This is V. So, the remarkable work done by Leo and Andrew, they show that Cu and C V are very important to control the dynamics. So consider P and initial data, you know, with the compass support with the support included in left half line, you can just like looks like, okay, for example, here. For example, here you naught and the v naught could be uh okay. U naught here, we just assume it's a compass approach to fit our assumption. But here, here's a star, okay. So if I remember correctly, there were considered more general initial data, it could be have a decay rate, exponential decay rate. Rate, exponential decay rate. So, okay, so anyway, here we only consider complete support. So, if U is single U is spread faster than V, then because U is stronger species, right? So eventually V disappear. We cannot find, we cannot see V in the long run. And the C1, C2, Cu between C1 and C2. So this tell us. Tell us Cu is exactly the spreading speed. Okay, so in this case, eventually you just see only spread to the right without V. Okay, so but most actual case is C V is bigger than C U so V is spread, V spread faster than U in the single species case. Then in that case, In that case, we can expect there is the picture something like here because U is slower. So V should be something that looks something like this. V is faster. So here's the C V. And so U is store diffuse, store species. So here we So here, we may expect here this power should be traveling wave solution. So we may expect this should be C star. It's for traveling wave solution for two species case, right? But somehow they show that there can be another speed which is faster than C star. So they actually define some function. actually define some function and they find a critical value called F C star. So if C V is, so if C V is above this critical value, then the speed of U would be C star. But if C V is below this critical value, Below this critical value, then you will choose another faster speed called ACC. So this behavior is called a non-local pooling. So in some sense, if C V is bigger enough, it's just like a two speech traveling. Like a two-speech traveling wave on the left-hand side, and on the right-hand side, we just like a feature KPP traveling wave. So in that case, it's easier to count to show the long-time behavior. Okay, but in this case, fortunately, so far we didn't have any results for the Any results for the convergence of solution. So for this case, if you choose this lower speed, we can show the result is u and v if you choose the speed c naught is between c star and c star plus some small epsilon. Some small epsilon, and over this region, you will see the traveling wave solution. And if you go faster, you choose the bigger speed than C star, you will see V propagates as this traveling wave, single traveling wave for V equation with resentment. Okay, so this is our result. So, unfortunately, in this case, we do not know how to prove the convergence of the solution because we actually do not have an exact weight profile for our candidates. Okay, so this is our second result. And as a corollary, if you is If u is faster than v, I mean, in the single species case, then of course we can see u disappear and eventually we only have a u propagates just like a single species. So this could be a corollary. So our results here is partially improve the spreading from studied in Studied in the work of Liu and Len. Okay, so this is our first part. Okay, so I still have three minutes. So another part is the free boundary problem. And in this case, we have four possible dynamical behavior. So unlike behavior. So unlike Koch problem, in this model, we do not have a hair trigger effect. So we only have we can have four possible dynamical behavior. First one is both two species die out eventually and one die out and the other one spread successfully and exchange their role. But more interesting is rule but more interesting is if they're eventually s1t and s2t both of them tends to infinity so what happened so in this case we we focus on this case so previous work we only see the type four can happen but we do not know the exactly how the solution looks like so in 2018 we 2018, we consider certain conditions on initial functions. We can show the solution is something like eventually it looks like this. So there is a slow speed, there is a fast speed. So just like a cloud problem, this part should be the single species propagates as a traveling wave. And this part is another Is another troubling wave, but for two species case. Okay, so numerical simulation shows that we do have four cases. It's like only V vinishing, only U vinis, and two species can coexist. Here we call trace and run coexist because C2 is bigger than C1. So the slower species cannot catch up with the faster. Cannot catch up with the faster species. This is stronger species, this is weak species. But somehow, okay, interesting part is here. So, what happened here? So, in this work, we find out that it could have another behavior. It's because time is, I'm almost running out of my time. So, I just want to say. I just want to say there is another behavior about because S3 is like two species spread at the same speed. But we do not prove it yet because we only prove F3 in this case can occur for some spatial initial data. And this tells us the species, weak species and the Weak species and strong species, their distance between them is always finite. So, this is our new result. We just explained this part, what happened in this part. So, because I don't have time, so eventually we can show F3 can occur in some sigma. Sigma is a family of dilated functions, the parameter of the function. functions the parameter of the family of related functions. Anyway, so I should stop. So our summary is we consider two different problem and the coach problem has a head trigger effect but the free boundary problem does not have this property. And from P we know there is a non-local pooling phenomenon, but it should not occur in our free boundary problem. Our free boundary problem. And also, we expect that for special case S3, I mean, the two species, they have a finite distance in the long run, we expect that there is a new type traveling wave that can occur. It should be something like this. And this part should be eventually. Eventually, the distance should be some L star, and the two species spread as the same speed. It's what we expect, but we didn't succeed to prove it yet. Okay, so sorry. So thank you for your attention. Are there questions or comments? Questions or comments? I have one. Thanks for the talk, very interesting. So in the case of the non-local cooling, so non-local cooling means that it's the natural decay of you, which is affected something like... Which is affected, something like that, right? For which this C accelerating, accelerated C? Does it come from the exponential decay of U, which is some sense affected by V? Yes. Yeah. So what is the precise? Yes. Yeah. So, so, so it means that the The behavior, the tail behavior of V would affect the speed of U. So, in this case, so the convergence to a front is not known. Yeah, it's unknown. Are there Are there other questions? So, very nice work. Thank you. This is not question is not about your work, but the work of Gerard and Lam. The presence of a competing species could accelerate the speed of view. The speed of view, and what is the intuitive interpretation of this phenomena? Clearly of any idea? Sorry, sir. I'm not very understanding your question because the voice is a little bit echo. So your problem is about non-local pulling? So problem P. My question is the presence of The presence of a competing species, P, could accelerate the speed of U. And do you have an intuitive explanation of this phenomenon? Okay, so intuitively, I think it's just like if V is weak, but it's faster, and if it's not fast enough, so there leaves. So there leaves some room at positive infinity to make you can push them faster. So if we move too fast, then the tail behavior of you should become weak. So it couldn't push, it couldn't spread so fast. So I'm not so sure it's correct or not, but I basically what I thought. But I basically what I thought. But if there is no V, there is nothing which pushes U, and then the spin is C star. C U. A C U C U. C U C U. The C star is a little faster as bigger thank you. Okay, thank you. Sometimes I cannot hear you very well. Sorry, it's an echo. Thank you. Because of the voice of the microphone. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Gay.
