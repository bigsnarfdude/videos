Can you hear him remotely? We can hear from remote. You can hear me. It's working now. Thanks. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And you can see the slides. Okay. So I am very grateful for this opportunity to talk here at the BARS workshop. Talk here at the BERS workshop. It is really a pity that I wasn't able to be there in person. Unfortunately, the time difference makes it very difficult to participate very much, but I hope you still get something out of this talk, which is now going to focus a bit more on the co-collapse side of things. I still want to flag, and this is. Flag, and this is something that you are all aware at this meeting. I know that when we're talking about gravitational waves, we just have one facet of the many multimessenger aspects of core collapse supernovae to cover. So I will also gauge a little bit how we go in terms of supernova theory against the other constraints. But I will focus mostly on the supernova modeling phase. Supernova modeling phase. And towards the end, I will say a little bit about gravitational updates on gravitational wave predictions. Unfortunately, as you know, Jade Powell had to cancel her talk, so I will try to cover this a bit, but I can't cover, do this as much justice as she could, I guess. All right. So, what's new in terms of Co-Collab supernova modeling? Supernova modeling. Well, I think you're all familiar with the usual picture after the collapse of an iron star, evolved massive star with an iron core, and the rebound and formation of a proto-neutron star. We can go to ways. We can have a revival of the stoll shock by neutrino heating with the neutrinos coming from the protein. Neutrinas coming from the protein neutrinos are in its surface, heating up the material behind the shock, and that hopefully energizing the shock wave in conjunction with hydrodynamical instabilities, convection, and shock oscillations, which are really the phenomena that would give rise to gravitational wave emission. So, in the neutrino-driven scenario, this is what we think applies, and there has been something of a dichotomy. Been something of a dichotomy. We had assumed for a long time that, in addition to neutrino-driven explosions, a smaller fraction of stars would explode by means of rotation magnetic fields, where the magnetic fields tap the rotation energy of a rapidly rotating neutral star, or maybe an accretion disk in the collapser scenario, and that transfers energy into. Transfers energy into the post-struct material and drives an explosion. Now, I will argue in this talk that in the last one or two years or so, we have recognized that there is maybe much less of a dichotomy between those two scenarios and that we should have a much broader look at the role of magnetic fields in core collapse supernova. In corkalab supernova explosions, then just focusing on the less than 1% of supernovae that explode as hypernovae. So why is that? Let's briefly review where the neutrino-driven explosion models stand. This is some overview by our group, so a bit subjective, but I'd like to refer, for example, to our colleagues in Princeton. To our colleagues in Princeton, who are getting a similar result in terms of the landscape of explosions and failures of three-dimensional models of neutrino-driven explosions. What you see here is the exploding ones in blue, failures in red, and that's both for red supergiant progenitors that have retained the hydrogen envelope and for stripped envelope supernovae with outer hydrogen. With outer hydrogen envelope that have lost it because of mass transfer, for example. And you see, in this, I must admittedly somewhat inhomogeneous set, these are not from a single suite of simulations. These have been assembled over the years. We have found many successful explosions, just a few failures. Ironically, the failures are typically at lower. At typically at lower mass, few still at higher mass with black hole formation, plus a few high-mass cases where we might have something in between. A shock that goes off is driven out by neutrinos initially, and then you have black hole formation afterwards. And then it's a bit of a tricky question what actually comes out. Gravitational waves, incidentally, if we had something like this in the Milky Way, would be of great use, of course. Be of great use, of course, to diagnose what's going on. So, the bottom line is that the neutrino-driven explosion models have matured considerably over the last few years. And the problem of shock revival, shock revival by many groups seems to be pretty robust. There are still other groups that dissent, but that may be to the use of slightly different physics, slightly different progenitor models in the Models in the simulations. So I hope this will be sorted out. But the key thing to take away, though, is that I'd like to focus more on the open questions in order to get us to the need to consider the role of magnetic fields more strongly. Is that despite these successes in modeling shock revival and 3D supernova simulations, we might still have. Might still have some open problems there, and that can be seen if we look at explosion properties. So explosion energy predictions by supernova simulations are possible now thanks to sufficiently long simulations. That simply takes a lot more time to simulate than just reaching shock revival because there's a cycle of mass accretion and mass. Of mass accretion and mass ejection that continues after shock revival that can last for seconds and it can take well over a second for explosion energies to saturate. You see here in this set of models, we don't have saturated explosion energies yet, but we can formulate lower limits. And if we look at the lower limits or at the tentative predictions of explosion energies from some recent From some recent 3D models, we see and pitch them against observations. We find that they actually do not look so bad compared to explosion energies that we infer from light curves. And in particular, what we do reproduce is a general correlation between progenitor mass and explosion energy that is there in the observational data as well. So that gives us some. Gives us some confidence that we're capturing an essential part of the mechanism here. So, some feedback of the mass of accretion onto the neutron star with the explosion energy. That must be part of the mechanism to get this correlation. So, that seems to be captured. But in terms of absolute energies, we still have trouble among the red supergiant explosions. Among the red supergiant explosions to reach the higher end of the scale. So explosions well above 10 to the 51er, 10 to the 51 to 2 times 10 to the 51. And even for a given progenitor or ejector mass, we might be slightly lower than the observations suggest. In terms of nucleosynthesis constraints, the nickel masses that we get The nickel masses that we get. So the radioactive nickel-56 that's synthesized, that's not too far off. So you can get numbers in the ballparks of the observations of the order of several 0.01 solar masses for type 2 supernova explosions. That seems to be pretty okay. But in terms of explosion energy, even in the longest models that we've run so far, we might still need to have some little boost. Have some little boost in the explosion energies. If you look at other observational constraints based on compact remnant properties, what the models also do relatively well, they are able to reproduce decent neutron star masses, especially now that we know that the neutron star mass spectrum is a little wider than we assume. Wider than we assumed in the past. So there doesn't seem to be a big tension there. The kicks that come out of 3D simulations because of asymmetries in the ejector distribution range up to 1000 kilometers per second, so nicely aligned with the observed range of kicks. The spins of the neutron stars also do seem to be quite okay. Seem to be quite okay. So you can get spins naturally by asymmetric accretion down to the 10 millisecond range. But there are open questions also about the compact remnant properties. So for example, we have no explanation yet for what the radio observers tell us should happen, namely spin-kick alignment. So there's nothing there in the simulations yet to explain that. Explain that. And this is one of the motivations, or these points that I mentioned, these small tensions are one of the motivations for considering the role of magnetic fields in normal supernova explosions a bit more widely than we have in the past, where we focused mostly on the hypernovae. And another important question for us to address with the simulations in future is, of course, where do the magnetic fields of Magnetic fields of neutron stars come from, and why do we have this subclass of highly magnetized neutron stars, magnetars, which make up at least 10% of the young neutron star population and have surface fields that go up to well above 10 to the 14 Gauss. What's the origin of these fields in magnetars specifically and in neutron stars in general? And in neutron stars in general, is it a dynamo-generated field that is really set after the collapse? Or is it at least for the magnetars, does this have to do with a strong fossil field that is inherited from the progenitor? So it has been postulated, for example, that the magnetars might come from a subpopulation of highly magnetized, massive stars. Massive stars that could result from stellar mergers, where the strong magnetic field might be created during the merger and then retained as a fossil fuel throughout the evolution. This, of course, opens a can of worms because in order to really investigate the origin of neutron star magnetic fields, you need to know lots of things. You need to know what the magnetic field is. What the magnetic fields, what governs the evolution of magnetic fields in the progenitors. Presently, we can only do that with onely stellar evolution models. And it's not only sufficient to investigate what happens to the neutron star magnetic fields in the prompt phase after collapse, the first few, the first second or first few seconds of the evolution. The question is, The question is: Could you have a field burial of fields that are initially at the neutron star surface later by some fallback? Or conversely, what about the breakout of magnetic fields that might be generated in the protonutron star by some kind of dynamo and then emerge on the surface later on? So, as I said, this is a can of worms, really, but still a good reason to consider. Good reason to consider the evolution, the role and evolution of magnetic fields in co-collapse supernova simulations more broadly. So, well, we and other groups have really taken up the challenge and done that in by means of 3D MHD simulations. You know, give you a bit of a panorama of the results that we're starting to see and also the open questions that now arise. That now arise. So, what we did last year, for example, in work together with a PhD student, Vishnu Varma, whom you see mentioned on the slides more often, we just considered the case of very small, very weak seed magnetic fields in a normal supernova, so no rapid rotation, no strong seed fields whatsoever, and just And just consider that even in such a case, you might get relatively strong fields by amplification by a small-scale dynamo, which will not create a strong dipole necessarily, but could still lead to fields that might have a small dynamic impact on the dynamics of the supernova revolution after cobalt. And that is indeed the case because what you find is that due to the What you find is that due to the hydrodynamic instabilities, convection in particular behind the shock, you can efficiently magnify even small seed fields by a small scale dynamo. You see a visualization of the magnetic field structure in terms of the, yeah, what we have here is really, yeah, here is actually. Yeah, here is actually the ratio between the magnetic and thermal energy density. So the magnetic fields really get generated mostly by shear flows between the convective bubbles. And quite interestingly, that does have an effect on shock revival. You'll see that on the next slide. And the magnetic fields at the neutron star surface can actually become quite strong. So they put you in this particular So they put you in this particular simulation to a dipole of order 10 to 13 Gauss, which is sort of at the upper boundary of the pulsar magnetic dipole fields, which might be a bit of a worry in that these magnetic fields might be too strong. But I mean, with just one simulations, you may have stochastic effects. And the question is really also what, how does that behavior change at home? How does that behavior change at higher resolution? Maybe the dipole is not that strong, and so on. But there is good indication that the magnetic fields, even in normal cocoa supernovae, might become relatively strong, might reach normal or the highest field strength encountered in pulsar. And as I emphasized already, and as you see on this slide, they do have an important effect on the Important effect on the dynamics after collapse. You see here the shock trajectories for the MHD case in black, maximum, minimum, average shock radius, and the non-magnetic corresponding non-magnetic model in red, and some other quantities here. So the magnetic field energy in blue versus the kinetic energy that drives the magnetic field amplification over here. The critical calibration. Over here, the criticality factor, which quantifies how close we are to an explosion, down here in panel B. And yeah, so what do we learn from this? So what you actually see is that the magnetic model with initially very weak magnetic fields does take off and develop a neutrino-driven explosion here at about 0.25 seconds after bounce, whereas the purely high. Whereas the purely hydrodynamic model turns away from criticality and actually does not explode for a foreseeable time. And what is behind this really is that after the convection behind the shock kicks in, seriously at about 150 milliseconds after bounce, you go through this phase of very rapid field amplification, nearly exponential field amplification over many orders of magnitude. Over many orders of magnitude. And in the end, the magnetic field energy reaches about, let's say, 40% or so of the turbulent kinetic energy behind the shock. And that helps give you a bit of an extra push to shock expansion. And the bottom line is the magnetic fields, even in these neutrino-driven cases, can have something of an auxiliary role for shock revival and give rise to even more robust experiences. Rise to even more robust explosions. We still have to follow up, of course, what the long-term implications of consistently including magnetic fields in supernova simulations are on the explosion energy, for example. And since we did not, so since we were interested in this question of the origin of magnetars for a long time, We actually focused on this particular case now. So, what Vishnu Vama, whose name you've seen mentioned before, recently has done and has a paper in preparation on, is to actually consider the case, this hypothetical case where we have strong, very strong seed fields of the order of 10 to the 12 Gauss in the progenitor already, but no rapid rotation. So, physically, Rotation. So physically, this might be a realization of this fossil field scenario for the origin of magnetars. And in that case, what he gets is actually a much bigger effect of the magnetic fields on shock revival. They considerably precipitate the explosion. So you get a rather early explosion in this strong magnetic field progenitor model. Field progenitor model. And quite interestingly, because the explosion takes off so early, he is actually able to get within just 200 milliseconds to, let's say, the typical explosion energies of close to 10 to the 51 erg, which is interesting because that might have broader implications. You might ask, do the magnetic fields, might we generally have strong magnetic seed fields in the progenitors that could. Seed fields and the progenitors that could precipitate the explosion. I don't want to preempt any conclusions. This is just an interesting hypothesis. But it shows that if you have strong magnetic fields in the progenitor, this can not only have a significant impact on shock revival, it can also have a significant impact on the explosion dynamics afterwards. And it's just to make things clear. It's just to make things clear, it's more of an indirect effect. So, the effect of the magnetic fields is really just to provide some extra push to get the shock revived and propagating out relatively soon. And it's still the neutrinos that mostly do the job in this case in terms of energizing the explosion. But the fact that the explosion kicks in earlier allows you to reach higher explosion energies because at that stage, the nutrient. Because at that stage, the neutrino heating is also still stronger. All right. And then, of course, there's this whole area that has already been very active on magneto-rotational explosions. And this is something really that other groups have pioneered in 3D, starting from the work of Winter and then Philip Merster and Takami Korora and Martinova Gawinger. And Martinova Gaulinger. You all know these, or I think you know all of these papers, I believe. We've also started to look into this a bit more. Jade has work on this in progress. And because it's something that really other groups have done more than us so far, I'd like to focus on a slightly different aspect here, namely that despite the That despite the great leaps forward that the 3D MHD simulations have taken, and despite our evolving understanding of how you might get strong magnetic fields due to some amplification processes after collapse, I think it is becoming somewhat clearer now that we also need to consider really the initial magnetic fields in the progenitor. Magnetic fields in the progenitor stars more strongly. So, people like Mataya Bulia are finding that if you assume strong seed fields, you have actually a strong sensitivity of the dynamics of magneto-rotational explosions to aspects like the field geometry in the progenitor. People usually, in these 3D simulations, just put in. 3D simulations that put in dipole fields, strong dipole fields by hand. And there's a lot of dependence on the detailed initial conditions. So whether you have poloidal fields dominating or toroidal fields dominating plays a role, what geometry is dipole, quadrupole, or spectrum of modes that will impact any early development of a magneto-rotational explosion. rotation explosion. So this is really throwing open up open the question what are actually the pre-collapsed magnetic fields for hypernova progenitors? And perhaps more broadly, I mean, for the hypernova scenario for magneto-rotational explosion, the rotation itself of the progenitors also remains a major uncertainty on the stellar evolution. Uncertainties on the stellar evolution side that still needs to be understood a lot better. And perhaps we even need to more broadly consider pre-collapse magnetic fields, even in normal co-collapse supernovae, given the role that we now think magnetic fields may play, even if you're not talking about hypernova explosions. So, again, this is work by Vision. By Vishnu in a paper from this year, where he investigated oxygen shell burning with magnetic fields to gauge how strong the magnetic fields would be that you generate before collapse and that would be felt in the info region at the critical phase where things become interesting for an explosion. And that's usually when the oxygen shell starts to reach the shock. So what Vishnu is So, what Vishnu is finding is again field amplification by turbulent convection. And the interesting thing to note there is that what Vishnu actually finds is the magnetic fields, in terms of their ratio to the ratio of magnetic energy to kinetic energy in these convective regions, they remain relatively weak. So they don't go. So, they don't go anywhere near equipartition to the hydrodynamical motion. So, they're clearly subsidiary to the turbulent flow. But still, the magnetic fields that you create in this way are relatively strong and quite some degree stronger than expected in standard cellular evolution models. So, he actually gets dipole. Actually, it gets dipole magnetic fields inside the convective, the oxygen convective region of up to 10 to the 10 Gauss on average. And even the dipole component is still about relatively strong with several 10 to the 8 and up to 10 to the 9 Gauss at the bottom of the oxygen shell. And that has implications for our Coco Lab supernova simulations because you could argue that we'd actually You could argue that we should actually start our simulations of the core collapse phase with relatively strong magnetic fields. There is some uncertainty here, though, that I should mention, which is that the operation of these magnetic dynam of these MHD dynamos can be sensitive to the microscopic transport coefficients, so to viscous. Transport coefficients, so to viscosity and magnetic resistivity. And that's quantified, the ratio of these two is quantified by the magnetic Prandtl number. And in the co-collapse supernova regime, after collapse, we're safely in the regime where we can assume that any small-scale dynamo operates efficiently in the progenitor phase, so in the late stages of Phase, so in the late stages of convective burning, we're in the regime where the magnetic Prandtl number is really close to one, and there is something more of an uncertainty of what the low viscosity limit of dynamos is in this case, whether you actually get just a weak dynamo or whether you're in the normal strong regime of high parental, magnetic parental number. Magnetic Prandtl number, if your Reynolds number is sufficiently high, there are some links here really to the theory of MHD turbulence, which need to be explored more in future. And one of the real questions that the progenitors, of course, progenitor modeling needs to answer, as I hinted, is that we need to better understand the Better understand the rotation of supernova progenitors. And it might be that the 1D stellar evolution models are still missing or not correctly modeling mechanisms for angular momentum transport that may have huge repercussions on the origin of hypernovae, which would require rapid rotation in the progenitor. And that's true. So complications arise in terms of. Complications arise in terms of missed effects in the progenitor evolution, even if we don't put in magnetic fields yet. So, what we are finding, for example, in the purely hydrodynamic case, this is work by Lucy McNeill, who's now moved to Kyoto University in Japan, that in convective shells, what you get, and that's in line with simulations of solar convection and also with theory. Solar convection and also with theory of rotating convection in other contexts is that you can get sort of super rotation of the regions near the equator compared to the pole and also slight super rotation in the sense that the star, the shell, rotates more rapidly at larger radii than at smaller radii, which is counterintuitive somewhat because that's not what your usual stability criteria. Your usual stability criteria for rotating convections would tell you, but it's something that is also known from convection in other contexts. And that can have possibly long-term repercussions on the transport of angular momentum in massive stars. Alex Heger, who's doing the stellar evolution of massive stars at Monash here, is currently investigating that, the possible impact of that in 1D stellar evolution models and finding. Revolution models in finding will small effects of slower core rotation in the pre-collapse in the pre-collapse cause if an effect like this super rotation in convective zones is included. Fortunately, this effect will actually be not so pronounced if the progenitor rotates fast to begin with. So you might be able to get away with this if you have if you have. If you have a hypernova progenitor that rotates rapidly to begin with, it might not be slowed down very much by this effect. But a bigger question is what rapid rotation will do in hypernomaprogenitas once you add the magnetic fields. And this is really more of an open question. So I can't really show you anything more than preliminary results yet, but in the simulation. In the simulations of rotating convection with magnetic fields that Vishnu is now doing, he does actually find, we do see indications that the coupling of convective shells by magnetic fields might be much quite strong and could lead to a in that the possible repercussions could include a relatively strong spin down of the Strong spin-down of the cores of massive stars before collapse, which might be sort of an impediment for magneto-rotational explosions driven by millisecond magnetars. But this is really just work in progress and very preliminary. But it's something that I want to flag as urgent work that needs to be done if we want to understand really the origin of hypernova exposure. Origin of hypernova explosions, in particular, whether we can have sufficiently rapidly rotating cores to form millisecond magnetars, or whether we might have an angular momentum distribution that is more skewed towards the outside, in which this would more predispose you towards hypernova exploits being powered by collapsers, in which case. Lapsars, in which case, slower core rotation in the beginning is not an impediment. So, bottom line is that there's much work done to be done for 3D and 1D progenitor modeling. So, let's have a quick look at gravitational waves at the end. We're moving towards the end. I hope I can remain roughly on time and consider what the magnetic fields do to the core-collapse supernova gravitational wave emission. So, before we go to the magnetic field, So, before we go to the magnetic field cases, a quick reminder about this picture, which is, I am sure, of course, every very, very familiar to all of you of the gravitational wave emission from normal supernova explosions powered by neutrinos, where, well, you might have a signal from rotational core bounce, and afterwards, you have mainly two signatures: the grammar, the F or G. The F or G mode with rising frequency as a function of time, and possibly an additional component of SAS from the SASI at lower frequencies, 100 to 200 hertz or so, whose and the FG mode frequency can be relatively well described by analytic relations in terms of key proto-neutron star parameters like neutron star mass and radius. Radius. So, how does this change in the case of magnetic fields? Well, this is also relatively tentative because the one systematic study that we have now done is has been with Ryland Jardine, an honor student here at Monash, has been done in 2D. So a broad parameter study of different initial magnetic fields and rotation rates in 2D supernova simulations. This will not, of course, be the final end of the story. End of the story, 3D is the way to go there, and some 3D models with magnetic fields are already there with gravitational wave predictions, although they're not necessarily in publications yet, but that will come soon. But what the 2D models do so far is, and I'll just focus maybe on the case of a real hypernova explosion driven by rotation and magnetic fields on the right here. And magnetic fields on the right here is as you add, in this case, for fast rotation in this whole series, as you add the magnetic fields, you eventually get a magnet rotational explosion, which is very, very strongly bipolar driven by jets. And the most marked signature of that really is that you get the strong, a strong tail, a strong memory effect in the gravitational wave signal from the Signal from the asymmetric expansion of the jets. And in terms of spectrograms, if you look at the raw spectrograms, this actually doesn't change too much. For those of you that have read the Jardin paper, there will be an update on this soon because we found there was some artifact in the magneto rotational model at late stages. So this spectrogram of magneto rotational models don't look so completely different, aside from the tail, the structure of the The structure of the spectrum is really just the same. But the interesting fact that we should be wary of is that the relations that we've established so far for the F and G mode frequency down here at high frequencies, that doesn't fit anymore. So the analytic relation for that is the black curve. That doesn't fit anymore. And that's something that we need to be wary of. To be wary of. Yeah, this just summarizes this, what I just said. So I'd like to say for those of you that have read the Jardin paper, stay tuned. There will be an update soon. And the bottom line in terms of detectability is, though, and this is quite interesting to flag, that aside from the rotational bound signal, which we Rotational bounce signal, which you would get for the magneto-rotational scenario, but which would not really probe the magnetic fields, the post-bounce emission over the first second or so doesn't really stick out compared to neutrino-driven explosions with strong gravitational wave emission. So these magneto-rotational models that we had there, two of them, there are strong gravitational wave emitters, but they don't stick out particularly in terms of detection. Particularly in terms of detection distance. They don't stick out particularly in terms of their spectral shape. So finding a fingerprint of magneto-rotational explosions is really somewhat tricky. There is work on the market there by Renault and Pablo Sala-Duran, who have been here at least for some of the other sessions, did some nice work on this. So there might be interesting fingerprints. Might be interesting fingerprints of the strong magnetic fields, really, from proto-neutron star convection on longer time scales, which I unfortunately can't cover today. But we might not get the smoking gun for strong magnetic field generation from the immediate explosion phase of a magneto-rotation explosion. It's worth having a look at this in 3D, though, of course. This is a big caveat. So, the simulations that Big caveat. So, the simulations that I just showed you, the waveform predictions were from 2D simulations. So, this brings me to my conclusion. So, in the key takeaway messages are really that despite progress in modeling neutrino-driven supernova explosions, we need to consider magnetic fields much more broadly in co-collapse supernova simulations, not just limited to the magneto-rotational explosions. And we need to worry much more about what the To worry much more about what the actual strength and geometry of the seed fields are in the progenitors of core collapse supernovae. We're relying on 1D stellar evolution for that at present, and 1D stellar evolution models are a big simplification when it comes to multidimensional phenomena. This is a huge construction site because very subtle issues of MHD turbulence can come into play. Integrals can come into play. And this is not something where we will get answers from just a few models. It's a long-term research program that we have to tackle there. And in terms of the gravitational wave emission from the impact of magnetic fields due to on gravitational wave emission, what I just showed you is that, well, there's not much systematic work. There's not much systematic work yet, so we've done that in 2D, and that doesn't seem to be a huge impact of the magnetic fields on, let's say, overall power and overall spectral properties. But there are subtle changes to the spectrum. So the mode frequencies are no longer simply related to neutron star parameters as we saw them. So if we were in the lucky position of actually being able to measure a spectrum very precisely, we'd have to be careful. We'd have to be careful in interpreting these. But more work on the gravitational waves in MHD supernova simulations really needs to be done in future. And of course, based on three-dimensional models, this is really just the beginning. And yeah, that's the end. And I'd be happy to take questions now. And thank you for your attention. Hey, Bernard, we lost you for the past five minutes or so. The internet just dropped out here. Just dropped out here. Oh, too bad. What should we do? I guess go back a little and then summarize. Yeah, so where did we lose me? I'm not quite sure what slide. It was a little bit after you began the discussion of the verification. Yeah, yeah, it was a bit after you started. Yeah, yeah, it was a bit after you started talking about gravitational waves. Okay, yeah. So maybe I think that the best way then is to quickly flash the gravitational waves again. So the key takeaway from recent research on gravitational waves is really that just a minute, we're still figuring things out here. Sure. Out here, sure, yeah, just let me know. Okay, good, good. Uh, try again, all right. So, the key takeaway on gravitational waves and the impact of magnetic fields on them is the following. So, this is just something that's beginning to be investigated. So, what we've done recently is to do a suite systematic parameter studies of rotational magnetic fields and the effect of gravitational wave emissions using 2D. Wave emissions using 2D simulations. And the key takeaway there is that, well, the really interesting effects start to kick in only if you go to very strong rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields so that you get rotational explosions, in which case the most characteristic signature on the gravitational wave signal, aside from the bounce signal, will be a strong tail in the gravitational signal. Strong tail in the gravitational wave signal. And otherwise, the spectrum looks relatively similar to normal cold-collapse supernova explosions. So the normal rise of a high-frequency node, which then becomes relatively quiet after the explosion. So I also wanted to alert you: in case you've read the Jardin, any of you have read the Jardin paper in the gravitational wave community, there will be an update. We figured out. Update: We figured out that the tail signal was actually much smoother than we had initially calculated, and the only thing that is really changed substantially is that any analytic relations for the F and G mode frequency don't work anymore. So, if you want to infer anything like neutron star masses or radius from the F and G mode frequency, if you could measure it, you'd have to be very careful. It you'd have to be very careful if you're talking about a case with strong with rapid rotation, strong magnetic fields. But otherwise, the spectrum looks very similar in 2D, and even magneto-rotational explosions don't stick out, at least in the post-bounce phase, for very high power or a different spectral shape than neutrino-driven explosions with strong gravitational wave emission. And if you wanted to look for a signature To look for a signature fingerprint of strong magnetic fields in a supernova, the phase to consider is probably protonutron star convection longer time scale, not work by us, but by Renault and Pablo and Jerome Dillier. But the key thing to take away is that for the magneto-rotational models, we really need to finally look at gravitational wave. To look at gravitational wave data from the two from 3D simulations, and that will come. And then I go back to my conclusions, which you can read. Okay, cool. Thanks. Okay. So do we have any questions in the room for Kerner? questions in the room for Bernard. Yeah, hi Bernard. Thanks for the talk and for getting up at 5 a.m. in the morning. So maybe you said it when we were disconnected. So you said that the spectrum, if you include magnetic fields, the spectrum of the gravitational wave signal remains the same. But what about what What about the strength, the amplitude? So, can we get higher range? Yes. Yeah, I mean, during the post-bounce phase, what you actually see, if you look closely, even in terms of amplitude, you don't stick out particularly. So the amplitudes are a little higher during. Are a little higher during the phase when the magneto-rotational explosion kicks off, but then they also die down faster than in a neutrino-driven explosion model. So in terms of overall power, you don't gain much really. What you do gain is that just because of the presence of rotation, you also have the bounce signal, which will aid detectability quite a bit. Yeah, and you might have effects of dynamo in the proton-neutron star on much longer time scales than we simulated here, as found out in this work by Renault, Sadaduran, and Guillé. So from the hot phase of the post-bounce evolution, you wouldn't get a big boost in a magneto-rotational. Boost in a magneto-rotational explosion, but of course, you still have those other two sources where you could get strong gravitational waves and a boost on overall power that would affect, positively affect detectability. Thank you. Do we have any questions on Zoom for Bernard? For Bernard. Okay, we have another question in the room. Hi, break out. I was just wondering. I just story like that. I was wondering. I just missed the first part of your question, unfortunately. Can you repeat your question? Can you specific code for the 2D simulations or like a GitHub repository? I was wondering, like, how for the waveforms for the waveforms, we will try to put them so Jade is managing our waveforms. So I think once the paper is through, she'll make these available. Yes. Yeah. And how many waveforms will you add? So, in total, we have it's about of the order of, I think, 20 waveforms. Okay. Mind you, only two of these are really magneto-rotational explosions. Any other questions on Zoom or in Zoom or in the room, no, okay. Well, let's thank Bernard again. Thank you, and sorry for the take. And with that, we will break for lunch and reconvene in about two hours. So, see you all then.
