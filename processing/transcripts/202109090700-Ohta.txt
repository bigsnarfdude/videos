Thank you very much for the introduction. I'd like to thank the organizers for the kind invitation. I'm very happy to talk in this conference. And my talk is about geometric analysis on Finstrampos. And I think this topic is maybe not very mainstream of this workshop. Of this workshop. So let me first explain briefly the aim of this kind of subject. So I'm actually a geometer and my main field is differential geometry and geometric analysis on various Coupled spaces. And then I'm always interested in the behavior of spaces under some constraint on the Under some constraint on the coverage. So it's called comparison theorems. So in this kind of theorems, we are interested in geometric or analytic properties of spaces whose curvature is bounded to below or above by some constant, like non-positive recovered spaces or non-negative recovered spaces. And then And then in this talk, we consider non-linearization of the gamma colour class. So, gamma colour class is celebrated slowly due to Bachery, MLE, Rudu, and so on. And then we consider the analog of gamma-car class on the Pinsla case, then we encounter non-linear Laplace. So, this is the main topic of this topic. Topic of this talk, and we will construct comparison theorems by using this technique. And then the main tool is the Bochona inequality, as always in the gamma-card class. And Finsel Bargeon Bohana inequality was established by myself and Teosturum in 2014. And as applications, we will show some functional inequalities. Maybe I will. Maybe I will only briefly explain these applications. So, the problem of my talk is just to first explain the ethics of Instrument Force and introduce weighted rich curvature and discuss non-linear comma calculus. Okay, so let me start with Bershek, so pincer mark or pincer geometry. So, a fincel manifold is just a manifold. So, in this n-dimensional connected smooth manifold with that boundary. And then Finstra structure is a function f on the tangent bundle. So, it is precisely the non-negative function, which is smooth outside the Outside the zero section. So at zero section, we cannot assume the smoothness. And I mean, if it's smooth on the zero section, it will be reduced to the Riemannian case. And then about the homogeneity, we assume the positive homogeneity to mean that F of C B coincides with the C times F of B for any tangent vector. B for any tangent vector B and positive constant C. And here we assume this homogeneity only in the positive direction. So C is just positive constant. And then about the convexity, we assume the so-called strong convexity. It means that for any non-zero tangent vector, we consider the symmetric matrix Gij of V, which is the So smooth which is the Hessian of F squared in the tangent space. Okay, so here B is just the linear coordinate in the tangent space. And then the condition is that this Hessian is positive definite. So F square has positive definite in each tangent space. So this is the strong convexity. And this strong convexity implies storage to convexity. It implies storage to convexity, and actually, this is a stronger complexity. So, this is our standard definition of insular manifold. And the important remark is that, as I said, we assume the homogeneity only in the positive direction. So, FO minus V may be different from FO V. So, this is a special feature of the Pincer geometry, and which cannot be captured. Which cannot be captured in the Riemannian case. So, this is an important property of this manifold. Then, so this Gij is actually an important quantity. And for example, we can introduce a Riemannian structure by using this Gij, which is a kind of approximation of the original finished structure. So, for each non-zero tangent vector V, by using the G i j defined like this, we can define an inner product G of G V in the same tangent space, just like this. So, just here we use Gij. Okay, then so since Gij is the Hessian of the principle structure. Of the finster structure. This G V is an approximation with the original Finster structure in the direction B up to the second order since this is the Hessian. And this G V is very useful when we try to mimic the Riemannian geometry in the Finsra case. So we have the Finstra structure. We have brief intrasture and about the curvature. In this talk, we consider only the rich curvature. And the definition of rich curvature, defined by using some connection. But instead of giving a precise definition, let me explain a useful interpretation. So in this occupation for a tangent vector B, we consider a rich B. So this is rich curvature or rich square. So we consider rich curvature just as a function like this. Then a useful interpretation is as follows. So we extend this vector, tangent vector B to a smooth vector field, capital B on a neighborhood. Never foot such that every integral cover of this vector field P is geodesic. So, this is a very important condition. Then, by using this vector field P, we can introduce a Riemannian structure G P just like this. By using vector field P here, we can define a Riemannian structure G P. Then a Riemannian characterization means that. Riemannian characterization means that the Finsler rich curvature HP defined by using some connection actually coincides with the Riemannian rich curvature of this same vector P with respect to the Riemannian structure GP. So in this characterization, this condition is essential. So we need to assume this condition to obtain this characterization. So this three minus structure is very useful in Fincal geometry. So we have natural rich coverage for FinSlam manifolds. Then to develop analysis, of course, we need a measure on a Finstra manifold. But here is the difficulty that in the Finstra case, we don't have To in the field case, we don't have a unique canonical measure. In the Riemannian case, of course, the Riemannian volume measure is the unique canonical choice. But in the Finsler case, we have several constructive measures, and they do not reduce to a single measure in general finsler case. So, this is a difficulty in the finstler case. Then, our strategy. Our str strategy is as follows. So, then, so instead of choosing some measure, we just consider an arbitrary measure, kind of insane fault. Then, the rich curvature controls behavioral measure. So, the rich curvature should be modified according to the choice of measure M. Then actually, such a modification is known in the Riemann case. So there's a successful theory in the Riemann case about the ability to reach coverage for Riemann manifolds equipment with measures. So in the finstler case, we try to follow this line. And then we introduce why data reach capital. So, this is the next topic. Okay. So, we consider a Finstra manifold, then we have rich curvature, but we don't have a unique measure, so we just start from arbitrary measure M. Okay, so we consider arbitrary positive stimulus measure on. measure on our things for then so just as above we consider a non-zero tangent vector and it's extension to a vector field v so this vector field has the same condition that every integral integral curve is jurisdiction then so by the Then, so visiting this spectrum field, again, we can consider Riemannian structure Gv and the Riemannian volume measure with respect to this Riemannian structure Gv. Then the measure M can be decomposed like this, then we employ this psi as a weight function and and and And also, eta will be the geodesic with initial vector B. Then, just like the Riemannian case, we can introduce the weighted rich curve at ditch n. So, here n is a real parameter. And usually, we consider this parameter in this range. Here, small n is the dimension of m, but essentially it. But recently, it's also that it is also meaningful to consider this range. So, in this talk, we consider also in this range. Then reach N of P is Japan like this. So, it's just the rich curvature, so the usual rich curvature, et p, plus the second order derivative. So, this is kind of Hessian of Psi, the wave function of psi. function psi and here is the first order derivative okay so this is the usual definition of reach n and reach infinity and reach small n can be defined just as limits so this is a weighted reach coverage for the physical case and just by just from this definition one can easily see that to this reach n This reach n has monotonicity in the parameter capital N. So between small n and infinity, each n is non-decreasing. So it's non-decreasing from each n to reach infinity. And for all negative n prime, so it is even bigger. So this is bigger than each infinity. And we will be interested in the case that reach n is bounded from p row. So it means that small n bounded from below is the strongest condition. So and for example, each infinity bounded from below is a weaker condition. And then, so this n so this reach n and we will be interested in the case that reach n the boundary will grow by some constant k so precisely in this way in this sense then so this boundary is equivalent to the carbon image condition C D Kn in the sense of roto strum piranha so this was established in the Limaran case by many people including strum and rotopirani And a lot of Pirani and in the Finsla case by myself in 2009. So and in the for negative parameter, so I extended to this in this here. And a typical example of non-negative reach infinity is a normal space and with a log conquer measure. And if we consider a Gaussian type, We consider a Gaussian type measure, we have even positive lower bound of reach infinity. So, this kind of setting canonical in convex geometry, convex analysis, can be included in this framework. Then, so as I said, we are interested in this case, so reaching by two pillow by k. Then, there are at least two three useful techniques. So, as I said, Useful techniques. So, as I said, the cover dimension condition is equivalent to this coverture bound. So, the theory of curvature dimension condition can be applied in this case. And in this talk, we consider the non-linear gamma card class based on the Pokémon quality. And more recent one is localization, also known as needle decompression. Compulsion. This is again from optional transport theory and actually L1 and L2 optional transport theory. So, in some cases, this localization is more useful. And so, these three techniques are very powerful and available in Finsra case and also in metallic measure spaces. And today, we consider this gamma characters. Yes. And maybe one important point in the gamma color class is that this gamma color class technique is not yet available in the curvature dimension case. I mean, the localization can be used for metric major spaces satisfying the curvature dimension condition, but gamma calculus is available only for Riemannian curvature dimension. For Riemannian curvature dimension case. So, for non-Riemannian curvature dimension case, gamma-card class is yet to be developed. But in the finisher case, thanks to the differentiable structure, we can consider gamma-card class. That's maybe a point. Okay, yeah, so in the rest of my talk, I briefly explained the non-linear gamma curve. Briefly explain the non-linear gamma cart graphs. So, since I don't have enough time, so let me just briefly explain necessary notions. So, first we need to consider Laplace, and actually, in a physical case, Laplace is non-linear. For a differential function, the gradient vector is defined just as the Degendre transform of the derivative of a function. Will a function. So the derivative in the cotangent space, and then by the Lougendre transform, the gradient vector is in the tangent space. And the Regendre transform is, of course, defined by using the Finster structure. And here, this is one way of characterizing the Rougendre transform. And the point is that Rujandre transform is linear only in the mania case. So the interface. In the Imania case. So, the in the Finnsla case, this grand transform is non-linear. And then the Laplace is defined as the divergence of the gradient vector field. And here, the divergence is defined by using the measure. So, divergence is only from the measure. And actually, the divergence is more precisely defined in the weak sense, like this. In the weak sense, like this, so that this divergence of granite vector field is defined in the weak sense like this. Okay, so this is the non-linear distribution of Laplace in the Finnsler case, and this is natural Finnish Laplace, I think. Okay, then so all this Laplace is non-linear, but it's not so bad. I mean, our physical structure. I mean, our physical structure is strongly convex and it's suctionly smooth. So the this labrasure is non-linear but locally uniformly elliptic. And this is good enough for applying classical non-technique analysis to analyze non-linear heat equation, associated non-linear heat equation. And for example, And for example, we can show that for any initial data F, we have a unique solution to the heat equation, which is H2 in space and Shiva alpha in time and space. And also, Laplacian again enjoys some regularity. And one remark is that I think it's clear for people in analysis. For people in analysis, but Shi alpha is the most we can expect. Since F is not smooth at the zero section, we cannot expect higher regularity. So she too is not true in general, but Q alpha is the best we can expect. Okay. Then we have this non-linear heat row. Non-linear heat row, a heat semigroup. Then, at the heart of the gamma calculus, is of course the Bochron equality. And in the field, I guess we can show the Bochrane quality in this form. And here, U is a smooth function, and N is in this range. And as I mentioned that this Bocher inequality has exactly the same form as. The same form as the Riemannian case up to this Laplace. So, here instead of the non-linear Laplace, we need to employ a linearization. So, this linearizer Laplacian, roughly speaking, Laplacian with respect to this luminous structure J gradient U. So this is precise division, but okay, so the gradient is linearized. Gradient is linearized in this way, and then the Laplace is just a divergence, so it is linearized gradient. Okay, so here we need to employ linearized Laplace, and the other parts it's just non-linear pressure. So, this is the finished poline quality, and here's the remark, but I just speak skip and then so. And then, so just like the linear gamma card graph, we can show many applications. And first, here I state gradient estimates. And from here, we assume that M is compact for simplicity, and UT will be the solution to the heat equation. Then we first have. Then we first have L2 gradient estimate like this. Then the point is that here again we mix non-linear and linear evolution. So here UT is non-linear evolution group. And here PE gradient UT is a linearized heat semi group coming from this linearized Laplace. So And I so this is a linearizer heat equation with respect to this gradient Ut and here we need to employ this to Hisme group. So this is L2 gradient estimate and also we can show the gradient estimate and also of anchoring inequality in this range. So the inequality, sorry, we just Inequality circuit with just a Seremanian case and also the logarithmic suborfin equality dimensional case and also suboral inequality and also becoming equality. So Becca means P is between one and two in general. Okay, P is between one and two in this plane. In this range, and in this case, we can also take negative n, but for negative n, the p is a bit more distributed in this range. And actually, this negative case was established by Chen Til Tsukumai Meiyai for the linear gamma characters and extended to the non-linear case. That non-linear case. Okay, so we have such nice applications for non-linear gamma-car class. And let me give final remarks. So the proofs essentially follow the same lines as the Riemannian or linear case, up to some technical differences. I didn't mention such technical differences, but at some point we cannot truly extend the Cannot truly extend the Riemann case to the finish large case. And also, one can generalize backly reduced Gaussian spherometric unequality to the Finisler case by using non-linear chemical class. And in some results, the non-compact case is yet to be fully understood due to the lack of high order regularity of heat semi group and also the washer stand contraction. So, in the fast feature case, we don't have wash-stein contraction. Finsel case, we don't have a sign control action for his same group. So, this is really a big difficulty. So, some techniques in the Riemannian curvature demand cannot be applied due to the lack of Washington contraction. And also, as I said, localization is another powerful technique and it can be useful, especially in the non-compact case. But instead, this localization But instead this localization is not very good in the non-reversible case. The non-reversible means that F of minus P is not F of P. So in some cases localization is good and but in some case gamma garglars is good. So we need to choose appropriate technique in this case. So anyway, so there are many appropriate So there are many applications, but still there are many problems. So I think this non-linear gamma calculus have more applications in the Finnsla case and maybe it may be extended to metallic major spaces satisfying the capital dimension constraint. So I hope that some people are interested in this topic. So and if you are interested, I have written a book. Written a book, it will appear soon from Springer Monographs in Mathematics. And so this may be a good reference for you. Thank you for your attention. I'll stop here. Thank you very much, Professor Ochta, for a very nice talk. So is there any question? any question sorry i have a question yeah my question is about the possibility to construct on a field manifold with the rich bounded below at least for some capital n a function of the order of the distance function forward distance whose laplacian is bounded in modus in the remaining case it has been shown In the Riemannian case, it has been showed by Shene Yao and is useful in various arguments. Do you know whether it's possible, it's useful to localize estimates because you control the Laplacian in modulus? Do you know whether it has been done in a Finnsland case? An exhaustion function of the order of the distance, so the force. Of the distance, or the forward distance, let's say, whose Laplacian is bounded immodulus and whose gradient is of the order of one. I'm not so sure. So, you mean construction of some good replacement of the distance function because the distance function has a Laplacian. Because the distance function has a Laplacian bounded only on one side. While in the Riemannian case, Shenayao constructed a function whose Laplacian is bounded on two sides. The gradient is no one, but it's of the order of one. And it proves to be useful in many arguments. For instance, in convergence theory or to localize PDEs in solar spaces. I was wondering whether in the physical case there is something like this. Is the case there is something like this already? Let's see. So, I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure. Yeah, I'm not sure if we can do it. Okay. Thank you. I think it was considering. The proofs may be possible for generalization. But I don't know whether there's some hidden case. Okay. Some hidden. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
