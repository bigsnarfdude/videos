From Sticklove Institute, and he will be talking about Binax basin metric subgroup in the event forum. Sergei, please, are you ready? Thank you. I would like to thank the organizers for the wonderful opportunity to speak. Here, my topic is very narrow. I will mainly Very narrow. I will mainly speak about one particular problem. And Juan Carlos already discussed this problem and its various connections to finstler geometry. So I will be kind of brief in my survey part. So here is a problem. And well, I managed to send an abstract that broke the website and it wasn't displayed properly until. Display it properly until today. So it tells that I'm going to announce the solution in dimension four. Well, here is a problem. There are two equivalent formulations. The first one was published. It's more analytic type of formulation. It was published by Stefan Barnoff himself. And it's motivated by the fact that in Euclidean geometry, in Euclidean Euclidean geometry, in Euclidean space, all linear subspaces of a fixed dimension are isometric to each other. So the question is, does this property characterize Euclidean subspaces among all norm spaces? So assume we have a real vector space equipped with some norm and consider all linear. All linear subspaces of some fixed dimensional little n and assume that the isometric types are the same. Can we conclude from this that our norm is Euclidean, so associated to a scalar product on the space? That's the problem. It is solved in some dimension, but not in all dimensions. And since norms can be represented by the unit. Be represented by the unit balls, which are symmetric convex bodies. One immediately reformulates the problem in more geometric terms. We have a vector space V and a convex body B in this space. And we consider all intersections of this B with linear subspaces of fixed dimension N. Of fixed dimension n. And it turns out that these intersections are linearly equivalent. These intersections are, of course, unit balls of the restrictions of the norm. And linear equivalence means that for any two such subspaces, there is a linear bijection between them, which sends one cross-section to another. So the affine type of cross-sections is the same. This is the definition of linear equivalence. And our Of linear equivalence, and our question is: is this body necessarily an ellipsoid? Because ellipsoids are exactly unit bolts of Euclidean norms. That's the problem. And as I already mentioned, Juan Carlos already discussed it and its various applications and connections. Now, what is next to me? What is known? Next to me, what is known? Well, not what is known, but some first comments on the formulation. First thing is that it's essentially codimensional one problem. Well, I forgot to say that I will refer to the problem as a conjecture. Banach didn't pose it, didn't suggest any particular answer, yes or no, but it's already a tradition to call it a conjecture. So, the first remark is that it's essentially a co-dimensional one thing. One thing. So, if we prove this in codimension one, then we prove it for in all codimensions, just because if all two-dimensional subspaces are Euclidean, then the space is Euclidean. This is due to parallelogram law. Parallelogram law is and the identity x plus y squared plus x minus one squared equals two x. equals 2x squared plus y squared and the norm is Euclidean if and only if this is satisfied for all pairs of x and y and this is verified in each two-dimensional subspace separately so being Euclidean is a property of two-dimensional verifiable on two-dimensional subspaces there's a first comment so I will be speaking about co-dimension one sension About codimension one essentially. And the next is, as Juan Carlos explained, there are non-symmetric norms also make sense. And if one thinks about applications to films or geometry, symmetry is an issue. But fortunately, in this problem, the non-symmetric case just does not exist. There is a theorem by Montehana. The theorem tells us that if we have a non-symmetric norm with this property, that all linear subspaces of dimension n are isometric or cross-sections. Actually, one doesn't need even assume linear equivalence, but affine equivalence. Cross-sections by n-dimensional subspaces are fine equivalence, then it is symmetric with one exception. It is symmetric with one exception, which is non-centric ellipsoid. And if you assume linear equivalence, this goes away as well. So the non-symmetric case doesn't exist in the original Banach problem. I will actually consider some variants where we don't have this Mundi-Hannas theorem. But anyway, let me assume symmetry for the rest of the talk, just for simplicity, to avoid some details. Now, next, what is known? I will not give an overview of related results because there are too many of them, and I will just list the progress in the original formulation since it appeared. The first thing is our Bach, Mother, and Ulom theorem, which tells that it is the conjecture is true. That it is the conjecture is true if the subspace dimension is two. So, in for three-dimensional bodies, if all two-dimensional central cross-sections are linearly equivalent, then the body is an ellipsoid, and then higher quadimension follows easily. Next is next big achievement was by Varecky. By Varetsky, who proved the famous and very important theorem about subspaces in higher-dimensional normal space. If you fix a small dimension n and let the dimension of the ambient space go to infinity, be very large, then eventually you will always find a subspace of dimensional little. Space of dimensional little n, which is very close, whose norm is very close to Euclidean. This is a very important theorem. It's kind of very famous, and it was motivated by this Banach subspace problem. Next, who solved a big part of the problem was Gromov. Part of the problem was Gromov in 1967, earlier young Gromov, proved the conjecture in the case of even subspace dimension, and also in all dimensions when the codimension is at least two. His proof was through algebraic topology, more precisely, some invariant. More precisely, some invariance of vector bundles. I will say a few words about this a little bit later, but Juan Carlos already mentioned that. Then there is a recent result by four authors who extended Gromov's methods beyond even n and proved the conjecture for all n congruent to one module four with one. Module of four with one funny exception, except n equal 133. I will comment on that later. And this is an interesting extension of Gromov's approach, which is actually in modern language is through the study of the structure group of the tangent bundle of the sphere. What groups can be structured groups for the tangent bundle of the sphere? That was the underlying technique beyond Gromovs and this Borrs and Borser's results. So the next item is what I want to announce in you advance the joint work with Denmark Maid and Anional Nordcover. It's very recent. It's very recent, so nobody really verified it, but I believe it's anyway, correct anyway. Using some different methods, which I'm going to explain and devote to it most of the talk, we proved this conjecture in the case of subspace dimension and n equals three. So it's a four-dimensional space. Four-dimensional space with a convex body in it, and all cross-sections by three-dimensional linear subspaces are linearly equivalent, then the body is an ellipsoid. This recent theorem. And in fact, it was based on some Finsler geometry research of mine, which ended up in an ended up in an alternative proof for the n equal two case this is n equal two but it's an alternative proof and it also proves more it is a local the assumptions of linear equivalence is restricted to local one where we have one cross section this blue one on the picture and we assume And we assume linear equivalence between cross-sections, not for all of cross-sections, but only across sections that are very close, that belong to some neighborhood of this horizontal plane X in the Grassmannium of two-dimensional planes. Assuming that, and since it was a Finsler's theorem, I assumed strictly smoothness and strict convexity. Strict convexity is. Trypton vascity is essential. Smoothness probably is not, but it's not finished yet. I mean, it's non-smooth case. And assuming only local linear equivalence, which kind of restricts us from all global algebraic topological methods, still, we are able to prove that these horizontal cross-sections and all. Horizontal cross-sections and all neighborhoods, all ones from the neighborhood are ellipses. And the piece of this B near this plane is an ellipsoid. So this conclusion is here. This was motivated by things for geometry, and the motivation was quite different from what Juan Carlos gave as connections in his great talk. Let me Talk, let me say a few words about my motivation. It was a search for the quest for Gauss's theorem for Fincer magic. Gauss's theorem says that the extrinsic shape of a surface in let's consider R3 is restricted by the intrinsic geometry. By the intrinsic geometry of the induced metric. So, if we're embedding, let's say, Riemannian metric into R3, then some aspects of the shape, like is it convex or subtle or degenerate, are controlled by intrinsic metrics. It is very interesting if something like this holds in the case because the distinctions between convex, saddle, and degenerate, it makes sense without any Euclidean magic. Euclidean metric nearby. It's a fine invariant properties. So we can ask if something like this holds infinitely metric. And well, fortunately or unfortunately, we do not know which intrinsic quantity should be here. It's a part of the problem, but whatever it would be, it should be zero for flat metric. So assume we isometrically embedded a flat instant metric, so a piece of some norm. piece of some norm two-dimensional vector space r2 with a norm uh so i assume we was are able i assume we isometrically embedded it into r3 also with some unknown norm and in such a way that the second fundamental form is non-degenerate so it's either strictly convex or or saddle then again i'm also referring to juan carlos Referring to Juan Carlos' talk, this family of identical unit balls on the sphere will become cross-sections of the unit ball of the three-dimensional space. And if the second fundamental form is non-degenerate, they will cover a neighborhood in the Rismanian. So, if we manage to construct such embedding, then the norm in a Embedding, then the norm in R3 should satisfy the assumption of linear equivalence, the local linear equivalence. And from this theorem, we know that this is not possible. So there is a hope for Gauss's theorem in the film theorematric, and at least for flat metrics and some other classes that I didn't mention here, it sort of exists, but it's widely open. Open this right formulation about flat metric, but there are some other technical properties that one could introduce instead of flatness. Well, this is what I want to announce, especially this dimension 3 case. Next is, I will overview the classical approaches of our Bach Master Ulam. Mazur Ulom, Romov, and the modern one. So, first of all, the classical thing, our work, Mazur, and Ulom. I will not repeat everything that Carlos explained about this, but I will emphasize that they actually prove a more general result. They solve so-called non-integrable version of the problem. Originally, we have some convex. Originally, we have some convex body in R3 and assume something about its cross-section. But here in the non-integrable problem, we just forget that there is a common convex body and just assume that in each plane, we have a linear copy of some model body in the plane. Body in the plane, which varies continuously with a plane. That's the assumption. And even in this generalized non-integrable setting, the two-dimensional case can be proven. This is the result of Albert Mauser and Lohm from the 1930s. And here is a picture of the proof. Very briefly, consider this. Very briefly consider this model, model body, model convex figure K. In each plane, like this green one, we have a linear copy of this. And for visual convenience, I'm drawing two copies of this body in tangent planes of the sphere. Next, the biggest issue with this type of proofs is the group of self-equivalents. Is a group of self-equivalences, which is discrete in our case, as we are arguing by contradiction and assume that k is not an ellipse. Then the group is discrete. We pick some vector and all equivalent vectors. So it's orbit. This is purple vectors in K. Then, well, for each of the two-dimensional planes, we have a linear map realizing the equivalence. It is not. Realizing the equivalence, it is not unique, but it's defined up to the self-equivalence of k. So the image of this violet configuration is unique and changed continuously from point to point. And therefore, since the sphere is simply connected, we can choose continuously one vector at each point and get a contradiction with the Haribal theorem. So we get a non-trivial, non-vanishing vector field, no way of vanishing. Vanishing vector field, nowhere vanishing vector field on the sphere, which is a contradiction. And this also shows that the non-integrable problem doesn't allow in even in the case when n is even, it doesn't allow model bodies, model cross-sections to have a discrete self-equivalent group. Just the same argument works and rules out many others. And rules out many other classes of self-equivalence group, and that is the idea behind further advances by Gromov and Bohr and others. Gromov also proves the result in the non-integrable setting. So he proves a more general result that we don't have any body in our. In Rn plus one, but you have a family of bodies in hyperplanes, they very change continuously from hyperplane to hyperplane, and still even this structure enforces the linear type of affine type of the body to be ellipsoid. And the idea is that instead of this hardly manageable object, arbitrary convex body, you consider its. Convex body, you consider its self-equivalence group. You install it in every tangent space, and you get this group as a structure group of the tangent bundle. The structure group of the tangent bundle reduces to this group. And this is a kind of more manageable. And Gromov was able to sort of classify all possible, well, not classify, but prove that at least in even dimensions. Even dimensions as a group G should be very large, it should act transitively on the sphere, and this implies a result. Then let's go further to the odd cross-section dimensions, specifically n 4k equals 4k plus one. The four authors that are not listed here. That are not listed here, but was on the previous slide. They pushed the idea further. The non-integrable generalization is just false, but still one can study the structure groups and conclude that it's still very large. And the only possibility for it to be not SON is to be SON minus one. And this implies that the model cross-section is a body of revolution, something like, I don't know. Something like, I don't know, like this. It has a SON minus one symmetry. So the original body B has a lot of ellipsoidal cross-sections of codimension two, and then it's easy to like using something like this parallelogram, lots of these parallelogram identities and so on. Well, there is an funny exception, dimension n equals 133, and this is because there is a special Because there is a special exceptional Lie group, E7, which stays in the way of the argument and doesn't allow to conclude this affine revolution as Sn S O and minus one subgroup. That's what I wanted to say about this topological method. They do not work at all, they do not help at all. At all, they do not help at all in dimensional n equals three because the sphere, as three-dimensional sphere, is realizable. So, you can actually choose a linear continuous family of linear isomorphism from fixed R3 to all tangent spaces and put any an arbitrary symmetric convex body K in R3 and consider its images, and this will be a solution. Its images, and this will be a solution. One has to be a little bit careful because on the sphere, one has it should be architect, in fact, but this can be arranged. So the opposite point gets exactly the same copy. The trivialization of the tangent band can be chosen in such a way that opposite points can obtain equivalent cooperation. Obtain equivalent corpus. So next thing is something completely different, local geometric approach of which leads to local proof in dimension two and global proof in dimension three. The idea is, well, we cannot we forbid ourselves to use global topologies, so the only thing that remains is local integrability. Remains as local integrability. So then the integrability conditions is that we still have a family of linear equivalent convex bodies, all hyperplanes, and the integrability conditions that they agree on these intersections of planes, this red segment, should be the same for two convex bodies, and they are related by linear equivalences. So the proof worked best. So, the proof works best when the body is smooth. It's a differential geometric approach, but it is possible to do the technical work and add words almost everywhere in many places and make it work the non-smooth bodies. But let me assume smoothness for now. What the idea is that we linearize this integrability condition. Integrability condition and check what is going on when we slightly rotate this fix this horizontal plane X and rotate this purple plane Y starting from X continue smoothly rotate it and differentiate the family of linear equivalence there is a theorem I didn't mention it on the slide but it is Matviev and Bartolome Mays not very long ago proved that Very long ago, proved that one can choose this family of not one parameter family, but all linear equivalents smoothly. So we can differentiate it, assuming that the body is smooth, of course. We can differentiate it, and the result is this orange vector field along the horizontal cross-section, which is tangent to the boundary of B. B, this is our B, this is our original convex body. Well, these orange vectors do not really help, but some of them, those that attached at the common lines, it's not a line, it's a four-dimensional two subspace, these red vectors, they give essential and helpful information. That's the idea. And this is kind of written in text. Written minute texts as orange vectors as denoted by W lambda here. And on the technical side, we choose some vertical kind of normal vector. It should be choosing in a special way, but for now it's just any vector in the complement of the hyperplane X of the base horizontal hyperplane. Project this orange vector field. Project this orange vector field, including the red vectors, to the horizontal plane X. Technically, the directions are parametrized by the dual space to the horizontal plane. Well, actually, each hyperplane close to X is a graph of some linear functions. That's why they are parametrized by this lambda. The parameters called lambda. The parameter is called lambda, and we project it down and denote the result by R lambda. And we have a linear family of this vector, horizontal vector fields, r lambda from, and about them we know that some specific members of this families of vectors are tangent to the boundary of the body. And it is a very strong condition because we have a lot of direct. because we have a lot of directions to a lot of we have lots of lambdas they actually in generically these red vectors will parametriz all all the boundary all the tangent distribution to the boundary so we are sort of uniquely determine uh the cross-section by finitely many parameters finitely many parameters are because while we are differentiating some smooth map Are differentiating some smooth maps? There is some matrix with finitely many entries, and they determine generically, they determine the cross-section. That's the idea. And the formal property of this family of vector fields is that we have a linear map from it's actually the tensor, but I'm denoted it as a family of R lambda of linear maps from x to x, which we interpret as vector. Which we interpret as vector fields. There is a tangency condition in the original space. So there is a horizontal component and vertical component. And the most important is this corollary that at points that are toggle to the corresponding lambdas, the horizontal component, which is Horizontal component, which is the only thing we think about, is tangent to the cross-section. That's the condition. It is very strong, actually. And we hope that it allows to solve the problem in all dimensions, but so far we could use it only in dimension three. There is a technical condition about trace, this horizontal vector fields viewed as linear maps. Viewed as linear maps, they should have trace zero, and this is achieved by the choice of the vertical direction, the simple system of linear equation, which always has a solution. And the reason for this condition is that these red vectors will determine these orange vectors through some polarization type identities. So we can, well, now when we Well, now when we have this nice algebraic structure, which is very rich and interesting, it has many aspects, what to prove about? It turns out that to solve one conjecture affirmatively, it suffices to prove the following property. Assume that we have this tensor R with this property that red vectors attention to the boundary. Vectors attention to the boundary and traces are zeros. It suffices to prove that every such construction, every such an object, every such vector field is actually tangent to the boundary of K everywhere, not only at the red places, but everywhere. That's an isolated formula, standalone formulation. You can try to prove it. Can try to prove it. And let me explain how Banach conjecture follows from this. Well, I need to use Blashki ellipsoid characterization, which is actually Blashki Kakutani ellipsoid characterization from 1930s. It tells the following. Assume that for every fixed sum, no. Fix some consider some normed space and fix some dimensional dimension n small, which is at least two, and assume that for every n-dimensional subspace, we have a norm non-increasing projection. If n equals one, then we always have this by Han-Banach's theorem. But in higher in case n equals In case n equals 2 and higher, this is a very restrictive condition. And if it's satisfied for all linear subspaces of fixed dimensions, then our norm is Euclidean. And geometrically, in codimension one, this means that our whenever we take a cross-section by a hyperplane, we can find some vertical direction such that. Direction such that the body is confined within the cylinder, this green cylinder generated by the cross-section in the vertical direction. And this is exactly what we have if our conjecture on the previous page is true, because the origin of this orange vector is projections. If all the projections are tangent to the cross-section, then we have exactly this. Exactly this situation. Orange vectors are tangent to the boundary of B and their projections to the horizontal components are also tangent to the boundary of B. Therefore, these vertical green vectors are tangent to the boundary of B, and therefore we are in the assumptions of Kakutani's theorem. And since it holds for all planes. Planes X, we conclude that the body is an ellipsoid. But in fact, this argument is only needed when our family R lambda is degenerate. And in the non-degenerate case, we can conclude, well, those dimensions n equal 2 and n equal 3, we can prove that directly without this Kakutani argument. Prove directly that the cross-section is an ellipsoid. So let me explain how it works in dimension two. I have, I guess, I guess about 15 minutes, correct? Yes, correct. Yeah, that's great. I will be able to tell something about. Well, this is a picture. For every purpose. For every purple vector lambda in the plane, we have a there's already a cross-section in the plane. For every purple vector lambda, we have a pair of red vectors tangent to the boundary of this planar figure. And let's consider all the red vectors corresponding to all lambdas. We get a quadratic vector field, red vector field tangent to the convex figure. And this is a very well-known situation. Situation: It turns out that if there exists non-zero vector field, quadratic vector field on the plane, which is everywhere tangent to some convex curve, well, symmetric, let's assume the symmetry, then this curve is an ellipse central to the origin. And the proof is simple. Well, first of all, the picture. First of all, the picture, I mean, topologically, the picture is this red vector field cannot turn around the convex curve like this. It should change the direction somewhere because it's quadratic. It's even. The values at these two points should be the same. These are two parallel vectors. The picture, I'm not an artist. The picture is not good, but these are two. Which is not good, but these are two equal vectors in the plane. So these directions should meet somewhere, and we have a zero of our vector fields, and this zero is zero along the line because it's quadratic homogeneous. So we have coordinates of our vector fields are quadratic polynomials that vanish on some line. We may assume that in coordinates, this is a line x, like y equals zero, and therefore our cafe. Our coefficients of this quadratic polynomials just can be divided by vius polynomials. And what remains is a linear vector field which is still tangent to our convex figure. And everyone knows that what trajectories of linear vector fields can be. And if they are closed, they are ellipses. That's it. But there is a degenerate case. is a degenerate case q equals zero and if q equals zero then by by polarization using this trace assumption we conclude that all the entire family are lambly zero and therefore all that yellow vectors that we had are zero and therefore the attention to the boundary that's okay we are we apply capital theorem Apply Carquitine's theorem. It is needed only in the degenerate case. And I have proved the entire n equal to case, the local variant. Well, the local variant requires a local variant of Kakutani's theorem. There is one for strictly convex, smooth, strictly convex bodies. So it works too. But this is a complete proof, actually. It's not very hard. Very hard. Now, about the dimension three case, it's full of technical details. Just let me completely ignore the degenerate case. They are algebraic and they're manageable at least until the dimension is not so large. Well, n equals three works, and I consider only Consider only, I will explain the ideas only of the non-degenerate case. In this case, well, consider this picture. This case is a three-dimensional cross-section of our four-dimensional body. And on this three-dimensional cross-section, we have two-dimensional red plane where we have this tangency condition. This nice red plane. These nice red vectors that are guaranteed to be tangent and they form a linear family. And what we do is we look at how this cross-section change if we allow it to flow along the thread family. So we define the flow on this space of two-dimensional cross-section. Topologically, it's a two-dimensional sphere. Well, let them be oriented and it's a Let them be oriented and it's a sphere. We get a flow on the sphere. For each two-dimensional cross-section, we construct this orthogonal complement covector denoted by lambda. Our plane is Z. We pick a Lambda which corresponds, which makes this Z red. This is the red and define this red family. This is a linear vector field. So we can kind of let this red plane evolve along this vector field. It will remain the plane, linear plane. And because this red vector is attention to the boundary, the affine type of the cross-section will be preserved. This very useful property. The next thing is that this is a flow on the topological sphere. So we can apply this Harry Ball theorem again and conclude that there is a fixed point. What is a fixed point? A fixed point on this picture is some red plane such that all red vectors are tangent to it. So we have a linear vector fields tangent to this red curve. So it is an ellipse, except it is degenerate. This degenerate, but degenerate cases are kind of unfortunately the number of degenerate cases grows with dimension, and this dimension 3 spills, I'll spit out three degenerate cases. This is one of them. It's kind of solved by algebra, it means. Well, so fixed points of this flow are ellipses. And our next idea is Is well, there are many trajectories nearby this fixed point, and we prove that there exists a trajectory. I mean, this is this third item. We prove that there exists a trajectory of this cross-section flow whose closure contains a fixed point. This is This is actually sufficient to conclude the proof because what is a trajectory? The trajectory is a family of cross-sections of this kind of red or green, well red, red type of cross-sections. And the affine type is preserved along the trajectory and the closure of the set of these cross-sections contains a fixed point, which is an ellipse. It's an ellipse because of this. Of this second item. So, all cross-sections along this trajectory are ellipses. And we have one parameter family of ellipses among the cross-sections of our three-dimensional convex body. And this is, well, unless we have some one more degeneracy, this ellipsis, unless they have a common. Like, unless they have a common pair of points, generically, the ellipses that satisfy integrability conditions, so they agree on the intersection on the planes, they actually feel a piece of L, an ellipsoid on the boundary of our body of K. We're not thinking about the original. We are not thinking about the original four-dimensional space at all. We are thinking only about one three-dimensional cross-section. So, using this one parameter family of ellipses among the cross-sections, we find a piece of ellipse on the boundary. And since originally everything was parametrized by some algebraic tangent vector fields, by unique continuity. Fields by unique continuation of this algebraic polynomials from the small neighborhood, we conclude that the body that's this ellipsoid concides with k everywhere. So in the remaining remaining five minutes, I guess, I will explain in more detail how we get this. This fixed points in the fixed point in the closure of trajectory. Well, where the flow occurs, we have an original three-dimensional body K. The space of cross-section is actually well known as the intersection body for each hyperplane. A geometric construction is for each hyperplane. Geometric construction is for each hyperplane. We consider its normal vector, it's oriented, so there is a well-defined normal vector, and we multiply divide it by the area, Euclidean area of the cross-section, and we get some point. And the family of all these points is a convex body. The famous theorem by Busiman that the intersection body IK is Body IK is convex and we have this flow. Let me point it in red. Flow on the boundary of this smooth. And well, at this point, we already know that the body is smooth. Well, anyway, even if it's not smooth, the argument doesn't change. And we apply Poincaré-Bendixon's theorem. Poin-Karabendixon's theorem is a theorem from topological dynamics. Topological dynamics. So, if we have a flow on the sphere, on the plane, actually, and any trajectory of it, then the trajectory, it A either the closure of the trajectory either contains a fixed point or it contains, sorry, a closed orbit. A closed orbit. If it contains a fixed point, then we are done. I mean, and if it does not, then the picture is like, well, let me erase all this, all this stuff. The picture will be like this. There are two fixed points exactly because they will have to have index one for each of the. For each of the fixed points, there is a periodic trajectory around it. Looks something like this, I guess. And there are no other fixed points because fixed point of index not one cannot have a cycle around it. And everything else is a collection of trajectories. Collection of trajectories that fill out this cylinder. But in fact, the algebraic nature of our vector field tells us it is actually a quadratic vector field too. Important thing that is that our cross-section flow is generated by quadratic vector fields. By quadratic vector fields. And therefore, this picture is impossible. This should change the direction of this green trajectory, it should change their direction somehow, and they create a fixed point, just like in the n equal to case. And that's it. There is another fixed point in the trajectory converging to it, kind of stopping there. And we got a family of ellipses among the projections. Ellipses among the projections, among the cross-sections. And this implies that our cross-section is an ellipsoid. And there are degenerate cases along the way. And separately, they finish with an application of Kakutani's theorem. Anyway, in all cases, we prove that unified formulation of a conjunction. unified formulation of a conjecture such that if red vectors are tangent the conjecture that if red vectors were tangent to the boundary of our bodies and all yellow or orange whatever that color is are tangent so this is sort of the end of the plan of the proof and i i am stopped here thank you very much for your attention Thank you. Thank you for the beautiful talk. It's question time. Please unmute yourselves and ask questions. What is the other nine pages of the slide? So comment here on that. I was wondering what's the other nine pages? I was wondering what's the other nine pages of your slides? What other? They are blank. If you ask good questions, I will write down something here. They are just blank. Okay. I have a question. So if you replace instead of linear equivalence, you assume there's projective method. Projective map that identifies different sections. So that's the topological approach. We just have to go through. You mean just replacing projections by cross-sections by projections? No, no, I mean that you know that every two sections are not linearly equivalent but projectively. Oh yes. I don't know. Maybe maybe. Maybe, well, there will be some other integrability equations that are less nice. So I think it's a good question, of course. So one should try to start with the case n equal two. I never thought among all generalization and analysis I never thought I never thought this projective equivalence question. Well, it's very natural, of course, but not in the context of norms and sensor spaces. Yeah, sure, sure. But would you expect, for instance, Gromov's approach to go through? Gromov's approach, I think it should work. I think it should work. Yes, yes. The projective self-equivalence group. Objective self-equivalence group. Well, at least in dimension two, it works the same. Yes. The global algebraic method. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. There was a question by Alexander. Hi, Sophia. Thank you very much for your talk. So I think I haven't understood much in the final part of the talk, but how far can it? So, how far can you go beyond dimension four with these methods? Well, we couldn't so far. But I mean, the next known dimension is seven, where the sphere is also parallelizable and we were stuck. Yeah, we couldn't progress further. This proof is a kind of hands-on, and the big point is that we split into degenerate and non-degenerate case and treat them differently. And treat them differently. There, I have some ideas how to approach this. Let me just scroll back and just look at this conjecture. It's an interesting conjecture. And I don't know how to prove it in dimension four, for example. There are some ideas, but we were not able to finish. Some different approaches is needed. Different approaches is needed. This is what we did is to hands-on to specific. We couldn't remember. Yeah. So also in dimension four, you couldn't prove this conjecture? Dimension four is followed from Bromov's algorithms. It's even. Even dimensions are solved. No, yeah, but I mean this conjecture. Yeah, but I mean this conjecture. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Even this conjecture wouldn't prove in dimension four. Yeah, well, we didn't try. We try. Well, the next interesting case is five or well, there is a local variant, of course. Of course, I believe that the assumptions are so strong that this should work in all dimensions, regardless of parity. So you expect that the local So you expect that the local Banach problem is correct in all? Yeah, yeah. The local Banach problem, it should assume strict convexity because otherwise there are conterexamples like cylinders. I believe that local variant should be true in all dimensions. And well, the three-dimensional case is a work in progress. I believe we will get it out soon. There are some technicalities. There are some technicalities related to the non-smooth case and to this Kakutani in the local setting, but it's all doable. And I believe that, yes, it should be true. And moreover, this differential geometric approach to this type of problem is very, very should be fruitful. But one needs theories, new series, algebraic series about this. Algebraic theories about these types of equations. There are certain systems of algebraic equations. One can reduce to a question whether certain systems of equations, polynomial equations, have non-trivial solutions. We can get rid of convex body and get into some. Okay, thank you. There is a question. Okay, thank you. There is a question from Juan Carlos. Hi, sir. Thank you for the talk. That was great. My question is here you assume that all the convex bodies, the sections are linearly equivalent. Suppose if you assume a bit less, like let's say, suppose you have a convex body in R3 for which all the central sections was. Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah. Do you hear me? Yes, perfectly. So something I can return. It's you're okay. Yeah, you're sharing, you're screen sharing. Yeah, yeah. So suppose you have a, let's say, centrally symmetric convex body, and all the central sections have the same volume. The same volume product, let's say something that has the same volumes, and I guess some rather which is a linear invariant. So, which is the volume of the body times the volume of the dual. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand. Well, who knows? Why is the volume product? Well, just a linear invariant instead of just asking for their only linear invariant. Of just asking for their own linear equivalent, you choose a linear invariant, your favorite, and you say, Okay, all these cross-sections have the same linear invariant. I don't, I don't believe in such things unless unless they follow from random transform, like simple volume. Yeah, okay. But it's too little information, too little, too little assumption. Too little information. Yeah, too small. Like you have some complicated integrals. Some complicated integrals conside. Well, I don't know, probably not. I don't, I wouldn't try to prove it. Okay. Okay, so thank you everyone for asking. Thank you again, Sergei, for this beautiful talk.
