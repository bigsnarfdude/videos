So today I will talk about the improved Tulinga model inequalities involving the Lele potential. So this is based on joint work with Professor Hu Yuan Sen from Jiangxi Normal University and Professor Du Yi Hong from New England, Australia. New England, Australia. Okay, so I will talk about first I focus on the Turing model inequalities and we record some Lele-Hardy operator. That is the motivation for our study on the Tuding Moslem inequality. And I present also some main results about this. About this tuning model inequality. And if I have time, I will give also some Lele type inequality. And also this is the main result in our joint paper with Hu Yuan Seng and Professor Du Yi Hong. So we start from the Buddha model inequality. So, this is the well-known inequality for the two-dimensional case. So, omega is a bounded domain in R2. And this two linger model in economics says that if we take the supernorm of this integration for this function in the class of the function. In the class of the function where the gradient, the norm of u in the h1 zero norm is less or equal to one, and then this supernorm is finite. Okay. This inequality is analogs of the solar inequality in the high dimension, which is related to the Yamabi problem or the problem or the critical exponent of soble f. Okay. So in our study, we want to ask whether this inequality is optimal or in the sense what we can do if we enlarge the class of this test function or if we can If we can enlarge this positive exponent, okay. So, in this sense, we have, for example, the behavioral result in the enlarged class of the function, where this integration is replaced by this one with minus vx the u square less than one. Less than one. And for the positive function or non-negative function v, if we take the v equals v1, which is one minus x modulus square minus two, this is a work due to Wang Gofang from Germany, La Freibau, and Dong Ye from East China University now. or by the work of Kintarev, he take the function v2 equals the function v Lele over the maximum of this one. Or another choice by the Professor Dansky, Spatter, if you take the function V3, just I don't write here, is just this one. Right here is just this one where the log in the one over the plus module of x replaced by one plus log in the one over module x. Anyway, in this three case, the result is true. That means we enlarge the function space and we get the supermom of this one is still finite. Still finite. But in another sense, we can also take the function instead of 4 pi u square, we take this 1 plus alpha, the module of the module in L2 and by the work of the MUC and the TRUE, Oliver Douer. And the 2A, all the way to a, and they prove that if the alpha is less than lambda one, of course, it must be non-denicative, then this is still finite. But if alpha is larger or equal to lambda one omega, then this supromum take the infinity. Okay, so this is their result. Their result. And so, this is our study modified by these two directions of the enlarged. And we asked whether we can do something for this one. So we come record some Hardy lab operator, and this is related to the same topic. Related to the same topic by Professor Royal talking this morning, talk this morning. And we call in the dimension n larger or bigger than 3, the L mu is the minus Laplace plus mu over modulus square. And this we take the sign plus. And the mu is large or equal to the mu zero, the best constant of record. Constant of we call it the Hardy inequality. And in the dimension two, instead of this one, we have the log in the module of X2. And this appeared in the first time in the famous PhD cases of LeRay in the 1934. And we have, of course, there are many, many important And of course, there are many, many important applications of this operator and the results for this one. And they also are a book five years ago about the Hardy inequality or homogeneous group with the 10, 100 years of Hardy inequality. So there are many, many research results on this. Result on these topics. Okay. And for us, we study this operator for the non-homogeneous linear problem. So, our point of interest is in the study of the classification of the singularity, of course, the isolated singularity. We study the solution and the result is a The result is connected with the weak solution, with this one, which is a generalization of the early work of Peisis and Leons or Weihong, etc. And we get some, we reformalized this problem and related to the to the with the dμ distribution. That means we can. Contribution. That means we can reform this one in a good formulation and we get some interesting results. And this can be applied to some semi-linear problem, which don't need the symmetric assumption. Okay. Okay. So before state our results, we We give some notation about the function space and present some embedding results. So, this is the first the space we will take. We will consider it is the H1, mu 0 on B1, and the mu is large or equal to minus 1 over 4, and this is the norm, and this is the inner. The inner product of this cubode space. So we can prove that with this classical notation H10, which is the W120 for the mu is larger than 4 minus 1 over 4, but the space is strictly included in the Included in the space H1 hat, which is the mu when the mu take the extreme value minus one over four. So and we suppose in the engineer case, we take not only the potential, relay potential, but we can enlarge a little the function v. We just suppose. v we just suppose is a big or equal to if we with a with a constant mu that is the minus v the function or the the potential the lay potential okay and we take also this notation where the v is a correspond uh the mu v and the mu is corre uh correspondence to the to the the term here, okay. The term here. Okay. So the hour, I'm sorry, this is maybe a little small and I'm a little lazy because it's a tool, the statement of the results is too large. So we take this one, we consider the mu is big or equal to minus one over four, and we denote by m mu is the four pi one plus four mu. 1 plus 4 mu root of this one. Okay, so for the statement of result, we separate the case. μ is a positive and mu is negative, but larger than this minus 1 over 4. For this case, mu is a big, is a positive. If we take the v is larger than the lele or the 4 times Or the four times the lay function, then we have two cases. The first case is we take the supernorm on order radiosymmetric function. Okay, so this is, of course, is one part of the order function defined with this construct. And then, but here it's not for pi. is not a 4π, but it is a 4π multiplied this coefficient, which is bigger than 1. Then in this case, it is still finite. And it is optimal in the sense that if we take one alpha, take the larger than m mu, and if the v the function v. If the v the function v near zero is like the lay potential, then we can find a sequence of radiosymmetric functions, which is concentrated at the origin of the zero, and this goes to plus infinity. That means we cannot get this is a finite, but it's the The infinite, okay. And in the general case, if we take if we omit this radial case, then we here we just take the four pi and this is still hold. It's not only the we just this posit with this condition and this also. With this condition, and this also is optimal. That is, if we take the alpha bigger than four pi, then if we don't suppose is symmetric, then this can go to infinity. Okay. So here, the sequence UN is said to be concentrating at some point X0. That means outside the outside this this the near the point x0 this quantity goes to zero or very small and otherwise it's all the point or the mass we can say that is concentrated near x zero okay so this is for the case mu is positive all right If μ is negative, we have some result is similar, but we have to take attention to this one. So we suppose in this case, mu is between minus 1 over 4 and 0, and the function v is less or equal to Or equal to the lay function. So, of course, it's included with the lay function. Then we have the following conclusion. So, again, for the radiosymmetric case, the suprom of this one with the m mu is a finite. Okay. And this again is optimal. That means even. Optimal that means even we have here the m mu is picked less than four pi but here if we take the radial solution with the the v positive no negative but we can still have the finite but for the alpha is the stick less than m mu but can less than four pi can less than four pi here we have again a concentration from phenomena that means we can find a sequence of functions strict radially symmetric function that is concentrate at the origin but the discounted goes infinity okay remark that in this case m mu is less picture less than four pi okay Than four pi. Okay. And for general case, we need to have the v is decreasing in 0, 1. And in this case, this is finite. And it is also optimal in the sense if we take this one, stick the less than mu. So here, we suppose V is decreasing since we, you know. Since we in the pool, we need to use the rearrangement of the argument. So we need to, the function v is a monotone. More precisely, we need it's decreasing. Okay, in this two, in some special case, we can also take special case, we can also take this one, this one, one minus, I think this less this one, and we get the same result and this is the optimal. Okay. I think I should how many time maybe okay I'm sorry okay okay thank you so finally the the the the the last case is the mu is the extreme value uh minus one over four and in this case uh the result is we suppose uh the v is a continuous non-negative and then in this case we again for the radial case okay for any alpha positive and the p belongs to zero one belongs to 0, 1 this supernorm is always finite with the u is a radial but in general case we can suppose is a decreasing and the p is again belongs to 0 1 alpha positive uh and okay i'm sorry this is for this okay uh For this, okay. I repeat that is for the radial case, we don't need to have v is decreasing. But in general case, if we suppose we omit this condition, then we need v is decreasing. And in this case, the conclusion is the same, is finite. But if we suppose the behavior of the v near zero is like Near zero is like this one and control by some constant times minus log in the R minus theta. Then we can find a sequence of function such that this one goes to infinity for any p larger to larger or equal to one and any alpha bigger positive. Okay, so this. positive okay so this is the uh this is the the the main result of this one and as in the in the pool okay next step so in the pool we we because we have some the mu is a positive or negative belongs to the interval minus one over four and zero then we uh then uh we need to uh to to devise the the the proof in several steps and this we written in some sense in this in this form which is the more difficult to to to take the computation or the construction of the auxiliary the function so we take the mu is bigger than minus one over four and we four and we we prove this one is is finite and this is if we take the coefficient by the alpha strictly then this four pi over times one plus four mu square then no square rho top square then we have the concentration phenomena Concentration phenomena. Okay. And in the proof, I think the more difficult part is to guess this coefficient. So if we take this one, then we find some calculation is more easy. But to find this one, we have tried several times for get because the result in Because the result in this sense is optimal. And this is for the case mu equal to minus one over four. And we can see that as mu goes to this one, and in this case, the m mu is go to zero. So it's another case for this. Another case for this extreme case is not proof and also other lemma. And this is the strong different point is that this is for any positive coefficient. And also this p is larger than this one. And we have the concentration phenomena. Okay. Okay, I come back to the lay inequality or the leis potential. In this work, we can state, we can observe that for this function, weighted function, we have two types of singularity. The first one, of course, is The first one, of course, is singular when x go to zero. But we also, the singularity near the boundary. That means when x go to the boundary, the unit ball, this also goes to zero. And this makes the difficult for pulling the result. For example, we have For example, we have the result before the Bachbadis, Philibas, and Hekdika, they prove this Lele inequality with the remaining term in this form. And even we have this one is lacks complicated. But the result is they don't include Don't include, you can remark that here we have e over modulo of x. That means when x goes to the boundary, this term is not singular. Okay? But if we have take this one, replace the e by one, the boundary becomes a singularity of this function. Okay, so the result of Okay, so the result we have is if we take in two with the L2 norm here, it's okay. So here is one is a one over modulo of x and then we have the we have the return term. And in the in the if we take the q is not equal to two, here is a we the u square and here you U square and here is the module of u q. And in this case, if q is bigger than 2, we get this one in the sense that we just have some constant mu q and here we just take the b r zero, where the r zero is sticked less than one. So this is means the the the means the the the the the reason is that in this case we can use the the basis of the l2 in the in the we have the if we take this one we trade a problem in hilbert space so we have some basis and we can take the expansion of the function by the by the eigenvalue of the laplacian etc but but in this case we But in this case, we have the problem in a general Banas space, then we cannot get more information for this. Okay. Okay. So this is some embedding result that we need to use to in the previous results that I think. Yeah. So thank you very much.
