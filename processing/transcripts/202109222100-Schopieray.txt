Thank you so much for the introduction, and thank you to all the organizers. It's getting repetitive, but this has been a really well-organized conference. It's been a lot of fun from all over the world. So yes, the title of my talk was meant to be sort of instigating, sort of inflammatory, I guess, especially to people who live in a very unitary world. Who live in a very unitary world. But it's, you know, it's a bit cheeky in the sense that I'm not saying that unitary is bad, but we're going to see that the non-pseudo-unitary world is sort of among us, whether we like it or not. And so those are the examples that I'm going to go by. So if I can advance slides here. So my whole process of thinking is surrounded by examples. Surrounded by examples. So, all of my research involves looking at large amounts of examples and trying to extrapolate things from them. So, I never try to live in this huge scaffolding of big theory or anything like that. So, in the spirit of examples, I'm going to give you an example of examples that I look at. So, I added this this morning, actually, because it was mentioned in talks on Tuesday, is that there's this very large body of literature in. This very large body of literature involving minimal modular extensions, for example, of braided fusion categories or pre-modular categories, if you prefer. But the thing about minimal modular extensions that should be asked and that some people are asking is what proportion of these braided fusion categories even possess minimal modular extensions? So we have this very large, robust, very interesting, beautiful. Very interesting, beautiful theory of minimal modular extensions that is developing. But the question is: what does it apply to? So, of course, it applies to symmetrically braided fusion categories. That's the classic example. Trivially, to modular tensor categories, but what in between can we apply it to? We can apply it to super vector spaces. We know that much at least. So, the standard response is that there are some counterexamples that are due to Drinfeld. That are due to Drundfeld. So that's about as far as people usually mention. Mostly because this was mentioned about 20 years ago and it was never written down. And it still hasn't been written down, at least in his words. But I found a proof in the literature, not particularly mentioned in that way, by Galindo and Venegas Ramirez in 2017, so almost 20 years. So, almost 20 years after it had been mentioned, that proves that there's this infinite family of counterexamples, which are constructed in kind of a technical way. They're G equivariantizations of pointed modular tensor categories. So this doesn't even say what the examples are. This gives you instructions on how to construct the examples if you were so motivated to do so. So to me, So, to me, when someone asked me, you know, what categories don't have minimum larger extensions, I'd like a name, you know, because they're not very big, these counter examples. And so, for example, two weeks ago, I put a paper on the archive that shows that this huge infinite series of examples that you're looking at are actually just representation categories of a finite group. And the only difference is that they have a slight. Difference is that they have a slightly non-symmetric braiding. So these counterexamples that haven't existed for 20 years are just REPG with non-symmetric braidings. And in particular, the group that I'm referring to are extra special two groups. So by looking at examples which don't satisfy this huge theory, we're able to see something interesting that actually very, very, very common categories represent. Categories, representations of finite groups, the original examples of these categories, don't satisfy this huge theory if you just slightly tweak their braidings. So this whole aspect, oh, and I also proved that this is true for other primes as well, but the original examples are these extra special two groups. So this whole side of this theory about where the theory ends and where counterexamples begin is very undeveloped. Is very undeveloped in comparison. So I added this to the beginning of my talk because this framework is sort of how I've been approaching the idea of unitary versus pseudo-unitary and things like this. So keep that in mind as we're going forward. We have this huge framework of theory, and we just want to know where does that end? Where do we start running into counterexamples? So, pseudo-unitary is actually. So, pseudo-unitary is actually a much more straightforward definition to talk about. So, pseudo-unitary, in reference to a fusion category, just means that the sums of the squares of the Frobenius-Perron dimensions of all the simple objects is equal to the sums of the squares of the categorical dimensions, the ones coming from a trace or a spherical structure. But that's not even necessary to define the dimension. So, this is truly a Dimension. So, this is truly a definition that is applicable to all fusion categories. And for those of you who like to live without the pseudo, this unitary certainly implies pseudo-unitary, but the other direction, possibly not. I don't have any examples of this, but just think of unitary as a much stronger condition, hence the name. So, an overwhelmingly large An overwhelmingly large amount of the literature rests on the assumption of unitary and pseudo-unitary. I mean, just listening to the talks this week, I would say a majority of the talks start usually with the word unitary, at least somewhere in the first slide or in the definitions. So this is something that is ingrained into our theory. But it's incredibly easy to break this condition, or it's an incredibly fragile condition if you just care about. Condition: If you just care about the categorical side of things. So, if we just care about the categories, you can very easily just crush this condition and create counterexamples to this being true. So, easy non-examples, the smallest ones that you could possibly create, involve the Fibonacci category. So, this is the rank two fusion category, or it's a modular tensor category two, if you will. It has two similar If you will, it has two simple objects, and its Frobenius Peron and global dimension are the same. Well, if this is the category that you want to call Fibonacci. And they're both five plus the square root of five over two. So you can create a non-example of pseudo-unitary by just taking its Galois conjugate, which is a very natural thing to do in the categorical setting. We just apply a Galois automorphism to all of the structure. All of the structure structure equations that are defining this fusion category. So, in this case, if you pick the non-trivial element of the Galois group of Q adjoining the square root of 5 over Q, that sends square root of 5 to negative square root of 5, it's not pseudo-unitary for a very obvious reason. So, these Galois conjugates don't change the fusion ring, so they have the same for being. So, they have the same Frobenius-Berron dimension, but you've conjugated the global dimension. So, now we have a category with categorical dimension 5 minus the square root of 5 over 2. So it's not pseudo-unitary. But it's kind of cheap because I've just sort of twisted it. I very purposefully created something non-pseudo-unitary. So, we can make this even worse. So, we can take Fibonacci and its conjugate, and we can tense. Conjugate, and we can tensor them together. So we've created something which is not pseudo-unitary, but also it's not just a Galois tweaking of the original category. So its Rubenius Perron dimension is just the square of the original category. But let's see if I can do the multiplication. What if I multiply 5 plus the square root of 5 over 2 times 5 minus the square root of 5 over 2? Hopefully I've done this correctly and we get 5. We get five. So you can see that if I start to conjugate this product, that five is never going to move. It's always going to be five. And this Robinius-Perron dimension is some quadratic number that's going to bounce back and forth between its Galois conjugates. So this is never going to be Galois conjugate to a pseudo-unitary modular tensor category. So you could do this in arbitrarily large complexity by taking any fusion category that doesn't have integer. Fusion category that doesn't have integer dimension, and doing the same trick, taking products of Galois conjugates, and you can create tons of non-pseudo-unitary examples, and examples which aren't even Galois conjugate pseudo-unitary examples. But aren't these examples exotic, or these non-examples, I should say? And Eric actually gave a definition in his talk of what exotic means. He defined it as not being in the Being in the subgroup of the bit group generated by the quantum group categories at roots of unity, the semi-simplified representation theory of them. And so by that definition, no, these are not exotic examples. Both are examples of semi-simplified representation theory of quantum groups, just at bad roots of unity, someone would call them. Okay, these are the roots of unity that if you define The roots of unity that, if you define this notion of level, these aren't integer levels, they're sort of fractional levels, the in-betweens. So, both of these categories on our previous slide are just straight up one of these quantum group categories at particular roots of unity. You don't even have to do anything fancy to them. They just exist. But these examples that I've created by taking all these tensor products of Galois conjugates, there actually are pseudo-unit. There actually are pseudo-unitary modular tensor categories with those fusion rules. So maybe I just made bad choices in my life, and I could have picked a different modular tensor category with those fusion rules that was pseudo-unitary. And in this case, it's obvious. You just take C itself or the product of C with itself. And these are both pseudo-unitary modular tensor categories with the fusion rules of these non-examples. So if you're So, if you're thinking, man, this guy is just stretching trying to come up with these non-SUNY unitary categories, you could probably claim at this point that I'm arguing in bad faith that actually these fusion rules, they are very pseudo-unitary because we have these categories that realize them. So if you must, I accept that as a valid argument. But there exist fusion rules or fusion rings, if you will, which are unapologetically nonsensical. Unapologetically non-pseudo-unitary. So, way beyond these types of examples. So, you think I might be about to fill slides with some huge definition, some arcane category with a huge rank, massive dimension that barely exists. But we're not going to look very far at all. We're just going to look at B2. So, if you look at these quantum group categories for B2, For B2, where Q is an 18th root of unity, or Q squared is a 9th root of unity, if you will, you get something which isn't modular. So it's definitely not unitary, but also it's not modular. But in this instance, there's a fusion subcategory. It's adjoint, which in fact is modular. So we're looking at the adjoint subcategory of this very particular quantum group category corresponding to B2. Category corresponding to B2 at 18th roots of unity. So adjoint means adjoint type. What's that? Adjoint means act like the adjoint type, like group theory adjoint. That's what you mean. So the word adjoint here, I know this is a dangerous word in any context, but this is referring exactly to this subcategory that I've drawn here. It's just these objects. It's all of the objects generated by X tensor X dual in this category, or it's just the root lattice. Okay. Root lattice of this category. Yeah. So, yeah, I understand a lot of these words have double meanings. But in this context, I mean exactly this. And as I've beautifully illustrated with purple for some reason, this category has six simple objects. It's incredibly small. It's one of the smallest modular tensor categories that I've said something interesting about. And it's Frobenius-Peron dimension. And its Frobenius Perron dimension is just nine times this unit that, of course, lies in the totally real subfield of the ninth roots of unity. And its global dimension or its categorical dimension is nine on the nose. Okay, so I made a particular point of noting that the unit is not one. So these two numbers are legitimately different. But you'll notice I didn't have to even But you'll notice I didn't have to even use a double-digit number to describe this category. It's that small and it's that elementary. So, this is something that's actually appeared in papers before, going back at least 15, 20 years, this exact example. So, it's not something exotic. It's not something that was particularly constructed just for this talk, for example. So, So, the main theorem that I wanted to talk about involves this rank six modular tensor category. And the theorem is that there is no pseudo-unitary fusion category which has these fusion rules. Okay, so this is a very short sentence, but the sort of impact of this to me is actually incredibly strong. So, I have this. So, I have this nice category. It's modular, it's coming from these quantum groups, incredibly small. It just isn't pseudo-unitary. And in fact, if you try as hard as you possibly can, you cannot create a fusion category which has these fusion rules. So this very much marks the boundary of where unitary and pseudo-unitary stop and where this non-pseudo-unitary business begins. Unitary business begins. Really, it's something about these fusion rules that are making these categories non-pseudo-unitary. So it doesn't matter how hard we try, this very combinatorial data is non-pseudo-unitary. So that's why I've attached the adjective to the word fusion. The fusion rules are non-pseudo-unitary, regardless of what's happening in the category. So this paper is about So, this paper is about a year old right now. I just haven't had a chance to talk of it because of COVID and all that. So, it's already going to appear in a journal, but you can still read the preprint, obviously, online. So, I'll leave that link for you. But the proof, I mean, it's very detailed and involves some computer computation, but it's very elementary, I think. So, the proof is essentially induction restriction with the center, the Drinfeld center. With the center, the Drunfeld center of this category. And you find that it's very easy to prove that if you had a braided fusion category, which was pseudo-unitary and had these fusion rules, then those definitely can't exist. That's actually quite easy to prove. You could do it as an exercise. So with induction to the center, you can prove that its Drinfeld center has a fusion subcategory, which has the same fusion rules that you started with. Fusion rules that you started with. So, those two facts combined together show that this can't exist. So, essentially, this is a technique that's been used over and over. We're just applying it in a very abstract setting. Okay, so in fact, another way to prove this is you could probably try to prove directly that the category that you're looking at, which is pseudo-unitary and has the fusion rules of this category, is braided just from the get-go. I don't know how you would do that without. Go. I don't know how you would do that without passing to the center, but it's probably something that could be proven. So, what should you take away from this very simple fact that I've just given to you? Well, it's that this lack of pseudo-unitary is not only natural, it's not something that we might stumble into someday, it's entirely unavoidable. So, even looking at incredibly small rank, small dimension examples. Rank, small dimension examples, you are going to run into this sort of a situation. And most likely, after you get above rank six, it's going to become more and more prevalent. And not only that, but it's also going to happen no matter what assumptions you make of the category, barring unitarity. If you look at braided or modular categories, you're still going to run into these examples. And even worse, if you take any construction. Even worse, if you take any construction, at least any construction that I know of, and you try to produce new categories out of this example, then it's going to preserve this illness. So you could take products, Gelois conjugates, extensions of any sort that you can imagine, and you're still going to get something that has no non-suitary, you're going to get something with fusion rules that have no pseudo-unitary categorification. Gorification. So, this non-pseudo-unitarity is contagious. So, once you find one example, it's going to spread to all other examples that you can construct out of it. So, now for the cheeky bit. The extent of the non-pseudo-unitary fusion pandemic that we're experiencing with this contagion is downplayed because no one's testing for it. Okay, so these examples have existed for 30 years or so. Well, probably not 30. Or so, well, probably not 30 years, but close to it, maybe. And we could have proven things like this at least two decades ago. But it's not something that people are looking for. But as we've been classifying modular tensor categories by rank and such things, you are forced to run into this situation. So I think it's time that we actually start treating it as something that we should be testing for. When we run into something that's non-pseudo-unitary, we could ask ourselves. Non-pseudo-unitary, we could ask ourselves: is there even going to be a category with those fusion rules that is pseudo-unitary? So it's very likely, in fact, I would almost say that it is going to be true. We just need to prove it. That if we look at analogous examples, so maybe the adjoint subcategory of B2 at these higher fractional levels, then you're going to find that all of these have this exact same property. Property. And I've loosely looked at the next example, and it seems to follow in the exact same way. But whatever the next paper is, it should be very large. It should be something like, here's all the other examples that come from quantum group categories. I don't think we should nitpick one by one at these examples, but it's probably true for all of these other ones. And as we're realizing, if you spend enough time around Terry Gannon or some other people, is that the examples Or some other people is that the examples that we know are a very small slice of all examples of modular tensor categories, of fusion categories. So it's likely that once we exit this quantum group world, we're going to be running into these a lot more often. Who knows? Okay, this is just sort of a demarcation of where this boundary is. So I have a little bit of time left. There's actually sort of an epilogue to this fact. Epilogue to this fact. So a thickening of the plot occurs if you look at a very special unitary category. So there is a very unitary modular tensor category, which I'll call S, of rank six. So this is, if you take SU2 at level 16, there's this invertible object with trivial twist. You can do this simple current extension if you're in VOA land or if you're in California. VOA land, or if you're in category land, you can do this deaquivariantization construction or anion condensation, whatever you want to call it. You can make it smaller, and you get something of rank six. And this has six objects with the exact same Frobenius-Peron dimensions as this non-pseudo-unitary category. So, in fact, I don't know if Kane's in the audience right now, but me and Kane were sharing an office at MSRI before the At MSRI before the pandemic struck. And I had these dimensions written on the screen. And he's like, oh, I know what category that is. And he said it was this category. And then I looked at the fusion rules for this category and I was struck. I actually thought that someone had made a mistake because they're almost identical. It looks like if you moved a couple of rows and columns, you would get the fusion rules for this non-pseudo-unitary example. They're that close. Example. They're that close. Three of the fusion matrices are identical on the nose. So there's one difference. There's only one difference between these fusion rules. So there's three simple objects that have a small Frobenius-Beron dimension, and it's all the same dimension. And if you call one of those x, in this non-pseudo-unitary category, when you square this small object, you don't get a copy of it back as a sum and. As a sum and in the SU2 category, you do. Okay, so this is the only difference. So if you move a one, and then you have to move two other ones to make it match up with the other objects, that's the only difference in the fusion. So you could be carrying along this very nice category. And if you just sneeze or if you drop it on the ground, then it just turns non-pseudo-unitary just instantly. Just instantly. It's that close to being non-pseudo-unitary. And in fact, this relationship between the two comes from a very famous auto-equivalence of this category. So this category has auto-equivalence, which usually has the very fancy name of triality. And that's these three simple objects. So if you take the fusion rules for this non-pseudo-unitary example, and you Pseudo-unitary example, and you just apply triality, you just move those three objects in the fusion rules, then you get this non-pseudo-unitary example. Or I forget which one I started with. They're both related by this automorphism. Okay, so it not only is related, but it's related in a very specific way that's instructed by this braided auto equivalence. So my question is, and these braided auto equivalences, they're not very These braided auto equivalences are not very common. Okay, you don't usually get braided auto equivalences of complicated categories that move all the objects around in a very complicated way. So my question for you, or people who care about fusion rules or categorifications or things like that, is, can you do this exact same thing with some other category that has a non-trivial automorphism? Can you take its fusion rules and just blindly permute some of the objects like this and still? Some of the objects like this, and still get something that's categorifiable. Okay, so it seems like a very simple process that might be generalizable. And you can think about this in terms of finite groups. If you have a pointed category, what this sort of construction would mean you're doing to this finite group. It's something that's very sensible. And this is the only extremely non-trivial example that I can come up with, but it could lead to something interesting. To something interesting. So, that being said, I hope I've at least convinced you that this non-pseudo-unitary world is something that should be in the back of your mind. It's sneaking up on us, and I think it's going to become more prevalent in the future. So, that being said, thank you for listening. Take a deep breath, and I hope everybody has a good lunch.
