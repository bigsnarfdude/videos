So you have till like your button. Just let me know, I'll stop. Yeah, I'll let you know. Don't worry. All right, so good morning and thank you to the organizers. It's a pleasure to be here. I noticed from the crowd here that I'm. I think I'm certain I'm the only engineer here, so okay. So that said. So, that said, for those of you who don't know me. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to tell you. Okay, so this is what I'm going to talk about. I'll tell you about dislocations. And I heard a recent talk by a SIAI talk by Aslo, second DP. He was talking about ITL and HP. And you know how it goes? You looking on something, you see something and then you do some symbol matching, things match. So I'm going to tell you about that analogy here. About that analogy here comes very close. So they've done a ton of mathematics on that, very recent mathematics. I'll try to, that'll be, that was my hardest slide to put together. I've done my best, and you'll see some connections there. And then I'll tell you a little bit more about how I think about solving all of those problems. Okay. So that's the title of my talk, I suppose. Now how does it go forward? How does it go forward? How does it go forward? Oh, the bottom one. All right. Okay. Okay. So I need to tell you a little bit about this talk is not about sort of the physical aspects of dislocations, and I have a certain amount of time. So I think, in the interest of time, what will suffice for you? What will suffice for you to think about is so what dislocations are first thing is very simple situation is suppose you have a regular so think of just that green block over there forget about all the blue stuff everything is in its place these are like equilibrium positions of atoms and everything sitting there what a dislocation is you've done something to the material you put loads etc so somehow one of these planes One of these planes, as slipped out of registry, okay? And because of the interatomic potentials, if you take the loads off, which made it do that, it's not slipping back. This is just how it works. So if you get into this kind of a configuration and this was a stress-free, every atom is happy situation, you can imagine that if this is what it is, then there's going to be stress and energy in the material. To be stress and energy in the materials, right? Even if you've taken notes off. And these things end up being so dislocations for our purposes today, it will suffice to think that for very good reasons, they are either closed curves or they run from a boundary to another boundary of the world. And for our purposes, it will completely suffice to think that because of that fact, these things generate stress and And they actually, it's known that these lines, these curves, they move because of the stress they see, not because of the energy they see, it's a stress. And each of these things, they move because of the stress they see, so they interact. This is how they interact. And if you put loads, that also puts stresses. So that also makes these curves move. And there's a ton, billions of them moving around. Of them moving around, and they have a topological attribute called a Berger's vector. And it turns out that you, so these things interact and they are moving around, they are producing stress. And that's what they're moving around, when they can move in the crystal, that's what allows you to do very large deformations of something like steel, you know, and the fact that it doesn't fall apart. Fall apart. So it's a motion of the defects that allows you to. Can I ask you a question? Say it's because of the stress that they see. Yes. By that. So if you, if you, because you would expect that you have Newton's law with some acceleration terms and some potential, right? So you're saying something different, right? Yeah, so, yes, yes. So this is not when you talk about Newton's law, so. Newton's law. So here it's not a Newtonian force that is moving. What do I mean by that? So often in a situation where a dislocation will move, a good assumption is you can make the quasi-static assumption, right? So say stresses are in equilibrium. So divergence of stress is zero. So now you take this little curve and you take any enveloping cylinder, divergence of stress is zero. Divergence of stress is zero, you integrate the traction here, you'll get a zero. Right? So, no Newtonian forces on the thing, but the guy moves. So, that's the difference between configurational forces and Newtonian force. Because you brought that up, that's why I'm saying this. Now, the configurational force on a dislocation, it is a configurational force, but it is keyed up by the stress, in that it's a pitch scalar force. Each scalar force, which is dependent on the character of the dislocation and the stress. But it's not Newtonian because if you took a little cylinder around the right area of you got okay, so that's all right. And if you did continuum mechanics or thermodynamics, right? So if you did fracture, for example, you did fracture. Did flat. So the driving force will depend on the energy. Yes, yes. Here it comes out, the thermodynamic driving force comes out in the stress. Okay, five more minutes. No, sorry. No, that's good. Okay, so so, so, so, so, so, so, so, no, no, with point. Okay, so, so they interact, they move, and their motion produces permanent deformation, uh, and plasticity is about that. And plasticity is about that, and the internal stresses they produce. So, this we want a theory of this thing to be set up. This is the idea. So, and they produce patterns, etc. So, a full-fledged non-linear model is like this. So, this is balance of mass. On the left side, I'll write things in sort of Lagrangian form. Here, this is the Weulerian form. So, balance of mass is standard continuum case. This standard continuum guys, I don't know what that hand is there, but rho v dot. This is the material type. Why it works to remove inertia from everything? But apparently it does. Okay. So, so there is inertia. So, okay, that's and so if you write it in Eulerian, that's going to be the case. Difference from elasticity. Difference from elasticity. So the W guy thinks of this as the inverse elastic distortion, right? So you're sitting on the deformed material and you think of the lattice, there's something here, it's stretched. The only concept you don't want to work is the reference configuration, but there is an elastic reference that you carry. So this guy, if you separate it from its material surroundings, then this is going to stretch, compress, or whatever. It go back to its left. will go back to its reference shape and there might be a rotation. So that's the inverse elastic distortion from the current configuration. So this is the and the difference between nonlinear elasticities here is that if it was elasticity this side would be zero. So it said the inverse guy is also a map. It's an inverse deformation map. Here there is no such thing. And of course if this holds then divergence of alpha has to be zero. Has to be zero. This is the evolution equation. So it's a transport law for the Burger's vector that is being moved around by this dislocation density tensor. So unlike everything we do in standard continuum mechanics, it's really transport of three forms. It's a vector value three forms. Linear momentum is also that. It's volume form. Here, the dislocation line, the accounting you have. The accounting you have to do has to be that you take area patches. There are these curves. So these fellows define two forms. Alpha, you can think of it as a form, but it's not important. So this line, it threads an area patch. And by Stokes' theorem, it gives you the Burger's vector content of any area patch that is threaded by a dislocation. Location. And so this statement is simply saying that I'm doing some bookkeeping here. I look at a moving area patch just like you look at moving area volumes in continuum mechanics. Moving area patch threaded by these dislocation lines. Each of them contributes to the Burger's vector content of that area patch at a rate of change of that. So we say the rate of change, you flash this out because this is on a moving patch. This is like doing Reynolds transport. It is like doing Reynolds transport theorem on an area path. So you do that, it will flesh out to be this thing: L is the velocity gradient. Time derivative of alpha divergence V times alpha, alpha times L transpose. This is this convected derivative. And if you do a little bit of geometry, you sit and think, the flux will be characterized by alpha crossed with the velocity of this location. So you think that there's a velocity field that's moving these lines. Field that's moving these lines around. And the difference between vortices and dislocations is that vortices are also line densities, but they move with the velocity of the fluid. Here they do not. I mean, dislocations move relative to the fluid. So that's that. The Eulerian form of this statement, this alpha circ equals minus square of alpha cross free because alpha is divergence free looks like Divergence free looks like this. So you see, if E was 0, that looks like the vorticity equation in, say, Euler, for example, right? Okay, and you have this relationship too. You boil all of this together. This transport of Berger's vector by dislocation density, you just write this out, it becomes this statement and it implies the rate decomposition for the For the total velocity gradient. So, in this, if you assume this, whether multiplicative, this, that, and the other, no choice. This is a consequence. And this is a nice consequence because when you couple it with other sort of features, if you do a multiplicative thing, now suppose you want to put some volumetric strain there. The order of how you do the multiplication is going to matter. Here, there is no such thing because it's added. There is no such thing because it's additive with the rates, and this is the consequence. So, this is like the elastic strain rate, and this is the plastic strain rate. And it falls out from two minutes, yes? So, this is the transport of Burger's vector, right? So, alpha mu, this is the Burger's vector content of any area patch, material area patch, time rate of change of that is equal to the Burgers. Is equal to the Burger's vector being brought in by the from the boundary. Alpha cross V, essentially, on the this is the bounding curve of that area patch. This basically does the counting of how much values we can count in or close up. Then you localize for every area patch, you will get this statement, and this guy is a consequence of this balance. Of this balance slope. Okay, so that's that. Alright? So this thing, it doesn't invoke plastic distortion at all. And so, okay, so that's the, and key stress and velocity now has to be constitutively specific. So that much is there. So an efficient way, the best way to write this system would be, you know, don't. Would be, you know, don't have 300 variables, so you write it just in terms of the W. W dot plus W times the material velocity gradient is minus curl of W crossed with V and divergence of T depends on W, its inertia or position, right? But this is tough. I mean, even the alpha equation is tough. This seems to me arbitrarily tough because it's a Because it's a sort of a tensor, and here you have a curl of alpha, and V will depend upon the curl of alpha, and this is like a system of Hamilton-Jacobi equations, right? So this is like what to do and deal with. We work with whatever we can, and I'm not going to dwell on this, but you know, we can now compute results from this theorem, meaning finite deformation field. Meaning, finite deformation fields of dislocations, and there are differences. Let me tell you. So, we call this, you know, people would tell you, yeah, it's all deformation, good enough, far from the core. No, no, it's not good enough. If you look carefully, there are directions where you can go 80 Burgers vector from the core and then there are 10% differences in the stress. Okay, and even with just the energy up to 25 Burgers vector, there are 10% differences. Burger's vector, there are 10% differences. So there are many differences, and so this is another interesting example that I like. So you force a dislocation to go through. I mean, in small deformations, we can do this fully coupled, the dislocation motion being coupled to the stress. But here, you're saying that the dislocation is being pushed in the elastic material at a speed faster than the shear wave speed of the linear elastic shear wave. Of the linear elastic fear speed. So you are supposed to seek Markham's, now get the elastic field. And we do get the Markham's. And this may be of interest to some of the audience here. This is a situation where you take a little strip and you want to understand, you start sticking in dislocations one by one along a wall. You want to understand how the stress and the energy profiles change, right? So you put one, this is the T1. Put one, this is the T12, the Cauchy 12 stress, okay? The shear stress only. Here, the energy is also even. Looks like this. So, there's serious stress. You put 5, it looks like this. You go up to 30, you know, the stress content starts to fill up the whole material. And then we did this calculation. So, 50 cores will fill up the whole length over here. You start with one, you go up. You start with 1, you go up to 32 or so. At that point, I mean, this is a complicated non-linear solve. I mean, you really have to have very good control on the initial guesses that you make to make this work. So, up to 32, 35, 35 you can't compute one, whatever guess you take. The linear theory doesn't work, the non-linear theory doesn't work. So, it seems like there's a bifurcation. But beyond that, I should have put the other picture. This is at 50 when the whole wall. This is at fifty when the whole wall is stacked up with dislocation. You know that if you have a full dislocation wall in linearity, sorry, non-linear plasticity, but no core energy, etc., just the bulk piece, should give you zero stress. And it does. I wish the non-linear uh theory uh uh it's non-linear elasticity of type of uh salve laceration. So So it's the sort of closest thing to linear elasticity, but it's invariant there. And here we're just ticking in dislocations one by one and stacking them up. So the point is in the dilute regime the behavior is very different than in the concentrated regime where they start lining up together. Why that? Say it again? Why that? Why this so what is what is happening? So, what is happening? What is happening? You don't see any stress? Yeah, because it's a complete rotation field. So, if you have a full wall of this location, one way to think about it is you have one rotation here. Think of a bike. You are saying it's confused. You don't see it because it's very localized. No, no. From the theory, it should be zero stress. Yeah, because it's a rotation this way, elastic rotation here, and you. Elastic rotation here, and you can patch them together with the dislocation wall. No, no, no, no, no, no. When you have a dislocation, you can do whatever. This is the point. In elasticity, if you have compatibility, you can't mess around with this. Because the elasticity says that only rank 1 connections don't happen amongst SO3, in SO3. This is the polygonization idea, right? I mean, start bending a beam one. Start bending a beam, why does it polygonize? Because if you do bending is a huge Telby energy, but you put dislocation walls in between, that's polygonized. You have a constant rotation here, constant, constant, constant, constant, separated by dislocation walls. That's the basic idea of why polygonization happens. Sure, sure. Okay. Okay, so I think. Okay, so anyway, first, you know, what I've talked about until now is dislocations individually and interacting, that's the kind of model. Plasticity is about thinking about it collectively, so you want to understand what collective motion of dislocations do. So a big question in this business is you want to average somehow. Is you want to average somehow, and the idea is that: okay, so this is if you think of some microscopic field that's varying very rapidly, you can take a filter, you start to filter. You average it, this has some length scale, you might want to think about it in terms of doing weak limits of functions. So, if you take, so the big question in this thing will be: you take this alpha evolution equation, and in the in the microscopic guy, this was. In the microscopic guy, this was it. You want to take the weak limit of this equation. Here, there's a curl of alpha cross V average. This is one case where the usual little that I understand, compensated compactness magic does not happen. So, there is going to be the product of the average is not the average of the products. So, there's an extra bit. This is what engineers and all of us macroscopically model as the. Microscopically model as the plastic strain rate. Mathematically, a question is to be able to supply this from the microscopic model. We make up, so engineering-wise, you know, you make up good models for this and you do things. I mean, we've done that. And just to capital V? I'm a little lost in the tense word. Capital V, so really. Capital V, so little V is the material velocity and capital V is the velocity of the dislocation lines moving relative to the material. So if you, with respect to fixed Cartesian frame, the dislocation will look like it's moving with the velocity little v plus capital V. So my interest in all of this is not just those equations. I mean, somehow it would be great. Somehow, it would be great if we could do everything without doing any math, but math does get in the way. But let me tell you some examples of where this is relevant, right? So let me show you, this is a quick example. So this is a micropillar. You have a, this is a ceramic micropillar. You put a thin film in this orientation and you put a thin film in a 45-degree orientation before, and then you compress it. Totally different behaviors when you go into these kinds of scales. So, if in this orientation of this little thin film, this is logarithm of the thickness of the film versus logarithm of the stress that you pick up in nanoindentation. It scales like this. In the shear situation, meaning you put the film in 45 degrees and you compress it, there's almost no size effect. No size effect. All strain gradient plasticity, so says Glaude Hutchinson, you know, all strain gradient plasticity take of any flavor, but in Hutchinson, they fail. That's the SGP prediction in both cases. And that's because the boundary conditions, they don't get right. The boundary condition comes from the alpha dot equation that I told you. That's where it comes from. We've actually, the theory I'm talking about, it does predict it line. About it does predict it right. It's all published here. So there are key things that you want to predict, and so it does depend upon what kinds of equations you are working with. This is another example where, just to give you a flavor that these things are real, what I'm talking about, you take these sorts of specimens, and these are additively manufactured nano-laminates of this is copper niobium. Of this is copper and Iobian, right? So there are layers of copper, alternating layers of copper and niobium. And you, again, you sort of do a tension test, or actually these are compression tests, you do a compression test. If the laminate widths are 500 nanometers and above, you see no pink banding, okay? But if the thing goes below, say this is the 30 nanometer, you see these sharp deformation bands, they have same thing. They have the same thing. You just change the laminate items. You want to be able to predict such things with the theory. Again, this again, this is experimental. We've actually predicted these kink bands with the model I'm talking about, with the made-up LP. Not made up, but you know, phenomenological. That's very good. Yes. So is it geometrically obvious what is the angle, or is that something you have to predict using the hand? You have to predict. Everything. I mean, the I mean, the formation of those bands is also something you have to predict. And this, the peak banding, I don't have the time to get into the very, very non-intuitive. So it's a test, and we've actually passed it. So that's also good. Alright, so now I wanted to talk about, okay, given that setting, so think, so I'm going to, I'll define something called ideal. Define something called ideal field dislocations going with ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Okay, so I'll make that analogy here. So here's the thing: so this is balance of mass. This is all written in Eulerian form. This is the dislocation density evolution. And this is up to ignoring a gradient, which you can. This is equivalent to curl of w minus alpha and this equation over there. equation over there. So think of that. And this is balance of, this is balance of mass. That's balance of linear momentum. Sorry. Okay. Alright. Okay, so T and V have to be constitutively specified. The way the structure works is think of the free energy as given by some non-linear function of the elasticity. This is the standard elasticity, but now W is not compatible. And then curl W eukinoli squared. So then the stress. So then the stress will come out as this object over here. Philip, this is to make you happy. I didn't put any indices, okay? So you can figure it out now what these symbols mean. And capital V, the thermodynamic driving force, so let me explain this a little bit. This X means you do a cross product, X acting on a tensor, this has an invariant meaning, but written Cartesian-wise, take the Written Cartesian-wise, take the two legs of the tensor, just make a cross-product of that, you get a vector. That's the guy you want. So, the driving force for this comes out as this object. If this wasn't there, you could show that this with this W transpose will become the stress. So, that's your driving force for the dislocation. So, thermodynamics will tell you that the stress and the V, these are the driving forces. So, that's what gives you the. So that's what gives you the constitutive force. So, what I'm going to do is to make that analogy. You kind of say now this is an elephant, let's assume this is a sphere. So, you know, we'll make that sort of an assumption. So, you're going to say it's a solid, it has no shear rigidity. Solid always has this is the point, difference between a solid and fluid is about shear, right? But let's assume that the shear rigidity is very small. The shear rigidity is very small. So we will assume elastic, non-dissipative, so dislocation, no. So this capital V M is 0. Is there no dissipation at all in this part? No, no, no. In this guy, there is dissipation. Full dissipation here. This the V guy, the dissipation is given by this V This V looking at the anytime the dislocation moves, that gives you. So, alpha cross V is the plastic strain rate. So, stress, look in plasticity, what do you do? You agree that stress times plastic strain rate is the dissipation? Here, the plastic dissipation is alpha crossed with V. Okay? Okay? And stress times stress double dotted with alpha cross V is the dissipation rate. Yeah? You mean that V and alpha are equal to each other? Not really. It's not V and I see like the stress. Alpha cross V and stress are in that sense model. It's not a standard generalization. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but uh I know just by analogy. Yeah, yeah, but I mean Yeah, yeah, can you V is what drives the alpha. If that's not the dual energetically Now what I'm going to do is to make the analogy with ideal MHD, I'm going to make some assumptions on this chart. So assume it's elastic, so not dissipating. So hit M, make M 0. So capital V is gone. But alpha will still move with the material. Will still move with the material. So, this is like turbulence, right? So, you see, I mean, in this model, the alpha gets moved around by the material velocity plus the dislocation velocity. Vorticity just gets moved around by velocity, right? The material velocity. Okay, that's zero. Assume it's a homogeneous material, incompressible, solid with vanishing shear stiffness, and make rho and epsilon one. That is not the That is not a model of my interest. I'm just making an analogy here. So, this is ideal MHD, okay? Euler, Euler driven by B is the magnetic field or magnetic induction. So, B is a vector field, V is a vector field. So, this is incompressible Euler driven by this. This is Maxwell, one of the equations of Maxwell. Rate of change of magnetic. Rate of change of magnetic field is a curve of E, and Ohm's law for perfectly conducting fluid is E is V cross V. So it's starting to look like something that you've seen, right? So here I write down the two things. So ideal FDM would be V omega to R3. Alpha is a matrix. Here the magnetic field is R3, vector value. And P is P, P is the pressure, incompressible. P is the pressure, incompressible material. So the only difference is you see over here, alpha now, and we do cross products all row-wise, and curls also row-wise. So here you have a coupling between the three rows of alpha. But otherwise, it's exactly the same state of thing. And so, as I said, I heard Second Yeezy's talk. Immediately, I did some symbol matching, and this is what came of it. So, what's good about this is: well, okay, so I found this paper very nice. They've written a whole bunch of papers, right? And so, this one was geared towards me. So, let me give you a definition. So, that definition is this: they call something ideal MHD, I put down the equations. The ideal The ideal limit of full MHD corresponds to you have basically Navier Stokes, and then in the Maxwell equation for the magnetic field, you have a dissipation, resistivity-related dissipation. So it's the mu is the viscosity mu times curl of V. There's a term there. Now they define the ideal limit of full energy. Of full MHD to be the following. So you take a sequence of viscous resistive MHD and you assume that it goes to limit strongly in divergence free L2 fields, velocity and magnetic field, right? So suppose such a pair of such things exist such that the sequence of viscous resistive MHD Viscous resistive MHD goes to that. So they are these norms are L2, but then there's the Bochner business, right? L infinity 0T. So UJ and VJ are converging. So UJ and Vj converge to U and B. If such an U and B pair exists, then they say this is the ideal limit of viscous resistive MHD theorem. Okay, so. Okay, so what they show is that if such the ideal limit of viscous resistive MHT in that the magnetic helicity, so magnetic helicity, A is the vector potential, B is the magnetic field. In our case, this will be like W and alpha. So magnetic helicity is conserved for ideal limits. So ideal limits will conserve magnetic helicity, but this is a But this is a fact. This is a theorem they show. So if you have ideal limits, then magnetic helicity is conserved. Question they ask is: can magnetic helicity be conserved for ideal MHD? And there again there is a theorem they show that actually you have they show L infinity solutions of ideal MHD. So U and B are in L infinity where magnetic helicity is concerned but it is disagree. Conserved, but it's disable. And these are all compensated compactness and convex integration. So they're usual gameplay. These things are extremely hard for me, okay? I mean, I can understand theorem statements a little bit of what is going on, but I can understand the theorem statements. Okay, but this should be interesting for mathematicians. And they also show that there are solutions to ideal NHD where P. Where P over here is less than 3 between 2, where neither magnetic helicity nor energy is concerned. But these are still pretty decent things out of the convex integration technique. None of these things are of the type where you have compactly supported solutions in space and time, which are non-trivial. These are much better. These are much better. I mean, you know, they do physical things over here. There are open questions: do ideal limits exist? This is a very tough question. And more interesting, what admissibility criteria would you want to put on ideal MSD to be able to recover solutions of basically ideal limits? Right? Only it's like the vanishing viscosity business for this sort of situation. So that's the kind of Sort of situation. So that's the kind of thing that you and my personal interest is not in the weird stuff. It's more on the smoother side. I mean, what you can pick up on the smoother side. So, and what I'm going to talk about next, depending on how much time I have, is the following. What was that? Seven minutes. Ah, that's plenty. Okay, so the whole thing was motivated from, you know, it was all. From, you know, it was all my main interest is this system here. And it's become clear to me with talking to a wide range of really good mathematicians that no one is going to supply me anything here that's going to even in terms of setting up a numerical scheme for this, right? Be able to do it. This is hard. I mean, what makes it hard is when you stick in, suppose this V over in. This V over in this equation here. You see this alpha sitting here and this alpha sitting there. This part really is like the driving force from the energy. But there's a multiplying gradient, a square gradient multiplying the driving force from the energy. And on the left hand side is the rate of change of whatever field you're looking at. This is like a multiplicative. This is like a multiplicative combination of reaction diffusion with transport. It's multiplicative. So in 1D you can see this. So phi t equals phi x squared times something that's the gradient flow or I mean driving force of energy. And then these are systems. So what's going to be happening? Anyway, my major interest is in coming up with some at least schemes, numerical schemes that you can put down to be able to Schemes that you can put down to be able to see these things. The coupled system work properly. So, I'm going to quickly tell you about a particular way I thought about something which seems to work well. And I'll tell you about the scheme, but I won't have the time to show you results. But we've actually implemented this, and this works. Same technique for the linear heat equation, of course, and linear transport. And linear transport, Euler's rigid body motion for about a fixed point, ODEs, and in non-linear elastostatics, non-convex elastostatics with a forcing. And we are able to pick up without relaxation the solution of this non-convex problem, which is the limit of the minimizers. Otherwise, in general, you are not going to pick that up without relaxation. We do. We do. But I won't have the time to show you the results. But here, let me just give you this plan and I'll hit on some boundary conditions-related stuff that comes up when you do evolution problems. And I'll leave it with that. So, suppose in the main idea of what I'm going to do even in the PVE setting is this. So, suppose you want to solve a, you asked that, solve an algebraic system of equation. X is in little n, you have capital N. You have capital L number of equations. This is just to give you an idea of the scheme. This is like an example. And there's no symmetry in anything, right? I mean, it could be overdetermined, underdetermined. So the plan here is what you do is you take this equation, you multiply it by, say, Lagrange. You think of these as constraints. But no one asked you to optimize anything. I'm going to play on that here, right? On that theme. So you multiply by Lagrange, I'll call these dual variables. I'll call these dual variables. You do this and you slap on a function h, which is only of the primal variables, only of the x's. You're not allowed to put any z's in this function. What's the requirement on this function? The requirement is that if you take an x derivative of this guy, that will be this fellow's derivative with x, this guy's derivative with x. You set this equal to 0. This equation has to be solvable for x in. Has to be solvable for x in terms of z's, for all z's. You make a choice of the edge. You're free to make a choice. Make a choice. So basically, a can be nasty, its derivative can be nasty. H is like you choose as convex as you want to make this happen. It has, it's the Legendre transform flavor. But no one told me, so I'm going to play with this arbitrariness over here. Suppose I have that, which means Suppose I have that, which means I have a function depending on the h of z, which if I stick into this equation, satisfies this equation for all z elements of r. Suppose I have that function and this can be constructed. Like I said, it's all probable. I actually put it on a computer. So you take this xh, now you take that function, you stick it into this slot over here of S hat. Now you define the dual functional of Z alone. Functional of z alone, which is this. And my goal was to construct an objective function whose critical points are going to be this. So I'm solving the system, right? So you look at the derivative of this with respect to z. First guy is this. Second will be z here, this pi x, x pi z, h pi x, x pi z. But this by design is 0. So I have actually managed to solve. If I can solve this critical point equation, then This critical point equation, then I have z's, I stuff it into the xh's, and that is guaranteed to solve the original equation. Mind you, I'm not saying that I want to solve by this scheme, I want to generate a scheme where I can recover all solutions of the primal problem. That is not the goal. The goal is when the primal problem gets m so messy that there are ten million solutions and just about nothing will work, Just about nothing will work, it's a selection criterion. You know, you stick this stuff in so that in some stable way you can pick out some smooth things. This is the idea. Now, when you get down to, okay, so it is not the least squares method. This I can tell you. I can explain to you. Let me just quickly run through the burgers example in two minutes and I'll be fine. Two minutes. Burgers, okay? And let's take the boundary 20. And let's take the boundary condition, let's not fuss about that, say periodic boundary conditions on the flux. And there's an initial condition here. So you play the same game, S hat, you multiply by lambda, integrate by parts. So this basically gets the initial condition worked out. And this is going to be the, I'll call the Lagrangian. What is the Lagrangian in this case? You know, that integrated by parts business. By parts business. So it looks like minus u lambda t this you stick in the h as we did in the previous case with the requirement on the h that point wise this dlu by u u d xt should be solvable for u in terms of dx, which means there is a function u h which does the job. Once you have that function, now you define the dual functional s of lambda, which is just this term, plus over in l term plus over in L you stick in these this function for u and you assume space-time bound on the lambda on the dual variables at final time you are free to allow so you see you have an initial value problem on the primal side you're going to solve this as a boundary value problem in space time in space time because that's the only way you can solve it is if you try to in the dual side to solve it as an initial value problem it's illegal It is an initial value problem, it's ill poor. That doesn't work. So you don't have to. You apply an arbitrary boundary condition at the final time, and these are the side left and right boundary conditions. You look at the first variation. You see, it will be only this guy's derivative with this times the variation in D because D L by D U by design was 0. And now you use these boundaries on the variations, of course, then. On the variations, of course, then this was prescribed. So, this is 0. On the left and right, also they are 0. You define this u tilde of h, which is essentially as a function of x and t, the mapping evaluated. This is the dual to primal mapping. You stick this in and you look at the first variation. So, what it does is it recovers the, you set this to 0, it will be this 0, initial condition, only conditions. What it says is if you What it says is: if you can manage to pull out an edge which does that mapping requirement, no matter what edge you picked, through the dual-to-primal mapping, you are going to pick up solutions of the critical points of the original guy. So there's like a gauge invariance. H is like a huge class, doesn't matter, and you can play with that. Now, the H that you want to choose is C. Is see you choose some arbitrary functions of u bar of x and t. You make this quadratic like so. So then the dual to primal mapping would simply be this equals that. And you quickly notice that if you chose these guys to be a solution to the primal equations, then the dual problem has a solution. Even I can tell you this now, right? Because choose just the dual variables to be zero, that's a solution. To be zero, that's a solution. So that's like an existence statement for you can always design a dual problem which has solutions. And now the U bars, the idea, this is probably the most important statement how to use this. The way you think about using this is that these U bars are free at this point. You know if there were solutions of the primal problem, this is all good. You can't solve the primal problem. You can't solve the primal problem, so you take a solution of the regularized problem for the u-bar, and then you look for a solution to the dual problem U by using this technique. And okay, I'll let it go at that. So, this we've actually used this to calculate solutions, and this will be coming out soon. Thank you very much. A couple of questions in the chat. A couple of questions. So maybe mine is that I don't understand really what you do on the model you were discussing before, but can I go back to this location walls example? Yes. So I'm I'm a bit confused by the model you use. So in so I don't see in this art finding of slave This alpha constraint related kinematic constraint related with the Burger vector and the value of the algorithmic stuff. No, so the way you set this up is that you have say a Burger's vector prescribed for the chisel. The way we solve this problem is this. So suppose you have that strip, yes? And you take, let's say, And you take, let's say, a wall over here. You take a Berger's vector by Berger's vector dimension core, okay, and you stick in an alpha in that core, constant alpha, let's say, such that its Berger's vector content is 1B. And now if you now put them contiguously. So you have a scale in this problem. Scale in this in this problem that doesn't show anything here or what? Because I mean uh you have a small scale and you send this thing to zero. No, no, I don't send anything to zero here. This is the calculation, everything is just completely discrete. Get zero at final scale? Yes. Because it's a rotation. I mean you're cooking the burgers vector up. The dislocation density that you're putting in, this is in the JFF paper. I'll show it to you. The way we construct The way we construct it is you take a rotation w and you make it transition over this layer smoothly to another rotation, which you can do, right? And I can write down that function. You take its curve, you take its curve, and that curve will give you the dislocation density. No, that curl will give you a smooth density, which you can then approximate using the discrete. No, no, no, smooth. So, what's the problem with the smooth density? So, what's the problem with the smooth density of L? There's no problem with the smooth density, but in the discrete model, you don't have a smooth density, at least by a customer density. Yeah, so that's the communications issue, right? So you have this. It's a finite dislocation core, just like they're supposed to be. And it has a Burger vector of 1B. You stack 50 of them up, it becomes a continuous wall. Can I ask a different question? Ian, I don't want to, but in the interest of schedule, we're already 10 minutes shifted. So, of course, you can ask later, but we should start now. Thank Amy.
