Yeah, so this is a joint work with Le Chen. So let's begin with the setup. So we consider the stochastic heat equation on R D, so with the drift term B and the coefficient of the A coefficient of the noise sigma. And here we assume that the initial condition u0 is a function with compact support. So we will see later that why we make this assumption. And here w dot is a standard Gaussian noise with covariance structure, which is a white in time. So the time covariance is delta function and the spatial covariance is a function f and f here is a non-negative and non-negative. Uh, non-negative and non-negative definite locally in the verbal function. So, what is the precise meaning of this? I will talk about that in the next slide. And here we have to assume that B and sigma are locally licked sheets and B0, sigma 0, 0. But as Z goes to infinity, it has a superlinear growth. So it's not a globally licked sheet. And the main question is the existence and uniqueness of the solution here. Uniqueness of the solution here. Okay, so here. So here we assume that W is a standard Gaussian family with a covariance structure given by this. So if here F is a direct delta function, then, oh, here, sorry, here is a should be phi T Y here. Then this is a space-time white noise. And here, W phi can be. And here W phi can be extended to this kind of thing. So the indicator function from 0t, indicator function from 0x. And this is denoted by wtx. And the w dot, by definition, is the distributional sense derivative of the w. So here we know that w is generally not differentiable in t and x. So here by a solution, we mean So, here by a solution, we mean the mild formulation, so which is written as this integral equation here. So, here PTX is the heat kernel. And here, the right-hand side, there are two three parts. The first part is about the initial condition, then second part is the term with about the drift term, and the third part is the stochastic end of the. Is the stochastic integral and the stochastic integral is the Walsh integral. So the Walsh integral, the main properties is that first the expectation is zero and the second important property is that the second moment of the stochastic integral is actually the expected value of the norm of x in this Hilbert space with f as a kernel. So basically this is just an extension of the This is just an extension of the Ito integral to the spatial variable. Okay, so let's first see that how people do for the classical case that is usually we assume that B and sigma are globally Lipschitz, and we assume that the Lipschitz coefficients are L B and L sigma. And here for the to make the presentation simpler, let's assume that B0 equals simply let's assume that b0 equals sigma equals sigma zero are both zero actually this can be uh extend to a non-zero case and u0 is a bounded function okay so this is a quite important in a classical case and we we will assume some integrability of the covariance function that is the Fourier transform of fc um divided by one plus c squared is integrable and this is uh called the dalance condition so um Condition. So, in yesterday's talks, we have seen that usually we people do use PCR iteration to solve the equation. So, define the first one as the initial condition and u n plus one equals the right hand side with in the mild formulation, we just replace u by u n. And we first we will we can show. We can show that, take the pth moment both sides. We show that the pth moment for u n plus one is bounded by these things. So there is one term about the drift term and another term using a book holder inequality, we get the estimate of the stochastic integral part. So if we consider this kind of norm, so we take the supremum of the spatial variable and we multiply by the e to the negative beta s and we take the supremum in the in the time. Then we get so the right-hand side, we put e to the negative beta s to the u into the of the LP norm and we have e to the negative beta. And we have e to the negative beta t minus s. So if we take the supremum in s and or y, then we can actually just integrate ds of the e to the negative beta t minus s. So if we take beta to be sufficiently large, then this will be just like one minus beta. And the same thing for stochastic integral part. So if we take beta sufficiently large, then this beta will depend on the P L B and L signal. And L sigma, the Lipschitz coefficients, then we will get a contraction. So the left-hand side equal less than equal to u0, the max of the L infinity norm, and plus one half of that. Then in this way, we will get a contraction that way we can run the scheme. Then we will show that this UN plus one actually has a uniform boundedness moments. Okay, so Okay, so for existence, then we just replace UN by UN minus UN minus one, and we will get a contraction, then which shows that UN is actually a Cauchy sequence. And the uniqueness, we just subtract two solutions. So here we also get the moment growth. Moment growth is a pth moment is less than equal to u zero, the L infinity norm, the maximum of u zero to the power of p times an exponential growth, e to the power of t. Exponential growth, e to the power of t times a function in p and f. But here the problem is that when we take a supremum in x, then the growth or decay information of u zero is lost. We just get the L infinity norm of the u zero. Also, this method does not work for some unbounded initial condition. For example, u0x equals e to the power of x. To the power of x, absolute value, or e to the power of x, or some people are concerned about the narrow wedge initial condition, which is a direct delta initial condition. And this method also does not work for that. So, what we can do for this kind of more general initial condition is that actually we can consider the initial condition u0 to satisfy this kind of. u zero would satisfy this kind of thing so that the initial condition pt x minus y convoluted with u zero this is less than infinity but for any fixed t bigger than zero on x so for example if a u0 is e to the power of y then as x becomes larger and larger this finiteness actually becomes larger and larger and the question is we need to keep control of u zero so we cannot take the supremum in x because it may be Supremum in X because it may be infinite. Okay, so the idea is that we can conceive the norm. So instead of just UTX, the LP norm and take the supremum, we divide by the initial condition PT u0x. So in this case, if we go back to the PCA iteration scheme, then we divide both sides by PT U0, X, the initial condition. Then the right-hand side, we also divide. right hand side we we also divide by this and to make the um to make things more symmetric that we divide by uan s y by p s u zero y and we multiply that by the same now now for this two key kernels p at t minus s x minus y p s and divided by p t u 0 x we will show that this one will not affect too much of the entire equation. Entire equation. For example, if we take, if in the drift term, if we take the supremum in y, then the dy will not affect this term. So we take the dy of integral of this term, then we will get that this is actually by the semi-group property, the top is the integral of the y of the top is just a gtu0 x divided by the bottom, which is cancelled. By the bottom, which is cancelled, and another term is for the stochastic integral part. So, again, we use the Bokoder inequality. We get an inner product of the right-hand side. And if we take the supremum in y, the u n s y divided by ps u 0, then T S U zero, then we just do the integral of dy of this complicated things. But so here, the truth. Sorry, sorry. Here, are you assuming that u0 is positive or something? Yes, positive. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. So here, what we the trick is that here we can rewrite because here PS with the u0y, this is basically a heat kernel convooted with the initial condition u0. convoluted with the initial condition u0. So we can rewrite the product of p t s x minus y and p s y minus z as another product, which is p t x minus z. This will appear in the initial condition ptu0x. And what about the other term? The other term also has z and x, but it doesn't matter. We can use the fully transformed f with respect to f, and we can get rid of these messy terms. So, what we do is that the Fourier transform, if we have a PRY plus A P R Y plus B, if there is a positive definite function f minus y prime, then we can get rid of the a and b by using Fourier transform. Because if we use Fourier transform, we will get e to the i B Y, something like that. So it can be bounded by one. And these method terms will be canceled. terms will be cancelled and finally we will get this kind of in the this kind of term which is integrable so in this case we also canceled the bottom pt the u0x so now again we if we multiply both sides by the exponential decay e to the negative beta t we will if we choose beta sufficiently large then we will see that supremum e to the negative beta t times this norm negative beta t times this norm is bounded uniformly bounded by a constant so in this way we will get a uniform uh get a pointwise moment bound of the solution so uh the pth moment of u tx is bounded by oh sorry here it should be a pth p t u zero x raised to the power of p times the exponential increase e to the power of t p beta um and if we assume the And if we assume the Dalance condition, actually, here the choice of beta can be explicitly written according to this kind of integral. So if we assume that improved Dalon's condition, actually this condition will guarantee a many like the holder continuity or something like that. So we can actually choose the beta to be this. So this will give us the Give us the explicit moment bound at each t and x. Okay, so this kind of moment bound can be used in our analysis of the original problem that is the superlinear equation. So now let's go back to our superlinear problem. So we see that superlinear case, the Picard iteration does not work because Does not work because if we do pig our iteration, we need to subtract the two things. Then the B and sigma are not the global addictions. So again, we cannot subtract these two. So let me mention some previous work on this area. So the Wander and Grossman in 2009 has a paper about the additive noise with bounded interval. And what they have done is that they show that the Oscar can. That they show that the Oscud condition, which means that the integral of one over Bu from any positive number to infinity is less than infinity, this one implies the finite time blow-up. Oh, by the way, may I ask a question and interrupt you? I'm just curious why there is one half in front of the lap watching view. Oh, in SPD, so we it doesn't matter, but if we put one half there, then But if we put one half there, then the let's see, the fundamental solution Pt is the density of the Brownian motion. Oh, it's sort of one the risk of right. If there is no one half, there will be like the density of Brownian motion, but with B2T. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Um, so Then later, Fundun and Nollat have a paper which proves actually the other direction: that is, the Oscar condition is actually equivalent to a finite time blow-up. So finite time blow-up means that there is a time capital T such that when the time goes to the capital T, then the solution goes to infinity almost surely. Then silence has a few papers on this direction. Um, direction. Um, actually, what he considered is that uh, with the additive noise, but superlinear drift or the multiplicative noise with a global Lipschitz drift turn, both on Rd. And our paper actually are more inspired by the following two works. One is by Dalan Kosh, Navy-san Zhang. Um, they considered the multiplicative of the noise and super linear drift term on the bounded interval. So, um, they assume that. Okay, so they assume that Bz is growth more or less like z times log z, and sigma z is to the is smaller than z times log z to the power one over four. So here actually the one over four is just half of the regularity of the space-time white noise. And another recent work is by Millet and San Sole. So they consider a stochastic wave equation on the R D, and D is a one, two, three. And they have a superlinear drift term and a multiplicative noise. So in both of these two works, basically the equation is on the bounded domain because, for example, the wave equation, if the initial condition has compact support, Condition is a compact support, then because the wave equation has the property of the finite speed propagation. So, after time t, basically, the solution is also supported in the bounded domain. And in a bounded domain, if we, for example, if we want to study the expected value of the supremum, then we can apply the Komograph's continuity theorem to put the supremum inside the expectation. But in the unbounded case, for example, the heat equation. The heat equation. As long as t is bigger than zero, it's non-zero everywhere. So we are not able to use the Kolmogorov's computer theorem in this kind of research. Okay, so here's our theorem that if we assume that the U0 is a function with compact support, and we assume that B0. Compact support, and we assume that B0 equals sigma 0, they are both 0. And actually, this is quite important. We are not able to remove this condition. And as Z goes to infinity, then BZ and sigma Z are both much smaller than this kind of superlinear functions. And what is alpha alpha appears in the Dalon's condition. Actually, if BZ and sigma z are both Globally, lip sheets, and this condition implies the holder regularity of the solution of the solution, both time and the space. And it has a the space has a holder regularity up to alpha over two and the space has a holder regularity up to alpha and time is up to alpha over two. So the conclusion is that there is a So, the conclusion is that there is a unique model solution to the equation of this. Okay, so let me talk about the idea of the proof. So, the idea of proof is that we first we truncate the function b such that whenever u stays when u is less than n, it's the same as b, but when u is bigger than n, and it's b in or b minus n. B minus A. So now the truncated version of B now is globally lip sheets. So there exists a unique solution to this truncated equation. Now, we need to study the global maximum of the UN. The reason is that we are going to define a sequence of stopping times such that before the tau n, the stopping time Before the tau n, the stopping time, u n is no larger than n. Actually, this kind of stopping time argument already appeared in yesterday's talk. So before the stopping time, then the b n u n equals b of u n. So that means the solution does not touch the boundary n. So the truncations are actually not a Truncations actually is not activated before this tau n. Then, okay, now, so actually, we define the solution up to the tau n. Okay, so the solution is already well defined up to tau n. Then we need to show that actually as n goes infinity, tau n goes to the fixed time t almost surely. And thus we have a constructed solution all the way from zero to t. From zero to t. So, this is the idea of the proof. So, to be more precise, if we define the truncation like this, then as we assume. So, when you say that you study the max of u n, is it for a fixed you're looking at the spatial maximum or? Yes. Also also before zero detail also on the zero detection so we we know that as z goes to infinity then b z is growth almost like a z times log z. So now if b n and sigma n are B n and sigma n are so b n and sigma n are globally loose sheets. But now with the linear growth coefficients, L the coefficient of B n is to a higher to a lower order of log n and the Lipsheet coefficient of the sigma n, the growth coefficient is sigma n is log n to the power of alpha over 2. Now we consider this We consider this kind of truncated heat equation, then this equation, because now B and Sigma are globally Lipsheets, so they have the, so it has a unique solution. Now, and also, because we have a pointwise moment bound actually here, moment bound is initial condition times exponential growth. And here, here we have the Here we have the L sigma n to the power of two of alpha. Okay, so that actually this is important that why we assume that the sigma of n sigma of z grows like z times log z to the power of alpha over two because here's two over alpha over two because here's two over alpha. So now we can see the Now we consider the stopping times such that the tau n is that the first time that the solution u n bigger equals n and before t. So before the stopping time, the b n of u n is just, we define that to be b of u, to be the solution b and the sigma n the same thing. So we need to show that as n goes to infinity, the probability that the tau n less than t goes to zero. So, another way to say that tau n less than t is that before the capital T, the tau n u n u n t x is already bigger equal to n. So by a chapel chef inequality, this is the one over n to the power of p times expect expect value of the supremo here. Now, the now the question is how to estimate the expect value of the supremum. So, and we know that this So, and we know that this, the Kolmogorov's, we are not able to apply Kolmogorov's continuity theorem to put the supremum because this is unbounded. And so what we do is that we use the factorization method. So recall that UN TX has this mild formulation. So now let's concentrate on this stochastic integral part phi. So the factorization method basically says that we can basically says that we can re we can rewrite the the heat kernel pts x minus y as the as the convolution with itself so pt minus r and p r minus s and we can also rewrite the one as the integral of t minus r to some power times r minus s to some power basically like the um semi-group property so now now the stochastic Now, the stochastic integral is written as the deterministic integral yr minus yr over yrz. So if we apply the holder inequality PQ, then if we take the LQ norm of the heat kernel, then the X disappears. So now phi TX is uniformly bounded by the right-hand side. And we also Hand side. And we also use a holder inequality again about the time variable. Then we finally will arrive at the phi tx, the stochastic integral part, is bounded by this kind of integral. And you can see that x disappears. And if we make t bigger to the fixed time capital T, then we get a uniform bound, supremum t from 0 t and x in Rd, this kind of thing. This kind of thing. So now the expect value of the supremum of the solution is reduced to the estimate of the expect value of the y. So the pth moment of y, and we integrate the spatial variable y, we get this kind of thing. And we have the, and recall that previously have the bound for of the UNSY. And the bound UanSY involves the initial condition PSU0Y. Now, the same trick, then we can combine PSU0Y with PRSY, then finally we will get the expect value of the supreme. The expected value of the supreme amount of phi is bounded by this kind of exponential part times here. And dz. So, this is the reason that we need to assume u0, z is in the, it has compact support, so this term will be finite. Or u0 is in the LP for sufficiently large P. So finally, we will do the same thing for the drift term, and we will. The drift term, and we will arrive at the expected value of the suprema of the solution is bounded by this. So now, if we go to the chip shift inequality, you see that it's one over n to the power of p times the expect value of the supremum of the solution. Then, so if we put So, if we put the 1 over n to the power of p into the exponential, we get negative p times log n. And here, here, the Lipschitz coefficient of the b is at the lower order of log n, and the Lipschitz coefficient of sigma is at lower order of log n to the power of alpha over 2. And here, alpha over 2 raised to the power of 2 over alpha, so just log n, so the lower order of log n. So the lower order of logging. And here we have a negative logging which kills these two terms. So that goes to zero. Oh, yes. Sorry. It's a title. Yeah, this is a truncated version of the U. Okay. And here this completes the proof of that. And so here are some references that. Here are some references that I mentioned. Okay, and this is my talk. Thank you. All right, thank you. So it looks like we have time for questions. Yeah, may I ask a question? In the proof, I didn't see where you used assumptions that u0 is zero and sigma zero is zero. Okay, you mentioned that it's necessary, right? It's unavoidable to use those assumptions where you use these two assumptions. So this is because in the Y, you see that here's a sigma in of u of n. Then we take the pth moment of y rz and we take the integral with. Rz and we take the integral with respect to dz. So we get a so here we use the sigma n of u n less than equal to L, the Litches coefficient of sigma n times u n. This kind of thing here. But if sigma n at zero is not zero, then there will be another term, a number. For example, sigma n at zero, number here. Here. All right. So this is the powerful sigma. How about the B? You also assume that. Oh, actually, I didn't include B here. B is even easier because we just take the LP norm directly here. Okay. So you can take, let's see. So that's sort of the technical reason, right? But this is. Yes. But it might be possible to remove those assumptions. But it might be possible to remove those assumptions if we dig into a more carry out maybe more detailed analysis for those. I mean, we thought about that, how to try to remove that, but we were not successful. You have to be kind of cautious if I may interject. If sigma is a constant, then the supremum will not be bounded. So there's no chance of proving LP estimates for the supremum because that's infinity. So there has to be something. Yep. Something yeah, so actually, here boundedness comes from the like the here psu0y. This will contribute to the fineness of the integral because there is a dz. If there is a constant here, then this constant times, because we already have dy integral, this is a finite number. Then if we do dz, it's infinity. All right, do we have more questions? So yeah, can you yeah, yeah, go ahead. So can you uh show uh move this uh shoop inside the expectation? The solution is clearly finite. The solution is still finite. So for the solution u tx, and we are not able to get like the moment estimate of that because it's constructed from one by one from zero to the stopping time tau n. Yeah, so we're not even able to get. We're not even able to get the second moment estimate of the solution. So, as the other one says, so if sigma zero is not equal to zero, maybe can you use the Sean also technique to we try to add some like weight to the UA, but the problem is that But the problem is that, let's see. The problem is that if we add a weight to the UN, then it is indeed the size of UAN that activates the truncation. It's not a UAN divided by the weight that's inside the beam. So this method still does not work for the weighted space. Weighted space. Okay. Okay, thank you. Okay. Do we have more questions? So Devar mentioned that if sigma is constant, then the solution would blow up. What happens to if... Sorry, I didn't say that. I said if sigma was a constant. I said if sigma is a constant, the global supremum of the solution is infinity. That's not the same as saying that the supremum of the solution pulls up. All right. Yeah, but that this is okay. Yeah, but my question is still the same. So if B of zero is not zero, do we expect the same kind of phenomenon? I should say I hope so. But we were not able to prove that. Yeah, like do are you able to prove like global bounds on the no? The factorization method, they need a global integral of dz. So in this case, sigma zero must be zero. Okay. Okay. But for the drift term, you don't have this constraint. Also, we have that constraint because that also involves the spatial integral dz. Okay. All right. Then I was also wondering something maybe similar to what David might ask. So if you take those super linear growth, Linear growth, do you expect to see that? I mean, what do you expect to see for the shape of your solution? Would you feel the difference with just linear coefficients? I'm sorry, can you? I mean, if you had to do a simulation of those with the superlinear growth, what would you see a what would you see a difference with non i mean the just linear coefficients sorry i don't know what what what what would you expect to see so you you mentioned for instance that you are not able to bound the lp moments for p equals two yeah for for the final solution for the for the constructed a u yes You yeah, so is it something you might see on simulations, or I don't know. We guess that the U will have a very strong growth properties or like intermittency properties. So, like peaks, too, right? Yes. So, it will be in the form of peaks, not just Not just steady growth. I have a question. Maybe I miss something. Thank you very much for this nice talk. So you have some conditions on the coefficients, so as Davar and company head and also we with an E. So do you know if this is optimal or not? You know, if you go back to the conditions on B and sigma. Yeah. So you have, so this is for some alpha. And then do you know if for well, if this, what is the critical linear growth where you have explosion? So the reason we have log z or log z to the power of alpha over two. The power of alpha over two is because finally we will get this kind of yeah, this I understand, but uh but uh you don't know if this is optimal. I don't know. We actually we hope in so in the linear in the in the in the linear case there are partial results by by Fundun and Wallard. Okay, and then for the heat equation with so these With also this, well, Davar can say better than me. So, for the heat equation with space-time-wide noise on R, so then combining their results with Bonder and Grossman, they have optimality. Okay, and we with an E, we didn't prove optimality either because apparently it's a quite difficult question in the non-linear case. non-linear case. So my question is whether you try to prove optimality sharpness. So we try to improve the condition on B by to the Oscud condition because we believe that Osgood condition is the optimal. And the sigma z has some, is related with that Osgoode condition. But the problem is Good condition, but the problem is still to handle the expect value of the suprema mean side case. Actually, recently, Michael Silence has a paper about this kind of thing. He shows his conditions that BZ satisfies the Oscar condition and sigma z is defined out of BZ, which includes all these kinds of conditions. His result is on the His result is on the bounded domain. Yeah, I had to look on this paper. All right. But we were not able to improve that to also good condition. We tried that. And another thing is that in the walls paper here, it's big O. They use a strong Markov property to connect them. And still, our method method um we fail to do this because uh also the control of the of the of the tail at infinity okay thank you thank you all right do we have more questions questions for jingu all right so if not let's If not, let's thank Jeannie again and all the speakers of this
