Did you so uh moment? First uh I thank the organizer for organizing this workshop in this beautiful band and happy birthday anyway. Let R by an R group I mean a linear algebraic group of A linear algebraic group of R. By gamma, I denote the Gla group C of R, which has two elements, one and gamma, small gamma, where gamma is a complex conjugation. For an R group G, the Gala group gamma acts on J of C and the fixed point is J of R. We start from abelian gamma G letter. From abelian gamma model, actually. Let A be a gamma module, that is an abelian group written additively. Write H1 of A, H1 of gamma A. So we have only one gamma, so I don't write gamma. So I remind that one of A is a safe oscillosymmetric element, gamma A equals minus A, B one of A. A, B1 of A co-boundaries, are trivial skew symmetric elements, and H1 of A cocycles modular co-boundaries. Okay, now let A be a gamma modulus. For an R torus, we write H1 of RT, H1 of gamma TOC. So for an R torus, we write S up. In our torus we write x upper star of t for the character group and x lower star of t for the co-character group. Proposition in our preprint, let T be n R tolls the gamma equivariant homomorphism co-characters of T to T of C, a co-character C star to T of C maps to new. T of C maps to nu maps to nu of minus 1, it is equivariant and it induces economical isomorphism between H1 of the characters and H1 of the torus. So we computed it because H1 of co-character is just easy linear, accumulatorics linear algebra. Okay, now let the naught denote the maximal compact anisotropic subtle. compared to anisotropic saptorus, T1, the maximum split septorus. Then H1 of T1 is one, it is very easy to check and it is theoretical 90. For T in now we write T of R2 for elements of order 2, real elements of order 2, and for T in T order 2 we have T times gamma T is T squared, which is 1, whence which is one, whence gamma t equals t minus one, that is, all elements of t of r2 are cocycles. And we have a canonical motion, Tr of 2 to H1 of Tr. Every cocycle goes to its clasp. And Lemmo, in my two-page note of 88, Hamomorphism uses isomorphisms. uses isomorphisms T of R2 modula T1 of R2 to comology and T0 of R2 modula T0 of R2 intersection is T1 of R2 elements of T1 R2 live in T1 and they are trivial so that's so we know how to compute Gua Kamo geopetrolos it's easy now non-abelian come over G let A be a gamma group Let A be a gamma group not necessarily abandoned by definition that one of A is the set of skew symmetric elements multiplicatively and the group A acts on that one of A on the left by this formula, twisted action, and we said H1 of A is that one of A model of this action, the central orbit. Okay, now Nala. Okay. Now non-abelian below now if G is an R group, then G of C is a gamma group and we denote by H1 over G, H1 of gamma, this coefficient in G of C. Questions? No, okay. Now, using the Law analogy, let G be another group, X plan and R variety, let O be a gamma stable complex. Be a gamma-stable complex orbit problem, classification problem to classify real orbits in O, that is G of R orbits in real points of B lying in our complex orbits. Using H2, if necessary, we determine whether O has at least one real point. And if yes, we find such a point, again we, in some cases, one. In some cases, one needs second non-Abidian chronology. Let age denote the stabilizer of its node. Theorem, Borel and Ser, this is maybe a resonator of definition of black homology, that there is a canonical bijection between the kernel homology of H to homology of G with the real orbits in O. Okay, I specify the value of the G. Okay, I I specify the bijection. I just wanted to this is phi this bijection. I specify phi. So we denote by i the inclusion map. Let h be a possible of h which is trivial on g in g equal g minus one to gamma g for some g in j of c. Okay. We said xh g times x0 x naught then one checks that xh is a real point and to h, to the commodity class of h, we associate the orbit of its h. It's all this is well known. Clearly, for calculation we need explicit cycles. We need explicit cocycles. We should be able to compute the kernel. And also, we should know whether we have a cocycle in G, whether it's chromological to 1 or not. We need explicit positions. Now, relation to arithmetic. Let K be a number field, let G be a connected reductive K group. The group H1 of K3 fits in the following conversion. 3 fits in the following computative diagram. Here, H1 abelian, okay, certain abelian group. G is the reduction of H1 abelian, certain abelian group. Here we take real comology, we have real homology over all the real places, and here we have abelian homology of all the real places. This and these are abelian groups. I don't explain which one. And moreover, this commutative diagram is an. this commutative diagram identifies H1 of H3 with the fibric product of this and this over this. So we see that the problem of half of the problem of computing H1 of Kg is to compute real homology. Maybe it's even more difficult part because this abelian group does not know knows nothing about root system. Root system is root system is no root system so this is in the most difficult problem is the compute real homology okay below homology of real I start from simple group we discuss each one of each or connective reductive consider absolutely simple group absolutely simple means simple over C Adams at time B Adams and Tyree computed H1 of RC for most of the absolutely simple rules, but they computed only the cardinality, that is not enough for applications. One needs explicit recycles. Yeah, absolutely almost simple. Absolutely almost simple. Exactly, right? Absolutely almost simple. Now, let G be an absolutely simple group. A simple group of adjoint type. There is a work of Katz of 69, two-page note, Victor Katz, who classified real forms of real algebra. He classified automorphism and also real forms. This is the same to compute H-10 coefficients in the automorphic group. Now, our group G, adjoint group, is the identity component. Component of the automorphism group. And the method of cut gives also block homology for all simple groups of adjoint type and hence for semi-simple R group of a joint type. Now let G be absolutely simple, simply connected, absolutely almost simple, simply connected are the in the paper of my student Eleanor and myself we compute Nor and myself, we computed we computed H1 over G by the method of Borel and SER. We computed explicit cosycles and even uh which cosycles are equivalent to one. This uh gives H one for all simple connected semi-simple algebra. Connected semi-single arm group. Okay, now I explain you the method of Borela and Serge. First, let G be a compact has a reductive connected arm group. That G of R is compact. Let T be a maximum torus. It is compact. Then T of R2 consists of cocycles. T of R2 is cocycles. And the Weyl group acts on the torus and on T of R2. A theorem of Baralla. A theorem of Borel and Serb 64, you can also find it in Serb's book, The Law Commology. The inclusion map T of R2 into cosycles induces a canonical bijection between T of R2 modules of the action of the while group, this Valarkom object. So result of sixty one. Now I explain my version of of this result for non-compact build. Result for non-compact problems. Let G be a connected reductified group, not necessarily compact. T0 in G a maximal compact torus. It is not maximal torus in general. Let T be the centralizer of T naught. And it turns out that this is a torus, a maximal torus in G. And let T one denote the maximum split sub torus. Now we have uh we denote by end the normalizer of T. n the normalizer of T and by N naught the normalizer of T naught. Then G is contained in N naught. Why? Because G is the centralizer of T naught and N in N naught in the normalizer of the same T0. So we have this including set W naught and not modulo T. It is a subgroup of the one group. A twisted action. I define an action To be state action, I define an action of T on T of C, and not of C on T of C. We take n in a naught, T in the totals, and we consider n times T times gamma n minus 1, which is n T n minus 1 times n gamma n minus 1. Lemma, the above twisted action, induces a well-defined action of W0 on Action of W0 on the promotion. Okay. Note that in general, this action does not preserve 1. Look at this formula. If t is 1, then this is 1, and this may be not 1 if n is not real. So this action does not preserve 1, so hence it does not preserve the group structure. Theorem Theorem of my to page note of 88. The inclusion map T into tree induces a perjection, H1 of RT model the action of W0 with H1 of Rt. So, and H1 of R0, we know I even gave two ways to compute it. Questions? The idea that T preserve in the compact case? In the compact case? What? Is the identity preserved in the compact case? Yes, because all elements of the compact case, all elements of the wild group are represented by real elements of the group. And therefore, let me just put... And therefore, in this formula, this is 1. So in compact case, we have only this part. And so 1 goes. Part and so one goes to one. So, and it does preserve, I think it does, yes, it does preserve the group structure. Preserves one and does preserve the group structure. Okay, now Michael Sir William de Graaff has implemented this formula on a computer. For a kinetic reductive group R given by its Lie algebra in J lan R for some n. Than R for some n, he can compute a list using computer a list of representatives of all comology classes. Moreover, for a given cycle, he can determine using computer to which of z i it is comalobus and also find g in g of c such that z i g c this is g bar is gamma g of course, gamma g minus one. Furthermore, Furthermore, using non-Abelian H2, he can construct such a list also for a non-connected reductive R-group. So this is a problem in progress, but he checked it on non-trivial examples. Borel's surface and G is a compact. When G is a compact simple group of type A L that is isogenous to SUL plus 1, the group W0, which is W because it's compact, has order L plus 1 factorial. The amount of regulations grows rapidly when L grows. By combining the method of Borel and Serret method of cats, we, Timashov and myself, this is how to pronounce the name, Timashov. The name, Timashov, Timashov and myself. We constructed a smaller subset and the smaller group such as the quotient is our commodity. Where this group, smaller group F naught, is a finite group isomorphic to a subquotient of that of G simply connected. G simply connected is the universal cover of the is the universal hub of the commutator subgroup G of G. So it's a group of small order. For A L, for A C L L we have the order of group is less or equal than is a divisor of L plus 1. So maybe it's better. Method of colours. Let G be an absolutely simpler group. Assume that G is an inner form of a compact group. An inner form of a compact group, that G has a compact maximum. Let R denote the root system as the set of simple roots and also it depends on G, T and say some Baraltza group. Baraltza group defines positive roots and so simple roots. And let alpha naught be the lowest root with respect to S. With respect to S. So we have positive roots, we have the highest root, and minus highest root is the lowest root. Let the Dilken diagram, its set of vertices is the set of simple roots, and D tilde the extended Dilken diagram. Its set of vertices is S and alpha naught. Alpha naught is the lowest root. always true. Now we have we have L plus 1 vectors in the same vector space. There is a linear relation. We normalize it such that m0 equals 1 and we get a linear relations and all coefficients m1, m two, ml m m zero is one and all the other coefficients are positive integers. They are tabulated in the best book of Gorbachev. In the best book of Gorbaki, Burwaki le groups the Daltiblas, chapters 4, 5, 6, and also in the books of Anirchik and Lincoln. So I show the extended Dinkin diagram, these are coefficients. These are extended Lincoln diagrams. The additional vertex is black. Look now, the Lincoln diagram. Look now the Lincoln diagram the diagram has more symmetry. For example for BL there were no automorphism and now after we take BL tilde here I should have written tilde of course we have symmetry. This symmetry are related to the center of simply connected groups. And these are the coefficients And these are the coefficients. All these are the coefficients. So action of C just one moment. Let G be a simpler group. Let G simply connect at the universal cover G and G adjoint G model center of G. models and loggery. Re T simply connected for the pre-image of T, in G simply connected at T adjoint for the image of T in J adjoint. We denote by X the character group, X V for the co-character group, and we define P and Q, P V and Q V as usual. So we have Q is contained in X is contained in P and Q. contained in P and Q V is contained in X V is contained in Pv. Look C, P V model of Q V acts on digital and it acts effectively. When the order of C is 2, the non-trivial element acts by the unique non-trivial automorphism. So let's see. So for example, we have E7. We have E7, the group of C is of order 2, there is one unique automorphism. Okay. And other cases, there is a table, I show it to you, I extracted this from the book of Bourbaki. This is omega 1 V is Fundamental covet. For example, for DL, for L even we have the group with Z2 times Z2, one generator acts like this, simultaneously. The other X like this, again simultaneously. And this is for the L odd. Here the group has a border 4. And for the here, the group of For the group of herderboard 3 definition, a fundamental definition. A cat's labeling of the extended Lincoln diagram detilda is a family of numerical label q0 q1 ql with qj non-negative integers such that m0 q0 plus m1 q1 plus sol plus mfql is 2. FQL is 2. Why 2? Because our fundamental group is about the 2. In the work of cuts, there can be 3 and so on. But for us, the right-hand side is of order is 2. Let K of D Tenote the set of cuts labeled theorem cuts for a compact simple group G, I write it G C also, of a joint type, the set of the most. The set of the morphine classes of inner forms of G is an economical projection with the set of orbits of the automorphism group of the extended Dinkin diagram in the set of Kartz labeling. So we can see that the extended Tinkin diagram be the Kartz labeling up to automorphine of the extended Tinkin diagram. I will give examples but later. Now theorem our Now theorem of a version of theorem of cart. For G as above, the set of H1 of Rg is an canonical bijection with the set of orbits in K of D tilde, but not of the whole automorphism group, the orbits of its subgroup C. C is a certain abelian subgroup, a certain subgroup of the group of holotomorphism. I explained it b before. Questions? Okay, theorem cat. I describe the bijection as placing cosycross. Write dtly, dt dot gc, tcp. Recall that for j1 to l and for j are roots, simple roots. What is the root? It's a homomorphism from t over c to c star. The simple root. The simple roots A gamma constitute a basis of Q. Q is the character group of T. Our group T is a joint. For a cut labeling Q, let TQ and T of C denote the element of the torus such that alpha J of T Q is minus one to Q J for any J. 2qj, so any j Then TQ square is 1, so TQ is an element, is a cosycle. So TQ is a cosycle. Just one moment, maybe I put no, okay, okay, it is a cosycle. So let G be a compact group, right? As before, and where Before, where here GC is a complex group with a certain complex injury, which I denote by sigma C. And we can see it and to Q, we associate a new group, which is the same complex group, but a new complex conjugation, the twisted group, GQ. Group twisted by TQ in new complex conjugation is TQ times sigma comp compact. So compact. So this is the this is how to you will associate a real form of our group or real form of our algebra. Question? Okay. What is Q? Q is uh a cuts labeling. Are you right, John? Are you John? That's a good question. Okay, John. It's a good question. So at the moment. So we take we take a cuts label in Q, which is a family of labels Q0, Q1, QL, satisfying this condition, where these coefficients M0 are from the table, M0, M1, M2 are from the table. So you understand that it can be non- you understand that it can be non-trivial or not more two places, because the linear combination is two. Now, from this cart's linklin, we define an element of T with a following property, the root alpha j acting value on TQ. Value on TQ is minus 1 to Q. Epsilon and TQ is minus 1 to Qj. For any J. It defines uniquely an element of torus of order divided by 2. And this is a cosycle, and we twist using this cosycle. Is it satisfactory? So this formula defines GQ. What? This formula defines G. This formula defines TQ uniquely because these roots are a basis of the character group of the T. These simple roots are the basis of the character group of T. So this formula defines an element of T uniquely and its square is 1. So it's a cosycle because avatar is compact. So this is a cosycle and we twist our compact And we twist our compact group with this one using this cosy. It's a cosyle, and we and then we so we take the complex integration corresponding to compact group, multiply by TQO, and we get a new complex integration. This is a new real form of our group, and similar for the real. Now, to Now, uh to Q and K of D was a say the twisted form G Q of G C. This is the bijection in the theorem of cut. For this unit, it theory associates the class of this cosycle in the homology of the compact group. This is a projection of our version of the theorem of cut for a compact group. For non-capact is the same. But I don't care just informal apartment. Okay, I don't know. Okay, non-adjoint simple groups. Let G be an almost simple R group, not necessarily adjoint, having a compact maximal torus. In other words, it's an inner form of a compact group. By version of theorem of cards, we may write G in G. We may write G in G Q, so we obtained it from some Q by twisting from a compact group. Let X, the characters of T, where I g of d tilde x q d tilde x q determines this group. Okay. Then maybe I skip with this sometime I skip Sometimes I skip we somehow define a certain subset k of d t the x q in the set of all cards labeling. We define certain subset dependent on x and q I skip how we define it. So I think there are also some tables. Also some tables. Also some tables. Now consider the group F X V moduloc Uv it contains in P V contained it contained in Pv moduloc UV which is our group C and so it acts on d tilde and on K of D tilde by C by C and theorem of our paper. of our paper in transformation groups. Let GQ be an absolutely simple, absolutely almost simple R group, not necessarily compact or joint, having a compact maximal torus. Then the group F, this group, when acting on K of D tilde, preserves this subset. Okay, it's nothing because I have not defined this subset. It is defined such that it is preserved. This is preserved. Defined combinatorially using certain tables. And there is a canonical projection between K of G into X U model F with the Galaxy homology of GQ. And in particular, Q is in the set and in sets P equals Q to the neutral element of the log homology. So this is the result, but I have not explained you in details how one defines this set. It is defined combinatorially from Q and certain tables, which I skipped. Now, the bijection, of course, I skip because Now, what about outer form of simple R group? An outer form is a compact group with a group, simple simple compact group, which has no compact maximal torus. For example, J Ln R has no compact maximal torus. SLN for n greater than 2 has no compact maximal torus. It's similar, but one Uh it's similar, but one should use the tw twisted affine Dilton diagrams. These are twisted affine Dilken diagrams. Here I normalize the coefficient, say the coefficient at the black vertice is not one, but two. Semi-simple group, it is published, and the reductive group is outprepared. Okay, and now I can give a Okay, and now I can give examples. So let's example to understand what all this means. Consider the group PGO12, SO12 adjourn. This is the extended Lincoln diagram. These are the coefficients. Now, the cuts labeling, the set of Q0, Q1, Q6, such that this linear combination is 2. I want to describe all I want to describe all these all these cuts labelings. We can put here at an extreme vertex, we can put two we have four possibilities, two at an extreme vertex in this line or we can put We can put one at two extreme vertices. We choose two extreme vertices and each we put one. Then we have six possibilities. Here there are six possibilities. Or we can put one at a vertex with coefficient two. We have three possibilities. So, these are all cuts labelings. These are the cuts labelings in a form of PGL12 correspond to all these diagrams, modular automorphisms. We have five possibilities. Five possibilities. This is PGO. Star is a quaternion form. R is the quaternion form of the group PGON. Now the global homology. We have a group C, which is Z2 times Z2. Either way, there is doub omega 1 V, which sends zero to one, alpha zero to alpha one. Simultaneously, this and this. Simultaneously, this and this, the other element simultaneously this and this, simultaneously. Now, H1 is by our theorem detailed model C. We have six elements. These two labelings are not equivalent. These are representative, of course. These are not orbitals, these are representative. These two labelings are not equivalent. We cannot put one here and leave this one on its place. This one on this place, we should do it simultaneously. So we have two homology classes, but the twisted groups are isomorphic. They are isomorphic with respect to outer automorphism. We have an embedding. We have an embedding. Okay, it's I don't know what I do. The neutral element is this from which we started. Which we started. This two is a black vertex. It's a black vertex. Okay, this is a neutral element. And similarly, H1 of Rgq is the same set for any Q, but now the neutral element is Q, the orbit of Q. So if instead of compact group we take non-compact with compact maximal torus, we have the same set of common. The same set of cohort set, but with other neutral elements, not this, but the vertical from which the labeling from which stars. And this example I will skip, so that's all so thank you. And I also want to say that it is just I also want to say that it is joint work with Timashov, but my contribution was that I stated the problem, the calculations, the proof mostly due to my co-author Timashov, because it is related not only to Dinkin diagram, also for extended Dinkin diagram, affine Dinkin diagrams, not only with Bile group, but with affine Bile group. And so most of the proofs are due to Timash. The proofs are due to Timashov. My contribution is to state the problem. Thank you. Questions? Thanks, remarks? So when we use CAX result, CAX result. I mean, essentially that result is just a classification. That result is just a classification of elements of finite order in the compact degroup. Yes, of course. So, in your case, it's two. But it's already in Bourbaki that you take this element and you bring it down to the fundamental alcohol. And you have the walls come up according to the root, and then you have this extra wall that corresponds to the extended road. With extended note. But so you have a very nice geometry. But you're doing the same thing in the non-compact case. So do you have any geometric interpretation of what's going on? First, this is a question to Timashov. Second is that I think, yes, it is the same, but you work with a fine dental diagram. Affine Dimkin diagram, not with extended Dimpkin diagrams, as we would probably go. But this is the same thing. But this is the same. I think that this is the same. The same. But you don't have the full automorphism group of the extended diagram. You only have parts of it. Yes, part of it. So, what is the meaning of this in terms of fundamental alcohol? Fundamental alcove. You probably have something that is slightly bigger. Unfortunately, I don't know what an alcove is, so I cannot answer probably the question. I think we have a similar thing, but with a fine linking diagram. Using, I find what's known about coherence for customer decays. I don't know. The cognitive classification of twisted forms, they are finalized. They are totally what you mean by group. What's that? To the what that correspond to the realge is essentially the same. But it is a beautiful result because you know there are fine algebra. I'm sorry, I'm hijacking your talk. I can talk to your immediate question. Okay. All questions? Okay, yeah. So the automorphism is answered. So the automorphisms that you're considering require that they should preserve the labeling as well? Or just the No, automorphism act on the set of labelings. They set on the extended diagram and therefore they act on the set of labelings. I do not assume that they preserve it, on the other hand, on the contrary, they act on the set of labelings and we consider the orbit of the automorphic group in the cell. Automorphic group in the set of all cuts neighborings. And this is the classification of real forms of Lie algebras or real forms or real forms of groups having a compact maximum total. The automotive act on the set of cuts labelings are the QI. Exactly. And I was talking about the MIs. Just one moment, I want to show you something. These are no notes, please. These coefficients are stable under the automotive of the Dinking diagram of the extended Dinkling diagram. Didn't think diagrams. They maybe I have some more. They are stable and there is automorphism. One more question. Also have a description of a carbon decomposition and you have Position and you have this part of a helium in both sides and compact, non-compact, you have Satake diagrams. Is it somehow related? These two descriptions can it be related? The Satake diagrams and say real root systems? Okay. First, I don't know. And second is for real groups, for real groups, we have two appro for a group on a arbitrary field, we have only one vastoral despitor. The total split torus or maximum split torus. On the real groups, of real numbers, we have two points to start: maximum split torus or maximum compact torus. And for computing Galois homology, the best way, the best torus is a compact torus. For example, all Galois homology of a reality breakthrough comes from a maximal compact. From a maximal compact. So I don't know the answer to your question, but it's two alternative approaches. And for galaxomology, the best is compactors. On the other hand, for example, if you want to compute, say, you consider a real group, connected, reductive group, and you want to consider our points, it may be non-connected. And then, And then you want to compute the group of connected components. And then the best torus is the maximal spirit torus. So all come from a maximal torus containing a maximal spirit torus. For other problems, this approach is better. But for global models, it's the best approach, I think, is starting from a compact tolerance. On the other hand, so it's of course no. On the other hand, so it's of course known that the elements of H1 of the special sogon group are in the bijection with the equal classes, so forming the same discrete and so on. Can you speak? So you're in an addition, for example, of H1 of the special orthogonal group. These are the two classes of forms of the same exact. Can you keep track of that? How does this play out in your description? So, for example, that element TQ has the same signature as the corresponding form or? Okay, I can add this. I can and this is I think you'll look these slides are in the internet already on the site and there it is explained. There are tables. I don't know whether I should I skipped the description because I explained only for a joint group and this group is not atroid, but it is explained in my slides. Maybe yes and you can find them on the site. On the site, or come to me, and we will together look on my comp on the computer. It is explained. So, maybe do I have, I can explain, do I have some time? We will leave it for an unformal experience. Okay. Okay, let's thank the speaker again. We have six, seven minutes to start. Stop.
