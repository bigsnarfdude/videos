What I want to talk about is: does oncology need the physics of cancer? And physics of cancer now exists since nearly two decades. And so I think it's a fair question, what's it good for? And in simple words, cancer is a genetic disease, and so it's definitely not caused by physics. Physics. So, is physics just a side effect or some perspective change, or is it really needed? And I want to convince you today with three examples that it's really needed. The way I want to go by doing this is I want to show you novel physics, like here is shown the unchamming of a cancer cell, and I want to show that actually this physics directly impacts patient outcome. So, if some physics event So if some physics event happens, actually the probability that you die of cancer gets higher. This will be the kind of argument I have. In that thing, I will actually focus on the early events in a primary tumor, which you see here in this movie. So in this movie, you can see seven hours in a breast tumor, and whatever is black is actually an extracellular matrix, and you see Matrix and you see how the cells are moving in the cancer cell clusters and how they're spreading through the extracellular matrix. And this will be the processes I want to describe and I will tell you that they are actually can be only described with physics and not just with a list of molecular events. So this is what I want to convince you today and before I do this all this is based on the mechanics of cancer. this is based on the mechanics of cancer. Mechanics of cancer is really something which is really old and that's what so basically what I'm what I want to show you is cancer count meta metastatic case does not exist with mechanics which actually requires intricate physics. And is this really needed in extra? So we did something So we did something truly heroic. So we wanted to see how far does gene expression go. So we basically took 20,000 breast cancer patients and looked at 10,000 different gene signatures and were actually seeing how well are these signatures predicting patient outcome. So how well are they predictive what's happening to the patient? And for that we The patient. And for that, we use the concordant index, which is an equation which basically takes sensitivity and selectivity of a prognostic model together. And what we found is, I want to show in this graph, here basically the full picture of cancer would be this zero I've drawn here and you have all the information. Now actually gene expression provides about 80% in concordance. In concordance. 80% in concordance sounds pretty good, but actually, we shouldn't forget that actually concordance, 0.5% is totally random and only 1.0 is actually predictive. So 0.8 is right in the middle. Actually, in terms of a Schennen entropy, this means actually if you only take the genes, 50% of the information are missing. So actually, emergent phenomena, collective phenomena in with Phenomena in with the microenvironment, which are part of the systemic disease, need actually different ways to description than just molecular descriptions. And I will show you today that actually physics is a very versatile tool in this case. As I said, mechanics is pretty old. Already the Egyptians were knowing that if you have a lump in your breast, that can be cancer. We started off with inventing the optical stretcher. With inventing the optical stretcher, and we showed that actually cancer cells become softer to get through the body. So, the cancer cell softening is a first condition for metastasis. This is a very old and very simple data. More in general, we used magnetic resonance elastography. And this is, it's not basically the solid tumors mechanically all seem to behave besides one brain tumor. Besides one brain tumor, everything seems to behave the same. So, what's happening is if you do magnetic resonance elastography, we see that in all tumors the stiffness goes up and actually they become more fluid. So, they become more viscous, so they have a higher viscous resistance. And this seems to be a general subject. So, actually, what I'm now talking about in case of breast cancer probably is, since it's also agnostic to molecular detail, probably applies to also. probably applies to all solid tumors. Now the first thing is I want to convince you that it's necessary is actually cancer cell unjamming. So I want to basically tell you the first event of motility onset is cancer cell unjamming and why is this necessary. So here you see on the left side you see histological cut through breast cancer. The pinkish stuff is ECM. stuff is ECM, the violet stuff are cells. If you zoom in, you see actually that the cells are so highly packed that they are at volume fraction of one and they actually have no space to move because wherever they want to move there is already another cell. And to still to be able to move they need to unjam and this is a simple model. So if I have density packing and I have these hexagonals then actually these hexagonals are staying in position. Hexagonals are staying in position, and even if I shake it, it can't move. However, if I introduce elongated cells, they can pass by each other, and actually they're fluidizing the whole tissue. This is a toy model which is very simplistic, but it explains the idea of shape-induced unjamming. And are we really seeing this? Yes, we are seeing this. So, let me give you the next. This. So let me give you the next example. Here in this tumor, we actually see the nuclei, and in the upper lower area, we see unjammed cells, in the upper right area, we see jammed cells. Roughly speaking, if the nuclei in the shells are elongated, we achieve unjamming, or actually if they have larger areas around the nuclei, we also Around the nuclei, we also achieve unjamming. So, we get a phase diagram where we have unjammed cells up here and jammed cells down here. And where does this come from? We could show that basically the cells which are unjammed are soft cells. So the blue cells are soft cells, while the red cells are stiff cells. So, what you really find in a tumor is that in a tumor cancer cell cluster is islands of rigid cells. Islands of rigid cells embedded in a fluid sea of unchained soft cells. And so this is actually directly connected to the cancer cell softening. Now the question is, is this just a side effect or is this important enough? And for that, we actually basically did a clinical trial with 1400 breast cancer patients, retrospective clinical trial. And what we did is Clinical trial. And what we did is, in the histological slides, we measured elongated cell shape, elongated nuclear shape, used the variability and combined this all to something what we call sinus, cell and nuclear shape. And we derived a phase diagram where basically a low sinus and a low mean cell area means the cells are jammed and that should be harmless because the cells can't move and where they're unjammed. And where they're unchamped, that's a bad prognosis, and the cells should be moved. So, we really looked now at the histological sites from 1400 breast cancer patients where we were knowing the clinical outcome and basically did a prognosis based on ungeming. And here, what you see is the gold standard for prognosis, which is a coupler-meyer plot. So, basically, the gem cells are actually have a chem cells are actually have a better prognosis than the unchemed cell. This is the training group and also in the test group we have the same. So this is in itself, I've seen better coupler Meyer blocks, but actually it tells you something very important, that actually unjamming is not just some side effect, that actually unjamming is directly related to patient outcome. So actually that you have to consider it very carefully. Consider it very carefully. And actually, it has some advantages to a previous diagnostic. Taking it together with previous diagnostic, it improves the diagnosis by 26%. And in particular, it predicts women which actually will not relapse into cancer very well. Up to now, these women had to wait 15 years to be sure that the cancer doesn't come back. 30% of these women, we can now send safely home. Can now send safely home. So, I hope that I convinced you in my first example: cancer cell unjamming is not just nice physics, actually, it's needed for the clinic. The second example is now if the cancer cells are unjammed, what's happening when they are actually migrating through the ECM, through the surrounding extracellular matrix? And it will show you that there are many, there's lots of research on this, but it will show you that actually it's best described by physics. Will show you that actually it's best described by physics. I will show you that it's described the cells, the cells and cell clusters can be described as active pneumatic, and the ESAM can be described as passive pneumatic. We've done this together with Julia Giermans and got some really exciting results. So what's already known, for example, we have published with Peter Friedel that if this depends on adhesion but and on Adhesion, but and unjamming. So, if it's more adhesive, there's more collective escape. If it's less adhesive, there's more signal escape. If the ECM gets denser, we have more collective escape. If the ECM is less dense, we have more signal escape. So, all this shows that actually I have a pretty broad phase space. How do I describe it? And for that, actually, we will use histological slides again, and actually, something which actually. And actually, something which actually helped us a great deal is that Eosin images stain the collagen fibers of the ECM as well as second harmonics. So we can use sample eosin staining of H and E staining and we can see the collagen fibers as good as with sophisticated second harmonics. And we use this. And what we get is a very nice picture about A very nice picture about self-assembly of malignant tumors. So, these are what actually Elisabeth Friedrich has shown. This is endothelial tissue, this is a milk duct, this is healthy stuff. From that, it goes to carcinoma in tissue. So basically, it's still surrounded by a basal membrane. But then actually, tumors form these really complicated structures of extracellular matrix and of highly fingering cancer cell islands. So we have to. Cancer cell islands. So we have cancer cell clusters which are torture with a tortuous shape embedded into ECM. And I will show you now how these structures are forming due to cancer cell motility. And so to basically show you that this is really best described by nematic. So the ECM arounding here clearly is aligned and forms a nematic. And also the cells here show alignment, so they form an active nematic. Alignment, so they form an active pneumatic. So, what we have is a passive pneumatic and active pneumatic, and this can be simulated very reliably by hydrodynamic equations. So, active, actually went far away. So, the pinkish stuff is the ECM as a passive pneumatic, and the violet stuff is the cells as droplets moving through the ECM. And we can simulate this, we can. We can simulate this, we can again, like in the histological slides, see the alignment and compare the histological images with our simulation and see if we're right. And so if basically I have more cell motility, I have a higher activity of this droplet, and actually at a lower activity I have larger domains, at a higher activity I have smaller domains, which means that Smaller domains, which means that I'm basically predict, actually, we see this in the movies that actually, like in a Rayleigh instability, if the droplets, pneumatic droplets, are moving too fast, they actually are splitting into two parts. So they are basically the droplets are splitting by Rayleigh instability into smaller clusters, and we get actually a smaller cluster distribution. And we've really looked at this, and the amazing thing is really in biology, you rarely get scaling laws. You rarely get scaling laws over several orders of magnitude. So we looked at the size distribution and we get a scaling law over two orders of magnitude for the size of the clusters. And in the same way, we use the shape index for the fingering motion of this thing. And again, we get over one order of magnitude. Sorry, I have to go back. Sorry, I have to go back over one order of magnitude a scaling law. So, and the scaling laws agree exactly with our simulations, and our simulations actually allow that actually the clusters are, in the clusters, fission is a happen and fusion. So the clusters can actually split into two, but they also can merge together. And a simple growth model, which would give an exponential distribution, doesn't suffice. Distribution doesn't suffice, is sufficient. So, basically, the size distribution, smaller sizes and more tortuous shapes, means that my cancer is more active, that it contains more motile cells. So again, we derived a phase model. So, stable cells are up here, unstable clusters are down here. So, here the clusters don't split, here's the clusters split and the cells are more motile. Split and the cells are more motile and more active. So, this is bad, this is good. And we looked at this together with the nematic defects. So, we also could see a plus and minus one half defects. And the more active clusters, actually, because the stuff is pushing the ECM, the clusters are actually closer to the, the cancer cell clusters are closer to the defects. You very nicely see this. You very nicely see this in healthy tissue. Actually, it's the other way around. The clusters in the ECM, the defects in the ECM are homogeneously distributed, or homogeneously distributed. So you see this very nicely here. And so again, we go back to our coupler Maya plots. This time we've done this now with 2,000 patients. And here we actually take the gluster shape index, so the finger ring shape. Gluster shape index, so the fingering shape. So a fingering shape is bad, a round shape is good. So and actually, again, the Kaplan-Meyer plot clearly separates a better prognosis with round shapes and a bad prognosis with actually fingering shapes. This is a training set, this is a test set, and clearly, so this nematic in a nematic is clinically relevant and actually predicts patient outcome. The same is true for the defects. Is true for the defects. If the defects are homogeneously distributed, far away from the clusters, then actually you have a good prognosis. If they're very close to the clusters, then you have a bad prognosis. You see this again. And very importantly, again for 2,000 patients. So we used at first 1,400 patients, now 2,000 patients. These are large clinical trials. Small clinical trials basically started 200 patients. So this is not. 200 patients. So, this is not just some guess, these are clinically relevant data. In the last few minutes, I want to show you something else. So, we also can basically inhibit cancer cell migration. We found this actually a little bit coincidentally. If you look at the cervix tumor, then actually, so we looked at the cervix tumor, and if you look at the cervix growth pattern, then actually. Growth pattern, then actually the cervix cancer cells grow around this fatty tissue. So this fatty tissue is not invaded. It's blue, which means red means invaded. So it's not invaded. So actually the cancer cells are avoiding it and it's different to other fatty tissues. So actually it has genetically a very different way to be actually to look at. So this kind of fatty tissues cannot be entered by cancer cells. Entered by cancer cells, and we wanted to understand how that works. For that, we actually did some follow-up. Actually, the bad thing is it's very hard to get this kind of cancer tissue because it's very small piece and it's hard to. So, we actually used abdominal and paracolic fat to systematically decide, look at the crosstalk between cancer cells and fat. And we put some fat in a separate chamber to the cancer cells. To the cancer cells, and they only could communicate chemically through signaling. And we did that. What we found is that all fats are highly cross-talking with cancer cells. And actually, in the lipid droplets, in the cancer cells, you find lots of lipid droplets, which actually show that lipid droplets regulate cancer. So, actually, the cancer. So actually, the Grosto is really having a regulatory effect. Now, here you see, so here you see how cancer cells move into fatty tissue. Into most fatty tissue, you see how they squeeze through, and in this one fatty tissue, you see they can't enter it. It's totally free. They actually even try to move away. Since we actually don't have enough data. Since we actually don't have enough data on this, we actually used Gila cells in Suski cells and normal fat. And what we find is actually HeLa cells, which are very aggressive, actually are getting faster if they see fatty tissue, while Saski cells are getting slower and actually try to stay away. So we really see both effects, and this is due to softening of cancer cells. Softening of cancer cells, then they actually get better in. If they're basically stiffening, then actually they stay out of it. So it's a truly mechanical effect, which actually either avoids that actually cancer cells can avoid this fatty tissue or actually can enter this fatty tissue. And that's where, so basically this is a third effect where I've hopefully have clearly shown you that cell mechanics, i.e. physics, is really needed to understand the Needed to understand the metastatic cascade as the essential part of the systemic disease cancer. Thank you very much for listening. So, we had ungeming, we had nematic physics, and we had cancer-associated atopocytes cancer cells. And this is done by an outstanding group and lots of friends. Groups and lots of friends, and thank you for listening for my talk.
