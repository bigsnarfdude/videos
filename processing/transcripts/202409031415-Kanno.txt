I'm going to explain the relation to the idea of Q-deformed Y algebra of the free field realization of n equal to stripability algebra, which Autasan explains. So, first, I'd like to make a comment about the relation of the quantum of the. Of the quantum affine algebra SL to hat and n equal to superbirth algebra undeformed case. Very, this is all the story. So it is known that n equal to superconduct algebra can be realized by twisting walking modularization of quantum algebra SL2 hard. I mean, in this modification, we keep the department sector, but only modify U1 currents. More explicitly, in terms of More explicitly, in terms of problem having current psi plus minus due to what here has the multi-coff, this is some expression. But I'm sorry, there are some typo. I missed to write down both operator part. But actually, the express form is not important. And the spiral frame currents are generated by two bosons, Carrie-Phi, Pyrodon, Califi. And then the quantum are real. Real algebra S, no, no, sorry, undeformed case, so just the cutsummi algebra SL2 hat with level K is error by adding U1 boson solid phi to the platform sector. This is J plus minus the lowering leading operator of SL cuts moving SL2 hat and J3 is a carton parcel so it's proportional to the additional U1. And the direction of uh And the direction of SL2 catsmoody and n equal 2 is just like this. So G plus minus is a supercurrent of N equal to super er algebra and J plus minus SL2 current. The only difference is, I'm sorry. Here, we keep the programming current, but only modify the coefficient. only modify the coefficient of U1 bottom here. Here is our custom of the algebra case. This is the n equal to 2 superconduct. So this means that we only change the so-called compactification radius of S1 boson to get n equal to Sebastian Home algebra from SL2 hat. That is the most basic That is the most basic relationship we are based on. And uh deformed case. But we I will going to explain, we will uh after the Q deformation of this, after the Q deformation, we can relate quantum affine algebra U to F L to hat and our Q deformed N equal to Super Gomm algebra. And the relation is just the basic strategy is just modify you want Just modify your part. And undefined case, the modification is just a change of the Z lattice. But what we found is based on the relation to the Y algebra, what we found is that relation is promoted to the SL2Z transformation in the context of context-foiled algebra. More precisely, to get n equal to Shuppa-Humm algebra. Uh n equal to Supa Kohm algebra column that quantum of algebra ma we make T transform of U1 boson or maybe deformed boson. That's the basic idea of our construction n equal to Subabirus deformed n equal to Subabirus algebra. So this is the part which already our sign explained to you, but unfortunately there's some change of notation. You know, even if among the You know, even among the collaborators, we sometimes use the different notations. And we are very sorry. So, in that case, we use three bosons, deformed bosons, alpha, alpha bar, and beta, and two zero modes corresponding to these deformed bosons. We can write down volatile representation of the control affine algebra with level k. So, since most important Since the most important part is the U1 sector, I only write down U1 part, U1 but explicitly and suppressing as a complicated part. Right? Then this is a U1 sector of representation of quantum algebra. Then this is basically we rely on the resultation by Atoshimatsu almost Atushimatsu almost uh thirty years ago. So I uh and also I also changed some notation. E and F is J plus min raised J plus minus raising and rolling operator and psi is a curtain current. And then, I mean, you know, curtain current is proportional to U1 of the normal order product of U1 current. And leading and rolling operator contains both U1 current. U1 current and E plus minus, F plus minus. This is a powerfame fundamental robotics operator of two deformed powerfin current. So we are going to modify, keeping this small E and F, we are going to modify this U1 vertex operator part to get N equal to Hupakohma algebra. Is it clear? Clear. So the problem is how to modify this bu to get n equal to, deformed n equal to 2, right? This is what we are I'm going to explain. So to explain the idea, I have to explain the relation of SL2 hot current. To hotakatumudi algebra and n equal to Chippakoma algebra to the so-called Y algebra proposed by Gautan Latjek. So Y algebra is a kind of vertex operator algebra which we have heard in the morning session. So the Y algebra is usually denoted by Y L M N. Y L M N, Psi. Psi is some continuous parameter, and L Mn is some non-negative integer, non-negative integers. So physically, that's the construction like this. So we consider this kind of configuration of five brain junctions with DC brains. So world book circle means where the world volume, these five brains occupies. Rain occupies. And then for NF5 range, the wild volume is around 0, 1, and 3, 4, 5, 6 directions. And for D5, the world volume is 60 meters, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 directions. And for D3, the world volume is four-dimensional. This is our, actually, we identify this one, two, three, four, our real four-dimensional space-time. And on D3, Space-time and on D3, we have so-called n equals 4 Shupakonghu associate, Super January survey. And then I here I only write down at the 2-3 plane. So this part. So in 2-3 planes, these veins are represented by the phases, 3 faces, and D5 veins. And D phi brain is since this only one direction, so this D phi brains are represented by edges. And this slope of these edges represents the so-called PQ charge of five brains. So in our convention, so if the fibrain has charge one zero, I write this corresp this correspond this edge correspond to Corresponds this edge corresponds to physically D5 rate. And the vertical line, so this has charge 0, 1, usually physically called NS5 rates. And this is so-called dionic fibrins. And in any case, we consider this kind of fibrin junction with th these three brains stretching among these fibrins. And then we And then we s uh uh actually we consider n equal to four super Yamil theory on this one zero zero one two three and this parameter character psi represents the so-called gauge coupling of that super younger theory. So this is some physical explanation of the so-called y algebra. And the one of the important also maybe this is next one of the important point is that there is an SL2Z action on this Y algebra. So this on the PQ charge of five lengths, there are the SL2Z action on these charges, which changes the slope of five lengths. Yeah, so the as I explained this parameter of size y are just expressed except as by the ratio of epsilon 1 epsilon 2 by introducing parameters epsilon 1 2 3 whose trace is zero. I I I suppose you are familiar with s such kind of uh parameterization for a Huang Yang Yang, right? Ahwang Yang Yang. Right? Then the important uh and in on the fibrane wave, the throw parameter represent the fibrane charge on which SDRT acts. And for example, this is a standard wire algebra configuration configuration. So this D5 corresponds to N1 and this NS5 corresponds to N2. And for example, And for example, we can make SLD transformation to the light diagram. Here, the edge corresponding to N1, originally N1 correspond to this horizontal line, and we change it to the edge to P one P uh Q one sorry, P one Q one. And then so uh the edge corresponds to N two. H corresponding to N2 is P2 and Q2. So we make SL2Z transform. To get this light diagram from the left, we make SLZ transform of this kind. And then this parameter, since this is the coupling of, so fi s the coupling of silver geometry, so this al also changes like this, that according to the action of According to the action of SL2Z. And then we can get SL. So this is the story of undeformed case. And then we can obtain, according to Projectska and Lebjack, we can get N equal to super Bilotor algebra and uh SL two current algebra. F2 U n factor is sometimes a cost. It's sometimes a cause. And then by gluing two y algebras, on the left, we will get n equal to Schubert-Biras algebra. And on the right, this is a diagram corresponding to SL2 current algebra. You recognize, so this is us we just grew. We just grew two y algebra along this edge, and you recognize there is a common sector, this part and this part. So this so it is natural to identify this sector as a parallel failure sector. And actually, we can show what or we in the old war of phasing. Old work of Phadi and his collaborators, we already know this corresponds to performance sector. And the only difference is the second white algebra. And then you see the slope of edges are changed from here, from left to right. So this is what I told. This is what I told we have to make T transform to get n equal to, sorry, this is all already undeformed case. But the transformation is, I'm sorry, translation is somewhat degenerate in the undeformed case. And if we make a Q deformation, we can clearly see the T transform from quantum affine algebra SL to hat to. affine algebra itself too hard to the our n equal to deformed uh n equal to supercon superbilator algebra. So this is the basic idea of our construction from the construction of these two VOA from the gluing of two white algebras. Sorry? We just rely on their work and I'm not sure. I mean, actually, the growing of wild herbia is highly non-trivial. But fortunately, in these two examples, the gruing is rather simple. And then we can identify the resulting chiral algebra. But in general, gluing, it is very difficult to get to identify, I think, other form I think I'm afraid. I mean, so the basic idea is by gruing, we add additional some operator corresponding to this edge. And in these two examples, that additional field is very simple. In this case, the additional field or growing field of corresponding to this H is just G plus minus. minus and here the additional field is just J plus minus. But in general that additional field is very complicated. And very fortunately in these two examples the gluing is rather simple and we can identify the grouping field and this is most fundamental one. Okay? So So to obtain a pre-filterization of this chiro algebra, we can make use of the relation of the y algebra and quantum tool algebra of GL type. So actually, so the before Q deformation, Y algebra is appropriate transportation of W1 plus infinity algebra or alpha and 01 young. alpha n 0 1 yang yang. So it is very natural after so Q deformation it is very natural to consider quantum tolder algebra type 0 1. I think you you agree. So to construct a free representation of so deformed wire algebras we can employ already know the fork representation of quantum uh control to the area of G R one type or in your mic algebra. T algebra as a basic building block given by these paper all the papers. So recall that control algebra type GL1 has three parameters, Q1, Q2, Q3. It was originally epsilon 1, if you relation to the parameter variable given by authority in this case. And we will, it is very convenient to parameterize these parameters by this. by this German Q and German D. And this German Q corresponds to the deformation parameter of counter-Marian algebra, UQ, maybe GL2IZL2I. And the third parameter is Q to the K, and this K will be identified with the level of the control algebra. Right? So this is, this is, so this control is the algebra. So this quantum tool algebra essentially has two parameters, and these two parameters are are identified as a Q deformation parameter in the level K. This is very natural. Then since we have three parameters, what we have a priority of quantum tolerance algebra zero one type, there are three types of deformed Heisenberg algebra whose Heisenberg algebra whose central charge is square root of the one of the parameter 2i, 1, 2, 3. And then actually, the computational relation of this two deformed Heisenberg algebra is like this. So here is appears Qi, and depending on this Qi, we have the central charge of this deformed Heisenberg algebra is a square root of Qi. So there are three kinds of Kinds of fork representation loaded by the priority of the team algebra. And then recall that for y algebra, we have three non-negative integer L, M, N. And to construct pre-filterization of the Y algebra, we prepare uh L times first kind of Fock representation and M times second kind of Fock representation and kind of fork representation and n times three kind of fork representation. And it is now usual when both l and m bungee then we have we have y algebra of type 0 0 n and in that case that y algebra is equivalent to so-called w n algebra of type a and we know that already know And we know that already know that the deformed Wn algebra can be constructed by n-tuple tensor product of Hawk representation dim algebra. This is basically so this is a generalization of this construction deformed uh W n algebra from the quantum tore algebra. Sorry? Psi, the other parameter of psi. Psi is determined by the slope of the edges. So here that that doesn't appear. I mean Oh, I'm sor I'm sorry. So psi is a latency of histrion one and strong two and then Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, actually, so so actually, yeah, uh and ac actually that that size is done by the slope of, I mean, the y algebra. Okay, so first the you recall that the common sector is we we had like Hard, like so this is a common sector corresponding to the perfect part, and so common sector. So common sector, the corresponding y algebra is Q deformation of Y 0 1 2 and this is a standard configuration of Y algebra. So we put psi here. And then it is very convenient to exchange first fork space and second fork space. I mean I other tools. So we h we have one fork representation one fork representation with central charge square root of q uh q two and we have s uh two fork representation of uh the central charge square root of q3. So this is a parameterization, our parameterization of this side. And then the sub sub index represents the central charge of the corresponding folk representation. So there are two folk representations with a There are two polkaizations with a square root whose central charge is square root of the third parameter. And there is a middle one, has a central charge, whose central charge is square root of the second parameter. And then following the prescription of deformed hydrogen algebra, we prepare Algebra, we prepare three bosons. And actually, to get power receptor, we make use of the screening operators. In this case, the corresponding algebra is SL21, and actually, there are two Fermi excluding charge. There are two Fermi screen charge corresponding the pair associated with adjacent fork representation. The first S12 is just this pair, one, two, and the second screen operator corresponds to this two, three box space. Then this perimeter screen currents correspond to the two nodes. are two nodes of purely fermionic root system of SL21. And these two fermionic screen currents generate essentially generate performance circuits. So after overall normization, there is a si recall that we have three bosons, three deformed bosons, and two of them generate a performance factor, which is uh parameter sector, which is ess essentially two palmic screen currents. And there there is some remaining U1 boson, which commutes with two palm two screening currents. And this is actually this is an excrete form of U1 boson which commutes with two screening currents. Right? And then original so this is Original, so this is SL2 U2 SL2 half. And to power factor, we add this U1 bottom corresponding to the second white algebra. This is 0, 0, 1. So, since we have only single deformed Heisenberg algebra, so we add a trigger corresponding. Corresponding this part. And in fact, we can check the combination of this additional a tilde and h from the first y algebra and take a linear combination. Then this, so I'm I'm sorry, there are many bosons. So take that a linear combination H and A tilde, we get alpha. We get alpha, and this alpha exactly reproduces the known working motor representation of quantum affine algebra. So, this is a kind of consistency check of the construction of quantum affine algebra by growing two y algebras. And you know already, I hope you already understand our strategy. We just make a We just make a T transform to this combination. And more explicitly, this is a relation of this quantum affine algebra to the n equal to supercondoma. We make transformation from left, sorry, from left from left to right. You see. You see, we can get making the right vertex this vertex is obtained by applying this. On parameter Q and D carry our German Q and D, we make just maybe since there's D inverse, just inverse of maybe transformation. But this is, we keep the second parameter D and make multiply D inverse to the first parameter. So this is just a detox. This is just essentially the key transformation of these two parameters of quantum Torrey algebra. Then applying the transformation T to the computation relation alpha Turdel, we get a bar. And recall that the bosons, U1 boson for the pre-realization is a combination of H, which from the first It from the first Y algebra, the competent of screen operator, and the second button. So the precise I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you. I'm sorry, yeah. Then so we So we take m uh so this is the original uh boson which appears the v uh vertex operator you want vertex operator part of the representation and may you make the t transformation to this part and maybe final result is we get alpha tilde. We get alpha tilde by making T transformation to obtain our free visualization of the n equal to deformed n equal to superconduct algebra. I'm sorry, I don't write any extra formula, but I hope you understand our basic strategy to make t transform to the original working representation of quantum algebra to get n equal to, a deformed n equal to supercomputer. A default n equals to supercomputing. So this is our result. I mean, this we make t transform to get the boot U1 buttons operator boot tilde. And then the, I mean, for example, most important part is the construction of supercurrent G. And we keep this perfume receptor and just replace original. And just replace the original B, even battery proportion by this period, which we obtained by making T-transform. So let me conclude by making final remarks. So recall that the Wakimoto representation, or our Fourier representation n equal to superbula, are deformed n equal to superbulator. Deformed n equal to superbless algebra employs three bosons. But in this wire algebra construction, we introduced four bosons, right? Three bosons from this first wire algebra and the additional single boson from the second. So in total, actually, we have four bosons. And we can see that I mean the vacuum. But I mean the volunteer representation of quantum algebra is uprefted to pre-filter representation of GL2 quantum tool algebra, which uses whose pre-filterization use employees actually employs four bosons. So in the similar it is so it is very natural to expect that deform our deformed n equals two s as the Pacoma algebra can be referred to the similarly to the some kind of Similarly to the some kind of quantum toward algebra, and b it is very natural to expect if the algebra, corresponding algebra is G L one slash one, super realgebra. But unfortunately, we haven't not worked out that apolis yet due to our poor understanding of quantum torrential algebra, type G L. Maybe it is quite a kind of singular example of Schupali algebra. G L n is a kind of singular. n is a kind of singular example of super algebra. So I at least our understanding of this quantum toleral object of this type is very poor. So unfortunately, we haven't worked out that practice yet. But quite recently, a new proposal of the supermarket normal polynomial has been given, but has been made based on this exactly the same algebra. And we know either. And we know in the case of two deformed Bilotto algebra, the singular vector is closely related to the Machiner polynomials. And we so it is a very interesting problem to figure out the relationship of singular vector of deformed n equal to super n equal to superbilospheric algebra to some kind of super McNale polynomial. That is very interesting, I think. That is very interesting, I think, very interesting problem. So, let me stop here. Thank you.
