Is by William Choi, and it's going to tell us about modulation of short surface waves by long internal waves. Go ahead. Thank you. First of all, we have good news and bad news, right? We have only two talks left, which is good news. Bad news is I'm Gimme's talk. I hope I don't make you see it. But anyway, thanks for organizers for the Thanks for organizers for the invitation. And so let me show you a picture here. So this is the problem that I'm interested in and how to model this. So what you're looking at is satellite images. And this is a radar scattering intensity, not a picture really. There are several reasons why you have such patterns. Such patterns. One of the reasons is that you have internal waves below the surface. And so this is the images around South China Sea. And some people did experiment, these experiments. And what you're looking at is particle variation of temperature and in time. Time. So each panel shows the 24-hour vertical variational temperature in time, and it's about 10 days. And what you can see is almost the same time, you see a big displacement of so-called picnic or interface, if you want. And so because they have a very large amplitude waves, it's it's the amplitude is about order of 100 meters, which is really huge wave. And because such a huge wave generates the local current, and then these local currents start to interact with the surface waves generated by me. So that's the story. And nowadays, there are some Nowadays, there are so many satellites moving around the Earth, and therefore there are tons of satellite images available online. And you can see something like this. And the reason why you have a relatively brighter region here, here, here are that the surface of the surface is very chalky, right above your somewhere above. Bulb somewhere above the internal waves, where the internal wave is. And then, because you have a choppy surface, when satellite sends the electromagnetic waves, satellite has a better chance to getting some reflection back. If it is flat, then you wouldn't get anything, right? So that that's what this reason is. So, are you good? So far? So far? Alright. So one time I met the physical oceanographer who did a real experiment and he provided these pictures. And normally you see waves like this. And then at some area, you have a very choppy surface. And if you really zoomed in, this is what happens. And there is a very And there is a very distinction between here and here. And so the question is: why and how much and also where exactly relative to the crust of the internal wind, for example. Those are the questions that we want to answer. Okay, although the ocean is continuously stress-wide, Ocean is continuously stress-fied. I cannot handle that. So I simplify the problem as a two-layer part. So we have a two different density row one and row two, and I put you know one in top, and then I put some short surface waves. These waves are, the surface waves are short, but long enough so that I don't have to worry about the surface tension. So we are talking about long gravity waves on the interface. Long gravity waves on the interface and short gravity waves on the surface. Now they should interact. And so how do we model this problem? There are many ways to do, but I decided to use this Hamiltonian formulation. And for surface way, we know that you can use the displacement. Displacement of surface and surface relative potential can be chemical variables, and then therefore you can write the mutations and so on. That's what Zappa told us. And then for two-layer problem, Benjamin and Bridges, the first, I think, wrote this type of equations. Okay. The question is, The question is, this Hamiltonian or total energy E, can it be written in terms of canonical variables? Two-layer problem with a free surface. There are four variables. Two are the displacement of interface and surface. And then there are two more. One is just like a surface wave. You have a velocity potential evaluated the free surface. Potential evaluated the free surface. And the other one is the density weighted velocity potential jump. Okay, so rho 1 times phi 1 minus rho 2 times phi 2 divided by some intensity. So if you use those, then you can write equation like this, but the question is whether E really can be written explicitly in terms of those four variables or not. A two-layer problem with the free surface is not that simple. Free surface, it's not that you know simple. It's not difficult, but it's not that simple. So we use the usually two non-correlators to write E in terms of 0 and 5. So I spent some time to figure that out. It's not difficult, but it took a while. But anyway, so I chunk it at the order epsilon squared. So E2 is a linear. So E2 is a linear energy and E3 is second-order energy. Don't worry about these computations. I'm not going to bother you on what is gamma or gamma or those. These are just Fourier multiplier that we are familiar with for self-wise. And so we know everything. And this E Hamiltonian is explicitly written in terms of those four. J in terms of those four values. So now we have a closed system, and all I have to do is just take a functional derivative. That's what we can do. So let me say a few things about this system. So we assume to derive this, we have to assume the slope is small, otherwise I cannot do anything. And as I said, the system is closed and everything is written. Closed and everything is written explicitly in terms of four numerical variables. I took it the system at order epsilon squared, second order. The reason is, you know, it's very messy. I do not want to go to the next order. But the more important reason is that, so here we are talking about the interaction between zero flavor and internal waves, right? And the most efficient mechanism. Most efficient mechanism to interact is through the resonance. And in this case, the primary resonance is a resonance interaction between three waves instead of four waves. Because of that, to start with, I need the second order non-linearity is good enough. So that's why I truncated all epsilon squared. And then once I truncate that, once I have the evolution. Once I have the evolution integrations, then I can use the pseudo-spectral method, and then I can solve it. I'm not going to show what these guys are, because it's wrong. I don't want to scare you, but I will just mention a couple of limits. So first, I assume top density of top layer is zero. Then I have a finite depth of water, right? Depth water, right? The tab layer is a vacuum. And then this is a well-known second-order system for surface-waves. Although we don't use a second-order system because we are interested in four-way interactions and so on, so I need to increase the order to the third order. But we already know what the third-order teachings are and so on. But since I But since I truncated the second row in this limit, this is what we have. And some analyst is using this system to show that this system is imposed. Am I right? Yeah, so they are worried about this guy and so on. Okay, I'm looking at another limit. So I have two layers, and I assume the thickness of each layer goes to infinity. What happens? So, top. So top guy looks over there, and so the surface doesn't see any interface at all because it's too far away, and which means the surface wave is surface wave, and the water depth is H1 plus H2. On the other hand, lower layer also doesn't see the top layer, the free surface, because that guy is far away, and therefore this is the And therefore, this is the evolution equation for interface between two unbounded domains. The reason why I'm showing this is this is kind of interesting to me. If I use a simple change of variables, this equation becomes this. Okay? That's nothing, nothing difficult. So for two layers, we know this is a We know this is a repose problem, right? But it's a truncated system, so I'm not, I don't know the full story yet. But if this guy is a repose, this guy has to be forced. This guy's there away. They are exactly the same thing with the different variables. But anyway, I'm just showing that this, because this is kind of funny. Why these two systems approach to each other? You know, approach to each other. But anyway, so this is my main topic. I'm still using the surface and interface, which are nearby. I think there is just reduced gravity, right? Just change a variable. Yeah, but it's not even, it's just a constant. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just reduced gravity. Okay, yeah. Risk variable, if you want. Okay, so now we must go back to the original, you know. Now we must go back to the original, you know, the system of four equations. And first thing is we just linearize, and then we can distribution relation. And it's very complicated. So I just take the limit of delta rho much. I assume that rho density jump is very small. That's very applicable. That is very true for oceanic conditions in the ocean. And if you do that, then if you take a plus sign. If you take a plus sign, this is nothing but a surface-wave distribution relation. And if you take a negative sign, then this is the internal wave mode. So what I'm telling you here is I do have surface wave mode and internal wave mode. Also, I want to mention that the description of Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 is not really the displacement of Displacement of the self-swing mode and internal wave mode. Instead, the displacement of top surface is a linear combination of self-strain mode and internal wave mode. So at some point, I have to separate them, mode decomposition, to really describe the resonant interactions and so on. To do that, I need the explicit. I need the explicit closed system. That's why I derived those four equations explicitly. Otherwise, derivation is really complicated and it's not a pleasure. Anyway, so I have a surface wave in Tor Wave. It boils. And then, as I said, they start to each other resonantly. And to understand the resonance, we look at Regiments, and we look at the very simple case. So, internal waves are propagating in that direction, and I assume surface waves are also propagating in the same direction. 1B, pretty simple. If these guys are propagating in the opposite direction, then they don't talk to each other. So, they are moving in the same direction. If that is a case, then to find the resonance condition, what you need to do is draw a. Condition: What you need to do is draw a dispersion curve, solid surface wave, and then you pick a point on the curve, and then you draw the dispersion curve for internal wave, and then you see the cross-sections points. Those are the two sidebands that you generate for surface widths. And the distance between this guy and this guy. Between this guy and this guy is the wavelength of the internal wave. But to make a long story short, when density jump is small, what you have to remember is regiment triad interactions only occurs when the wavelength of interwave is very long and the wavelength of short wave, because the surface waves are much shorter than wavelengths of. Much shorter than wavelengths of internal wave. Only that's the case when you can see the resonant interaction, they are moving in the same direction. So if that happens, then short wave and long, short surface wave and long internal wave can interact with each other. And more generally, the resonant interaction between two-layer system is a little complicated, in particular, when you include the two-dimensional. Yeah, um the two-dimensionality and so on that people describe. Okay. As usual. Okay. So since you know this k is much smaller, this capital K is a wavelength or wave number of wave, which is small, because of that, I can, you know, in the approximate desk, because of this omega. Because this omega 2 is nothing but k1 plus capital k. This guy is much smaller than this, and therefore I can do the expansion and so on. So finally, the resonance condition ends up with this condition. Phase velocity of long internal wave is the same as group velocity of surface waves. I mean, that's not surprising, right? Because group velocity is the velocity at which the energy is translating. Translating, propagating. So if internal wave speed is the same as group velocity observed waves, then they talk to each other. Okay, that's exactly what this condition implies. Okay. So I'll show you one numerical solution. So t equals to zero, I have a cosine wave, four internal wave, much bigger, much longer. much longer and then shoulder waves smaller a shoulder wavelength and they start to you know target each other and at the end you see modulation one question is you know when you know you have a maximum modulation and so on and for that I put the dashed line so dashed line is nothing but this as you can see maximum occurs in like the track for the internal weight kind of thing so remote So the numerical solution shows, you know, there's something. To get here, you know, I made a lot of assumptions in terms of the nonlinearity and so on. So how good is it? So I tried to find the lab experiment. The two-lay experiment is not, it's hard to find. This is the only one that I know. So what they did is they generated low-interways and They generate long internal waves and they send short waves at the same time. And then they measure the waves on the surface by putting probe and that's what you see. And this is something similar to what I showed you for surface works. So that modulation was observed. And then they introduced some parameter like this. They measure maximum and minimum, and then they define a star, and so on. Star and so on, and then forget these lines, I'll explain later. And that the open circles are there for measurements, and they are numerical solutions, they are in the same trend and so on. And also, when phase velocity is the same as group velocity, as I said, the modulation becomes maximum. So, you really need to be able to get the phase. So, you really need the matching of phase velocity of internal wave with group velocity of this experiment shows that, of course, you know, this is a resonant trial interaction, right? So, you can describe this with a small number of ODEs, right? So, in this case, we have four waves. By the way, these sidebands are not really the Really, I excited through the four-way regional interactions. These are the two separate triad interactions. That's why I have four modes instead of three. And then in our paper, we showed that this ODE is not bad compared with our numerical solution, which was a good experiment. The problem is when desert. is when density ratio the density jump is very small then this neural resonance conditions are satisfied continuously so once you generate k2 and k2 is interacting with the surface wave and generate another surface wave and so on so the energy was contained only this guy and then this guy spreads quickly boom okay the reason is you know The reason is, you know, this kind of resonant interaction occurs when capital K is small. So, because of that, successive resonant interactions is possible, and therefore, you cannot use only small number of ODEs. You really, to compare your numerical solution with the solution of system of ODEs, you need ten, twelve, and and so on, which is too much, you know, to to handle. Know to handle. So, also, you know, as you can see, because you know, we are looking at the interaction between long waves and short waves, therefore, there is quite a disparity in scales. So, numerically, you know, solving a system, resolving both scales is not straightforward. So, you need some kind of reduced model, and there are several models for Models for short and long wave interactions, including many. But the known, as far as I know, previous models have some issues to apply this problem directly. So that's what we are looking at. Do I have two or three minutes? Two minutes. All right, then I'll show you very simple, you know, the model. Model and which is this. So, as you can see, when these two guys interact, internal waves don't change much. They give energy to surface waves a little bit, but they don't change much. So, as a leading approximation, you said, oh, okay, internal wave doesn't change. It gives a little bit as a part of current. And then, surface is, you know, Is evolving under the effect of current. Then you can use WKV approximation and so on, and then you can write this system, which some people call the wave action equations, because these don't satisfy energy, but the wave action is satisfied. And anyway, so in this case, you can solve for local wave number k and Local wave number K and local amplitude A and so on. These are the, although this describes the linear dynamics under the effect of current, the P D E is nonlinear. But if you write the old schedule forms and so on, then we can find the syntactic solutions. And this, one of our results is. You know, result is we can really compute the stiffness in time, and then we see that maximum modulation really occurs above the crest of the internal wave profile. So something is promising here, but in this case, you know, the energy Energy swift wave is getting energy from internal wave, but to have a resonant triangle interaction, swift wave has to give energy back to internal wave. That model doesn't have that mechanism. So we need that and along with some other things. So that's what we are working on. So this is work in progress, has been work in progress for the last five years or so. So I don't know any names, but anyway, so we also. So we also did a numerical simulation of 2D resonant interactions of surface and internal waves and so on. And we also did modulation of surface waves when we did laboratory experiment for internal solutary waves. And in this case, we generate internal solutor wave here. And by looking at this picture, it's not easy to see what you see. Picture, it's not easy to see what you see, but if you really zoomed in, then right above here, we always see reports. Even though we didn't generate surface waves, there were some disturbances there, and then these disturbances interact with the internal waves, and therefore these guys are modulated so that we could see. So this modulation was observed not only in the field, but also in the In the field, but it's in the land as well. All right, so let me let me finish here. Thank you.
