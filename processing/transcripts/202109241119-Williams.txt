So that's what I've done in this little table here. So there's n is 4, and there's 6 permutations starting with a 1. In this table, for simplicity, I set all the y's to be 0. And so my unnormalized probabilities, psi sub w, are polynomials in the x's. And what we observed was that these probabilities are all monomials times Monomials times some Schubert polynomials. So I'll define Schubert polynomials in a moment. Yes. Okay, so some main questions here are find combinatorial formulas for the steady state probabilities. And here there's these beautiful objects, multi-line cues introduced by Ferrari. Multi-line cues introduced by Ferrari and Martin. And so those are what wind up being the relevant combinatorial objects. And then a second question is to figure out those monomial factors and the relationship to Schubert polynomials. And going back to this data, if we pay attention just to the monomials, then we see that the monomials and x's are all Are all distinct. There's six different monomials and x's. And then apart from that, what I'm seeing is Schubert polynomials. Okay, now just to back up a little bit, there's several versions of the exclusion process on a ring. And I think the more commonly studied one, well, people can correct me if I'm wrong, but the one that One that I've seen more papers about, which I'm referring to as the usual multi-species ASEP, is the version of the ASEP where particles can hop both clockwise and counterclockwise, but the transition rates are either one or t, depending on whether the bigger one is clockwise of the smaller one or not. And in this setting of the usual multi-species ASAP, one can give formulas. ASEP, one can give formulas for steady-state probabilities in terms of multi-line Qs, and this was first understood by James Martin. And then, in a work with Cortilla and Mendelschamme, we gave some slightly different but related formulas in terms of multi-line cues with a different style of proof. So, this is on the side of the usual multi-species ASEP. Now, what I defined for you earlier was the in For you earlier, was the inhomogeneous TASAP where particles are only hopping in one direction, but there's more complicated hopping rates. And in the case that y sub i is zero, there's a formula for probabilities in terms of multi-line q's. And this, I believe, was first conjectured by Iyer and Linison, and then was proved by Arbita and Malik. But there's no formula in the case of general y not zero. Not zero. Okay, so this is about combinatorics of stationary distributions for the usual multi-species ASEP and the inhomogeneous ASEP. And so interestingly, despite the fact that these models are quite different, one can use multiline cues to understand steady-state probabilities in both, but the statistics that one looks at in the multiline queues are different. Now, both versions of these models are Of these models are connected to interesting families of polynomials. So, for the usual multi-species ASAP, they are connected to McDonald polynomials. And more specifically, the partition function of this model, so that common denominator, if you like, is equal to a McDonald polynomial after specializing almost everything to be one. So, this was proved by Cantini, De Guerre and Was proved by Cantini, Daguere, and Wheeler. And a refinement of that is the statement that every steady-state probability is a specialization of a permuted basement-McDonald polynomial, which we showed with Cortiel and Mandelstrom. And one sort of cool application of the fact that the multi-species ASEP can be understood using multi-line cues and is connected to McDonald polynomials. Is the fact that one can use multi-line cues to give formulas for all McDonald polynomials? So that was the main result of this work with Cortiel and Mandelstrom. Okay, so that's on the side of the usual multi-species ASEP, the connection to McDonald polynomials. But now on the other hand, if we switch to the inhomogeneous TASEP, this model, well, it's much less understood, I would say, but it's connected to But it's connected to Schubert and double Schubert polynomials. So in 2012, Lam and I wrote a four-page paper about this model in the case y sub i is zero, where we basically just observed that steady-state probabilities looked related to Schubert polynomials. So we have a four-page paper with a bunch of conjectures and we didn't really prove anything. But then four years later, Cantini proved that Proved that n of the n factorial states do have a probability which is proportional to a product of double Schubert polynomials. And it was also Cantini who realized you could add y's into the parameters of the model. So then in this recent work with Donghyeon Kim, we extended Cantini's result, but now we understand roughly this many. Roughly this many states and can and have explicit formulas for each of this many states. We have a precise formula that the steady state probability looks like, some kind of monomial times, some product of Schubert's. And we conjecture that every other steady state probability cannot be written as a product of Schubert's, but can be written as a non-trivial positive sum of Schubert's. Of Schubert's. Okay, so that's how these two versions of the usual multi-species ASEP and inhomogeneous ASEP are connected to McDonald polynomials and more speculatively to Schubert polynomials. Okay, so now I should probably define Schubert polynomials. So they're defined. So, they're defined using some operators called divided difference operators, deli, and this is an operator which acts on polynomials as follows. So if p is a polynomial in n variables, then del i p will be a new polynomial obtained by taking p, subtracting off the related polynomial obtained by swapping xi and xi plus 1, and then dividing by xi minus xi. dividing by xi minus xi plus one okay so that's the divided difference operator del i now if si1 through si m is a reduced expression for a permutation w, then del i1 through del im, this concatenation of operators, actually depends only on the permutation w. And so you can denote that operator by del w. Okay, so we're going to define Okay, so we're going to define Schubert and double Schubert polynomials inductively using these operators. Lauren, can I just ask what are these SI transpositions? Yes, yes, yes. Sorry, I should have said that. SI means the simple transposition swapping I and I plus one. Thank you. Other questions? I'm not good at monitoring the chat, so if I'll keep an eye on and I'll I'll keep an eye on it and I'll shout if something comes up. Okay, sounds good. So now if x and y are two sets of variables, we'll let delta of x comma y be this product of linear factors x n minus y j. And then to every permutation w and sn, we associate a double Schubert polynomial. double Schubert polynomial. This is was first done by Lescu and Schutzenberg. And the double Schubert polynomial associated to W is defined by starting with this product delta and then acting by the divided difference operator corresponding to W inverse W naught. And here I should explain my notation again. W naught means the permutation which takes 1 to n, 2 to n minus 1. 2 to n minus 1, 3 to n minus 2, and so on, down to 1. Okay, and the divided difference operator is only acting on the x variables. Okay, and the double Schubert polynomials, if you specialize all the y's to be zero, give back what are just normally called Schubert polynomials. So, to say a few facts about To say a few facts about Schubert polynomials, when W in Sn is a Grassmannian permutation, then the corresponding Schubert polynomial is just a Schur polynomial. So actually both McDonald and Schubert polynomials generalize the Schur polynomials. And there's a geometric significance of Schubert polynomials in terms of the cohomology of Schubert varieties in the complete flag variety. There's also a geometric significance. There's also geometric significance to double Schubert polynomials, and there's been quite a lot of work on the Schubert polynomials. Okay, so now let me go back to our inhomogeneous TASEP on a ring and show more data. This is what the steady state probabilities look like when n is 5. Okay, so again, because of the circular symmetry. So again, because of the circular symmetry, we only have to look at permutations starting with one. And now we can look at the monomial factors. And if you look again at these monomial factors in front of the steady state probabilities, oh, sorry, I should say x to the 5, 2, 0 is shorthand for x1 to the 5, x2 squared, x3 to the 0. Okay, but now one observation is that these. One observation is that these monomial factors are all distinct. And then, when you look at most other steady-state probabilities, what you see is a product of Schubert polynomials. But in a few cases, you see a non-trivial sum instead. But it is a positive sum. So there's these four cases where our probabilities. Cases where our probabilities look a little bit more complicated. Okay, so let me mention a conjecture which came from our 2012 paper, which is the monomial factor conjecture. And it's a precise conjecture for what those monomials should be. And I should say also. And I should say also the data I showed here was when the y sub i's are all zero and the monomial factor conjecture is made in that setting. Okay, so let's let W be some permutation and I'm going to let R and S be the positions where I see the letters I plus one and I. And now And now I'm going to define a number alpha sub i of w by counting how many integers are greater than i plus 1 among the following set of letters. And so what I'm going to do is on my permutation, which I'm viewing as a permutation of an arrangement of particles on a circle, I find my i plus 1, and then I start moving clockwise, and I keep going clockwise around my circle until I get to i. Around my circle until I get to i. And I look at all those letters that I see along the way, and I count how many are bigger than i plus one. That's what alpha i of w is. Okay, and then the theorem is the following explicit formula for the monomial factors that one sees. Okay, so we consider the inhomogeneous TESP on Sn and for W in Sn we're going to let Sn, we're going to let eta of w be the largest monomial that can be factored out of psi sub w. And then the statement is that eta of w is this product. So it's a product of all the xi's raised to some power. And to find the power that xi is raised to, I add up alpha i of w plus alpha i. w plus alpha i plus one of w dot dot dot all the way up to alpha n minus two of w and another way of thinking about it is that I'm going to find so starting on this side to calculate this number I would find the n minus 1 on my circle and I would start traversing clockwise until I get to n minus 2 and I count how many numbers that I see are bigger than n minus 1 and then I go from my minus 1. And then I go from my n minus 2 and I keep traversing clockwise until I get to n minus 3 and I count how many numbers I see which are bigger than n minus 2. And I keep going in this way until I get to i. Okay and then the other statement is that if two states are well if two states have the same monomial factor then w and w prime must be cyclically equivalent. Okay so for example if For example, if W were the permutation 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, so then my configuration of particles is 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, then to count alpha 1, I would, so I'm looking at this definition, I find my two, and then I start moving clockwise until I get to one, and I count how many numbers are bigger than two, and both three and five are bigger, so this is two. Okay, and then This is 2. Okay, and then similarly, I can compute alpha 2 and alpha 3. And so my monomial factor will be eta of w to, which will be x1 to the 4, x2 squared. And so this is the permutation 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, which is this one. And so here we see the monomial factor is x to the 420. Minomial factor is x to the 4, 2, 0, which is exactly what we got from this recipe. Okay, yeah. Please interrupt if there's any questions. Okay, so now let me say something about pattern avoidance. So we say that a permutation W So we say that a permutation w avoids the pattern. So I'm sort of defining it by one example. We say that w avoids the pattern 2413 if there's not four positions in a row, Ijkl. Sorry, not in a row, but in order, but they don't have to be like consecutive. So there's not four positions, Ijk and L, such that Wi, WJ, WK, and W L are in the relative order 2413. So as So, as an example, this permutation W, if you look at the red letters, these red letters have the relative order 2, 4, 1, 3, and so we'd say that this permutation W contains the pattern 2, 4, 1, 3. But on the other hand, this permutation avoids the pattern 2, 4, 1, 3. It has no instances. Okay. Okay. And now, so then we define. And now, so then we define this class of permutations called evil avoiding. And evil avoiding means that W has to avoid the pattern 2413. And as a kind of a mnemonic, I'm associating 2413 to the word evil, where I identify one with I and two with E, and three with L and four with V. L and four with V. But we also have to avoid three more patterns coming from these anagrams of evil. So, vile, under the same translation between letters and numbers, will be four, one, three, two. And then the other anagrams we have to avoid are veil and leave. Okay, sorry, and leave is this one is a little bit of a stretch, but this is a Scandinavian name. Name. So that was the best. Sorry, this was the best I could do. Okay, so evil avoiding means you avoid these four patterns. Okay, so now how do evil avoiding permutations enter into this story? Well, what we realized at some point after staring at lots of data was that whenever W is an evil avoiding permutation representing a state of Representing a state of the TASEP, and without loss of generality, recall w1 is one. Then, as long as you're evil avoiding the unnormalized probability, psi sub w is proportional to a product of double Schubert polynomials. And the number of Schubert polynomials in your product is going to be the number of descents of W inverse. So, we'd been staring at the data. We'd been staring at the data for n equals 5 and 6 and 7 and trying to figure out for which states of the TASAP is your steady state probability monomial times Schubert polynomials. And it took us a really long time to sort of figure out what was going on, but eventually realized that it was all the states avoiding those four patterns, which had these beautiful multiplicative steady state probabilities. Study seat probabilities. So, Noah, can I ask if you because everything should be? Oh, I see. So, we're fixing one to be the first. Yes, that's right. That's right. Yes. So, so that's why we wouldn't have to avoid passing. Yeah, okay. That makes sense. Right, right, exactly. Yeah, so it's a little bit asymmetric how it's stated, but we're yeah, we're breaking symmetry in order to make the statement. To make the statement. Okay, so again, if we go back to this n equals 5 data and you look at the four states where the steady state probability is more complicated, is a non-trivial sum of Schubert's, then those four states contain these four bad patterns, right? The one, three, five, two, four, if you throw away the one, the remaining letters form. The remaining letters form the pattern 2413, which is evil. And then similarly, these three correspond to the other three bad patterns. And then the other thing, the other content of that statement I wrote was that for all the other permutations, if you want to know how many Schuberts are on the right-hand side, and there can be one or there could be two or there could be three, that number can be read off of by taking the inverse of this. By taking the inverse of this permutation and counting decents. May I ask a question? Sure. I'm confused about the lack of circular symmetry. Oh, yes. Maybe this is related to what James was saying. Because if I've got a really long polynomial, you would think it really wouldn't, I mean, it really wouldn't matter. I mean, it really wouldn't matter where it starts, whether or not it has an evil in it or not. I mean, some of them wrap around, of course, but why are your rules not sort of circularly symmetric? Or did you try to make a circularly symmetric definition? We didn't. We didn't. Yeah, I guess because we were looking already at the permutations starting with one, it was natural. With one, it was natural to make this assumption, only look at the ones starting with one, and now try to characterize the permutations with the good steady state probabilities. Yeah, but it would be interesting to try to find a circularly symmetric way of stating it. And actually, okay, actually, that's going to be related to an open problem that I pose. So, yeah, there may be a way to answer it. So, of course, once we came up with this definition, we were trying to figure out if other people had studied these kinds of permutations. And we counted, you know, of course, we put in the sequence into Sloan. So if E of n is the number of evil avoiding permutations in Sn, this sequence of numbers appears as Sloan, well, this sequence. One can easily find an explicit formula for this number. This number, and there's a whole bunch of references in Sloan for this numerology for the sequence, although we couldn't find any reference to permutations avoiding these particular four patterns. But I'll just mention a few other interpretations of this sequence. E of n counts rectangular permutations on 1 through n, which are those avoiding these four patterns. Avoiding these four patterns. And so, of course, the obvious thing to try to do is figure out if somehow there's an easy map between those avoiding these and those avoiding these. And we didn't try for very long, but we didn't find a bijection. So anyway, I just leave it as an open problem since I know many of you are experts on this kind of thing to find a bijection between these rectangular permutations and the evil avoidance. Rectangular permutations and the evil avoiding ones. Another way of describing these permutations, sorry, of giving another permutation interpretation to this sequence. So this is not a way of describing evil avoiding permutations, but it's a class of permutations with the same cardinality. Is the permutations in Sn such that for each j, there's at most one i. There's at most one i less or equal to j with pi of i bigger than j. And there's a way to rewrite this statement in a sort of a non-crossing partition-ish type way. And so I think this set of permutations has more circular symmetry. So it could be that mapping these to these might give some insight on a more Give some insight on a more circularly symmetric way of describing the good states. Yeah, so anyway, so it's an open problem to find a bijective proof between evil avoiding permutations and any of the other objects counted by the same sequence. Okay. Let's see. Yeah. Let's see. Yeah, so the way I stated the theorem before was sort of vague. So I'll just refine my statement now. So if W in Sn is an evil avoiding permutation representing a state of the TASEP, and let's say it has K, its inverse has K descents, and without loss of generality, W sub 1 is 1, then the statement is that there are partitions lambda 1 through Lambda K which Which I can construct in a moment. And then, if you then define μ to be this vector minus the sum of all of these lambda i's, viewing each partition as a vector, then your steady state probability psi sub w looks like x to the mu times the following product of Schubert polynomials and s lambda i here with s lambda i here with this notation here is a Schubert polynomial which is actually a flagged Schur polynomial and one way to define this flagged Schur polynomial is to write down the generating function for all semi-standard tableau of shape lambda i but now the extra complication is that your entries in row j are bounded above by this number so so the class So, the class of Schubert polynomials that we're seeing are actually flagged Schur polynomials and can be described using semi-standard Tableau. Okay, and okay, maybe I won't go through the explicit recipe, but using the lemur code of W inverse, there's an explicit way to write down those partitions lambda one through lambda k. So So, so anyway, so if you want to see the explicit recipe, you can see it in my slides, which hopefully are online by now. And then, again, for simplicity, I stated this theorem in the case when y sub i's are zero, but we have a version of this theorem when the y sub i's are non-zero and with double Schubert's instead of ordinary Schubert polynomials. Okay, so this here is just a little table of essentially the same data but rewritten. Now I've sorted the states, the evil avoiding states, by numbers of descents of their inverse. And then I've written down the corresponding sequence of partitions associated to each one together with the steady state probabilities. Probabilities. And again, the recipe for constructing monomials is to sort of take a constant vector 631 and then subtract off the two partitions associated. Okay. Okay, so here I've just rewritten the theorem. And of course, as we know, when the y sub i's are all zero, there's a The y sub i's are all zero, there's a combinatorial formula for the stationary distribution in terms of multi-line q's. And conjectured by Iron Lineson and proved by Arida and Malik. And in this case, so in the y sub i is zero case, and additionally if k is one, one can go from the multi-line q formula to our theorem by mapping multi-line q's to semi-standard tableau. Okay, so we can do a Okay, so we can do a combinatorial proof of this theorem when y sub i's are zero and additionally when k is one. But to prove the theorem for general y's and k we first of all don't have the multi-line q formula available and also when there's products of Schubert's on the right-hand side we have no idea how to map the terms on our right hand side to multi-line cues. Okay, so um Okay, so instead what we use in that case is a result of Cantini, which introduces some auxiliary parameters z1 through zn into the picture. So it wasn't bad enough to have x's and y's. We're going to throw in some z's as well. And essentially what he writes down gives a recursion for psi sub w's after throwing in these auxiliary variables. And I'll just show. Okay, so let me try to just unpack Cantini's result a little bit. So, what he does is sort of introduce new parameters z1 through zn and introduce some new quantities psi sub w of z. They are defined recursively. Your base case when your permutation is the identity. Permutation is the identity permutation. The base case looks like this huge product. Some factors look like have x's and y's, some have z's and x's, some have z's and y's. And then to go to the other size of w of z's, where w is arbitrary, there's a sort of isobaric divided difference operator, which takes you from psi sub w of z. Psi sub w of z to the related state where instead of having a w, we have w multiplied by a simple transposition. And this isobaric divided difference operator looks as follows. So you take your quantity g of z. So it's probably a rational expression in x's, y's, and z's. Expression in x's, y's, and z's, but we're thinking of it as an expression in z's. And you, well, this basically looks like a divided difference operator, but we also have these factors in terms of x's, y's, and z's as well. Okay, so, okay, so he introduces these sort of upgraded steady-state probabilities psi w of z and shows that the leading coefficient of each one with respect to z. Each one with respect to z recovers the steady state probability. So he's basically using integrability to throw more parameters into the picture and then express these sort of generalized steady-state probabilities and to basically write down a recurrence for them. Okay, so yeah, so anyway, anyway, so I so this is a So, this is a main tool. A main tool in our proof of the connection to Schubert polynomial stuff is to sort of use this recurrence and then show that leading coefficients of his psi sub w of z's look like products of Schwartz. Okay, so a conjecture, which seems pretty hard, is that if W is not evil avoiding, If w is not evil avoiding, then the steady state probability psi sub w looks like a monomial, this monomial we understand, times a positive sum of Schubert polynomials. So what's left is to understand these other steady state probabilities, these sort of four complicated ones in the case n is five. And another related open question would be to find some kind of G. question would be to find some kind of geometric interpretation of steady state probabilities. So can you understand these expressions and maybe give an interpretation in terms of cohomology of some sub-variety of the complete flat variety? So that's all I wanted to say. You can find everything I said in this paper on the archive and I think I'm the last And I think I'm the last speaker of the conference, so I want to give everyone the opportunity to thank the organizers for a really nice conference. Well, thank you very much, Lauren. I think we should give Lauren a proper round of applause at the end of that amazing talk as well. Any questions or comments? I have one comment. So that class of that enumeration of evil permutations, there's yet another class of permutations which is counted by the same numbers, which are permutations that can be drawn on an X. So you have an X shape, put dots on the X. Dots on the X, label them from bottom to top, and then read them from left to right. That's also a set, that's also a pattern avoiding class. It also, these are also permutations that avoid four patterns of length four, but I think it's different from all of these that you listed. Oh, is there a name for these permutations? I guess it's called the X class. Huh. And you said again. And you said, um, you said again the four patterns to avoid would be those corresponding to sort of all ways of drawing an X and then like labeling them. Oh, wait, no idea. Yeah, so I mean, I have them here. It would be 2143, 2413, 3142, and 3412. But I don't think it's any rotation of any of these that you have. So I think they're all fundamentally different, but they are counted by the same sequence. Oh, interesting. The same sequence. Oh, interesting. Those are sort of more symmetric, it seems. Yeah. Maybe. I mean, if you plot the graph of each of those four, then they sort of form a set. Huh, interesting. The rectangular permutations are also a bit more symmetric, but not exactly in this. Symmetric, but not exactly in this, not exactly the same, though. Huh, interesting. And those have come up in some of your work? Yeah, so I have a paper that gave a bijection. I think it's between the X class and the one you wrote here, the pi, so that for each J, there's at most one I such that. So I think there's a bijection between these two. I think there's a bijection between these two. I mean, I suppose because it's a pretty simple linear recurrence, one can probably turn it into recursive bijections. But I guess the question is whether that has a nice description too or not. Interesting. Yeah. Lauren, I was wondering if there's a are there any conjectures about extensions to Extensions to asset versions of this. So, what would you do with the parameters that still might make it integrable somehow? Oh, yeah. I don't know. You know, I'm not sure. And Cantini has some discussion in his paper to the extent that this was seemed to be the most, so, so, right, so what he did was explicitly add. Right, so what he did was explicitly add in the y's, whereas before we only had the x's, and he has some remark in his paper to the effect of this seems to be the maximal extension which preserves integrability, but I haven't sort of digested what he said there to know well enough whether there's any hope to put in any kind of hopping in the other direction. That's what you were asking about, right? Whether you're the other way, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it would be really cool to sort of find the common generalization of these two sides. Yes. Yeah. I guess another interesting thing to ask about is a case where maybe you've only got a small number of types of particle, like three, you've got, or maybe even you've just got one fast particle, a load of normal particles, and one slow particle, or something like this. So a lot of you're only working with some number of variables, whether any x. only working with some number of variables whether whether any extra kind of symmetries emerge or something oh maybe yeah i i guess that's something we're we're quite used to when you're thinking of processes on the infinite line you're often thinking well you you you don't want infinitely parameters you just have some finite number of particles with some finite number of types with some density and um it'd be interesting to know if anything yes right you mean like if you have like two or three species of particles Two or three species of particles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good suggestion. I've got a question. So on the evil avoiding permutation, I mean, it's just a thought, really, but maybe if you could just draw the picture of a large random. A large random one, and it doesn't even have to be uniformly random, but just like some reasonable way of picking a large evil-avoiding permutation. And then you might learn something about it because maybe you already know, but I'm thinking with the X permutations that we just heard about, my guess is if you drew a picture of a large random one, then you would see the X and then suddenly you kind of And then suddenly you kind of understand what they are, right? In a way that you, at least I don't from seeing those four. Right. So I can imagine there might be something like that for yours as well. Like if you just, it's just like it's a sort of very dumb kind of experiment, really, but just by whatever means, doesn't have to be uniformly random at all, but just come up with some silly way of producing a random example. And I don't know how to do that either, but I guess there are ways. Do that, I don't, but I guess there are ways. Then you might, when you look at the picture, you just actually look at the permutation matrix, you might just suddenly realize, yeah, and oh yeah, that's yeah, that's a good suggestion. I'm not very good at drawing large random things, but it's but it sounds like a really useful thing to do. Yeah, I mean, if anybody feels like thinking about Anybody who feels like thinking about these things, it would be great to have more suggestions. Any more comments or questions? I have a question, but I don't know how pertinent it is. So here you are, it's to gain cyclic symmetry. So you have numbers, j's, which are greater than i's. Which are greater than i's. But if you change the order to be something on z over n z, so for example, j is greater than i if j minus i is between zero and n minus two. Sorry, just to be clear, are you referring to this description here? Or was it something else you were referring to? So it could be to replace. So it could be to replace all types of orders. So you have a permutation, but your number are between 1 and n. And sometimes you consider j greater than i. So which jump you're allowed? Oh, I see. Yes, for example. And so there would be some kind of drift maybe, but were those kinds of orders, they are not really orders, but studied somewhere, or do you think it would be pertinent to study them? Pertinent to study them? Oh, sorry, I don't think I quite understood the question. You're talking about another hopping, another hopping? So if you said instead of I less than J, you said something like I minus J is between zero and n on two mod n or something. Oh, I see. Oh, I'm not aware of anything like that, but um, that, yeah. Like that, but that, yeah, that sounds very intriguing. So, so maybe making it more restrictive and only if J minus I is at least something. Or, I guess the something could be negative or positive, so it could be more or less restrictive. Is that yes, or modulo n, that was the. That was the I mean, that already. I guess the first question to ask is: if you just make all the rates one without any of these parameters at all, do you get anything tractable in that case? It would be interesting to look at. Oh, if the Xi's are one. Well, just make all the Xi's one and all the Yi's zero and ask the question that Luca asked. It's already interesting what models attractable there. Right. Models are attractable there. Right, right, right, right. Yeah, no, that's very interesting. I never thought about something like that. But yeah, that seems cool. Okay, well, there are lots of amazing, magical things going on there. It's take me a while to digest for sure. But if there are no more comments or questions, let's thank Noran very much again. Thank Noran very much again. And we should thank the organizers as well. Thank you very much. Thank you. And thank you to everyone who's been this week. We've had a really marvelous array of talks and so much stimulating stuff. I think it's going to take a long time to digest all the wonderful things we've seen. So thank you to everyone who's spoken and thank you to everyone who's attended as well. To everyone who's attended as well, and yeah, and I think the staff here at Wires also deserve some special thanks for making this possible and a lot of help with both the technical and other aspects of the week. But yeah, I guess execute to everyone who spoke or attended. And hopefully, next time we can see you here in person or somewhere else. Thanks, everyone. I enjoyed it a lot. Yes, I concur. It was really, this would have been the, you know, never mind about COVID, this would have been my week zero, right? Classes are about to start. Zero, right? Classes are about to start for us next week. So it was so useful to have a Zoom option for attending this. It was really great. Speaking of which, I have to go put out a couple of fires. So nice to see all of you, if only virtually. Yes. Nice. I've lost all the vision on my screen somehow. The Zoom has collapsed. The Zoom has collapsed. Maybe I need to leave and come back. We still see you, but I see you as well. And the other participants. I'm just going to leave and return and see if that solves it. Alexander? I don't know if you saw, but I put an article in the chat where these experimentation. Where these experimentations were studied. And you can see pictures, and they are completely understood. Okay. But it's nice because these X classes are coming from many different models, not just the one that they mentioned. So thanks for the email you sent, by the way. I'll have to see what's in there and it will take some time. As I mentioned, they are very quick notes, so yeah. And the idea of using some kind of combined entropy certainly would be the right kind of approach for this mixed singular and irregular permutants. I'm just going to butt in and say, say, cheerio to everyone. Cheers, Omer. Hope to catch up with you properly soon. Omer, hope to catch up with you properly soon. Yes, yes. Yeah, we should all try to maybe catch also Ande at some point. Yep, let's and maybe Giddy, we can all we can resurrect our Giddy as well. Yes, so there's some interesting news on the BML model, by the way, to at least two of you. Oh, not not rigorous, but experimental. Oh, okay. I'm all ears, but not right now. I have to run. But Anda, thank you so much. I have to run. But Andre, thank you so much for your talk as well. It's, I mean, I've seen the I've seen those ideas before, but it's but you haven't seen that bit, right? The the last bit with the right, indeed. No, there's a I sort of I wish I had. I mean, I think you've mentioned you've mentioned it to me in verbally, but yeah, it's wonderful. Okay, I'll leave you guys to it. See you soon. I'll leave you guys to it. See you soon. I think we'd love to go back to go get lunch, but uh, I'm gonna go bye everyone. Bye.
