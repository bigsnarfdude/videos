Thank you very much, Jesko. I hope you still have energy to follow this talk. This is joint work with three people with Frank German. There's also something coming up there at the bottom here. Yeah. Something else wrong here, but we have this before you stop. Yeah. Are you more familiar with the methodologies? Okay, um joint work with Frank William, Slava Popkov, and Shin Zhang. And That was better. Yeah, so I was missing this line. Okay, so the title of the talk has been mentioned. It's about a new basis for qubits or multi-qubit systems, and we are not using the usual computational basis where we have spin up, spin down. On each side, but we use different local states. And we change the choice, I mean, we have a different choice for local basis states from side to side. And this is highly useful in the case of the study of spin helix decay in XZ Hamiltonians, in particular with explicit results for the XXK, for the free fermion. The XX case, for the free fermion case. But free fermion does not mean that everything is trivial. And for that, I mean, to convince you about that, I give you a short history of the study of correlation functions and especially of correlation functions in the XX so-called free Fermi case. Okay, I'm going into some details in case of longitudinal correlations and I will shortly. And I will shortly use some classic results and optimal results on high temperature asymptotics, also transverse correlation functions at any fixed space time point. What we are interested in is the explanation or prediction of results of recent, relatively recent quantum spin chain experiments in full atom realizations. Atom realizations. And the experimentalists at MIT, Gibson, and others in the Katili group were interested in quantum control in search for new forms of quantum matter. And they constructed or realized stationary states with long-range order, stationary states that are not equilibrium states, states that are sitting somewhere in the energy. Are sitting somewhere in the energy spectrum, but truly through ion states and have long range order, and in particular long-range order of chiral type. Okay, for doing calculations for such systems, we can in principle use the beta anzats or beta anzats expressions for the x x z. For the XXZ chain, and from the previous thought you may have infinite already that although expressions exist, and Frank also talked about that on the first day, I mean expressions exist but are difficult to work out and to do all the integrals. But for the XX case, the free filming case, we found A way to do the calculations by use of the chiral basis and managed to calculate the spin helix decay for the case of the xx quantum spin chain. Not yet for the xz chain, but at least for the xx. Now, what we did when developing this chiral basis, or this alternative basis, is Is, I mean, we were rather excited, and only after doing the calculation we realized that we had rediscovered Baxter's work on the XYZ chain, the beta ansatz for this very complicated system which does not have any one symmetry. So when you try to write down beta anzats, eigenstate for the XYZ chain, you discover that any magnetic... That any magnetization, I mean, you cannot use fixed magnetization and therefore you do not have effective particles. So, you cannot restrict yourself to a fixed particle sector. But in Bexter's work, okay, hardly ever anybody has read Bexter's work in the 70s because, I mean, it's full of law that this work is so difficult, more difficult than what we get to read in Baxter's textbook on the To read in Bexler's textbook on the eight vertex model, that nobody dared to use this work. And I think the universal attitude was we have to keep a healthy distance to that work. But what we discovered is the work is not so difficult and it can be used in practical calculations. Okay, so that's a comment on Bexter's work. He had to use this card basis or actually even more. Actually, an even more general version of the chiral basis to write down beta Anzatz states for this XYZ Hamiltonian. So in this context, the spin helices are unavoidable. In our calculations for the XX chain, where we have the U1 symmetry, magnetization is conserved, and we have a symmetry with respect to rotations around the Z-axis, we can, in principle, use a Z-base. We can, in principle, use the Z basis, but the chiral basis turned out to be much more useful. It simplifies calculations. Okay, so this is the Hamiltonian I'm talking about. I think it has been shown a couple of times. Delta is the anisotropic parameter. Very soon I will set delta equal to zone. Delta in the practical calculations. Practical calculations that I'm showing to you later is equal to zero. But in the experiments by the catalytic group, delta has been chosen zero and non-zero within the critical regime, but also outside. Okay, in general, our mission is, and the theorist's mission is to calculate these correlation functions, the Z correlation functions, the transversal correlation functions for arbitrary spatial. Functions for arbitrary spatial distance of the two spin operators, an arbitrary time difference at arbitrary temperature, and possibly also for arbitrary magnetic field in equilibrium. Now, the state of the art is rather depressing. Finite temperature dynamical correlation functions are largely unknown, and the partial exception is the XX model. One example is the longitudinal two. The longitudinal two-prime correlation function of the XX model, sigma Z, sigma Z for arbitrary distance and arbitrary time separation. And of course here the free Fermi techniques are really useful because you can write sigma Z as psi dag up psi and then you do the usual free Fermi techniques, your Clavix theorem, and then you chop down the correlation function of sigma Z sigma Z type to a product of To a product of a single particle Green's function, the single particle Green's function has this characteristic form. These are integrals about momentum. And in the exponent, there appear the spatial coordinate R, the momentum value variable, and minus T, that's the time difference, times the energy of this fermion, this momentum t. And in the denominator, we have one class exponential. We have one class exponential of the energy divided by temperature. I'd like to comment one thing for two coins. So here. So you got the same formula by performing all what you showed analytically in that case. So that is the second paper. So you can calculate all matrix elements, sum up everything. It is something very simple. You will have a second chance for having this comment. I will show something. Okay, so this is. Um okay, so this is a classic formula. And this is also a side of result, a spin-off. So it's also a spin-off of some other approach. Maybe that's what you want. Yeah, different. Okay. So yeah, by use of the quantum transfer matrix, indeed. So here is this formula evaluated for fixed, so for fixed spatial distance are. Spatial distance R equals 12 for some given temperature T, magnetic field, and overall coupling strength J as a function of time. And just look at the solid black line and you see some non-trivial behavior. I don't want to comment about the colored dots. These are results of evaluating the integrals by settle-point techniques. If you do it completely numerically without any approximation, Any approximation, then you get the solid, the black solid line. Okay, so these integrals give the full result. And the implication of this Niemeyer's formula, which is to say, everybody's results in these days, because of Freyferman techniques and theorem, gives us non-trivial. A non-trivial function even for temperature infinity. So you see what the integral that I showed to you before with this denominator at infinite temperature has just the numerator. And then the integrals of the exponentials, where the exponential, the cosine function of momentum at Ps gives us, these integrals give us the Bessel functions. So here are the So here are the simplification, but still with a non-trivial Bessel function of type R, the spatial coordinate enters as the index of the Bessel function, and the time and type enters as a continuous argument in the Bessel function. So at infinite temperature, this time dependence is still non-trivial, and the non-time asymptotics is 1 over r. So you see here. Is 1 over r. So you see, even at infinite temperature, these quantum spin systems show non-trivial time correlation functions. Okay, that is the result of the ZZ correlation functions. What about transversal correlation functions? Something like sigma, sigma plus, or sigma x, sigma x. The same spatial, so now we do not have much for the transversal cost. Not have much for the transversal correlation function. If we keep the special coordinate fixed and we just introduce time, then at infinite temperature, Brandt and Jacobi showed many years ago that the time dependence is a Gaussian. There exists also results for such nearby autocorrelation functions. I mean, for autocorrelation function means you're Correlation function means you're sitting at the same site and you only change the time coordinate. When changing also the spatial coordinate, something is changing and Perk and Capella calculated the case for sigma 1 and sigma 2, sigma 1 and sigma 3. And my dear colleagues Gerlan, Mikosovsky, and Suzuki calculated by different means, different from Burke and Kapel's. different from Berkeley and Capell's means the k sigma 1 sigma 4 and what you see when changing the spatial coordinate is you still have a very non-trivial time dependence but an overall pre-factor appears which is so this is a result in the high temperature limit and here you see j over t to the power 3. 3 is the difference of the coordinates so it means So it means when you go to t to infinity, this result is completely zero, exactly zero. So sigma one, sigma two, at non-zero times, et cetera, et cetera, evaluate to zero. And only in the high temperature expansion, the term of order difference of the spatial coordinates is non-zero. And then, of course, all other higher order terms. All other higher order terms contribute. Okay, so this result, but I mean, this year, in the year 2020, was obtained by use of the beta z for the quantum transfer matrix and the form factor series, and then the analysis of a matrix Weeman-Hilbert problem. Okay, I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk more about the experiments that have been done in Catalyst group. Group. So they create quasi-1-dimensional systems by use of optical lattices. Optical lattices are formed by pairs of laser beams and there are two pairs of strong laser beams where we have deep optical lattices. These optical lattices are cigar-shaped geometries that you can see here visualized. Here are visualized. And then within these one-dimensional geometries, you have softer optical lattice which shows a regular periodic structure with dips in the potential. So that's the points or the wells where atoms can sit. And in these geometries, they feed in lithium-7. CDN, lithium-7 atoms, neutral atoms, of course. And these lithium-7 atoms are bosons. They have a nuclear spin 3 half, an unpaired electron in the electronic hull, 1 half, and 3 half and 1 half coupled to 1 and 2. And actually, it's the total angular momentum 1 with its lowest two states that, so to say, mimic a magnetic space. A magnetic spin one-half. So that's how they construct or they realize the spin one-half XXZ chain and they can perform experiments. The states they are interested in are helix states. So here you see, let's look first at the upper figure or inset. So this is the chain of the Chain of the spins that we are dealing with, what they were dealing with, and they construct, so to say, initial states of the type well, of this type with helical order. So here the helical order is chosen in the symmetry plane, in the xy plane. The symmetry axis in spin space is visualized here by this vector and within this plane. In this plane, you observe the spins, or you look at spins that from side to side show different orientations. I mean, irregular increase by the same amount within the XY plane. These are transversal spin helices. They also investigated longitudinal spin helices where the winding is out of the xy plane. Is out of the xy plane. Here, in this talk, we will focus exclusively on the first type of spin ebysis. Alright, so what do they do? They construct these spin states in the following way. First, they apply a very strong magnetic field. This plane is now the XY. Field. This plane is now the XY plane. So they apply a very strong magnetic field in X direction, which leads to a full polarization of all spins in X direction. Then they introduce an orthogonal magnetic field pointing in that direction, linearly increasing along the chain, and let it act for a certain time. And that leads to precession with. To precession with increasing speed from left to right, and therefore, after a certain time, the spinnings range in this regular fashion from side to side. We have an angle. In this case, the angle is called Q, or Q times A. Describes the rotation from side to side. And then this. And then they switch off the magnetic field and perform experiments. They let the X-exine chain act for a certain time. Then from this, so to say, intermediate state, some relaxed state appears. Then, after letting the X-Z interaction act for a certain time, they do the procedure of this winding in the backward direction, this unwinding, and then the This unwinding, and then they perform the experiment, they perform some optical detection of the order, and that's the way they get the results. And they are shown here. These are results. They call it contrast versus time. Contrast versus time is the expectation value of the one-point correlation function. One-point correlation function in the transversal direction, or within the transversal plane, after a certain time. In this particular set of figures, they have chosen the interaction of the XXZ chain to be zero. What they find is if the state they let the state on which the xx On which the XX chain acts is a fully polarized state, then they observe decay of this order as shown here. So you see, after about two time units, the order decayed to practically zero. For the chiro state with winding given by wave number pi over two, Numbered pi over 2 leading to such an order, they observe also a decay of this order, but on a longer time scale. Actually, this time scale should be at infinity if the experiment would realize perfect X chain and decoupled spin system not feeling the environment. And for the winding number, winding number or wave number q equal to pi we can we see again I mean this corresponds to a plus minus plus minus orientation within the x direction then you see again a decay which is much faster after two time units the order decayed to zero so the qualitative difference or well that you do not really see a qualitative difference but quantitative difference yeah so here's Quantitative difference. So here the decay lives two times longer, but maybe you can also see that here the tail looks different from the tails left and right. So the value of Q equal pi over 2 is special. Can you explain again how the contrast is different? Sorry, the contrast, that's the order. So they look at, so they create this chiral state, perfect chiral state, and they have the X chain act. X chain act, and then some relaxation happens. And then they wind everything back, and then they look at the strength of the ordering in X action. That's what's going on. The contrast. You mean before? Here, this year. Yeah, so they... So they make a photo. Yeah, they make a photo. And everything's rather complicated. They talk about Everything's rather complicated. They talk about a resolvable wave factor. And there are some such terms: resolvable wave factor. One has to look at the papers and read it, I mean, in order to understand the stripes they go. Sorry. The stripes they get paler and they have lost. It's what they observe in the exposure. They see the stripes and they're wet, and they fade out. And then the consciousness, that's what they are. The contour system, but that's what they talk about. But they can choose obviously different resolvable wave factors. And they look at different types of stripes. And so this is something I find a little bit difficult to understand. So they have means to measure this order. And I will show to you calculations, and then you see something which is more intelligible, I think, than these figures. Okay, here, another set. Okay, here another set of experimental results, similar to before, but now they look at not only the xx chain and its dynamics, but also at the, so here delta is equal to zero. In the left figure, delta is one half, and in the right figure, that is minus one half. What is shown is the decay rate. You can calculate easily from these figures the decay rate for pure results. Decay rate for q equals 0, the decay rate for q equals pi over 2. So here they get something finite, but smaller as decay rate in comparison to q equal to 0. And for q equal to pi, they also get a decay rate, and this is shown in this figure. So this is for the Hamiltonian, this late q0. And you see that for wave vector, wave number, q equal to 0, you get some value, and for q equal to pi, or And for Q it will pi almost the same value, and for Q it will pi over to only half of that. You see this in this figure, the decay rate, decay this time rate is shown for data analysis of the figures, the figures that I showed before. Don't ask now about the meaning of the different colours. Maybe we have time at the end. Maybe if we have time at the end, I can comment a little bit about it. So declaring sort of exponential decay? Because I mean, on this figure before. Yeah, exponential decay, yes. But then on the figures, yeah, it didn't look like exponential. But what we find out is the decay, at least for delta equal to zero, is actually exponential. So the lines are just about two lines and it's. They they cannot resort it to large times. So they are restricted to times two, from zero to two in this particular unit. When looking, when working with an XZ chain with delta equal to one half, they can also realize different initial states with different winding wave numbers, and then they find decay rates which show the minimum not at pi. Show the minimum not at pi over 2, but at pi over 3. And for delta equal minus 1/2, this decay rate as a function of q has a minimum at 2 pi over 3. And this follows some expectation that we have that this formula, delta equal cosine gamma or cosine q is known. For the xxz chain, we know there are special wave. We know there are special wave numbers for which the magnons, any new introduced magnon into the system, carries zero energy but finite momentum. And this is called a phantom excitation or the condition for the momentum to order not changing the energy depending on the delta. It's known as The delta is known as phantom condition. And I mean, everybody knows the beta and that's yeah, that's what I what you heard with interest. At least nobody protested when Nathan Andre gave the statement. So then you probably also remember that for the, I mean, for wave number Q or for this value and this uniformizing spectral parameter representation, spectral parameter goes to infinity. Representation parameter goes to infinity. That means the energy that is carried is zero, but momentum can be non-zero. Yeah, anyway, you see here there are special, I mean, you see characteristic minima. And in theory, these minima are not just minima, they take the value of zero. When constructing this helical order and having the xaz Hamiltonian. The XAZ Hamiltonian with delta equal to one-half. If everything is perfect, that's a stationary state. That's an eigenstate sitting somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. It's not a thermal state. It's a stationary state. Sir, can I just ask something? So is this eigenstate special? Is it like a product state? It's a product state. It is of local spin states which rotate from side to side. Which rotate from side to side. So, there exists a very special eigenstate that is the same. It is a simple formula, and formulas like that I will show to you hopefully in the next minutes or something. Okay, this is the experimental result. Now, in formulas, what I said before experimentally they start with They start with a multi-spin state which is fully polarized in X direction. By use of the standard S basis or sigma Z basis, the eigenstates of the sigma X operator take this form 1, 1. This has an eigenvalue plus 1 with respect to the sigma x operator. 1 minus 1 would have the eigenvalue minus 1 for sigma. Minus one for signals. And they start with this product state just by imposing a very strong magnetic field in x direction. And then they apply a magnetic field in that direction, which leads to precession around the z-axis. And they choose a magnetic field which linearly increases. And then this precession. The precession increases in speed from side to side. So there's a linear physical angle which we can write as Q times N. So the magnetic field times the acting time is identical to Q. And Q times N is the angle of precession after this procedure at side N. Okay, so here is written. Maybe I should start from left to right. The final state is identical to the initial state fully polarized times an exponential of the Seeman term. The Seeman term is a sum over index of the spin operator times sigma and z and then times the overall scale q. That's the operator that has to be applied to omega zero. Will be applied to omega 0 to this object, to this tensor product of the 1,1 states. And then, of course, since the basis we have chosen is the eigenbasis of sigma and sigma z, the calculation can be done quickly and easily, and what you get is just a tensor product of such things. Exponential of minus i over 2 times qn. n is the side number of this spin. This spin and exponential of plus i over 2 times q. So that's a spin helic state. If you don't believe it, we can calculate that. We are interested in the expectation value of the sigma operators at side n, so sigma x at side n, sigma y at side n, and sigma z at side n, in this state that is formed. State that is formed after this procedure. And for the calculation, we need to know what the transformation of the sigma n operators with respect to the exponential of I over 2 times phi yields. And of course, these calculations we have taught so many times in our quantum mechanics classes. And the spin rotation and the spin one. Rotation and this will one half, but the corresponding representation of SU2, the one corresponding to the representation in the spin one-half space, is, I mean, one the three Pauli operators is just a classical three-dimensional representation, so to say, the defining representation of SEO3. And therefore, Free. And therefore, these spin operators are transformed with this matrix with the cosine sines acting in the upper left corner. And in the lower right corner, that's just number one. Now, we look at the expectation value of the sigma and x, y, z in the state omega q. We introduce Q. We introduce the definition of omega Q as omega 0 times the exponential of the phi operator left and right. And then we take the exponentials of phi left and right to sigma n, and then we are allowed to replace this by R with the angle Qn applied, I mean, as a three times three number matrix applied to the vector sigma n x y z. And then we get And then we get this object here. So the 3 times 3 matrix is on the left, and on the right is just a number vector, a 3 tuple, which is the object above the expectation value of sigma x in the fully polarized state, the expectation value of sigma y in the fully polarized state, and so on. And only for sigma x we have a non-zero value, namely one and the other values also. You insert. You insert one zero zero here, apply this matrix, then you get the vector cosine qn, sine qn, and so on. And this is what you would measure when you take this omega Q state and measure the spin at side n. There you see this helix. Okay, what are we interested in? We are interested in the changes of the this. Of this one-point function upon the dynamics induced by the x-axis amplitude. And we look at this object. We look at the time-dependent sigma n operator, so sigma nx, yz at time t, and we want to take the expectation value with respect to the omega q state. This is a function that depends on. A function that depends on three parameters or coordinates independently. There is a special coordinate n, the time t, and the winding number q, or the winding wave vector q. So that gives a function, a three-component function, or a vector field depending on n, t, and q. But for the xx Hamiltonian, we find X Hamiltonian, we find that this function, depending on by definition, on three arguments, is much simpler. There is a very simple term, which I comment in the next step. This is a free matrix applied to S the spin expectation value for site zero wave. Wave number zero and time, renormalize time, so to say, time t times cosine q. So this is the number cosine of q times t. So the t is not to be thought of part of the argument. So it means somehow, and I want to show to you how this works, this three parameter function reduces to a one parameter function where the time enters with the Enter the with a factor cosine of q. The first factor is, well, what appeared before. It's rotation around the z-axis with angle q times n, and this 3 times the way matrix is written here. And it gets even easier. This function with spatial coordinate 0, time t and wave vector. And wave vector, wave number cubic reservoir, has just one component, namely the first one, and then with the value s of t, s of t can still be system size dependent, and the y and z components also. And in total we find this is to be calculated function s of cosine of q times t times this vector cosine q n, sine q n zone. Cosine Qn, sine Qn, zone. So that's what I want to show to you how this works. And in the second step, I'm going to calculate this function as of cosine Q Tempski. What you already see here is if Q is, so in general, for arbitrary Q, there is a time dependence. But for Q equal pi over 2, cosine pi over 2 is zero, and then there's no decay. So that's absolutely compatible. So that's absolutely compatible with what I told you before: that for the proper matching of the chiral wave vector with the anisotropy of the XZ Hamiltonian leads to a stationary state. That's what you see here. This is exactly. The proof comes now. Here is the Hamiltonian, the X Hamiltonian, written in the normal. Written in the normal way, here slightly blown up for later use. So, why can I write it in this way? You have a sigma vector, three tuple column vector, and this sigma n transpose is a row vector. And multiplied from the left and the right to this vector 3 matrix is what's in the in the left part of this equation. In the left part of this equation. Now, what are we interested in? We are interested in the sigma n operators, so at side n, this time t, and evaluated in the state omega q. I colored these components differently, and I'm just replacing everything on the left-hand side by the definition. Omega q is omega zero times the exponential of phi. zero times the exponential of phi. This omega q in the similar way exponential of phi, times omega zero. And the time-dependent sigma n operator is identical to the product of these blue things. Sigma n in the middle, exponential of ith on the left, exponential of minus ith on the right. And the black things here are just identities. So I just, I mean, nothing has happened. Now I regret. Nothing has happened. Now I regroup everything slightly differently. Let's look at the exponential of i th with the exponentials of phi and minus phi to the left and to the right. That can be written as the exponential of some transformed Hamiltonian that I call h tilde and h tilde is just h with exponential of phi minus phi on the left and on the right. Just bookkeeping. And then remain. And then remains exponential of I phi times sigma n times exponential of minus I phi. And this is something that we can replace by the three times the free number matrix R of Qn applied to sigma n. And that's what we now put together. What is H tilde? H tilde, this is the definition, is that H with exponentials. With exponentials of plus or minus 5 from the left and on the right. Now, when doing that, you see these exponentials only apply to sigma n and sigma n plus 1. And we can use this transformation formula, that these exponentials lead to an 3 and spray number matrix with different rotation angles applied as a number matrix to the 3 tuple sigma n. Okay, that's what we. Okay, that's what we insert here, and then we here on the left is sigma n, so the angle of rotation is q times n. Here we have a sigma n plus 1, therefore an r with rotation angle q times n plus 1 applies. And in the final step, we take these r's, r transposed from the left to the 3 times 3 matrix 1. left to the three times three matrix one one zero in the middle and this r of q n plus one let act from the right and and then we do a simple calculation actually the only non-trivial action of these matrices is in the two times two subspace and there we are dealing with rotations about with angle well minus qn and plus q times n plus one and they annihilate and what remains And they annihilate, and what remains is a rotation with an angle q. That's why we have here cosine sines of q. And then you rewrite this matrix notation and standard notation, and you discover that the diagonal elements give you the same Hamiltonian as before, this prefactor cosine q. And the off-diagonal elements give you the spin current of the x-ax Hamiltonian. So what we can So, what we can, yeah, so that's what we use. The transform H tl, the transform H Hamiltonian is the old H Hamiltonian times cosmic Q, and then comes the current J. Now, time passes by quickly, and so what we do is, I mean, this is what we're interested in: Sigma N, time-dependent sandwich, which means Sandwich between omega Q and omega Q. Then we have seen the intermediate state of this formula as omega zone, left and right. And in the middle we have the exponential of H tilde, the 3 times 3 matrix, partition matrix with angle Qn applied to sigma n, and then exponential of minus H tilde. Now we replace H tilde by H and J, the current. This is what happens for. This is what happens from this line to the next line. Now, J and H commute, so you can take this exponential apart in two factors. Then you act with exponential of J onto the omega zero state, but J takes omega zero as eigenstate with eigenvalue zero, so you draw that. Therefore, we have only omega zero and left and right, and in the middle we have exponential of eigenvalue. middle we have exponential of I t cosine Q times H then this rotation matrix applied to sigma n and again exponential of minus IT cosine Q times H and that is in what we yeah here you can take out the Freedom 3 transformation matrix out of the expectation value of the sigma n operate I Operate, so the exponential of h minus h applied to sigma n give us the time-dependent sigma n operators. But not with time t, but cosine q times t. Okay, so that's how this formula is found that I showed you before. So elementary massaging with spin one-half objects and representations of SU2 in the spin one half. Of SU2 in the spin one-half space and in the three-dimensional space. Okay. But things become more complicated forget to see. Somewhere this simple argument breaks down. Yeah, the simple argument breaks down, and what H and J do not commute in that case. Everything is more complicated, especially when calculating the overlaps. So xx is special. So J is not a conserved quantity for the general XXZ case. And this is one of the troubles that. Case and this is one of the troubles that the spin transport is so difficult to analyze. And so we are using delta V so. Okay, what are the basis states that we are using? Here they are. We take tensor products of independent single side states and on the odd indexed sites 1, 3, 5, and so on, we use eigenstates. on we use eigenstates of the sigma x operator either 1 1 or 1 minus 1 and on the even indexed sides we use eigenstates of sigma y so 1 minus i or 1 plus i and when you look at these products you realize that at each link when you I mean when you look at the the neighbors of eigenstates in x and in y direction. In x and in y direction, then the polarization changes either by angle plus pi over 2 or minus pi over 2. Go from an eigenstate in x direction to the y direction, you have to rotate by pi over 2, either plus or minus sign, etc. We consider the following states, reference states, the perfect spin helix states, plus and minus. Plus and minus. The plus state is a product of this form. We start with site 1, a single spin state pointing into plus x direction, and then we have rotation by plus pi over 2. Then we go to side 2, then we go to side 3 again, plus pi over 2. So we have rotation in an anti-clockwise manner. And the state minus is just, I mean, it starts with an eyeing state at side one in minus x direction. And then from side to side, we again rotate by plus pi over two. This is a definition of plus and minus. And then all other states that appear in this list can be understood as sequences of just plus pi over two rotations, possibly interrupted by minus pi. Interrupted by minus pi over two rotations, and the link where this happens is considered a kink, a misfit. And what you maybe not directly see is the action of the XX Hamilton on these states preserves the number of kings. So these misfits move, but the total number of the misfits is conserved. And these kings can be used as elementary particles. Elementary particles, and we can set up kind of data hazards for actually referring ion state construction on the basis of these particles, the kinks. And yeah, okay, I should go quickly. So this, maybe just for the notation. These products of the fine zeta states I call now kappa, semicolon X, where single colon X, where kappa is plus or minus, meaning that on the first side the single spin state points into the polarization points into plus x direction or minus x direction. And then we have kings at positions capital X, where capital X, the collection of coordinates X1, X2, Xn, where the individual kings are sitting. We work with something like that and these basis. And this basis is called a current basis, it has topological properties. Now, let me quickly flap the eigenstates of the XX Hamiltonian. They look somewhat like the usual eigenstate, the Slater determinant appears, which is a determinant of matrix elements, which are exponentials of I times a single particle moment. A single particle momentum, thank you, Pj times the coordinate xk. So we worked with that, and this later determinant is multiplied to these basis states, kappa equal 1 and kings at position x, or kappa equal minus 1, and kings at position x. So one has to work with that. And it's possible. It's possible. One of the great properties of the base of these states is that, well, we are interested in the evaluation of sigma1 x operator in the omega sigma 1x after time dependence and in the state of In the state omega 0. Anyway, sigma 1x applied to these basis states is just plus or minus 1 times the basis state, depending on the parameter kappa. And that leads to the fact that the sigma 1x operator sandwiched between basis states of the type that I showed before is 0 if the number of states. Therefore, if the number of kings left and right don't agree, because sigma 1x in this sandwiching procedure can be dropped and just a plus-minus significance. And the basis states are also. Now, using that and inserting a complete set of states two times in the definition of the time dependence of Sn of T leads to such a formula, form factor expansion. And here, And here, in principle, a fourfold summation should have occurred. The sum over M and M prime, and a double sum over P's and Qs. But because of this rule, only the same number M of kings appears in the ion states on the left and on the right of the sigma and X operator. Okay, when using that and other properties, then we get. Then we get what we also find is that the scalar product of the eigenstates of the analyton in this basis, eigenstates scalar multiplied with the omega-Zomo state, are given by a determinant of a matrix with elements given here. And the matrix element of sigma 1x is another determinant of a matrix with matrix elements given here. And these matrices are fundamental and Cauchy type. Matrices of Fendermund and Cauchy type. Massaging this further on, we can reduce the threefold summation to a determinant of, so we are interested in this S of T, and this is given in terms of the determinant of a matrix, where in the matrix, a double sum appears. Yet another formulation is for the thermodynamic limit of system size to infinity. Besides the infinity, the infinite determinant representation. There we have matrix elements k sub mn given in terms of Bessel functions. And this matrix K or matrix elements K sub M N appear in a definition of two other matrices, A plus minus, and the interesting correlation function S. interesting correlation function s of t, the limit of s n of t and n to infinity limit, is given by the product of the determinants of the two matrices a plus and n minus. Okay, so this formulation is highly efficient and here are the evaluations on a classical computer of very finite computation times. You see here the evaluation of the foundation is a phi, the terminal phi formula for different system sizes. Formula for different system sizes and for the thermodynamic limit. And here on the right-hand side, you see, okay, also N appears and SN, but the very, yeah, so the color code refers partially to finite size and partially to the infinite size formulation with finite truncation of the infinite matrix. You see, if you truncate after maybe, I don't know, I mean, 50. I mean, 50, the infinite times infinite matrix, the 50 times 50 matrix, you get practically a straight line. In the beginning, you see some curvature that looks like, I mean, close to time equals, it looks like a parabola, but then, and this is a log linear plot. Anyway, so we can evaluate that and we can refer to compare with the experimental results. And in the long time limit, In the long time limit, we get this semi in our, how can I say, numerical analytical expression. The long time asymptotics is given by some constant times the exponential of, and we absolutely show that these numbers are exact exponential of minus eight over pi times t. So that is the behavior that you see here in the long time limit. Well, you see a straight line. Well, you see a straight line. I mean, we don't need a ruler for that. Okay, so then the spinelic decay rate is given by, I mean, found by substituting T by cosine Q times T, and then you see we get the product 8 over pi times absolute value of cosine Q. And this is plotted here, and this is absolutely comparable and satisfactory, satisfactorily factorily comparable. So as expected in experimental work. Okay, here's a summary of what I have shown to you, but with regard to the time constraint, I stop here. Thank you very much for your interest. Thank you. So you showed that the one-point function, you showed that the one-point function behaves in a very simple way. That's the one-point function. So it doesn't hold for two-point and three-point. We have not uh looked at two-point functions on mind um So we start, I mean, this is out of equilibrium. We have an initial state and then we let it some extra liberate or whatever. So it breaks the symmetry, then we have restoration of symmetry and in the process of course build up of entanglement, but entanglement unfortunately. And so that's what we study. And looking at this process of relaxation also, it's a two-point function with the two-point function. A two-point function that would be something that nobody else did before. This is a full quench situation. So the crunch is calculated with all times. So since it's a true crunch, you have a double summation on the for the one point function. So the one-point function is in the picture there. We calculated the one-point function because the experiment doing the experiment they are measuring the one-point functions one-to-one is the catalog of each year. But maybe we could also calculate two-point functions. I mean, maybe we can ask two-point corrections. Two-point type, but different positions. I think in this case the log is possible because Because we are just dealing with determinants, but now we would have to put some kind of non-trivial. If you look at it and think of it, you have this complicated sum of four fifty-person kernels, and you have what is I mean I wonder why you start with the determinant and Why you start with the determinant and then that's one and two. So there are many variables occurring, and it's a non-trivial thing. It is quite. Sorry, I corrected about type and so on. It's a very interesting object, actually. And the amazing thing is that it's very super efficient. And calculation you can go to times of what was shown here. What was shown there? I don't know if we can show, but t equals, say, 60, 70, then the sizes are 10 to the minus. I mean, the value is 10 to the minus 70, but you can get it 16 degrees using Mathematica on my laptop computer. Of course, this is irregularly efficient. What can be done?
