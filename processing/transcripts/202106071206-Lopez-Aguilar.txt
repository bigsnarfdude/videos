production of this kind of phenomena experimentally happening of a worm like micelles, which I would like to kind of understand to describe the flow pass sphere benchmark geometry that I'm using. Then after the constitutive equation, I use the VMP plus model, a model parent of the Vautisa Monero models that we proposed lately. The numerical scheme that we use and stabilization techniques for what we are doing. For what we are doing. Then, after we go to flow-pastosphere results on a viscoelastic regime, in which we analyze the phenomenology behind the sphere, and then after a plastic regime, in which we try to understand what yield fronts with elasticity look like for this kind of models. Finally, to get to the conclusions. Then, a little bit of an intro for this kind of model. Bit of an intro for these kinds of ideas that we are familiar with. Sorry for that. There we are. Here we have some experiments, really nice experiments done by groups of Andrew Belmonte some years ago on a sphere falling in a satily material, molybdenum bromide, sodium salicylate solution, in which we see oscillation of the sphere on the falling of the sphere in this fluid. Of the sphere in this fluid. Authors in that paper say that this oscillation might be due to some construction and destruction of structures in the extensional and shield formations happening near the wake of the sphere. There's another nice picture, a group of pictures from Rottenstein showing us how, again, solid sphere falls. Sphere falls doing some oscillations on a worm-like micellar solution, in which we can see some hints of interesting phenomena happening on the wake, basically. Here in some other PIV experiments reported by the same authors, we can see the flow fields in which we can see some hints of a negative wake below the sphere, behind the sphere. So this attracts our attention in order. These attracts our attention in order to try to replicate or at least get some understanding of what's happening in these flows. Here we see also some data from Mueller, Susan Mueller's work on sedimentation of spheres in wall-like micelles as well. She uses a different kind of micellar solution, but still she does see the same kind of oscillations and the same kind of flow fields through PIV. Passing a little bit on another benchmark, which is a flow past cylinder, we see some biofringing patterns here reported by Rochstein, in which we can see on the wake of the sphere, on the wake of the cylinder, sorry, some interesting phenomena reflecting some extensional phenomena happening in the wake. In another paper with Andrew Belmonte, in which there is a motion of a In which there is a motion of a cylinder through a micellar gel, we can see these different flow phases in which you have a flow phase, a cut phase, and a tear phase for this salty tumatomium bromide solum salicylate solution. So there's quite interesting phenomena happening in the wake of the sphere as well. I'm cylinder, sorry. And finally, some very recent results on rods, flexible rods. Flexible rods staying and remaining fixed on a water-like mice or solution in which the rod interacts with the fluid, developing some oscillation and the formation of the rod and also interesting patterns. So this is the kind of information, experimental information that we would like to start grasping. This is the first time that we go into this flow with this athixotropic micellar constitutive. Micellar constitutive equation. So, the setting that we are using is a flow setting of flow rate increase protocol in which we have a sphere. We only model the half of it. We assume symmetry about the center line of the sphere, about the equator of the sphere, in which we impose a constant velocity fully developed flow in the inlet that we force passing over the sphere to see what was happening. This is obviously contained in. Happening, and this is obviously contained in a tube flow. You can see the flow direction, there are signals. We use our finite volume code for solving this problem, in which we analyze three aspect ratios, one to two, one to two to five, and one to five aspect ratios. The form of the constitutive model is the following. This is the last version of the BMP family of fluids. BMP family of fluids in which we can model several features of world-on-like micellar solutions, particularly shear thinness, strength held and softening, time dependence, physotropy, and flow segregations, either yield stress in a fashion of an apparent yield stress and shear banding as well with a supplemental destruction term. Here you can see the equation in which you have a construction and a destruction term. term evolving this F variable, structure variable that we can relate directly in this model to a dimensionless fluidity. The consequences on modeling of this on simple shear is that we have a continuous simple shear and extension extension or viscosity as you can see in the top figure and also we have a non-linear response in numerous stress difference in shear. This equation plugs in This equation plugs in into all rod type differential equation form. As you can see there, this f functional that we are used to have in this kind of models reflect the exotropic behavior and time-dependent behavior of the model. This equation alongside with the structure equations is solved by the finite volumes. And then the conservation of mass and momentum equations are solved by the finite element strategy in our Strategy in our work. You can see details of these numerics in the paper signal in the corner. And what we do for doing this kind of flows, we use a couple of corrections that we proposed some years ago for stabilizing the system. Basically, we use what we call the AFS-F correction, in which we use basically the absolute values of the various. Variables driving the non-linearity in flow basically for these micellar flows would be the energy dissipated by the flow. So this would give us physicality in the prediction of viscosity. On the other hand, we use what we call the VGR correction, in which we want to avoid the proliferation of noise in the boundaries of the system. For this flow, we impose a shear-free flow in the... As shear-free flow in the center line, we impose some uniaxial extensional type deformation at the same location, just taking care of what's happening behind the sphere, which is uniaxial extensional deformation, basically. And also we enforce mass conservation through this idea because of the geometry. This is a two and a half D axisymmetric geometry which we are working on. In past works, we have In past works, we have gained some success on going to high Weisomer numbers in contraction expansion. As you can see, we started in natural design without any VGR correction in the orders of four micellar flows, in orders of units, and we could reach hundreds when we applied these two corrections. And there's a couple more of examples, for example, EDT going from hundreds to thousands using these techniques. These techniques. Okay, using this and going into the bisphic regime, sorry, we get the BMP plus model comparing three different grades of hardening. We call it no hardening, model hardening, and strong hardening, as you can see. And that is correlated with the peak in extension of viscosity. There are some consequences on the sheer viscosity and the normal stress difference. Basically, the normal stress difference goes. Basically, the normal stress difference goes more elastic, as you can see. We started looking first at what was happening on the sphere for the three aspect ratios we looked at, and we found that for the one to two aspect ratio was the most prominent features arising. So from now on, I'm going to speak on that aspect ratio to try to reflect what is happening precisely behind the sphere. As you can see, in the back faces. See, in the back face of the sphere, there's a local maxima in N1, and it's posed over the center line where extensional deformation prevails. This is attracting our attention, and we are going to do a little bit more of exploration of that feature. Here, looking at what's the effects of the hardening from the no hardening to the moderately hardened fluids with highly concentrated solutions with beta 1 9th and by 1. With beta 1.9 and vice versa 6, we can see that the hardening features promote the appearance and strengthening of this peak behind the sphere. You can see it there in a 3D and a 2D representation where the 2D gives you the location behind the sphere precisely and the 3D gives you the strength of this feature. There, again, Again, making use of this fluidity variable of the BMP model, we try to see if this fluidity variable tells us something about what is happening in the sphere. And behind the sphere, and surprisingly, there is a peak localized again behind the sphere correlating with the location of the peak in normal stress differences. Also, the 2D presentation gives you some. Gives you some hints and some idea of what is happening over the sphere surface. Basically, there is a fluidicized material over it in which we can think of that as the effects of shearing on the sphere. Reflecting on that, here are some data on the drug coefficient dimensionalized with respect to the neurotransmit level, in which the moderate hardenering, the Uh, moderate hardening, the variant with more hardening effects have some drug coefficient larger at intermediate Weisenberg numbers, but the two of them just enter into a plateau for higher Weisenberg numbers. This is reflecting just the attainability of the second Newtonian plateau, which is dominated by viscosity, the shear viscosity. Okay, then. Okay, then looking at what is the bisomber number influence, we can see here for these fluids the comparison between bisomber number one, in which you have a balance between the elasticity and the viscous parts of the flow, in which Weisembernumber just makes this feature more prominent. Feature more prominent, and it rises from, for example, on the right-hand side, on the left-hand side, sorry, it rises from the level of 6.55 to 15, basically. And then when we just increase the Reinmann number, that maxima, that localized maxima, declined again, some 10 units. This is following what the phenomenology in uniaxial extension is proposing. Uniaxial extension is provided by the BMP model. You have a first hardening phase, and then with increasing of the formation, you have a declining strain-softening phenomenon. So this seems to be correlated to the extensional viscosity properties of the model. Interestingly, the fluidity just in the same kind of exercise goes rising with a Weisenberg number. This may seem conjectured. This may seem counterintuitive, but you will see that it is not so. Let's see, for example, what happens if we decrease significantly the solvent fraction to 510 to the minus 3. What is happening is that precisely you have a complex interplay between shearing deformations and extension of the formation on the sphere and on the weight just before the detachment of the fluid from the sphere. From the sphere. There over the sphere, you have the thinning that scales quadratically with the fluidity, and on the center line, you have normal stress in extension, which correlates to extension viscosity and scales differently. Scales basically in an inverse relation with extension of viscosity. That's why the different kind of behavior between the both combinations. Both combinations. Right, so then we wanted to explore further hardening in this kind of flows, but we need to decrease the sodium fraction, the solute fraction component. We needed to do the solution more diluted to beta 0.5. And we are showing here some information with Weisomer number two, particularly bisomer number two for the strong hardening case, the one with the largest peak has. Largest peak has the critical Weisomer number on Weisomer number two. But you can see quite a different behavior across moderate hardening, strong hardening features. Basically, the moderate hardening for this diluted flow, you don't see much of an interaction or anything behind the sphere, but for the strong hardening case, you can see that large red regions reflecting on extensional deformation. So we think that we have. So, we think that we have with this model a lot of extensional contribution to the phenomenology. This reflects again on fluidity. You can see some noise in the strong hardening case, which is, I think, inherited by the proximity of the critical divergence state of this solution. If we look at the drug coefficient, we see that strong hardening just basically resists more. Resists more the flow over the sphere than the modern hard case. Okay, so we wanted to see in this combination what was the positive definiteness and the quality of the solutions in this extreme case. As you can see, we have a two and a half D simulation in which we drop because of this determination. Because of this determinant calculation, the contribution of the feta-feta axis. And we compute the eigenvalues for the subsystem, in which the second eigenvalue, the one in red, is the one prone of getting negative values. If you compare moderate hardening to strong hardening for this weism number two, you can see that moderate hardening retains positive definiteness. S1, the first eigenvalue remains. The eigenvalue remains positive always, but for a strong hardening, you see that some negativity arises and it arises behind the sphere at the same position in which we have the peak on N1 and the peaks on the fluidity. This is attracting our attention, and we are going to look further into details of the flow structure on this work. Then, finally, for this viscoelastic part of the work, we wanted to compare the EPTT non-phytotropic model to the BMP model. We see quite interesting differences. Basically, EPTT with its exponential F-like functionality show F functional really large. We cannot talk about fluidity for Fluidity for EPTT as such. I mean, it's a functional that is a function of the trace of the stress by Simber and the extensibility parameter. But I mean, it goes in the same place as in the Bautista-Monero model on the concentrated equation. So it's kind of a fair comparison. Here, I got to say that the hardening features for these two models are quite the same, matching the peaks in moderate hardening measures. Hardening measures. Here you see a little bit of what is happening in number of stress difference, nothing much really, only BMP retains this localized N1 maxima. But if we go to higher bisomer numbers, bisomber number five, you see that EPTT just gets red everywhere around the spheres, telling us that the extreme thing is happening there. And also, that seems to be. And also, that seems to be painted on the normal stress difference, in which you have patches diluting this maxima for EBT whilst BMP just retains localized N1. Quite interesting feature that we are going to explore more. Then, quickly going past to plastic regime, we here we have the features that the BMP plus model has to model. MP plus model has to model upper and yield stress. As you can see, this is promoted by the decline of beta or the increase of concentration of solute in the model. You have the branching there that seems to be continuous as well in your stress. And we want to use these features of the model to see how yield fronts appear around the sphere. Basically, what we do here is using three different measures for Three different measures for the yielded and unyielded regions. The first one is the classical full Mises criterion, in which the debiotoric stress is taken into its second invariant form and used to be compared with a value that in this case I use just K1 as the yield stress value coming from rheometrical measures. The second one is the second eigenvalue that I use in this paper in 2018. In this paper in 2018, it's basically using the same second invariant, but over the polymeric stress in the system. And recently, Paolo de Sousa, Ronnie Thompson, and their colleagues proposed this kind of measurement using the second invariant. J2 is the second invariant of the diverteric stress, and J3 is the third invariant of the same stress. They use this linear combination through C. Through C, in which C can take the values that you see on the bottom. They say that this may be, they propose that this may be a better measure for digital stress, and we explore the three of them in this work. There you can see the solution for extremely concentrated solutions, worm-like solutions. Two more minutes. Sorry. About to finish. Thanks, ma'am. Here, beta is 10 to the minus 2 extremely concentrated under moderate hardening. Concentrated under moderate hardening features for extension of viscosity. You see in rows the rise in visco elasticity and in columns the different measurements of what I described in the previous slide. What is catching our attention here basically is the asymmetry that we get. It is the same data only measured in different forms for the yield stress. You can see that the fond misses and second environment of stress look very alike. Of stress look very alike. And the one from Sika and Polo Susa and Ronnie is a bit different to what we see for the other two. We need to say that this C value is calculated from the flow curves coming from our models in this combination of beta and moderate hardening features. Okay, now looking at some experimental data from Holocaust. Looking at some experimental data from Holdenberg, 2012, we see that they report some asymmetry about the equator of the sphere descending in a viscoplastic fluid. If you only reverse or you turn the figure 90 degrees, you will see that the asymmetry is kind of alike with what we predict for different kind of measures. This attracting our attention, obviously, you see on the equator of the series. On the equator of the sphere, you see this wrist that the non-fluidicized region is making over the sphere, that it's a little bit off the center for us, and it's basically center for them. And also you see this kind of tail behind the sphere of the decisive material. So we see, we think that this model can, at least qualitatively, so far, represent more or less what is happening. More or less, what is happening with respect to experimental data. Okay, conclusions. We have shown results for flow past spherical wall and mic cells. Basically, we used the BMP plus model to detect a close correlation between the fluidity and normal stress difference behind the sphere, which we think may explain some phenomena like the ones experimental reported of. Of negative weights. We are going to look more into detail into the flow fields. Next, we compare this isotropic BMP plus model with experiment with the independent, time-independent EPTT and found contrasting things. Finally, under the plastic regime, we can qualitatively see some features arising in experiments. On future work, we are going to do some flow patterns. To do some flow patterns and negative weight studies for this kind of thick-oviscolastoplastic flows.
