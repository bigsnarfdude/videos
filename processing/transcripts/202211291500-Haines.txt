So now it's a pleasure to introduce Thomas Haynes from University of Maryland that will talk about has a very set of functional cut with simple chimura varieties. Thank you. Yeah, I'm very happy to be here. Thank you very much for the invitation to speak and to come here, this beautiful place. Okay, so let me. Um okay, so let me get started. Um, is it working? Okay, now fair one okay, so good, so it works. All right, so I'm going to report on some joint work in progress with uh Jingren Shi. All right, and uh, well, this is the outline, so we'll get to what these things are. Um, all right. Well, I'm just going to start with just talking about Shimura data. And this is a somewhat abstract subject, even though it has examples which are concrete. And I'll try to mention some of the more concrete ones as we go. But to start out with the, to define a shimmer data, to define a shimore variety, you start out with some group theoretic data. Group theoretic data. So, one thing is a connected reductive group over Q and also a Hermitian symmetric space of the real points of this group. So, this can be written this way. It's the real points modulo some group K infinity, which is more or less a maximal compact subgroup. And these things, in order to form, I mean, not any old Hermitian symmetric space is a Shimura variety or gives rise to a Shimura variety. But there are certain axioms that have to be satisfied, which I am not going to tell you what they are, but there are some formal axioms. But the most important consequence of the axioms I'll mention in a second. So in particular, what is this set X? It's actually what's a homogeneous space under the real points of the group. But in particular, it can be actually thought of as a GR. As a GR conjugacy class of certain homomorphisms of real groups. So, from this vague restriction of scalars from the multiplicative group, that's something called the Deline torus to the real group. And there's like a GR conjugacy class of such things. And again, they satisfy some axioms. And the important thing about the axioms is that any particular choice of one of these homologous. Particular choice of one of these homomorphisms from the Delene torus into G subar gives rise to a G of C conjugacy class of minuscule co-characters, okay, to the complex, to the complexification of the group. These are sometimes called the Shimura co-characters. And so this minuscule co-characters come with the data, and the fact that they're minuscule is a consequence of the axioms. Consequence of the axioms. And these minuscule co-characters play a big role in the subject in the sense that you often try to define, describe things in terms of this. Anyway, the most basic example of a group and a Hermitian symmetric space that gives rise to a Schmur variety is, well, the group GL2. And the space X is the complex plane minus the real line. So that's the union of the. Real line, so that's the union of the upper and lower half planes, okay. And the in that situation, the uh the Shimura co-character is just the well can be normalized so that it's just the diagonal embedding, it's the diagonal, take sends a complex number Z to the diagonal matrix with Z in the first place and one in the second. And then in a, in a, in a, you know, these co-characters can be for GLN, for example, always indexed by some. example always indexed by some or described by some tuple of integers and in this case the i hope the conventions are clear mu one zero corresponds to this uh co-character with those diagonal entries so the one and the zero give obviously the exponents of the z that appear okay and so now if you have a conjugacy class of co-characters that has a field of definition and the field of definition is just And the field of definition is just naturally given to be some subfield of the complex numbers. In fact, it's a number field. And so this is called the reflex field, this bold E. And then the other parts of the data that you need to define your Schmoovarity is you need a compact open subgroup in the idyllic points of your group. And we let them range over all, well, usually sufficiently small compact open subgroups. And then we just form, we look at this inverse limit as k. This inverse limit as k ranges of these double coset spaces. See if I can use the pointer. Yeah. So these double coset spaces. So you've got the space X and you have this discrete space here, and you just have G of Q acting diagonally on this, and you form the quotient. And you can show that this, I mean, these things are like finite unions of locally symmetric spaces. So these are complex varieties. Well, they're complex manifolds to start. Manifolds to start out with. But then it's a relatively deep theorem that, in fact, each one of these is a quasi-projective variety over this number field E, independent of the group K. So the whole family of these things is defined over the same number field. That's important. And what we're describing here is just the C points of an inverse limit of quasi-projective varieties over E. Of quasi-projective varieties over E. And that is what a Shmur variety is. This is the most general form of a Schmoor variety. In other words, when I talk about the Shmur variety, I mean the actual algebraic varieties over E. And then, well, then there's a lot of, you can discuss about additional structures. Like, for example, maybe there's some integral models of these things over some ring of integers of E, and all those questions. Jersey V and all those questions are important and will play some role. They'll come up in a moment. We're going to abbreviate SH sub K to be the Shamur variety for the level K that we fix. Okay. Okay, great. So now I want to talk about Heke correspondences and Galois actions. So you fix the rational prime L, and we set H upper I to be the direct limit over K of the. The direct limit over k of these etalic cohomology groups. Okay, so those are these ellatic cohomology groups. It doesn't really matter what they are for our purposes, they're just some finite dimensional vector spaces and don't need to know more about them at the moment. But the important thing, and maybe in some sense, the reason why shmor varieties are studied is because this object, each for each eye, naturally carries an action. It naturally carries an action of commuting actions of this group G of AF, the idyllic points of G, which is a locally compact Hausdorff group, and the Galois group, the absolute Galois group of this number field E. Now, the way this works is that the Galois group, it just acts, so to speak, by functoriality. The fact that The fact that a Galois automorphism gives you an automorphism of this variety right here, and that induces an automorphism of the atol cohomology groups by functoriality, then this thing acts by Heke correspondences. So that's why we let the K vary, because if you don't let the K vary, then only a certain Hecke algebra attached to K would act. But if you let the K vary, then you get this infinite dimensional vector space on which this thing acts. On which this thing acts, and it's an admissible representation. Okay, so in fact, the k fixed points of this infinite dimensional representation is just this thing right here, this object that's indexed by k. Now, how do the heck operators work? Well, I'm not going to give the full definition, but just imagine that you had imagine that you had an action, an element hidden here that actually normalized the particular k. Then in that previous Then, in that previous slide, you have this quotient by k on the right. You can just multiply a representative of that coset space on the right by this element since it normalizes k, it just moves inside. That gives you an automorphism of the thing at level k. Now, when g, your element g, does not normalize k, it doesn't act like that, but it's the smallest group of endomorphism, it's the smallest ring of endomorphisms that contains all those automorphisms that I just described. That I just described. Okay? Now, once you have a commuting algebra action, I mean, you have two groups that commute, and now you can just take the isotopical decomposition with respect to one of the groups. So let's say we do it with respect to G sub AF. So let pi sub F range over the irreducible admissible representations of G of AF, and then decompose this alternating sum. So now I'm going to take the alternating sum. So this is a virtual representation. So this is a virtual representation. But I'm going to, in the Groton-D group, I can still do this decomposition. I can let pi sub f range over these irreducibles, and then I can write the thing that you get a finite dimensional vector space paired with each pi sub f, the sigma of pi sub f, which is an act, is a virtual representation of the Scalwa group. And so this gives us a way to move between representation. To move between representations of GAF, which is basically like related to automorphic forms, and Galois representations. So you can see where this subject is going. This is the reason why this subject got off the ground because of this structure. So this map from pi f to sigma pi f is supposed to reflect aspects of the global Langlands correspondence for this global group G. So in So, in some sense, you can upgrade it to give information about actual global language correspondences. It doesn't, in principle, allow you to attack general Galois correspondences, global language correspondences, because not every group gives rise to a Shimur variety. So, this is different from the theory of Schtukas, which was discussed earlier. In the function field world, every reductive group over a global function field gives rise to. Global function field gives rise to a shtuka space, moduli space of shtukas. You can do similar things there. People are doing all sorts of things there. The point is that anything you do in that world can apply in principle to every group, whereas in this world, you're limited. Only certain groups give rise to shimore varieties. But like GL2 does, and unitary groups, and lots of nice groups do give rise to shimore varieties, but not all of them. Like, for example, E8 doesn't give rise to any shimore variety. Doesn't give rise to any small variety. Okay, we also expect the local global compatibility. So roughly, if you have an automorphic representation, it always decomposes. If you have an irreducible admissible representation of GAF, it always decomposes like this. It's an infinite tensor product, but the part away from P, let's just write it this way. So the part at P and the part away from P. And let's assume P is not L. Then yet every one of the irreducible representations. Then yet every one of the irreducible representations here should belong somehow in roughly. This is a very rough statement. I'm going to give you the precise statement in a moment, but it should roughly correspond to the local L packet that you get by taking this global Galois representation and just restricting it to the local V group. Okay? And that's when, well, when the prime in the ring of integers is something that divides little p. Okay, so this is not the correct statement. I'm going to get to the correct statement in a moment. Get to the correct statement in a moment. But the first step, what this leads you to do is the first step in trying to understand this story, is trying to understand this virtual representation here, but restricted to just look at this group of GAF cross just the local V group. Just try to understand that representation. And if you understand that for all the local V group, that's that's. Local v group, that's sort of like almost enough to recover information about this thing up here. Okay, so now let's do some abbreviation. So regular G is going to be bold G, just base change to QP. There's the local reflex field, E. There's the versions of the local L groups that I'll be talking about. So these are, we take the Langlands dual over. Are we take the Langlands dual over QL bar and we take the semi-direct product with the appropriate V group that acts on those things? The Shimura co-character, of course, starts out as a co-character over C, but you can just choose some isomorphism between C and Q P bar, just make a choice, and then transfer it over to giving you some conjugacy classes, co-characters over the p-adic field. These are geometrics, though, right? They're not defined. Geometrics, though, right? They're not defined necessarily over Qp, they're only over Qp bar, but they give each one of these choices gives rise to an algebraic representation of the L group. Namely, you can, so the important thing is that mu is a co-character of G, which of course it lands inside some maximal torus of G, and therefore it's a co-character of that torus, and therefore it's a character of the dual torus. The dual torus is a maximal torus. The dual torus is a maximal torus in the dual group, so it gives rise to a highest weight representation of g hat. And then there's a canonical way to extend that to actually give you a representation on the whole L group. In other words, you have to sort of pin down how the V group acts on there, but there's a canonical way to do that. Okay, so we're just going to consider these representations of the L group. And the target theorem is the following. So, this target theorem, of course, there's a much broader story for all Schumer varieties. I'm only talking about, in this case, very special ones. But for what I call nice unitary Schumo varieties, which are otherwise known as the simple Kotwitz-type Schumer varieties, which have the condition, they have the property that they're compact, they're actually projective varieties, and they have no global endoscopy, which I'm not going to say what that means, but just means things are simpler. simpler. We have an isomorphism of we want that we have an isomorphism of virtual modules. So here we're looking at a group that's almost the group that I was interested in before. I have the local vague group, but now I have almost the idyll points of G, but I'm actually slightly smaller. But I'm looking at the action of this thing on this and I'm saying I can describe it explicitly. Well, so you sum over all these irreducible representations of GAF and then you And then you write that across a certain Galois representation, and the Galois representation is given the following way. You take the local Langlands parameter, the semi-simple local Langlands parameter. I'm going to say this in a second. It's the next part. You take the semi-simple local Langlands parameter attached to pi sub p, you compose that with the representation of the L group. That gives you an action of, that gives you a representation of the local V group. You take that representation of the local V group. Representation of the local vague group, you twist it by one of these characters, this absolute value in the local v group to some power, and then you get something which is of the right form. It's the representation of the GAF cross-tensored with a Galois representation. It's virtual because these multiplicities are virtual. These are defined by Kautwitz, and I'm not going to go into what they are, but they're just some integers. Okay? And this is what we want to prove. We want to prove. And by the way, the K0 subp, well, that's going to be fixed like once and for all, but for us, it's, I mean, it's going to be a perihoric as become clear why we want to choose it to be a perihoric and not just say, because at P, in general, our group will not have a hyperspecial model. Okay, so I'm allowing the group at P to not be quasi-split even. not be quasi-split even so i i can't take just like a smooth model a hyper like a like a reductive model of the group and just plug in the zp points i have to actually do something a little smaller but nevertheless it's not a very big limitation um it gives you a lot of information so this is what we want to prove i should say the statement makes sense for almost any i mean there's versions of this for almost any shimmer variety In the old days, meaning before a few years ago, one could not say this semi-simple local Langens parameter would be conditional, but now we know these things exist because of Farg-Schulzen. Okay, so now this kind of conjecture can be made in general. In the situation that I'm going to be dealing with, the group at P is special enough so that we already knew the local Langens correspondence for those. Correspondence for those. Okay. Anyway, so that's what we want to prove. And if you know that, the corollary, the immediate corollary, it's immediate, like if you're in the subject, it's immediate. Once you know that description of the cohomology, you can recover the information about the local Haseve Zeta function. So I'm not really going to define that, but it's just something that, like in many cases, if you have a variety over a finite field that's a nice smooth variety, the zeta function is the general. The zeta function is the generating function that controls the number of rational points over all the finite extensions of the field you're looking at. If you look at a particular place, you could be trying to take the reduction of your Schimor variety modulo that prime and counting the points in some form. But that doesn't always make sense because you might not have an integral model, or if you'd have an integral model, you might not have a smooth integral model. So the correct definition of the Hase-Wezezeta function is a cohomological one. Function is a comological one, and it's uh, but there is a correct one, and then, but the problem with the correct one is that in order to prove anything about it, we need to know the weight monodromy conjecture, which we do not know in hardly any Shimur varieties. Okay, so what you have to do instead is you have to make a statement about these things called semi-simple Hase-Vei-Zeta functions, which are substitutes for Hase-Vei-Zeta functions meant to account for the To account for the fact that we don't know the weight monodroming conjecture. And on the other side, you have to put semi-simple automorphic L functions. Now, you might complain that we don't know what automorphic L functions are in general. I mean, for a general group and a general representation, this is a local thing, right? So, this is a local representation of a p-ada group. This is some representation of the L group. This is some complex number here. You could argue we don't know what. You could argue we don't know what that is, but actually, we do know what it is now. Again, because of Farg-Schulze, we know how to define unconditionally local semi-simple local L functions for every representation of every group. Okay, so this is not a conditional thing. This is unconditional. But this theorem would follow formally from the thing that I stated on the previous slide. Okay. So let me say a word about what these. So, let me say a word about what these Kotwitz simple Shimur varieties are. So, before I tell you any of the data, the word simple Shmur varieties is named, I mean, Kotwitz didn't name them Kotwitz simple Shmoor varieties. He just wrote a paper about certain Shmoor varieties, which turned out to be very important. And they were simple in the sense that they were compact and had no global endoscopy. And the basic, there's only one source of those that I'm aware of, and they come from these things called fake unitary groups. So, to define a fake unitary group, you need So, to define a fake unitary group, you need a CM field. So, the F is the CM field, F plus is the maximal totally real subfield. D and star is a central division algebra over F of rank n squared with an involution of the second type on it. And then you can define from that a kind of unitary group. You think of the star as like conjugate transpose, and you take the normal definition of unitary group. Okay, so that group. Uh, so that group is a reductive group over Q. Um, well, sometimes for whatever reason, we call them faked unitary groups because in some sense, the group, the more natural thing maybe would take some, you know, some instead of the D, you would have some n by n matrices over some over F or something, and you have star would be actual conjugate transpose. But since we're dealing with the division algebra, But since we're dealing with the division algebra, which is important to make it projective and to have no global endoscopy, sometimes we call it fake. Anyway, this is what's called a PEL-type Shimur variety. So it's in this family of Shimur varieties, that's the ones that are the most concrete. If your group at P is K sub P is a periohoric, then this Shimura variety has an integral model over O sub B, and it's a moduli space of abelian. And it's a moduli space of abelian schemes with some additional structure. So, the way this right here means that, well, to define a perihoric in these classical groups means to give a certain chain of lattices in some space. And corresponding to this chain of lattices, we'd have a chain of abelian schemes with principal polarization, maybe some endomorphism structure. So, P stands for polarization, endomorphism, and level. And this eta upper P is a level structure away from. A is a level structure away from P. It's a K upper P level structure. So the endomorphism structure is just means that O sub D, some order inside D, acts on A and it satisfies some technical condition called the determinant condition. And A to upper P is a K upper P level structure. Anyway, the point is, you can specify this moduli problem. It makes sense over the ring of integers. If you then pass to the generic fiber, you just get the original thing that we The original thing that we started with. Okay, okay, some history. So, the target theorem was proved by Kotwitz in the good reduction situation, where the local group G over QP is unramified, and the K0 thing is actually a hyperspecial maximal perihoric subgroup. And all of the pi subp's that appear there would be unramified representations. So, the thing about local language parameters becomes extremely simple, then it's just replaced by the Satake parameters. The Satake parameters. And then, more, then Harris-Taylor, well, in the Harris-Taylor cases, which I won't say, but just some things about them, among other things, the Harris-Taylor cases had that essentially the group at an infinity was a product of a certain unitary group with a certain signature across a bunch of other unitary groups with the signature 0n. And essentially, the co-character is given by this first signature, 1. Is given by this first signature, 1n minus 1. That's the Shamur thing. And the thing at P is a mixture of groups that are like literally split over QP and ones that are literally compact or compact mod center over QP. So this kind of thing. And then later, Schultz and Shin returned to this after some work of Schulze made some advances possible. And they considered, they have a paper where they. Considered, they have a paper where they considered the Cotwood situation, where again, at P, I mean, at infinity, there's no restrictions. The co-character mu can be any minuscule co-character of the group. But we require, they require for various reasons having to do with, well, harmonic analysis mostly, that G is actually a product of A restrictions and GLNs at P. So it's a simple at P, very simple at P. Simple at P, very simple at P. And then a student of Farg Xu Shen, he later also wanted to generalize, in some sense, Schultz's Shin, but he needed to make some assumptions. So he wanted to allow G to not be quasi-split, but rather to be some non-quasi-split groups at P. And so he considered, again, he had to do the Harris-Taylor situation of the signature because Of this signature because and he was dealing with groups at p which were associated to the situation of p-adic uniformization. So those are they're essentially products of units of division algebras with very special invariance, 1 over n or minus 1 over n. And so that the situation at p was required because you wanted to have p-adic uniformization of the Schumur varieties. Okay, and so our result is that the target theorem holds in the Schultz-Schinn situation. Theorem holds in the Schultz-Schinn situation, except that we relax the condition on the group being a product of A restrictions. We allow it to be any inner form of such things. So in some sense, we are generalizing all of these things. Now, I should say that the difference between the Kotwitz result and all of the other results is that all the other results allow arbitrary level at P. So arbitrarily deep level at P, whereas the Kotwitz thing is the good reduction situation, which of course is what. Situation, which of course is what happens at almost all p. If you start with a Shamur variety, for almost all P, it has good reduction. But if you, there's always these finitely many places where bad reduction can occur and where, in particular, the level of the subgroup K could be deep. And as a result, both the Schmoor variety might not have a good reduction, it might not have a good integral model, might not, if it does have an integral model, it would have singularities. And also, the representations that come in could be arbitrarily deep. They could be any. Be any p-adic representation of the group. Okay, so that's our theorem. So, in some sense, we generalize both Scholze-Shin and Shen, but our proof is different from either one. So, in some sense, we recover their proofs again by different methods. Okay, so the way of studying shamarides is always somewhere. Is always somewhere involves counting points in some sense. So we're going to fix a perihoric once and for all at p called k sub p upper zero. And so there's some perihoric group scheme, calligraphic G, which is lurking in the background. And then in that situation for perohoric shimmer varieties, that's been studied by a lot of people over many years, and we know how to understand integral models of such things. And so we have an integral model. Have an integral model in particular in this Kotwit situation, but even much more generally, we have integral models of these Shimoor varieties with when you have perohortic level at P. And when you have a subgroup, K, the subgroup that we might be interested in for the actual Schmoor variety, this might be the one we want to study, but we have to relate it to this one here. Well, there's these natural projection maps in the generic fiber, so there's just a finite atalomorphism like this. Morphism like this. And okay, we'll make use of that later. But from now on, we're going to fix a sufficiently small k of that form where k sub p is just an arbitrarily deep subgroup. And we're going to also have some operators. So there's f upper p, which is something in the hec algebra away from p, and then there's h, which is some kind of like cutoff function. It's in the hec algebra, but only of the para horic. Notice that. See, notice that here we're not allowing all of the QP points of G, but rather only functions which so the functions are supported only on double cosets like that. And then we have a Frobenius operator, just an abbreviation tau for something inside here. This is the inertia subgroup. And r is just some integer which is sufficiently large. And you don't lose any information if you prove. And you don't lose any information if you prove theorems for all sufficiently large R. Okay. So the Groton-Deklefshits. So, in order to understand this cohomology groups, what you need to study is you have this virtual, you have this alternating sum of cohomology groups, and you have some kind of HEC operators, something coming from the Galois group and something coming from the Edalic groups. Okay. And these things operate on the cohomology, and you need to understand these traces. That's basically the problem. The problem. And the Groton-Lefschitz trace formula applied to a Frobenius-Hecke correspondence, that's what this is called, should give a formula for some kind of function that you would plug in at P of the following form. So this I have to pause and say something about because if you haven't seen this before, it looks completely out of left field. So when you're trying to understand the Lefschetz trace formula, you want to sum. You want to sum you're going to what this if things worked well, which they do in at least when j is sufficiently high, this thing should be a sum over fixed points of the correspondence of some local contributions. If your situation was that the heck operator was basically not there and you just had a good reduction situation, meaning this trace on this generic fiber would. On this generic fiber would be the alternating trace of Frobenius on the cohomology of the special fiber. And then, that by the usual trace formula would be counting points over the finite field, points in the finite field that live on the special fiber of the Schmuer variety. That's literally counting points. But here in the more general situation, you would have something where you would still like to somehow relate this to counting points on the special fiber in some sense, but it becomes much more complicated. But it becomes much more complicated because, well, we don't even have an integral model in general. And the other thing is that we certainly don't have a smooth integral model. And but nevertheless, the point is there's a way to pass from this thing to some kind of like fixed points of a Hecca Frobanius on the special fiber. And when you do that, you end up counting over fixed points of the Frobenius-HECA correspondence. If there's some kind of points over. There's some kind of points over some finite field in the special fiber, and then there's some local contribution. Then the local contribution could be quite complicated, but you should think of this roughly as if you're in a good reduction situation, these things roughly would be like counting isogeny classes of abelian varieties over a finite field. And here, these would be the number of fixed points over a fixed finite field that live in a single isogeny class. And when you want to count points. And when you want to count points in isogeny classes, you end up having to use like the p-adic tate module of your abelian variety and also the crystalline coal module or the Doudenet module. And these contribute like the number of certain lattices that live inside a certain rational tape module away from P. And these count the number of certain lattices that live inside the Doudenet module at P. And when you, this right here amounts. And when you, this right here amounts. Oops. Why is it doing that? You shouldn't hold it down or something? Yeah, there's one here, I think. Okay. So if you put like two time fast, then change. But I don't okay. Okay. So these are like volume terms. Anyway. terms anyway so the the formula is should take this form and uh the hard part about the formula or the hardest part about the formula well there's two hard parts there's something called the language rappaport conjecture which is trying to parametrize the isogeny classes roughly and then there's the counting the points inside a given isogeny class which is this this part inside and the hardest part about that is trying to figure out the function here so there should be some function on the group over some unique group On the group over some unramified extension of the base field. So that when you plug it in and you take its twisted orbital integrals, you should count exactly the right local contribution of this Frobenius-Hecca correspondence. Okay, so the hard part is to find a formula like this for some function. But once you find a formula like this, the right-hand side, it looks like the geometric side of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula. Side of the Arthur-Selbert trace formula for the group G. Now it's not in the right form because you see, well, there's all sorts of ways it's not exactly like the Arthur-Selbert trace formula, but it's resembling it. And there's this process called stabilization of this, or sometimes pseudo-stabilization, which is slightly different, which is which in which you massage this into the form where it actually is a sum of stable geometric sides of stable trace formulas for endoscopic groups. And that, then by the Arthur-Solberg trace formula for all those endoscopic groups, Arthur Sophic Traceformer for all those endoscopic groups gives rise to a connection between these cohomology groups here and automorphic representations. Okay, so if you believe that, you might believe that we could prove that Haseve's eta functions are automorphic. Okay, so the goal is to try to prove this and then eventually invoke a lot of other stuff to get to the end point. So about So, about this function phi sub tau h, this is the main thing that occupies interest for the large part. And a lot of people have studied over the years the case when you just look at perihork level. In other words, kp is equal to kp upper zero. And just supposing that h is not really there, just take it to be an idempotent, basically the identity element in the heck algebra corresponding to that. Then this test. To that. Then, this test function is known to be determined by the trace of Frobenius on the nearby cycles of something called a local model. So, in this situation, there is in at this level, there is an integral model, and there's also something called a local model, which is an idea introduced by Rappaport. And the local model is supposed to be something simpler than the integral model of the Schumer variety, which is defined in linear algebra terms. And it turns out that studying the trace of Frobenius on nearby cycles of local models is something that has. Cycles of local models is something that has been done by a lot of people, including people in the geometric language program. And we understand well now that these are, so to speak, give rise to functions in the center of a parahac algebra. Okay, so that motivates some other things. So for deep K sub P, there's no integral model, and there's no local model either. But nevertheless, we still expect to take a But, nevertheless, we still expect to take a function in the stable Bernstein center because of this conjecture, which is normally attributed to me and Kotwitz. So, this is something that's very general. It's not specifically for Kotwitz, simple Schmoor varieties, but for really any Shmur variety whatsoever, there should be a formula like the one I said above, the counting points formula, where at the twisted orbital integral, you plug in the function phi. Orbital integral, you plug in the function phi sub tau h. Well, you should be able to take it to be something very special, something in something we call the, well, something related to the stable Bernstein center, which I'm going to describe in a moment. And so the theorem is to write it this way. I'm going to tell you, this is something in what we call the stable Bernstein center. And then you convolve that in a certain sense, I'll explain, with another function, which whose base change transfer is the function you started out with, H. You started out with H, the cutoff function. I'll have to say more about all of these things, but first of all, this thing about here we're viewing this element as something in the usual Bernstein center for the group over the unramified extension. But it's the image of something we call in the stable Bernstein center. So I have to tell you what these things are and how we can. So one thing I want to say is that. One thing I want to say is that I might say this again, but if you actually have something in the usual Bernstein center of a p-iadic group, there are like at least four different ways to think about the Bernstein center of a p-adic group. One way is certain invariant distributions, which are essentially compact, which means that if you have a distribution, you can convolve it with a compactly supported function. Essentially compact means that when you do that convolution, the result has still got compact support. And so we require, so something in the Bernstein center, something that's Something in the Bernstein center is something that's a g-invariant distribution which is essentially compact. And so it makes sense to consider convolution of this distribution with a function. That pops up a lot of times here. Okay, so now let me do a quick review of what is the stable Bernstein center. So let's just let F be any non-Archimedean local field, G a connected reductive group over F. Let's just, because I don't want to talk about homomorphisms into QL bar, let's just choose an isomorphism with C. She used an isomorphism with C. So the Bernstein variety, what is it? It's a variety structure on the set of supercussible supports. So you have a set of G of F conjugacy classes of pairs, F points of a Levy and supercuspital representation of a Levy. And then you just consider the set and you want to give the set a variety structure. So what you do is you just, you can twist the supercuspital representation of M by any unramified. M by any unramified character of m. So that's what this notation means. And when you do that twist, of course, you know, you just take a conjugacy class, the G-conjugacy class, you can also twist a representative of the G-conjugacy class. When you look at all possible twists, you get the inertial class. But since the inertial class is an orbit under this, and this is a torus over C. So, what happens is you can just say that your inertial class is. The inertial class is a quotient of a torus over C. So it's an algebraic variety. We just give it that structure. So it's an infinite, the Bernstein variety is an infinite disjoint union of tori modulo finite groups. Now the Bernstein center is just the ring of regular functions. That's another way to think of the Bernstein center. Okay. The stable Bernstein center is the variety structure on the G-hat convexy classes of semi-simple Language parameters. Classes of semi-simple Langlands parameters. So from the V group to the L group. These are what Clifton was calling infinitesimal parameters, right? Infinitesimal something, characters. Yeah. Anyway, I'm calling them semi-simple Langens parameters, but they are the same things. What's the variety structure? Well, the analog of being supercuspital, roughly, the appropriate one in this situation is that your parameter. Situation is that your parameter factors minimally through the L group of some levy. In other words, not through any smaller L group of a levy. And if that's the case, then you can twist that by a one-co-cycle with values in the inertia invariance of the center of the dual group. So this thing on the left here, I write it this way as a first cohomology group, but it's really just the coinvariance of this thing here by the action of Frobenius. By the action of Frobenius, and that's some diagonalizable group over C, and then you have to take the connected component to get a torus. And this torus is isomorphic to the other torus. So it turns out that the stabilizers are finite, and so you get an infinite union of tori mod finite groups. The stable Bernstein center is the ring of regular functions on that. That's all it is. But the two things are related. Now, it was conjectured. Related. Now it was conjectured originally by Vogen that they were related. But now, because of this result of Farg-Schulze, they're actually really related. So for every G over F, this is F can be any non-Archimedean local field, there is a semi-simple local Langlands correspondence from pi to phi sub pi, which is compatible with unramified twists, normalized parabolic induction, and which is suitably functorial. When you know those three properties, Three properties, which in my paper I called LLC, then formally you get a natural homomorphism of commutative rings from the stable Bernstein center to the Bernstein center. So this is now a theorem. This is available. In particular, if we start with something that's in the stable Bernstein center, we can take its image and just use the same letter for it in the Bernstein center. And so we can view something in the stable Bernstein center as a distribution. And we can convolve it by. Distribution. You can convolve it by the compactly supported function. Now, how do we get a natural source of stable elements in the stable Bernstein center? If you take a representation of the L group, you can define a function on parameters. How do you define the function on parameters? Well, you take the trace of Frobenius on the parameters composed with the representation, and you can check that this is actually a regular function on the variety of parameters with the definition. On the variety of parameters with the definition I gave. So, this is for every representation of the L group, you get a natural something, you get a natural element of the stable Bernstein center, and therefore you get a natural element in the Bernstein center. The upshot is that that test function conjecture that I wrote before, which was involving some, it was involving, so I didn't explain it, but the representation V that appears here, the one you want to take is the one. Appears here, the one you want to take is the one called V sub minus mu, that highest weight representation. That's the representation of the L group. Take that, take the associated Z to that. And that's what you use to formulate the test function conjecture. And so now the point is when the test function conjecture was originally written down, which was more than 10 years ago, the Farg-Schulze stuff did not exist yet. But it was anticipated that it should exist. And luckily, Should exist, and luckily it now exists. Farg Schulze did exactly what we need. Yeah, so I wanted to say here, they proved exactly what was needed. They actually proved a lot of other properties, but in some ways, these are the most important properties. Okay, now there's also another thing going on here. There's this thing called Schultz test function. So these are independent, totally different from the test functions that Kotwitz and I tried to introduce. Tried to introduce. And so he constructed his own test functions before his paper with Farg in a totally different way. And it comes from deformations of p-divisible groups. And so he had in mind PEL type shamore varieties. And then, so he proved a theorem about these I'm going to tell you. And then later, Alex Jukas made progress extending it to abelian type shimuritis. Extending it to abelian type shimorbitis is a broader class of shimorbitis. But recall that we don't have an integral model at level P, at level K P. And Scholza suggested that the way to understand this problem, understanding these Hecke correspondences on cohomology, is to, you have to have an integral model somewhere. So, what you do is you push down to the level where you have one. For him, he was considering a situation where the group at P was quasi-split and. The group at P was quasi-split, and he even had like an integral and like a hyperspecial level there. So he would consider like a smooth integral model at the base level. But upstairs, you have these kind of more, you have these shamor varieties at deeper level mapping in the generic fiber down to the thing at base level. And upstairs, you do not have an integral model, but downstairs you do. So, what he suggested is that you take the constant, say you take the constant sheaf upstairs on the Schmoor variety's generic fiber. On the Schmuer variety's generic fiber upstairs, you push it down by these finite entomorphisms. You get some local system on the good model downstairs, and then you take the nearby cycles of those things and you study those. But that alone is not, that's an idea, but it's not enough to get you very far. But then he had, he understood what to do after that. So you need to under, then you need to give like a purely local construction of a test function, which he defined as follows. So I want to go through this. This is the little Through this, this is a little bit heavy in a sense, but I want to go through this just to illustrate that the two functions in the world that we're talking about are really completely different. One comes from the theory of the stable Bernstein center and the Bernstein center, and the other one comes from deformations of p-divisible groups. And there is no reason a priori why there should be any relation between these two things. But as we'll see, there is some relation. So, what he does is the following: suppose kappa is a perfect field with characteristic P, and it is also an. And it is also an OEE algebra. And now we consider a chain of p-divisible groups. This chain is supposed to be like reflecting this perihoric thing that we start with. You can just consider a single p-divisible group if you like. A chain of p-divisible groups over this field, this perfect field. And really, we're going to be considering the ones that have this extra structure that's reflecting the PEL data that defines a Shimur variety of PL type, but you don't really need to worry about that. What he considers is the deformation space of this. So, in other words, you have some PL. This. So, in other words, you can you have some p-divisible group over a field, you can consider all possible lifts to that to p-divisible groups over some art and local algebra which has the same residue field. So that's this functor associates to an algebra R with residue field K, kappa, set of isomorphism classes of piezo groups over R, together with an isomorphism of that when you have something over R. When you have something over R, you can then reduce it to give something over kappa, and an isomorphism of that structure with the one you started with. So that's called a deformation of the thing that you started with. And what he proved is that this functor is represented by a complete notarian local OE algebra, R sub H bullet, which has residue field kappa. This is standard in the world of Galois deformations, and this kind of deformation problem comes up a lot. Kind of deformation problem comes up a lot. But then what you have a formal scheme, and then what you do is this formal scheme spoof of RH bullet, you can construct from that following Reynaud something called its generic fiber, which is just something belonging to the category of rigid analytic spaces over this field K, which is the vectors of kappa. When you invert P, it becomes a field. So you get some options. You get some object in the world of rigid analytic spaces. And if the chain is corresponding to this perihoric, in other words, the notion of chain is sort of reflecting the notion of lattice chain used to define the perihoric, then any k inside there gives rise to an atal cover like this, which you get by just uniformizing, choosing a choosing a uniform, rigidifying the level K structures on the universal. The level K structures on the universal p-adic tape module. Okay, so I don't want to say more about that. But now, when you have this, when you have the p-divisible group that you started with, it has a rational Dudenay module called M subbullet. And then you can take, I mean, you can tensor that with, you can take the integral guy and tensor it with Q. You get some vector spaces with endowed with these sigma-linear Frobenius. That's what the Dudene model is. linear Frobenius, that's what the Due to Nay module is. And you can rigidify this. In other words, you can take this rational Due to Nay module can be identified together with its Frobenius. This Frobenius can be identified with sort of similar chain of vector spaces over QP with, well, some matrix composed with the Frobenius. And this operator, this delta is just something that, I mean, it's the thing you get by. I mean, it's the thing you get by writing, trans taking an isomorphism of this with this and transporting this f over to an automorphism of this size, of this form. It has to be given by a delta that's in this the wit vector points of g and it's well defined up to sigma conjugacy by this group. That's just because you could change the you could change the isomorphism between m bullet and the standard model lambda bullet, and then when you change that. And then, when you change that, you're basically you have an automorphism that's represented by an element in this group. Okay. Anyway, the association, the important thing is that the association from the original p-divisible group over the field kappa to this group element delta, modulo sigma conjugation, this is an injection. So for every, so you can think of deltas, these are just elements of a group. You can think of like sometimes they come from some p-divisible group, sometimes they don't. Group. Sometimes they don't. Well, what Schultz does is you said, well, let's define a function using these. So take delta, an element of the QP the R points of G. If it comes from a p-divisible group over this field FP to the R, with controlled cohomology, that's just some technical thing that says that the cohomology groups of the origin analytic spaces are well behaved. Okay, so don't worry about that. Then we set the value of the function he wants to define to be the trace of, so this, these call. The trace of so this these cohomology groups is just some abstract theory of the tau cohomology groups of rigid analytic spaces, Latic homology. They're functorial also, they carry a natural action of tau and h. And so what he does is he says, just take the trace of tau cross h on these weird cohomology groups, and just that's a number. It's an L-adic number. In fact, it's actually Q-valued. So what he, this, this K here is kind of auxiliary. It's just any sufficiently small. Just any sufficiently small pro-P open compact subgroup. And if delta does not arise from some LH bullet, then you just take the value of the function to be zero. So anyway, I went through this just to explain that this function is just pretty hard to understand. And it's hard to prove anything about it, but Soltzer did prove that it's locally constant, Q-valued function, compactly supported. It's also sigma conjugacy invariant for this para horc, and it's independent of L. And it's independent of L. So, all those properties he proved. And then he also proved, and his main result in this paper was that if you take this as your definition of the test function, it does satisfy the point counting formula. So that's what he proved, that in fact, this formula holds. So in a sense, you'd be, that seems like it's a great result, but it's also in a way kind of useless because the problem is we don't know anything about these functions. But we know they. But we know they exist. Okay, that's all we know in general. So, well, another wrinkle is that in this formula that he proved, it's actually the small lie is that he only does it when G is unramified, in particular quasi-split. He doesn't prove it in general. In fact, it doesn't make sense in general for a reason I'll about to come to. In general, there's an obstruction. So I said that, you know. So, I said that, you know, in some sense, if you take a fixed point of this Frobenius-Hecke correspondence, then you want to associate to that some group theoretic data. Now, I didn't tell you really what this group theoretic objects are, but I mean, this gamma zero is a rational point of G, a bold G, taken up to stable conjugacy in general. This is some point in the finite idelic points, finite adult points of G away from P. And this is this thing in the QP to the R points of G. To the r points of g, and there's some relation between these things in the sense that this is supposed to be sort of stably conjugate to this, and the norm of the delta is supposed to be stably conjugate to the gamma zero. But in a general thing, in a general group, if you take an element of a group over qp to the r and you take its norm, which is by definition this product of these elements here, just taken in this order, that's an element of the group G qp to the r. It may or may not be stably conjugate to something. may not be stably conjugate to something over qp and if it's not then it can't be stably conjugate to something in the over rational coordinates so basically this whole thing would break down in the situation where you can't you can't attach a triple to the data that you have in the situation when the group is not quasi-split at P. You just can't. This is the main source of difficulty in trying to extend these theories to Extend these theories to situations where the group at P is not quasi-split. So, to make things work, what we need to know is that we have an a priori vanishing statement. Namely, these Schulze functions have to have the property that they're twisted orbital integrals. They're just vanishing when the delta is bad, when the norm of delta is not stably conjugate to something over Qp. And then what would happen is that the terms that were bad simply don't contribute. And so you basically are good again if you can prove this. Problem is, again, we don't know anything about the Schulze functions. So, how could you prove something about their twisted orbital integrals? Well, another question is, how are these Schulze functions related to the conjectural test functions? So, as I said, the original test function conjecture says that you should have a formula like this in general. As long as you should have a thing like that where you define the, where you insert in that twisted orbital integral a function of this form, which always exists, at least if you assume h tilde exists, which is in practice always the case. I mean, in every interesting case, it exists. So the question is, again, to repeat it, how is this function related to the conjectural test function? function related to the conjectural test function. Well, theorem is that in the various situations of the target theorem, the two test functions essentially agree. We can't prove they're actually equal functions, but we do know that they have the same twisted orbital integrals. Well, we prove that they have the same twisted orbital integrals. So in other words, whenever delta is something that the norm of delta is semi-simple, it doesn't have to be rational, just semi-simple, then these twisted orbital integrals agree. So, that means that if you believe this, now we know a lot about the functions because these functions here, in some sense, are designed so that we know their spectral behavior. For example, we know the trace of this on any irreducible representation of any level. Okay, so we know explicitly all the spectral behavior of this function. Whereas this thing we knew nothing essentially. Okay, so in the light of the Schulze point counting formula, this test function conjecture that I stated before holds. That's what the statement said. It said that you could insert this kind of function here into the counting point formula and it would be true. So I'm almost out of time, but we had local results. We had the main local results that are needed to prove these things. So in the situation of the target theorem, So, in the situation of the target theorem, we have to prove that the Schulze function satisfies the a priori vanishing property. In other words, that its twisted roboticles do vanish when they're supposed to vanish. And then when it does have that property, we prove that it has a base change to a function here. So this is a little bit unusual base change because, again, the group is not quasi-split. So this thing is not like an endoscopic group of anything. Okay, because endoscopic groups are always quasi-split. This is not an endoscopic. Are always quasi-split. This is not an endoscopic group of anything, but nevertheless, there is a notion of base change from a function upstairs to a function downstairs. Just doesn't always exist. But in this situation, it does exist. And then, moreover, we can prove that the base change of that thing is, in fact, given by the sort of version of our stable base change, our stable guy here convolved with our original H. So here, R is one. That's why there's a one here. Here, R is one. That's why there's a one here. This is the thing downstairs over QP. Anyway, the unusual notion of base change here that occurs, because we instead of using the normal stabilization to understand like the point counting formula in terms of automorphic forms, we use this thing called pseudo-stabilization, which was introduced by Kotwitz. In this specific situation, it's what's more useful. And it involves you having to deal with the state. It involves you having to deal with this kind of base change. Okay. Anyway, the point is these are local results, but we do not have any local proof. We can only prove it by global method. I think that I will not be able to explain that. So I think I should stop and just with this assertion that, sorry, I want to go back. The last two The last two slides are basically like the sketch of how you do a global argument to get this local stuff. We do not know of any purely local proof. I'm thinking about this, but it's not, I don't have at the moment, a purely global proof, a purely local proof. I mean, I want to prove it in much more generality. So I want to just point out that the versions of what we're proving here should all have analogs in great generality. Great generality. I mean, we can prove things here because we're dealing with GLN and its inner forms, basically. And every notions of transfer of functions become much more elementary there. You don't have to deal with stable orbital integrals or stuff like that. You just have single orbital integrals and twisted orbital integrals and it's much simpler. And there's also the other thing that's simple is that because those local groups of that form Those local groups of that form, GLN and inner forms of it can be embedded into very simple Shmur varieties. So you have the local, the global argument is that you have purely local statements here. You have a p-adic group, but now you're free to embed that into a global situation that except for at P, you fixed, but right away from that, you can choose good global situations. And then you can play with this Harris Taylor. You can play with this Harris-Taylor methods of playing with different global inner forms and use global base change and use a lot of automorphic forms for different global groups to try to eventually get these local statements. Okay, thank you. So, there's any questions? Maybe in the chat or in Zoom or something? Sorry. In the market, you can vote on the print center. So, yes. From the prints and so yes, when the results are to the stable restaurants from the Twinstein UI variety to the stable. Yeah. You fix G. Yeah. You have to worry about UK essentially pure F1s. Well, no, no. I mean, no. Well, so first of all, the stable Bernstein center is the same if you change to an inner form. It doesn't change at all. And the Bernstein center. And the Bernstein center does change. And but that's it. For any group G, you have the, you have like, you have a little commutative square where, I mean, well, so, okay, let me take that back. You don't have a commutative square. You have a triangle. You might want a commutative square where you would see, oh, you see the stable Bernstein center of G and its quasi-split interform G star or any interform, they're just canonically the same. They're just canonically the same. The Bernstein center G itself and that of an inner form are not obviously related. And I don't know of any morphism between them. And similarly, there's no base change. Like if you have a group over, if you have a group over an unramified extension and you have the group downstairs and you have the notion of like if they're GLM, If they're a GLN, you have the notion of like base changing a representation downstairs to a representation upstairs. For packets, you can take a packet downstairs and you can create a packet upstairs by just restricting a map from the vague group or to the subgroup. It gives you something, right? And so on the stable, on the level of stable Bernstein center, you always have base change. Always. But on the regular Bernstein center, you don't have base change. Don't have base change. So, similarly, like there's a lot of stuff that comes in here where we're using, we use base change of the stable Bernstein center. We use functoriality and stuff like that, which all works very nicely for the stable Burnstone center, which does not work for the Bernstein center. So, our functions really have to come from the stable Burns and Center, otherwise, we wouldn't be able to do anything. And is the math known positive finding? The map. No, because Fargo. No, because Farg and Schulze don't know much about their packets or the enlarged packets because it's the union of packets. I mean, the things attached to a given infinitesimal thing probably should be a finite set, but I don't think it's known to be finite. Yeah, so we expect it to be a quasi-finite. I mean, the map on the variety, we map, the map on varieties from the Bernstein, stable Bernstein, sorry, from the Bernstein variety of the stable Bernstein variety should be. Variety of the stable Burnsine variety should be an actual finite map. It should be in particular quasi-finite, but we don't know. We don't know anything like that unconditionally. Okay, so that's that big area.
