Yes, I was already done. So, thank you very much for a kind invitation. I'm not involved today, but I would like to give a talk here. So, I'm going to talk about classification of SPT phases. And so, this is about that. And I'm very excited that we can hear about D-dimensional. That we can hear about three-dimensional case in this workshop by Nikita. But today, unfortunately, what I can tell you is only one two-dimensional system. But new things may be that I talk about fairly system. Okay. So in a word, what I'm going to tell you is the following. We derive some invariant which is similar to the predicted one. To the predicted one in these papers. But the unfortunate thing is that it is not exactly the same. So probably I'm missing something. Maybe some of you can tell me what I'm missing. If you do, please let me know. So let me start from the setting. So in FermiNix system, we the A the algebra if the system is described by self-dual CR algebra, so let us recall what it is. So let H be a Hubert space and let C be a complex conjugation. And you are shear algebra over this pair K and C, Hubert space and complex conjugation, which I denote by this simple. Not by this symbol, is defined as a universal shift algebra generated by this object where the map from k to the schist algebra is linear, which satisfies anti-linear commutation relation, and the adjoint is related like this. So, this is a self-dual shear algebra introduced by Professor Raki, and that is what we describe. And that is what will describe our system. And for this share algebra, we have a Pogodium of automorphism, which is defined as follows. So let U be a unitary on our Hilbert space, which could commute to its complex conjugation. And then when such a unitary is given, then we have corresponding Pok√©lobo transformation, which I Which I did only did because I you here like this. So in particular, if we take you being just in a identity, then it will give our usual grading operator on our self-gRC algebra. So there is one way to construct automorphism like this. And there is another also a way to Also, a way to construct some kind of state out of projection on this Hilbert space. Not all projection, but something called basis projection, which is defined as follows. A projection P, which is satisfying this condition, is a basis projection, is called a basis projection. And when such a projection is given, then we can say that there exists a unique state on the Exist a unique state on our system algebra satisfying this condition. So, this formula defines a state on our shift algebra, which is called a Fox base state. So, out of basis projection, we can define some state uniquely. So, this is the view of search to our algebra and our system. Algebra and our system is derived described by this JR algebra. So our system is a two-dimensional Human system. It is given by this CR algebra. So let T be an even number and I will consider this dual algebra, SR algebra. So here the Hilbert space is times H2 over Z2 times C D. So this C D indicates a internal degree of freedom. And this, so this Huber space, I denote the standard basis, which you can imagine what this xy. This xy denotes z to z and j runs from one to d so this takes value one only on the one one point of each. So we let me denote the standard basis of this Huber space like this, then we can define the complex conjugation which is defined by It just does not move a complex conjugation with respect to this standard basis. So that is a sister deriver which described our fermionic system. So now I would like to introduce star symmetry. So let G be a finite group and let UG be its unitary representation on C D. C D and which commute with the complex conjugation on C D standard basis of C D and as a result this one tensor UG commute with our complex conjugation as a result it defines a vocal of automorphism by a general fact we saw in the previous slide. We saw in the previous slide. So, like this, we can define some group function of G on the self-dual CR algebra. So, that is symmetry we consider here. And what we do is usual thing. So, what we consider is a beta invariant, even interaction with unique Japanese state. Unique gap ground state, which can be smoothly deformed to trivial on-site interaction without closing the gap. So we consider such an object. Beta invariant interaction, unique gap ground state, and which can be deformed to trivial. That is what we consider in SPT phase. And we would like to classify them with respect to the following criterion that is, we say, to international. That is, we say two interactions are equivalent if they can be smoothly deformed into each other without closing gap nor breaking the symmetry. That is a classification criterion of SPT phase. And what we would like to do here is today is that to derive an invariant of the classification. So, usually I talk about this thing a little bit more carefully or precisely, mathematically, and I could define. Mathematically, like defining what I mean by gapped grand states or so on, but today I would like to skip it. And I'd like to instead I'd like to start by the reduction of such a reduction of the problem thanks to automotive equilibrium. So let me do that. So let Q out here, it just means maybe there's Maybe there is better example, but by Q, I mean the set of all automorphism our cistern algebra the system given by a possibly time-dependent interaction. So with these 10 people, probably I don't need to explain about this thing, but we consider usual equasio automorphism and for notation. And for notation, q o beta here, I denote the set of generate of a set of such automorphism given by beta invariant interactions. So that is what I mean by QOT throughout my talk. Now, so now I'd like to reduce my problem using. Problem using this Q old. And in order to do that, I need to introduce some different state, which I denote by omega zero here. To do that, I need to do this annoying part. So as before, we consider standard basis of our Hubble space like this, like this. And now I denote by a Denote by a two-dimensional subspace of our Hilbert space spanned by these vectors. And we consider also one projection on this two-dimensional Hebrew space onto one-dimensional subspace bound by this vector. And note that our complex conjugation is a complex conjugation with respect to this. With respect to this standard basis, that if we apply our complex conjugation C, then this part become this one become negative sign. And in other words, this original vector maps to a vector which is orthogonal to the original one. So, and from this observation, we And from this observation, what we see is that if we define p as a direct sum of this orthogonal projection p xyk, then this is a basis projection. That's all what I wanted to say. This defines a basis projection on our Hilbert space. So for the latter purpose, maybe I want to draw a picture about the situation. So we are considering the So we are considering the two lattice. And as I said, we are considering this here space. So each lattice point includes some d dimensional internal degree of freedom. And I would like to write it as follows: namely, I put blue. Dot here, which is the d dot here corresponding to the d level of this internal degree of freedom. And we do that for all the points there. And then, and so and each point indicates the standard basis I wrote here. So this point corresponds to the Corresponds to this, and this point corresponds to this, and this point corresponds to this, and so on. Now, what we are doing here is what we are doing here is considering this two-dimensional Hubble space, which just means that In this picture, it corresponds to these two points: these two points, these two points, these points, and so on. And we are considering for these two points a subspace of this space which is spanned by this vector. And I would like to denote it by this blue line here. And I do the same thing for other. For other pairs. So, this blue line indicates this projection PXYK, and we are considering also a direct sum of that that we are considering, the projection P we are considering can be written like this. So that was anyway, what I this P what P this P is. P what P this P is. And let us come back to what I wanted. That is, I wanted to reduce the problem of classification. I wanted to reduce the classification problem of SPD phases using automorphic equivalence. And to do that, I prepared this reference state. And now what I would like to do is the following. We consider the set of states which are. Consider the set of states, which I wrote SPT here. It is a set of states which has of this form, where this omega 0 is our different state, which I've just defined, and alpha is a Q alpha as a automorphism, quasi-rocker automorphism. And because it is F the spt, it's the state should be invariant under this our symmetry. So this is. Our symmetry. So this is the set we are interested in. And what we would like to do is to derive some index h omega for each state inside of this set. And we want to assign some number, something to this set which satisfies the whole, which should be stable under this. Stable under this automorphism, which is invariant, which is given by time as beta invariant interactions. So we would like to derive some index H omega satisfying this condition, namely if omega 2 and omega 1 are connected by alpha, which is given by a quasi-local automorphism. A quasi-local automorphism given by beta-invariant interaction in that case, these two values are equal. That is what we would like to do. That is, this is a reduction of the problem of our classification problem of SPD phases. So for the rest of talk, what I consider is that this classification. So I have a quick question. So far, you haven't assumed anything on the behavior of omega. On the behavior of omega zero with respect to the symmetry, is that right? No, I didn't. Thanks. Yeah. Okay, so now I'd like to introduce my index, which is slightly different from what I wanted, what they wanted. And so it requires a little bit of preparation. So let me start to do it. So let A be Do it. So let A be either Z2 or U1. And we consider direct sum of them and associate pointwise multiplication namely just x dot y for xy from here is just pointwise multiplication. So we are like this this well a plus a is a um Abelian group, and on this aberrant group, we define some reaction. Namely, first we prepare some group homomorphism from G to Z2. This H1GGZ2 is just a group homomorphism from G to Z2. So let's fix something like that. And this A define action of This A defines a G action on A plus A by this formula. So for each G and X, we assign a define X A G by this formula. What it says is that if A G is equal to zero, X A G is just original X. And if Ag is equal to one, then it becomes Then it becomes a flip of x. X plus, X minus become X minus X plus. That's all. So like this, we can define a group action G on this A plus one A. And so like this, this A plus A becomes G module. And when this G module is given, then we can define a co-chain of G on a. chain of G on G module A plus A, which just means that we see K G A plus A is just a map from G times K to A plus A. So that is what they are. And we fix some group on or from Z to Z2. And then a usual procedure tell you how to Tell you how to define differential and first and second assert differentials are given by this formula. And furthermore, I denote I sometimes need to construct U1 plus U1 element out of Z2 plus Z2, and I do that by doing this formula, just considering by this formula. So this is. Yeah, so this is a kind of object we need to introduce my invariant. So now this set I would like to introduce first. It is a set of these three pools from here. Here and satisfying these two conditions, where this one is saying that this one is two cycle. In other words, this being equal to zero. So that is first condition. And this is a condition for K and this C, if this is zero, then it's just meaning that this is. just meaning that this is a second subgroup homology sorry second three cosine clue but now this is not zero but there is something here given by the second element so the detail does not really matter it's i'm but there is some not only just this set but there is some list Reset, but there is some restriction about the elements. So now that is a set I introduce here. And for this set, I introduce some equivalence relation defined by this condition. So it says the following: let 2 C1K1 kappa 1A1 and C2K kappa 2A2 are equivalent if the But two are equivalent if these two conditions are hold. The first one says that this one are equal, and I will denote it by Ag here. And second one says that this other element, this cup K2 and K1 are related by this formula using a chain M and M and in other words, the second group of homology of this and that are same. And this C2 and C1 are related. If again, this is not theory, then it just means that there are third group homology given by this and that are same, but there is some additional structure here. And you can check that this duration, this gives an equivalence duration and. And I denote by the equivalence classes by P D 0 G here. Maybe it's not the best denotation, but I wrote it here like this. So, and the main theorem is that there exists this value to invariant for two-dimensional ferment FPT. So, that is the main theorem of the talk. Ethereum was a talk. So it's and yes, the thing is that if you understand it correctly, without this without this doubled structure, that should be the one predicted in literatures. But I for the moment. But I, for the moment, I don't know how to remove it, so maybe you can help me. Okay, so let me go on to define, define, let me explain for the rest of my talk, let me explain how to derive this sort of things out of our microscopic system and a comparison. And compared to the few times now that there's a small difference with what other authors expect, that you have these additional terms there. So does it mean that you have or you expect that you have different values for your invariant where in fact they should be the same? So compared to the former Compared to the former right now, I don't know. Someone says that if we require additional symmetries, then maybe it reduces to their symmetry. But if I actually require diffraction symmetry, I will get what they will. I will get what they will they say, but according to him, direction she is forbidden because they will then they will get something else. So for the moment, I don't know. Yeah, maybe you can think. I don't know. Okay, yeah. So now I would like to tell you how to derive such a thing. And compared to the analysis in quantum. Compared to the analysis in quantum spin system, the main difference of the analysis comes from the difference from split property. So I'd like to start from what is the difference of split property compared to the quantum spin system one here. So let me start from split property. So let us recall our Hubble space is given like this, and clearly it Like this, and clearly we can split this space to left and right, which is indicated by KR and KR here. And because our computer conjugation was just given by a standard basis of this one, that we can decompose our computer conjugation accordingly, like this. And I denote it to be and share. And here is a definition of split property. Definition of split property, we say that a homogeneous pure state on the C algebra, which is representing our fermiog system, satisfies the split property if there are homogeneous states. A homogeneous means that it is invariant undergrading. So if there are So if there are a homogeneous state phi i on a self-dual shared algebra on left hand and right part such that omega and phi tensor phi r are quasi-equivalent. So for this probably most of the you know but this tensor product with this graded mark here is just state Mark here is a state given by this formula where AR and AR are represented elements from left and right half frame. And quasi-equivalence, I will not define here. And if you don't know it, it's just fine to think that it is kind of macroscopic equivalence. It just means that if two states are because I But because I equivalently, you can definitely think that the difference between this and that are just small one, microscopic one. So this is a definition of a split property. And our reference state are defined like this. So it is just consisted of a projection P, which was represented like this. So if we Like this. So if we let's say x being zero in this picture, then xy split is this line. So clearly our projections split into left and right parts nicely. So as a result, we see that this only our defined state is actually of this. Is actually of this form. And so, in particular, our state is omega zero is a sub-satisfied split property. And there is yet another, well, of course, there are many states satisfied property, but I would like to introduce another one, a particular one here. To introduce that, I would like to introduce a unitary vital, which is defined like this. Which is defined like this. So it is defined by this formula, which is telling you that if y is equal to zero, is not equal to zero, if this point is not on the x-axis, then this is mapped to itself. Vitau doesn't do anything. But if y equals zero, if the point is on y-axis, x-axis. axis uh x axis then it shifts by one so a more precisely if j is one zero to d sorry no not zero this is one this one to d minus one then j is shifted by one and if a j goes d then this point x is mapped to x plus one zero so what we are doing here uh so yeah so that is a unitary idea That is a unitary idea with how I introduced here, and again, it is given by a standard basis that it commutes with a complex conjugation of us, therefore we can define a volume of automorphism there. And using this unitary tau, I would like to define projection Q by this formula. This formula and so recall that P is a basis projection and tau a commute with a complex conjugation. As a result, this Q also is a base projection on our Huber space pairs. And as a result, we can define a focus space given by this Q. Now, what we are doing here is we don't do anything to these lines, but we shift. So let's say y equals zeros here. So we don't do anything to this line, but we shift by one this picture, this middle line. Namely, we shift this by This by one, like this. So now let's say x is equal to one again, equal to zero again. Then this y-axis is like this. So also there is now someone overlapping to connecting to region, but it's just one. Region, but it's just one site and it is ineglazible from a macroscopic point of view. And in particular, our omega Q is also satisfies split property. And I would like to denote this omega Q by omega 1. Now this V tau from a picture we From the picture we saw, we see that V tau maps P to Q and V Q to P, so this holes. As a result, the corresponding volume of automorphism maps state omega 1 to omega 0 and omega 0 to omega 1. So that is a property we see. And so now And so now, like this, I prepare two states, two kinds of states, which satisfy the split property. And actually, it gives us the dichotomy of split property in the following sense. So, here is a proposition for any homogeneous pure state omega on our Hermiac system satisfying the split property. There exists a unique 0 or 1, exactly 1 of 0 over 1, which allows the existence of graded automorphism eta L, eta R localized on left infinity half, right infinity half, such that omega and omega A composed with this automorphism are equivalent. So, first of all, this grade just means that. Graded just means that this automorphism commute to its grading operator, and so this theorem is saying for split state, it can be written from either omega zero or omega one using this automorphism, which has tensor product form of left and right. Left and right infinite plane that we can show. So, and this is a if it holds for zero, then it never holds for one. And if it holds for one, it never holds for zero. So, there is this dichotomy. So, this so yes, and in quantum spin case, this whole similar thing holds. This similar thing holds, but without this dichotomy. So, when you are given any state, a satisfying split property can be created out of infinite product state by in this form. But in fermionic systems, there is a difference and there is this dichotomy. And this is the main difference for the analysis of SPT phase and. Phase and phase. So, having that, I would like to start to derive, tell you what how we can get this invariant. So, a derivation of this valued invariant. So, like any other work in topological physics, it's always good to consider the health of the system. system and here we in order to derive the invariant we restrict our symmetry to the upper half plane beta gu which i denote by beta g u now uh then note that um a so that i omega be i element from spd which means that um it is given by our difference It is given by our different state times alpha, which is given by time-dependent interaction. So, and by definition of this one, it is in this state is invariant under beta. And as of you know, this alpha satisfies a factorization property. It factorizes to a nice Nicely with respect to lesion, and using such a thing, one can see that this state constructed from our reference state with this automorphism alpha, it satisfies a split property with left and right cut. That is rather easy to do, but annoying to see on the slide, so I didn't like, but I think it's rather easy. It's easy to see that this satisfies a split property. Now, having a split property and recalling this dichotomy and the fact that omega 0 is mapped to omega 1 by tau and vice versa, we can, with a little bit modification, we can derive the following proposition. That is the following. That omega via speed is speed static. Different speed state from this SPT set. And then for this SPT set, there exists a unique group homomorphism from Z to Z, which allows the existence of graded automorphism. Here, I did a little bit more work than previous slide that this gamma g L e eta eta g A G Eta G A G Elo Iption is localized here and this eta G R is localized here and there is some angle here, theta. So with a little bit more work, we can, but basically by this proposition, we can see that from this fact, we can From this fact, we can using this fact and using this proposition, we can see that the effective action of beta GU on our SPT phase is described by these things, where this is automorphism here and there, and this tau is the shift I was talking about in the previous slide. And this And this here, so note that omega 0 tau is equal to omega 1, but omega 0 tau inverse is also omega 1. And there is this choice, and this choice is showing up this with this epsilon. And for each choice, we can. Each for each choice, we can obtain some automorphism satisfying this condition. And so, so this Ag A omega g corresponds to this dichotomy we saw in this previous proposition. And so let me try it again. So this AG omega basically corresponds to the dichotomy I talked about in this proposition. In this proposition period. And there is annoying epsilon which is showing up here. But it comes from this fact that we have freedom of taking tau atau inverse. And according to which one we took, this automorphism changes. And but for both of them, this works. And yeah, but actually this Ipshion is the source of my double. Source of my doubled structure. So, but for the moment, I don't know how to get rid of it. So, anyway, what I wanted to say is that from this dichotomy of general dichotomy of split, and from this fact that we naturally encounter a split state with split property, we can derive. Property, we can derive this kind of, we can say that the effective excitation given by this upper half, the destruction of our symmetry to the upper half frame can be represented by something explicitly split into left and right, and some automorphism, which corresponds to this map. Map so can I interrupt the question? So, so there is this uh I don't know whether it's ambiguity or something, extra freedom, this epsilon, which comes from the fact that you can either use tau or tau inverse. So is it true that for d equal to d is the even dimension, the spin dimension, right? If d is equal to two, aren't the two the same? I know my shift. Ah no, my shift is that that's that's yeah that's a confusing point of my my I mean my D is this D so yes this D but my shift is just by one of one of this unit so that's a bit annoying maybe it but for d equal two there is only one unit my unit is My unit the translation by tau is just by one of them, so I'm not defecting the split by d so d is this block, and I'm not saying that translation is by this d block, but it is by unit of one point, literally one point. Yeah, okay, so it's not even It's not even. So, in other words. But in the case, well, okay. Tau is move from like this. Right. And the shift by usual, that is, sense, is this. Yes, no, no, I didn't mean that. Yes, no, no, I didn't mean that. Oh, okay. So if you do this for d equal to, you don't see a difference between tau and tau inverse. It's look to me. D equals two, yes. Yes. Ah, yes. Ah, yeah, yeah, that's true. So, so then there's ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, it is cheaper. There is still There is a direction left and right. And yeah, so that's exactly the point that I don't know how to handle this, how much shift it is. And yeah, yeah, so I don't know how to delete the shift to right and left. That is my problem, and that is a source of my double structure. I see. Sorry, sorry about that. Okay, well, sorry for interrupting. Okay, then let us. Okay, then let us continue. So we have this proposition. And so I just rewrote it this proposition and we have some group homorphism and that is the group homomorphism I was talking about here. So this guy in the index shows up as a result of this dichotomy. A result of this dichotomy of the split property. Now, let us move on to derive kappa and C. And the argument is basically the same as a quantum spin case and a case. So, from this previous proposition, we have this equivalence which I wrote like this. I derot it. Like this, I derot it here. And with the factorization property of alpha, we can decompose. So, factorization property here I wrote certainly precisely, but it just means that there is automorphism strictly localized on the left-infinite half-frame, and there is an automorphism strictly localized in this right half. In this right half brain, and there is eta which is localized along this cone along this axis and let's say this is theta where theta is Where theta is the sita i where this eta g eta g's are so the situation is that alpha l is localized on the half frame and left infinite frame and alpha r are localized in that infinite frame and could this uh absolute is localized in this red area with angle theta here and angle theta here and this uh this this guy is localized in this area while this guy is localized in this area so that is the situation so let us come back to this equivalence and i'm saying that i can decompose alpha into these three automorphisms Into these three automorphism times something small, which is given by in automorphism, which just means it is given by at the joint of some unitary. And so we can have this kind of decomposition from general theory and from this factor omega clearly omega is equivalent to this state. So I would like to replace this omega by this one. It is possible by It is possible by modular unitary equivalence. So, by doing that, we obtain this equation. It's just that I replace this one by that one. And now I would like to define gamma g epsilon by this formula, which is just this times inverse of this times inverse of this. So, of course, we obtain from this equation, we obtain this equation. Equation and it what it's saying is this defining this gamma gypsion like that. Gamma Gypsy applying gamma gypsion to this state does not do much. It just moves the state to something equivalent to the original one. And so we can repeat the same thing three times. So repeated use of this, we apply, we use this fact for this one and that one and that one. That one and that one, and we obtain this equivalence. So, that is one. And now, look, looking at this annoying epsilon, which I don't like, there is something different happening in this second part. The reason why is the following is the following. So, let us look at this shift part. Shift part, what this gamma g epsilon part give in terms of this shift is tau minus a, I don't know, sorry, minus let me forget about tau, but Kamaji epsilon gives this shift in terms of tau and the second. And a the second one gives a minus a omega g epsilon and the third one gives a no sorry a epsilon times a omega h a epsilon plus third one gives g h. So by considering the case 0, 1, 0, 1, or even 1 or whatever, you can easily check that this is actually 0. So the reason why I suddenly put this strange entry here is in order to make the total shift being zero. So this is a coordinated. This is coordinated directories, and also there is this beta g u here, but this very roughly aiming. This gamma g gives beta g and this gamma h gives gamma h u and gamma g h give gamma g h u inverse. So roughly they cancel each other and what is What is left is a conjugated version of this one. In other words, you can easily check. If you consider these things, you can easily check that this is written as a tensor product of some automorphism on the left, how left this part and this part that you can show. So that is That is one observation. And then now I would like to substitute this one to this formula to here. Then it me here. Now I'm saying that I was saying that, let me erase this part, that I was saying that this guy is given by this one, where this is localized here. Localized here, while this yet are no epsilon, sorry, epsilon is localized in this red area, which are disjoint from the support of this guy. Therefore, we can commute them. And by commuting them, these two there, and then noticing we have the same guide here, we can erase both of them. We can erase both of them. So, what do we want? So what we want to know, say, what we obtained is that we can so most of the thing I already wrote. So we were here. We can eliminate this guy and this one is equal to this one. So this part, this tensor product states times tensor product automorphism equal to the original tensor product states, which Original tensor product states, which means that this and that are equivalent. And having some state being equivalent to the same state composed with some automorphisms, it means in general theory almost by definition, it just means that this alpha is implementable by some unitary in the GNS representation of the state. Of the state. So, in our case, it means that there is some graded automorphism implementable by some unitary in the GNS representation of this state. Because of this iteration, we conclude that there is some unitary implementing this automorphism like this. So, also, this, so that like this, we obtain some injury, it's quite similar things for quantum. Similar things for quantum spin system. And now I'm sorry. Now I recall that this state is, maybe I didn't really say that, but every automorphism so far showed up are graded and all the states so far showed up are homogeneous. So from this point of view, this is a homogeneous, which means a Which means it is invariant under the grading, which means that there exists a self-evergent unit implementing the grading like this way. And from this and that, and from the fact that this is invariant, this commute with this guy, you can easily see that this UGR is graded in the sense that when we apply adjoint gamma R, then we get some sine plus minus one. sine plus minus one to the like this and this plus minus one and which give the two element is the corresponds to the second element of my index so like this we obtained the second element and then third element let us go back go to the third element so third element is a derived Is derived by the same arguments for one quantum spin system, and the easiest way to think of it is a cycle action. I I I talked about it several times in several places, so I maybe some of you remember. Some of you remember, but um so a quiet action is a map from G to automorphism factor, which means a phonomic algebra with trivia center satisfying this condition, namely a gamma g gamma h is almost like gamma g. Gamma H is almost like gamma G H, but there is more obstacle given by some unitary U. And for that, by considering this kind of associativity of for this kind of thing, we could obtain a subgroup of homology that was that is just first we combine this. Combine this using like this, and then total thing become using this formula again. We get something like that. But on the other hand, we can do the different order, we combine this first. We combine this first using this formula and then apply then we have to move this like this and gamma Gamma H K and this become so like this so in In total, it become u H K U G H Kamma G H K. And because M is factor, it means that this and that are proportional to each other. Namely, this is equal to some G H K. Sorry, this is not. Sorry, this is hard. So we can see that this is equal to this times some phase factor C G H K. So what I want to say is considering this kind of given such a kind of duration and considering two ways of combining these three operators, three operators, we can obtain some phase which turns out to be subgroup homology. turns out to be such group homology, turns to be circle cycle. And that is what is well known. And we do quite analogous things in our setting. And like that, we can obtain this value, but and this it is written here. So here I'm applying gamma g to u h k. Gamma G to UHK. And what is this gamma G? It is given by this unitary written here. So note that we already have this equivalence and it means that this unitary implementing this automorphism in the genus representation of this state. And with this UG, we get pretty much an arrow gas. Another vars thing here. So what so what I wanted to say is that doing pretty much analogous things that we did for cycloaction, we can derive this relation, which is pretty much look like the one we obtain from a cycloaction. And the difference is we have annoying epsilon around here. And yes, but anyway, we can obtain these things. And this like this, we obtain some U1 phase for each epsilon GHK. And this U1 phase is by juggling this relation, we can see that. We can see that this C ipsron satisfies some non-trivial direction we saw in the beginning. And this is the first element in the index. Okay, so that's almost all. And my problem is how can we remove the double structure? Moves the double structure, but yeah, if you have an idea, let me know. So, thank you very much for attention. Thank you, Yoshiko. Let's make some virtual thank you. And now we have, I see, 25 minutes for discussion and coffee break. So, please, questions to Yoshiko and also if you want to. And also, if you want to go make yourself coffee, that's also a good way how to use the time. So, please, questions. Maybe I'll start with a quick question. So, in the setting, you need to have the D, so the kind of the spin degree of freedom, has to be even, right? Why is that? Yes, it's because I wanted to make it to make um make uh basis projection we i wanted to make the the on-site product states and to to do that we we need basis projection corresponding to on-site and then it requires to dimension i see i see related to that can can i ask so Can I ask? So your trivial state is a half-filled state, half-filled funk. Is the filling a parameter or why? I mean, yeah, if you have to make a choice, it's a good choice, but why? No, that can be indeed debatable. Maybe I thought just of the simple. Just the simplest possible, but maybe you can tell me what's. No, no, I can't tell you, but I thought you thought about it. So, so, sorry, I just thought of the simplest case. So, okay. Yeah, but it can be deep. I feel I'm missing something. So, maybe some physicists know that let me know. I mean, this is a bit related to the epsilon problem, right? Because the fact that you have these two, you know, these two possible values of epsilon arises from the fact that you have to have at least these two possible, you know, to have this shift. I'm not sure it's related, actually. No, okay. No, I actually. okay no at least i don't see but maybe i'm not seeing everything i have even more nice question so if i take the group to be just a trivial group then i get a trivial classification looking at the indices yes so i i how do i how do i see in the definitions that i can connect Definitions that I can connect the odd and even subspaces. Like, you know, I sort of imagine that I myself tend to think of algebra that this is generated by algebra of operators that are even in the creation and annihilation. In the you know, creation annihilation operators, and then I would expect somehow that even without any group, I would have two sectors. Ah, I don't know. It's I is it I'm not it's SPT, so it's trivially connected. I mean, by definition, certainly it's trivial if G is trivial. If G is trivial, right? So, yeah, it's by definition, it's connected to the omega zero by quasi-local automorphism. So, I you don't consider any other states. Yeah, I guess I see. It's a bit weird to video code this session, yeah. Yeah, okay.
