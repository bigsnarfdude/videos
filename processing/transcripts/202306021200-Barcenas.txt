It's my pleasure to introduce the last speaker of the conference, Neue Persanas, talking to us about the Zimmer program, Granitan Trees of Green Manifolds and the Netherlands. Well, thank you very much to everyone for being here. Thank you very much to CMO staff for giving this really pleasant day we have here discussing. Days we have here discussing a lot of mathematics, and thank you to everyone who was involved in the conception of CMO in any way that it could contain in the future. It is a great initiative for the Mexican community and for mathematics in general. So I'm yet again being the last talk. So I would like I would like to tell you about this sort of result that we have with Manuel Cedano. And I would suggest that you just imagine that you walk into one of the arts and crafts store here of Oaxaca, right? So there's going to be a lot of stuff, like overwhelming lot stuff. If you are not particularly interested in textiles, then don't. Then don't look at it with a lot of care. So we are going to move forward to pottery in one slide. Hopefully there's going to be something for everyone. So let me go ahead. So I am giving you a very hand-waving introduction to what I personally understand of the CIMR program. Of the SIMR program. And I will want to present you a version of the result tailored to dimension tree, but with two kinds of twists that you will find. One is considering metric considerations and the other one is specific to the actual topology and geometric group theory of theory of three manifold groups. So this balance of ideas is going to be contrasting during the exposition of results. So the CIMER program. So this is really a big field over there started by Robert Fisher and with contributions of Simmer and many many people around. So in a So, in a very reductionist way, we could say that the SIMER program is a series of studies related to the diffeomorphism group of a smooth manifold. So this is the fundamental object of study, differential manifolds and their diffeomorphism groups. And let me just say some keywords about this. So it is a Lie group, but there is small letters in this. Small letters in this, it is an infinite-dimensional group. So people like Agustin Banaga and Helmut Hofer have studied diffeomorphisms groups of manifolds as infinite-dimensional Lie groups. Well, and if you begin to try to study this from a group theoretical point of view, you find that it is a result of Baniaga, actually, that the identity component. Actually, that the identity component is a simple topological group. So that's as far as matters go. And for people who want to apply directly measure theoretical tools, like the hard measure, so you won't find it because it is not locally compact, right? So we are loss of those. Laws of those tools. And the general idea is that one considers instead of these other structures in the diffeomorphism group, rather group homomorphisms, right? From discrete and, let's say, finitely generated groups. So this is the object of study of finitely generated group theory or geometric group theory. Or geometric group theory. And then we are going to study group homomorphisms from a discrete group into this group of C infinity diffeomorphisms of the manifold. And the SIMER program is a series of statements of what happens with this morphism. So, in particular, we are going to set things later to the point that Later, to the point that gamma is a lattice inside a Lie group and with a given notion of rank. And the most general way of understanding the similar program says that from this viewpoint, an action is less interesting when the image of rho is a finite group, right? So, and there are lots of disclaimers. And there are lots of disclaimers on this because if you are an algebraic topologist, then you are very soon talked that actions of finite groups are really very interesting and actions, free actions of finite groups are very well understandable with homological tools, right? So, try to leave with this kind of shock for me as being coming from algebraic topology was from algebraic topology was sort of hard, but this is the way how the SIMER programs do. So they even come to saying that sort of the action is trivial in this context, when the image goes through a finite group which is in the image, right? So more precisely, for lattices inside Lie groups, so if the rank of the ambient Lie group is considered The rank of the ambient L-group is considerable large in comparison to the dimension of M, then very often this action is less interesting. And let me see some ways of making this precise. So this is a theorem which led to high tides in this area after some times of rest. This is a theorem by Brownfisher and Urtado, which appeared. Brown, Fisher, and Murtado, which appeared in Inventiones Mathematica. So, if you consider a lattice in SLNR and you consider a C-infinity manifold and a group homomorphism, that is the setting of the SIMER program as we are studying. If the dimension is smaller than the rank minus one, then the image of rho is a finite group. And if the dimension is small, And if the dimension is less than n, so this will be the boundary case, and the image preserves a volume form on m, then the image is a finite group. And this is a prototypical result in this very general sense that if the rank is higher, the action is in a way less interesting, right? So in the first setting, it takes the incarnation that the image is a finite group with no assumptions. Finite group with no assumptions. And in the second case, if you are on the boundary and you put some extra structure, in this case, some measured theoretical structure, like the volume form, then you conclude that the action is less interesting. And this way of reasoning is going to be very often in this situation. If you have higher rank, then you have less interesting action. And if you have Less interesting action, and if you have on the very boundary and an extra structure which will be of geometrical sense, which may be a more measured geometrical sense or in another ways. So you are still concluding that the action is less interesting. And you can start going ahead of yourself, thinking what will be the kind of geometry we are going or extra structure that. Geometry, we are going, or extra structure that we are considering in three manifolds. So, here are the key examples to sort of understand these two phenomena. I will consider the group PSLNR. So, this is the JLNR model of the diagonal group over there. So, this still acts on the projective space. And let me put the model I want to consider. The model I want to consider, the space of lines through the origin, and consider also the other variation of this as SN module antipodes. So, and for the sake of preciseness, think of the action of a cover of SL2R on N compatible with the identification. So, if I consider the action of this lattice inside, The action of this lattice inside the SLN z over there that you can see, then this factorizes to the group to the discrete group a SLN z modulo the positive diagonal integer group, right? But being viewing it on the sphere modulo antipodes, but this is maximal in the sense that this action does not factorize to any finite quotient of this. Characterized to any finite quotient of this group. So, this is the case where the dimension is exactly the rank over there. Here is another example. So the action of SLNR on the real, on the Euclidean space of dimension n preserves the lattice of integer points over there. And then the group of affine diffeomorphisms. The group of affine diffeomorphisms of the torus acts transitively on the torus and it preserves the affine structure. So, there is this gives the example of an action on the same dimension, the lattice s n z to the n on the torus, which does not factorize through a finite quotient, right? So, these are the key examples to understand these methods. Well, now Well, now welcome to the store. So we're going to show you lots of things. First of things, there are rigidity results, like especially most of rigidity, well known for hyperbolic manifolds from dimension three on, plays a fundamental role in playing this, in proving the results. In proving these results. And then a little bit of more arithmetic or more Lie group theoretical Margulian superrigidity. So for example, if you take n equals 3 and you take a lattice in the diffeomorphism group and the manifold is compact, by most of rigidity, the There is a unique isometry which induces the homotopy class of this image in the diffeomorphism group. So this gives you a map from lambda to the isometry groups of M with that hyperbolic structure, and then it is known that the isometric group of such a thing is finite. So this is just of the case where it becomes less interesting, let's say, no? Less interesting, let's say. Although isometric groups of hyperbolic manifolds like these are as beautiful as jewels are. So here is the finite volume version. So if you take a discrete gamma and the isometric group of H3 of finite volume, then this is less trivial, but still a known result. Still, a known result that the normalizer of such a group is discrete. So, this is a, you can find it in Radcliffe's book about hyperbolic geometry. And the isometric group of the quotient is finite. A bit about Marguli super rigidity. So, if you get a lattice where you have G, a non-compact simple Lie group, ambient group. Lie group and group of this form. So, this ON1 and UN1. Then, for a group homomorphism with Sarisky dense image, then you have this dichotomy that either rho is the restriction of a continuous homomorphism from the ambient group, or rho has pre-compact image. And these are ways, especially the second part is algebraic group. Algebraic group way of thinking that the action is less interesting in a way. So there are further strategies to this. I'm going to be less detailed even on this for two strategies. So there's lots of hyperbolic and homogeneous dynamics in this proof. So there are ideas from operator algebras, especially. From operator algebras, especially Kazdan property T and since we know PRP's, for example, property tau, this also plays a role in this program. And here is just a keyword for this. So if you consider a discrete group with property three, which acts on a smooth compact surface by C1 diffeomorphism, then if you find a periodic orbit, then the action factorizes. orbit then the action factorizes by a finite quotient this being an example of the action being less interesting with the hypothesis of some dynamic input going to it so this is a more elaborated result which is um an intermediate step in in this work of brownfisher and urtado if you have a gamma with strong property t of la forg and Property T of LaForgue, and this is geometrical input yet again, sub-exponential growth of derivatives. Then the image preserves a smooth Riemannian metric. This being an example of putting an extra structure and then concluding that the action is less interesting with the help of an extra structure, right? Which in this case is a very interesting mixture of a Interesting mixture of dynamics, strong property T, and then a more differential geometric input, this sub-exponential growth of derivatives. And then there are the group of ideas which we are introducing in this context. So, being an algebraic topologist, I like to study actions from the comological point of view. And these are the exotic tools that we are going to put into this program. So, this is sort of a basic exercise with the spectral sequence. Yeah, I'm exotic in that community command. So, I'm exotic, so from outside into that sort of place. So, the pi-dical numbers as a group cannot act freely by homeomorphisms on a n-dimensional mod P homology sphere. So, this is probably the easiest statement. And the key word is that if you look at the very standard method of the SER spectral sequence for such an action, you will find that if the action will be free, If the action would be free, then the quotient map would rise the homological dimension by two. And this is something which is really, really odd. And that's why you discard this idea. And this is a very straightforward argument using the spectral sequence for a free action and the fact that the comology of the piadical numbers is what it is. So if anyone has more curiosity, Has more curiosity, I could just sketch it after the lecture. So, and their classical papers from the 50s by Jang and Bradon, which is like the very beginning of algebraic topological transformation groups, is that the same happens for effective actions. So, there are no effective actions of the parenticals on a n-dimensional homology sphere. And here is And here is something where you put stress on this. It is one of the first papers of Jean Pardon that there exists no effective action by homomorphisms of the p-adicals on a connected three-dimensional manifold. So this, I don't expect that you see the jump of ideas from the previous results to this, but it is very natural in the But it is very natural in the sense that it is comological, the argument that happens there. And this is in a very reductionistic way of seeing it, algebraic topology and comology going on there. This is, by the way, known as the Hilbert-Smith conjecture, and giving this result as a word of an invention paper. But the conclusion that I want to draw you from this From this part of the exhibition, it says that homological tools can be used to discard possible actions of groups like the pairicles. That's the. So, because you do by doing theory of transformation groups, that group actions decrease the dimension. Now, in that cannot be no, so that's the point, yeah. So, uh, and I mean, it will decrease dimension zero because this is dimension zero in a way, but this jump of rising the comological dimension, this is just something that it cannot be. So, that's the point of that. Um, so um, the thing is that the quotient map. thing is that the the the quotient map uh you're like using covers uh you can just think that if you get a a cover of the of the of the given um so given given a cover of the of the of the manifold or object before being acted um and given such a g-equivalent cover so you can go bring it to the quotient no and at least of comological dimension you can just go back and forth right so Back and forth, right? So in this, so in this case, just homological dimension cannot rise. So that's the point of this argument, right? So here are more comological tools. These are like known to graduate student topologists, I would say. So if a space which has a either finite homology never degree or or a general bound on the dimension of being a CW, for example, then but more generally affinitistic space. If you consider a finite group of order P acting on it, if the mod P homology of the space is the homology of a point, then the fixed point says point then the fixed point set has the homology of a point so this is one one of the key results there and the same happens for a homology sphere and the fixed point set is a homology sphere of a dimension not greater than the original one um theorem and this is a a nice uh theorem of of um of people using a group homology on on on this result so On this result. So, if you take a group like Cp to the power of R and it acts freely on S1, then R is less than K. So, this is also a result proven directly with just considerations of compology. And could not be equal in particular. So, acting freely, that's the point. Well, it's oh, sorry, then it includes equal. Sorry, yes. So less than equal. And so following these ideas, if you get an extension of a finite p group, G by C to the K, and well, if you have an extension and gamma is torsion. If you have an extension and gamma is torsion-free, sorry, then the p-rank of g is less or equal than k. It's also less or equal here, right? So, and I assume that this is also acting on S1 to decay over there. So, the consequence, if a finite group acts effectively on a three-dimensional torus by isometries, then the P-rank of such a Then the P rank of such a group is strictly less than three. So, this is also a result how the P rank of groups acting on these spaces effectively by isometries, then you get into restrictions of what the group algebraically is. And this is obtained just with Obtained just with the help of combology arguments. Less trivial is the fact that the same result holds for nil and solve manifolds in the same dimensions. And this is actually going to appear in the arguments. And algebraically, such finite groups are well classified. So people People tell that there are consequences of Bieberbach theorem. So the groups which act effectively, final groups which act effectively on Nil and Solz manifolds of given dimensions, they're very often very rigid classifiers. So let me recall one of the examples I presented. So we have the PSLNR acting on the projective SLNR acting on the projective real projective space and then the action preserves the lattice. So the group of affine dipomorphism of the torus acts transitively on the torus and it preserves the affine structure. And if you remember, this shows the existence of an action of this lattice on the torus, which does not factorize to affinite quotients, right? So the generalization. So, the generalization, and this brings us to the geometric structures we are thinking, include Lie groups which fix a geometric structure on RN. For instance, these groups with given signature and the affine groups, and the feomorphism which fix a measured toretic structure. So, we are going to study this on three manifolds and then Manifolds and then fixing sort of the geometry instead of this other data. Also in a very general setting, this has a formulation in the sense of rigid geometric structures, which is something I won't talk about. So, but Romov calls these two examples rigid geometric structures. Rigid geometric structures. Okay, so now let me go to the continuous versions of the CMR program. So the C0 version, it should be down, this zero. So acts for the behavior of group homomorphism from a discrete group, now not to the set of diff to the. To the group of diffusers, but to the group of homeomorphisms. And it is a remark by Schmuel Weinberger on some proceedings on the SIMER program, that one should, in a way, consider other kinds of homeomorphism, like belief sheets, holder. Belip sheets, holder, or whatever. And we just follow with this kind of talks here. So the conjecture is that if you consider n greater or equal than three and the rank less than n minus one, this is the situation of the rank being greater than the dimension. Than the dimension. Then, and if you consider an aspherical dimensional dimensional topological manifold, then every group homomorphism going from a Heiger-Rank lattice, Heiger Rand meaning higher than the dimension of the manifold, factorized through a finite quotient, right? So this is the kind of results that we are going to address. That we are going to address, but giving it a metrical twist. So instead of considering homeomorphisms, we are going to consider isometries, but having in mind the other kind of homeomorphisms that could appear of a more metric nature for a metric space. Okay, so there is a result which was the last Was the last result in the direction of the continuous version and three manifolds. So, this is due to far well-shallen. If you get a three-dimensional irreducible manifold and an irreducible lattice of real rank greater than two, if gamma has an infinite image in the general linear group of the homology, then the following version of the SIMER program holds. Similar program holds. Then M is homeomorphic to the torus, so this is very restrictive and just valid for Euclidean geometry. Then gamma is a finite index subgroup of SL3 set. And the action is isotopic to the standard SL3 set action. So in a way, this is with the viewpoint of homology, this is as far as you can go. You only have a theoretical You only have a theorem for tori in a way and tori geometry or Euclidean geometry. So, we are going to state a continuous and metric variation of this similar problem and able to prove a result like that, which holds for all geometries, not only for the torus. So, as I told you, it's going to be a little rigid, not only for the Plideon one. Rigid, not only for the Euclidean one. And the formulation permits a generalization to metric geodesic spaces which are close to three-dimensional manifolds. So three manifolds and the torston geometrization. So any, as a consequence of geometrization, any closed-oriented prime tree manifold can be cut along tori such that the interior has a geometric structure. And there are the ones with constant curvature, which are With constant curvature, which are the Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical. There are the ones which are products, which is S2 times R, the easiest of all geometries we learned this week, H2 times R. And there are the three fiber geometric structures, which are the universal cover of SL2, Niel, and SR. And for closed manifolds, there is at most one. Closed manifolds, there is at most one geometric structure. If you make it weaker, for instance, finite volume, then one might have many, for example, the complement of the triple knot. And for manifolds of infinite volume, then there may be really a lot of geometric structures on the same infinite volume manifold. So, and this is a nice illustration of the eighth Torstone geometry. Illustration of the eight torston geometries. This comes from this archive preprint over there, but it's really, really nice. Okay, so here is the main theorem. So consider a simply connected and homogeneous tree manifold and consider a discrete group of isometries such that the volume is finite. Then, and this is really And this is really, in a way, sort of really straightforward from the general theory of three manifolds. Then the isometry of the quotient is a finite group if you have H3 or sol as the manifold that you're putting the geometry on, then the isometry groups. Then the isometry groups of X modulo gamma is a finite extension of S1 for these three cases, nil H2 cross R, S2 cross R. Then the isometry group of the quotient is a closed subgroup of SO4, if you begin with the S3. But general warning is that the isometry of this quotient can change a lot within the same geometric structure. A lot within the same geometric structure. For example, there are groups for which the isometry of the quotient is trivial, but the isometry of S3 is O4. And especially this spherical case, it has a warning that I'm going to state precisely in the end. So this is just the determination of the isometric groups of the quotients. And these may be an And this may be an orbifold in the general case. So this is not always the isometric group of a manifold, but rather than an orbifold. And this is an algebraic determination of the isometry groups of the orbifold quotients that you get there. In the what? In the Euclidean case, then it is very rigid. So what you get is So what you get is that the quotient of such things are basically the three-dimensional crystallographical groups of the quotient in a way. And this is a complete classification for that. Okay. So here is the, but we are using the we're giving a result which is going to appeal to the to the SIMR program. To the SIMER program. So, fundamental for us is this theorem, which we state as a dichotomy. So, if you have a discrete group of isometries of any of these three-dimensional manifolds, H2 times R, SL2R, or nil, then either gamma projects to a discrete group of isometries of the base or the orifle has infinite volume, right? And moreover, in the case of solar. And moreover, in the case of sol and product s2 times r, then the projection to the base is always discrete. And this is a long case-by-case argument using first the comological classifications of gamma and nil, which goes through the P rank and sold. Then in S2 times error, as already pointed out, so there is the papers by Tolevson. So there is the papers by Tolevson and many others, which sort of already classified even group actions on this very easy example of three manifolds. And then in the other ones, there are direct arguments which just involve hyperbolic geometry of the plane, like considering how the isometries acts in the factors of H2 times R or in the universal cover of SL2R. Cover of SL2R and then you get the result. So here is the consequence which I would like to state as the simul program for metric with a metric statement for three manifolds. So if you consider a non-uniform lattice in a Lie group without compact factors and rank higher than three, I will put, so this is an example. Will put. So, this is an example of the rank being higher and concluding less interesting in a way. And we assume that this acts on a three-dimensional Riemannian orbit fold as before, then the action factors through a finite curve, right? So, and this is a theorem of the first kind, telling if you let the rank go higher than the dimension, then the action factors to a finite group. And here is a corollary. And here is a corollary, so the isometrical version of Jesse and Weinberger's. So any group action of SLR with R greater or equal than three on a closed spherical three manifold by isometries, factors to a finite group. So this is first corollary that we get, in a way, really the isometric version of that result. And here is And here is the story about the spherical geometry. So if you consider every semi-simple Lie group such that the product is G times SO4 is isotypic, and this is a technical definition from actually algebraic groups, meaning that it has a complexification whose simple factors are located. Whose simple factors are locally isomorphic, meaning any product like this, which each GJ is one of SO31 or SO22 or SO4C, then there is an irreducible lattice and a homomorphism out of this lattice to S4 with dense image. So these are the only lattices of higher rank in quotation marks which appear here. Quotation marks which appear here, and higher rank means greater than two in this case. And so if a semi-simple Lie group has a complexification whose simple factors are locally isomorphic, then the group is called isotypic. And this is the more general result. So if you consider a geometric three-orbital of finite volume, then X admits an isometric action of higher rank lattice. Remember, that means Higher rank lattice, remember that means a greater than or equal to two, if and only the group isometry of X contains the group SO3. And then in this case, this Lie group is isotypic, meaning that it comes from the products mentioned before, and the lattice is uniform. So SO4 factors locally as this product. So this is just like a bundle of bundle of of uh so3 so3 principal bundle so the base space the total space sorry and in fact there is a copy of so3 inside so4 uh so this previous uh colorary includes um examples like s3 modulo lambda and s2 times r modulo lambda right so these being the ones of of higher higher rank there um okay Okay, and then the last part of the talk. So, there are orbifolds, which are singular spaces which come from group actions, for instance, on manifolds. But there are also singular spaces, so-called Alexandrov spaces, which are close to three-dimensional manifolds, but in a Gromov-Hausdorff way of thinking, right? Yes. Yes, so the idea from algebraic topology go mainly on the nil and sol case. So all of other arguments are admit theory and that kind of things, right? So the hyperbolic case in a way is classical because it mostly comes from most of rigidity. And well the And well, the the like the important uh point are these um this these uh results so um in particular the the so this dichotomy is proven this using the classification uh in these cases okay so now so we're going to push it uh further in a way that means That means these orbifolds are close to three manifolds because they come from group actions, but there are also spaces which are very close to them in a Gromov-Haudor sense. So these are Alexander spaces, which are complete geodesic metric spaces for which there is a comparison property in the sense of comparison geometry. You know, this is the two-dimensional manifold. The two-dimensional manifold of constant curvature k. And for every geodesic triangle and a comparison triangle in Mk, so this inequality holds. So this is in a way bounded by below. Geometry of curvature bounded by below. So examples include complete Riemannian manifolds of sectional curvature with a With a bound below. So, if you find a convex body in a run, there exists some k such that the boundary has the comparison property tk. So, cones and suspensions here leaving the world of even topological manifolds can be given a metric with this property. Grom of outdoor limits, so especially in the fixing the diameter and given a Diameter and given a lower covator bond, then what you get at the end is by Gromov Haudor are these examples of Alexandrov space. And quotients of compactly a group actions by a metrics, not necessarily free actions on Alexander spaces with this property, they remain with this property. And And so the methods over there is that there exists a notion of angle between geodesics, direction spaces instead of tangent spaces. There exists regular points which have space of direction as three, and the other ones which have a cone over RP2. And the starting point of this project was that there is no classification of these Alexander spaces and metage geometers just wanted. meteor geometers just wanted to know and they asked for for seeing what we could prove um so and even in the simply connected three-dimensional case there are like conferences of alexander spaces and communities which are trying to classify them and um well the a the the group theory of isometric uh groups is plays a role in this project but also the A role in this project, but also the algebraic topology and other projects did something there. So, first, results: the group of isometries of such a space is a Lie group of at most this dimension, where n is the dimension of the space. So, in the specific case of three-dimensional Alexander space, there exists a geometrization argument over there. So, and this is how we are going to push our results for. We are going to push our results for three manifolds and the rubifolds to these spaces. So, here is the corollary. If you get a locally compact topological group which acts faithfully on this three-dimensional Alexander space by homomorphism, then there are no strange examples. Sorry. So, then this G is going to be a Lie group. A LI group. So, in particular, this community of Alexandro of Geometry were really surprised that we could discard the pairical so easily. But we did it just going through the three manifold case, seeing that the orbifold was exactly the same, and quoting John Pardon's result with homology. So, in particular, this was interesting to them because we sort of discard that the periodicals cannot That the p aticals cannot, for instance, cannot appear as the isometric groups of such a sort of singular space over there. And I will rather stop here. So thank you. Is this like some sort of passing through the ideas of Hilbert's problem? Isn't it of what? Of Hilbert's pink problem. Yeah, no, I don't know the number, but this Hilbert Smith conjecture over there inside. So, and well, Hilbert-Smith problem. Yes, I mean, it enters, for instance, in like Gromov even proves that the isometry groups of such a Gromov-Haudor limit is a Lie group using the Hilbert. It's a Lie group using the Hilbert fifth problem in a way. So these kind of methods appear there. Yes.
