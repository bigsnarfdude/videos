And come to Canada. Now I see many familiar faces in the room as well as many familiar names in the Zoom chat. And hello, everyone. So the topic of my talk today is periodic commodization for dynamical 542. It's sort of on the boundary of the main theme of this workshop, and I will try to make it accessible to everyone. And the purpose of this talk is to have an attempt trying to combine two limiting procedures. Combine two limiting procedures. One is called homogenization, and the other is called renormalization in singular STDs. And we try to combine or put these two limiting procedures into one single problem and see what's going on. And the plan of this talk is going to be three parts. So at first, we will introduce some examples of singular stochastic PDEs and see what type of limiting procedure we have there. Namely, you have a small parameter called delta. A small parameter called delta, which is the regularization parameter, and then you analyze the limits at delta going to zero. And second, I will introduce what periodic homogenization is. There is another small parameter called epilep in this type of problem, which describes the oscillation of the main operator of the differential equation. And the main problem in homogenization is to try to analyze the limit at epsilon going to zero. Epson going to zero. And now we have two different parameters with two different limiting procedures, and we try to put them into one single problem and see what's going on. And we sort of start with a toy model that combines both. That's the dynamical 542. So that's the plan of the talk today. So I'll start with some singular stochastic TDEs. There are three equations I listed here, very common in probability. The first one probability the first one is the kpz equation it's a one plus one dimensional function h it sort of can describe the interface between two different materials for example if you have a paper at hand and then you you you burn the fire at the bottom of this paper and the flame is going up so the function h at time t and position x is to describe the height of the interface at The height of the interface at this time and this location. So that's what's described by the KGZ equation. And the other thing is the dynamical 54D model, and D denotes the dimension. It sort of can describe the fluctuation of a magnetic field near the critical temperature. For example, if we have a magnetic ion in the very low temperature room, then it's pretty much magnetized. And then if the room temperature is very, very low, And then, if the room temperature is very, very high, it's gonna losing its magnetization. So, you can imagine that as the temperature is going from low to high, there is a critical temperature around which it's going to lose its magnetization. So, the fluctuation of the field will be very interesting around that critical temperature. And 54D can be supposed to describe the fluctuation of the field near the critical temperature. And also, there is a called parabolic Anderson model, which I don't give details. Pollock-Anderson model, which I don't give details, but it also has some motivation from probabilistic models. And so these three FPDEs have one single feature, namely that they are all singular. To see how their singularity is, we see that there is an external term Kai in the first two equations, and then there is an external term Eda in the third equation. And so Kai is D space-time white noise in D-dimensional. Space-time white noise in d-dimensional space, and eta is the white noise in space only. And we sort of list the irregularities here. We see the irregularities, they are very singular. So if we measure it in parabolic metric, then casai only has regularity in minus d over 2 minus 1 or slightly less, and either has negative regularity minus d half and slightly less. So these three equations are parabolic equations. So parabolic equations. So, parabolic equation, the main part of it is the heat operator, and we know heat operator has a regularizing or smoothing property. So, if your input has certain regularity, then the output has this regularity plus two. So, for example, for the KGZ equation in dimension one, we see that Kazi has regularity almost minus three half in dimension one. And so, as a consequence of this smoothing effect on the heat kernel, we expect. Effect on the heat kernel, we expect the solution h to be holder a half minus. And so if h is holder a half minus, then we have a dh then we have a dh in the equation. So dh is expected to be at most holder minus a half minus. So it's one derivative less than h. And we see that there is a product between two dh and since dh is a distribution, you can't take product. So the meaning of this equation is unclear. Product. So the meaning of this equation is unclear. And the same is for the PI4G model. And we see that for Phi 4D, we take this regularity of Ta-Sai, and phi is supposed to be twice more regular or two more regularity than Ta Psi. So phi is supposed to be one minus D over two that regularity. And if D is two or three, then this regularity is below zero. So you can't multiply distributions which have singularity below zero. So you can't do that. Can do that. So IQ also has a problem. And in the third parabolic end of the model, there is also a problem between the product of U and Eda. There is also a problem in that. So the common problem is that the solution, since the noises are too singular, so the solutions are too singular for the product to be well defined. And we see on all these equations, there is a constant C on the right-hand side. The right-hand side. So, when you multiply singular distribution, so infinity appears. So, as a consequence, you sort of know that you need in order to let these equations to be well defined, you also need to take this constant C to be infinity. And there is a rigorous procedure of doing that. So we modify the noise cosine and either at a small scale delta. At a small scale delta. So, for example, you take a modifier and rescale it at a small scale delta, and you compose this rescale modifier with the singular noise psi or eta, then you actually get a smooth noise, cosi delta, and eta delta. So for every delta, these noises are smooth. And so all the solutions, H delta, phi delta, and U delta are well defined for every positive delta. And there the problem is that as delta going to zero, things will not converge. Things will not converge. So, you can't multiply two distributions. So, if you multiply two smooth functions, the approximating distribution, things will be blowing up as the approximation is going to zero. And then there is a general theorem developed by Martin Kairo in the theory of regulatory structures and also Kubernetes in Keller and Kerkovsky with the paracontrol. This general theorem says that in all these three situations and beyond those things, through a much wide class of equations, To a much wide class of equations, you can take this constant C delta going to infinity as delta going to zero in such a way that all the solutions converge at delta going to zero. And furthermore, the limit does not depend on the preset regularization procedure. So whatever approximation you take, Kazai delta you take to Kai, the limit is all the same. So in this case, you can actually define the limit to be the solution to these equations. To be the solution to this equation. And that's just a sort of a table showing how large each delta is in all these three cases. But it's not going to be relevant for the talk later. And a remark which will be important later is that we see the main part here are all the main part of the operators in space are all Laplacians. And an important remark, which will be used later, is that you can actually replace Laplacian. You can actually replace Laplacian by a divergence operator where A is the coefficient matrix, which is smooth and uniformly elliptic. So even if you replace Laplacian by variable coefficients with the divergent form, so as long as it's uniformly elliptic and A has enough regularity, we expect all these theorems also to be true. The only difference is that the C deltas will depend on the location X. Will depend on the location x as well. So they won't be near constants, they will depend on the locations as well. So that's a general statement for singular STDs. And what we know is that in these cases, there is a small parameter delta going to zero, and you need to do some renormalization procedure in the limit process. Okay, so next we turn to periodic homogenization. And in this case, there is also a small parameter which called epsilon. We consider Epsilon, we consider a linear equation. It's actually not non-linear, it's actually only a linear equation, a linear parabolic equation with the divergence operator at the main part. The difference between the previous one is that we, this alterator, the coefficient A here is highly oscillatory at scale epsilon. And we also assume A is bounded uniformly elliptic and also one periodic in the sense that if you move. Logic in the sense that if you move A along that is side one, then meaning that A that's plus EI equals to AX for all I between one and D. It's sort of one periodic. And so the main question is: and now we see that A is periodic and And now we see that A is perotic and it oscillates very widely. We actually can see that this A divided by epsilon will actually weakly converge to its average on the torus. And the main question here is that since epsilon going to zero, this coefficient A epsilon will converge weakly. So what's the behavior of U epsilon as epsilon goes to zero? Of u epsilon as epsilon goes to zero. So that's the main question. And the answer is that A is going to average in a weak way, and U epsilon will actually converge to U, where you solve the electric PDE with the constant coefficient matrix A bar. So A bar is a constant matrix not. And the important thing is that A bar is actually not equal to the average of A. To the average of A. So that's the main statement in theoretic homogenization. So as that time goes to zero, things will converge. And the interesting thing is that the limiting equation is not the one, one would not even guess. There is a correction. So the main statement in this case will be that u-adson will actually converge weakly in H1D to a limiting function u, where you solve the parabolic. Solve the parabolic equation where the coefficient matrix in the elliptic operator is not the average A of A. It's rather the average of A with some corrections, which we call chiy. So that's sort of the take-home message in that there is a limiting procedure and the limit is not the same as the one you expect. And so here are some remarks. So here we only present the linear equation, but the theory is also well developed for non-linear. Is also well developed for nonlinear ones. As long as the right-hand side, you don't have the derivatives of u on the right-hand side. So, for good nonlinear assays, you can also do it. And here, there is only a convergence result. Recently, there is a quantitative theory developed by Fang Hua Ling and Zhang Wei Sheng, saying that the convergence from U atom to U can be quantified very explicitly. And there is also a very active field called. A very active field called stochastic homogenization, which people deal with where this coefficient A is not periodic, it's rather random. And there recently, there are quantitative theories of this stochastic homogenization developed by two groups of people, by Gloria Otto and also John Cooty and Mohat. And now we have introduced two different things. One is the renormalization procedure in singular SPDEs, where you have a delta, parameter delta going to zero, and then there is the homogenization. And then there is the homogenization where you have an oscillation parameter epsilon in the coefficient going to zero. And we try to combine both in one single problem. And the way or the model, so the most natural model we look at is actually you take all your familiar singular FTDs and replace the Laplace operator by this highly authentic diversion three. Haley alternate is diverging from elliptic operators. So that's the three singular SPD we listed before. Then what we do is that we replace Laplacian by the divergence operator where the coefficient A epsilon is highly oscillatory. So as long as A is smooth or A has certain regularity, then for 6 epsilon, the solution to these things are not a problem at delta to zero. So the problem becomes zero so the problem becomes occurs when you send epsilon and delta to zero simultaneously or in first order and now we have two parameters there are actually two natural or two extreme ways to take limits the first one is that you fix delta when you fix delta everything on the right hand side is smooth and then you send epsilon to zero first which means you do the homogenization procedure first and then as soon as you have a homogenization As soon as you have a homogenous limit, you take delta to zero then, which is sort of a singular FPDE. And the second way of taking limits is that you fix the epsilon, you take delta going to zero first, which is sort of the singular FPDE renormalization procedure. And then as soon as you get a singular limit, you perform a homogenization procedure. So a natural question is that if we conform these ways, do the limits exist? And if they do exist, are they equal? They do exit, are they equal? Are they equal? So we try to look at or try at least formally explain what happens in the two procedures. So if you take homogenization first, which means it's epsilon to zero first, and then renormalization delta to zero second. I don't think it's explicitly written as a statement in the literature, but I think it's sort of. But I think it's sort of well expected because if you fix positive delta, so as long as delta is positive, everything on the right-hand side is going to be smooth. And we know how to deal with homogenization with smooth right-hand side. So if you fix delta and send epsilon going to zero, that's going to be very standard periodic homogenization. So you get a singular SPDE with the parameter delta and with the constant theta operator. Heat operator, say Al epsilon, and the constant heat operator, say AL equals divergence, A bar times gradient. You get a homogenized limit. And now, since this A bar is constant, we also know how to deal with singular SPDEs with constant elliptic operator. That's sort of quite standard singular SPDE theory today. SPD theory today. So at least in one order of the limits, we formulate, no, there are standard ways to deal with this. So now it happens. Now the question is that what's going to happen in the other side? What if we fix epsilon positive and send delta to zero, but then since as soon as A has a little bit regularity or as soon as A has some regularity, I believe it's also doable. It's also doable that we can send delta to zero first. That's the singular SPD renormalization procedure as soon as you have a nice coefficient A of epsilon. Since A is nice and you fix epsilon, so this may all future is nice. There should be no problem of doing that. And the second, and so we confirm this case in 54D with D equal to 2. And now, so the problem becomes. And now, so the problem becomes the second. So, when you have a singular limit and then you want to take the homogenization procedure of sending epsilon to zero, what's going to happen? And that's the main question we're going to deal with. And at the first step, we did this 54D part with D equal to. So, and also before I present our main results, I'll try to explain the key difficulty of key difficulties of doing this part. So when you already have delta equal to zero with the singular limit, what's going to be diff well what's going to be different when you take at once going to zero? That's sort of you are doing a singular SPDE with with very with homogenized with with very oscillatory coefficients. That's sort of a homogenization problem for singular SPDE. And so the first difficulty is that there is no uniform meaning at once. There is no uniformly in epsilon shelter estimates for the heat operator. Even if A is smooth, there is just no such estimate uniformly in epsilon. And it actually can be seen from the following example. So no matter how smooth F is, U epsilon actually has at most one spatial derivative. It can't have more than one derivative uniformly in epsilon. So that's an evidence saying that shoulder estimate cannot be true in this case. So even In this case, so even if A is smooth, u epsilon can have a multiple derivative. It's even not regularizing. So, for example, when F has two derivatives, U epsilon cannot have two derivatives uniformly in epsilon. That's one thing. And the other thing is that, so there is a solution uncast in both types of the problem saying that you need to guess what the solution is before you are able to solve the problem. That's the solution uncast is the true skill. solution on thought is the two-scale expansion in epsilon in the homogenization problem and also the tailor-like expansion in regularity structures when we have these two singularities interacting with each other together it's unclear what the solution on that will be and now so in order but then in the 542 case in the 54 case which i'm assuming too the second one won't be a problem because because it sort of beat Because it's sort of the fast singular PDE in the so the synchronous singular FPDEs in the singular regime. And so we, as the first example, we studied this model. And that's the dynamic of 542. I should add that this dimension, this dimension equals 2. So we take a standard 542 and replace its main oxytocin plus 1 by the highly oscillatory coefficient L epsilon. Coefficient L alpha. And in joint work in progress with our PhD student E. Ling Chen, we obtained the following theorem: namely, that in this case of 542, you are indeed able to switch the order of the limits, and the limits are indeed the same. And so that's what we can obtain so far. And I think that provides a first sort of toy model or first example when you combine homogenized. When you combine homogenization and renormalization in one single problem. And I think time is almost up. I'll quickly explain what we or mention what's the natural next step. So in the previous theorem, we only obtained that when you can take the two orders of limits and the limits coincide. And now the natural next step is to have a quantitative estimate for phi epsilon delta minus phi for the different. Epsilon delta minus five for the difference between the limits at epsilon and delta going to zero simultaneously in arbitrary ways. And in that case, we actually need an audit expansion in terms of epsilon and delta. That's also working progress. Now, the more challenging things is that we are doing what currently we are doing is 542 is sort of the least singular one in the singular SPD regime. Now, the next challenging thing is sort of trying to go into more singular regimes. And in that case, Regimes, and in that case, it's not clear what's going to happen. Things actually can go either way, so it either can converge or either can diverge. It's actually not clear for us now. So, we are trying to figure that out. And third thing is that we are dealing with periodic homogenization, and it is also natural to put the coefficient A being random and independent of the randomness in the noise, and ask what happens in this case. That's sort of going. And in this case, that's sort of going to be stochastic homogenization with singular random force. Yeah, so I think I'll stop here and thank you very much for your attention. Yeah, thanks a lot. Time the recording off. We started a bit.
