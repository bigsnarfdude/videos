Thank you for letting me report our recent experimental study on the mechanical property of living cells. So as usual, the real work done by my postdoc students, so let me just mention them. First, Dr. Dong Su Guan, who's my former student postdoc now in the Institute of Mechanics in Beijing. In the United States of Mechanics in Beijing. The second one, Yusang Shen. He's my postdoctoral. He's now at UC Davis. He's the second postdoctoral. My current student, the Tao L in Physics. In addition, I work with my colleagues in my university, Professor Rei Zhang, who's the theorist, and also I work with Ping Behuang, Cao Jin, Ming Jie. Jin, Mingjie, they are all biologists in life science division. And finally, Peking Lai from Central University Taiwan, who's also a series working on modeling. So let me just, for this audience, I just quickly run through the first, the leaving cell really is very soft, extremely soft. It's on the Extremely soft, it's on the lower end of this spectrum, and typically we are talking about kilopascal, maybe 100 Pascal. Um, this for the strains, the other thing I want to emphasize, the living cell, it's not a solid, uh, it's not liquid either. It's sort of in the middle, so we have to deal with visual elasticity. I will tell you what that meant. And of course, the living cell has. The living cell has hierarchy structures, start from proteins all the way, organelles, and all the way to tissues. The other thing, in the living cells, we have all kinds of networks and people, previous speakers already mentioned here, mentioned, for example, microtubes, acting, these acting elements, ER network, and because of that, And because of that, the cells are highly heterogeneous system. You put the small particle diffusion, then you will see they have different diffusivities. Finally, it's a living matter. So what I meant is there are some motors which constantly apply contractile forces on this active network. So because of that, So, because of last thing, so we have to this system very complex with a rich area of physical elastic behaviors. So, today I'm trying to, there are many studies being done, and most of them take out this individual component, study one at a time, in vitro. Then, I think what we need to know is put all the knowledge together and to see. Together, and to see what's a coarse-grained description of a living cell. And then from there, we start with to build the model for tissues. So let me just, I'm an experimentalist. I'm just telling you some real experimental challenges that work. First, we say extremely soft. We have to deal with find a sensitive device to measure it. Also, the sales, there are some clean. Cells, there are some clean cells, there are some very sticky cells. So, we have to deal with surface heating. Well, and the previous speaker, the surface very fragile, you put a sharp tip there, you just destroy the structure. And if we want to deal with a living matter, you have to deal with water. Most device we invent for mechanical measurement for dry area, dry condition. So we have to. Dry condition, so we have to work out a way to deal with water. And finally, we need a theoretical model, and like we do rheology, the geometry matters, and also we need a very concrete mathematical modeling, independent of the details of a mechanical property. But people tried all kinds of things. Now you can see local from AFM, you can see magnetic twister. You can do magnetic twister, magnetic tweeters, optical tweeters, these aspirations. I mean, people try different types of things. And they all claim some success. But if you compare all the numbers, you will see people get the modulus of a living cell all the way from 100 Pascal to 2000 kilo Pascal. It's wide variety, and many measurements simply say, Well, everything's wiggle, but experimentally, we need an absolute number, and I will just tell you really how do we do these things. And so let me just focus on the AFM, which I'm going to use. People are tried with sharp tape here, with cylinders, with sphere. And the typical way you do is if you have a sphere, you assume it's a Hershing component. Here, you assume it's a hurging contact. And then you use a formula, this person ratio for cell, which is 0.5. So this is just a number. R is the radius, you know. And theta is what the indentation you measure. And from that curve, you fit, you get an amplitude, which goes as E, that's the modulus. And let me just later on we'll show you the cells more complex. This is not just a number. It's not just a number. There are issues associated with FM. First, the tape is so sharp, sometimes it's penetrating through it, and then you do not know what you're measuring. There are some uncertainties about the contact. If the surface is soft and if your indentation is small, then you have to worry about the contact point. But most important thing, we are lacking of a model. Of a model, all the things that people are using, Hearth, JKR, whatever, it's all assumed sales pure elastic. And we will show you it's not pure elastic. And the way they tell you normally is the force at the indentation, that's you they use to measure the first, there's a speed dependent. So the modulator can now be a speed dependent. And normally they don't tell you, they just select. They don't tell you, they just select one particular speed, they just measure. And the part of the reason people use a different speed, of course, they have different modules. The other thing is, now you can see if it's a pure thing, you move in the one thing, the rising or receding should be the same. And here you have a hysteresis. So, these are the characteristics, and we have to figure out the way what's going on there. And also, what I'm saying, like in the reality. What I'm saying, like in a rheology measurement, first you want to have a very defined geometry. With that geometry, you want to have an accurate theoretical modeling to know what exactly you measure. There are different ways to think. And here I'm just trying to tell you: with a colloidal probe, you do an indentation and with a combined AFM technology, we can measure a relaxation. A relaxation modulus. From there, we could understand how the cell functions. And this, I hope, will provide an experimental platform. You can use that to study cancer cells, study tissues, study different things. I will mention a few applications. So, our original work is getting published here. So let me tell you some experimental results here. Since first, you have we grew our own glass spheres on the AFM cantilever. Everything's micromanipulator. You have to do it under microscope. I will skip that part. Typically, we put 10 micron particles glue on the cantilever. We coated this surface and the cantilever with different types of coat. Is different types of coating that basically is trying to be inert, not get it sticky. And there are some cell living cells that secrete certain proteins always sticky. Then we just stay away. That we need some theory to really deal with how to include adhesion into the measurement. But let's start with that with negligible adhesion. And we keep the maximum, you know, a few micron indentation so that. The indentation so that the deformation is not too big. We can use a linear elasticity to work on the things. So, the first measurement we do is that just imagine you can just instantaneously apply the indentation, face number string, data. And then you can see how the force relax. That's a typical. Force relax. That's a typical relaxation modulus. You measure in practice. We have to apply a certain indentation speed. Typically, we do fast. In the lab, we can do 100 micron per second. I will tell you how the speed dependence thing. But now, this sort of typical curve when you apply a certain strain, the force increase. You set, with FM, you can set, and now you. Fm, you can set, and then you can watch out the relaxation. And then, so we are we said time equal to zero is basically peak position. You normalize by the maximum force, F0, you put the end, and that's the force is the strain, relative strain times modulus. You really see the normalized modulus at the function time. And here is log, log, log for the things and that's we see initially there's an exponential. Essentially, there's an exponential decay that's typically millisecond level, and then there's a long parallel relaxation. But the system does not relax to zero. There's a finite constant value there. And this typical spread, I mean, you live with living cells. There's always cell-cell variations here. I'm just telling you that we typically try 10 cells. We typically try 10 cells, and then you have a mean, and then you can that's basically your R mass. You have somewhat slower, that's the experimental uncertainty. We try 10 different types, cell types. There's same line, the cell lines, there's some primary cells. You try differently, all can be described by the same relaxation. There's exponential component mode. Component model mode. There's a power law. We put a one plus there to separate that exponential degree of finally. There's a constant. This are the fit. And this for different cell types, we have different values. There's one thing here. I mean, we can only so far initiate the ratio, 30%. For example, here for HALA sale. Here for Hala cell, one-third is from this mode, and 56% from this. There's a residual part, typical relaxing times, two or three millisecond. The exponent alpha, typically between smaller than 0.5 and maybe 0.2, 0.3. So that's the value. But there's we're missing here this overall. Here, this overall value, when time equals to zero, the maximum value that we didn't measure, so we have to measure that part. So the way you do, so that's one approach. The other protocol you do is normally you just do an indentation with a constant speed. You lower your probe, contact, and then you see this. You start with zero, and then eventually you. To zero, and then eventually you get hurting-like contact, and here's different speed. We saw the same thing, but you can see here, this is the measure of adhesion. So, we try hard to make sure and minimize the heating. The heating means the thing, the reason you have negative force because something is pulling down, and that's part of the heating. If you take one particular curve, Take one particular curve you want to fit, you can fit, and then you get a module. And what you can see, the higher speed, the modules are bigger. As you may relax, because this things keep relaxing, you do fast enough, the thing is not relaxed yet, and your module is bigger. So we start with first model, and here this double constant anymore. So you have a Constant anymore, so you have a time. How do you do? The way to do is there's if you assume a linear visco elasticity superposition, you can do a time integral. So that's the standard reality. You can take the time-dependent part here, get the indentation as a function time. In our case, which is constant, indentation is function times linear with velocity. Times linear with velocity there. So you put the end, and all you can, with this formula, we can get a modified hearse. Namely, the original form is there with E here replaced by the E0 at time equal to zero. And then there's a time dependent constant, the dependent constant here. There's no budget factor, it's all you measure. And then, in fact, you. And then, in fact, you can put this equation there and finish the integration. And you have this complex form, but nonetheless, it's known. So, magically, now this is a new formula. You plot force divided by this C star. There's no experimental such factor, we just divide it. Let's calculate. We just divide it. Let's calculate. You measure on the same cell, and all the cells collapse, all the curves collapse into a uniform thing. And that uniform one is just this part. By fitting this with one parameter, E0, you can get 3.56 kilopascal. And then once you measure this, then the different component part, you just multiply the fraction part and you can get all the module moduli of all different three components. Of all different three components. So, to make sure we really understand the speed dependent, I just show you finished the speed dependent. Now we also want to do it to make sure there's a hysteresis. But for hysteresis, your D at delta is a function time. You get the approaching curve with constant speed. And then when you pull, just you just the relaxing, when you start here, then you have a. When you start here, then you have his. So, this part is from here. You put this thing in, get that thing, and then you can get hystolysis curve. So, we understand both speed dependent and hystoesis-dependent. And now, there's a typical way when I say we want to do an infinite fast experiment. There's no infinite. So, you just do different speed. Okay, we can do it. I mean, I can tell you, so different speed, we can all fit. So, really, with this formula. So, really, with this formula, we solve all the time dependent so long as you measure that time relaxation modulus correctly. So, let me just quickly go over what's the meaning of each component. The first one is we have a network. This is a cytoskeleton network in general. In general, the what we say is the time here is the mesh size is a diffusive relaxation of a settle across the different across the network which match size A0. So the diffuse typical size, the match size 2 nanometer, typical diffusion is this number you put there is 0.6 2.7 millisecond. The other thing you want The other thing you want to know is time, also amplitude. For amplitude, we have a match size. You squeeze this, that's basically bound density. That's modulus unit. That's typically, if you don't have any association, you can get the 1 kBT divided by that unit volume. And then you can get about 500 Pascal. That's a typical order magnitude misestimate on both the time. On both the time and the relaxation modulus. If you want to find time, indeed, this is about two or three, maybe five millisecond. You want to see the component in absolute value. It's around 500 plus minus another 500 Pascal. So this estimate explains what's the first component of the modulus. Of the modulus. Now, let's go back to the second one. The second one, normally people, this is the parallel rheology typically refer. In this, I will just tell you what's the relation between E of T and G of omega. But just let you know, the people already know that thing by measuring the oscillatory complex share. To start a complex shear modulus. Now we, with this thing, now we have a time toll. This basic relaxation, the deform, when you indent the cell, the set of skeleton network deform, that deform network relax. And then there are many routes of relaxation, and as a result, you have a power law distribution. There's a smallest fast relaxation that's tall too. Relaxation that's tall to describe here. That's typical associated with a single match size. That basically you have a you have a contact bond with certain lifetime associated with these binding strains. And that's typically in the millisecond. The other one is you can estimate what's the amplitude, the amplitude for each. Amplitude for each for acting network: the this banding strain is typically 4 kbt and then you have a mesh size 20 nanometer. You put it in, you can get a good 22 kilo Pascal. And the previous measurement of the exponent here in the this positive typically in the range 0.1.5, we got in the same range and here. In the same range, and here we estimate that's two kilopascals. And then you can go back and see what's the number, the numbers millisecond range, similar as tau one. And importantly, this E2 here is on the order of one or two kilopascals. So that's the number it's also right. So let me say a few words because So let me say a few words because for people dealing with polymer, they deal with this time-dependent relaxation many times. But for this community, people normally use this share complex share modulus. The relation between the two is one is fully transformed the other. So this standard, I mean, of course, here's a compression modulus, here modulus for isotropic. Modulus for an isotropic material, they off by a constant here. So, we just already put there. So, that's the relation. I mean, in fact, we can measure the three mode. You can do a free transform. We can do it. So, just for quick summary for parallel relaxation in time, you get a power law in frequency. So, this is long time relaxation. Power law is short frequency. Short, short frequency, zero frequency limit things, but they have the same scaling. But if you do a calculation, you will find the amplitude differ by a tangent of alpha times half pi. And for this particular case, alpha equal to 0.5 is a crossover above which, if you get the exponent larger than 0.5. Larger than 0.5. Um, it's well, let me say the other way. If this thing is small, lower than 0.5, it's more, it's the G double prime is smaller than G prime. And these things behave more like a solid, and the other way around, and it's more like a liquid. People know a big thing, but here I just tell you exactly what's the relation. What's the relation? The reason we can see things clearly is not always good in the frequency. As we all know, do experiment. In certain times, the frequency gets mixed, then you don't have, if you have a peak, you do a frequency. And here we have very separate time domains. You have fast relaxation, sure. So time presentation is slow, it's easier compared with the frequency. And finally, And finally, what's this thing? What's the constant? The constant because the living cells, there's a people already talk, there's active stress. The active stress typically is random. When you compress that, the stress doesn't like to, because you align the active modulus in one direction, there's repulsive force that gives you a constant. That active stress there all the time. Active stress there all the time, and therefore, there's no time, there's no relaxation. That's the only effective way that you have a permanent permanent relaxation of a modulus that's elastic. So, we can tell you, I mean, this thing we can do estimate for myosin 2 concentration for non-muscle cells, we have a typical concentration of myelsin. Concentration of mouse and is about four micromolar. Each miles and there's a force about four piconewtons. There's a typical distance of this stack. It's about 10 nanometers. That's the work they've done. All you do is you deform it. The density here, you multiply these times the density. That's your modulus. Modulus, you put a number there. Is you put a number there, it's about 100 plus. Now, you can go back, it's a small, but not negligible. So, we got about something most of the time, a couple hundred. People already did this, I think, in all virtual, they also get a similar number. So, it's, I think, it's a good estimate of this. So, that's our so far quantitative understanding of the sales. All the cells. And of course, you do biology, then you have to do all the tests to make sure what we said is correct. The first thing we try, we try to different cells. You can get MPCK here at the reference. If you can fix the cell, then everything stop leaving. Then basically, you have a more or less rigid network. And here, indeed, you have a plateau. You have a plateau modulus. It doesn't change with time. If you want an exponent, it's a very small, just like we expected. The other cell, you go to other limit, you do a red blood cell, which you don't have network, you don't have a settle skeleton. And the only thing you have is some diffusive relaxation. And indeed, that's the case. Of course, none. Of course, none of course, and people say, hey, how about you use different drug treatment to control your subtle skeleton network? We tried ATP, we tried the inhibition of milestones, we tried disruption of network with long chunking lay. So, all these things, oh, I mean, I would let me just skip. We have some effect, 20-30% of. Effect 20-30%. The largest one is with Lambstacting A. We get rid of this acting network, keep cell leaving. We have a big change of the thing. So all the direction fall into that. The understanding is correct. Let me skip that thing. So the bottom line is: I want to understand if I just do a compression of a piece of material. Of a piece of material, one is a living, one is non-living. What's the essential difference mechanically? And here is conclusion. So here's sort of a catalog picture. You have probe, you have a cell, you have a nuclear, and then you have a cytoskeleton, which is red, a network, you have motors, you give you active stress, and this, the indentation geometry. Is the indentation geometry that's here, your radius here, your impact region here? And you take the whole message: one is the data skeleton network is not a typical polymer like a gel. It's not a permanent network. It's a changing network with a finite binding or binding time, which is called tau2. And that determines the fast relaxation. Relaxation. So that's number one message. Number two is that you have active, you have motors, motors gave you active stress, active stress gave you corresponding modulism, which against the deformation of the network. So that's what we learned for the living cell. And then you say, well, with this understanding, what we could do. I haven't I haven't done all the things, but we just started the first thing we could do now. It's now one number again. So, this is Visco Elastic. We have a three-mode, and then this, you have one, two, you have six index to describe a physical elastic property of a living cell. Now, you can, this is sort of a mechanical profiling. A mechanical profiling of the thing, whether you could use to study the biological function and the disease state of living cells. First, let me try. We can do here, for example, we can get normal breath cell. We can do a kind of breath cell cell line. Lo and behold, Cell line, lo and behold, you can do a quick thing. We can see for cancer breast cells. I assume, I think it's known that you have a lot of motor activity there, and that may cause the cancer cell mobility fast. And we can see here this for cancer cells, the active part of the E infinity is a lot bigger than the normal breast cell. The normal breast cell. Then we can measure this measurement. In principle, we can use this to do different subtypes of breast cancer cells. And then we can use compare mechanical profiling with genetic molecular profiling and understand the cross-green properties of cancer thing. The other thing you could do in experiment we do here is. We lose here is a particular bosinab density, it's the protein condensate, six components under microscope. You can they can condense it, they form a droplet, typically 10 or 20 micron. You can treat it as a cell, you can do mechanical property of protein condensate. And indeed, we can find they can form. Now, you can see here's the protein condensate. One thing is very clear: there's no living part, therefore. And therefore, they should relax to zero. And indeed, they relax almost to zero. From there, we can measure the other modulus contributing to the protein condensate. The other thing we try, the people interested to do cell. The simple cell, we can start with the cyst. We can get the AP0 cell, you can grow so that they can go to things that become a big bloom, but we inside with water. But we inside with water outside, we get a monolayer of F cell cells, so we can do indentation and study the mechanical properties. We also try the same for people here about cosmetic. There's no science. People talk about different things, different price thing. What in cosmetic, what you care is elasticity. Elasticity, water content, winkling. For elasticity, if you can measure, you have whatever the ingredient, you have elasticity as a function concentration or gradient, that elasticity increase 100%. That's a million dollar advertisement. And not being done. So with this protocol, you can easily work with skin sales. Well, we started with Bebella. We started with my biological colleagues. They say, Hey, you have this thing, I have this magic Chinese burnite. They say, By putting a burn out there, they increase your moisture of your skin. That was why there are 20% change. But I'm not sure. I agree. I believe this is a good model system for us to play with skin cells, try to understand what affects the elasticity of these cells. And finally, we also divide so far as four screen. We purposely put this probe, it's about 10 microns to get some kind of average amount visco elasticity of living cell. In principle, you can sharpen your tip. Typically, we don't want to get a very sharp fiber and get the tip diameter about 100 nanometers. That's big enough so you don't penetrate through the membrane. through the membrane and with that you can introduce you can do an ac this uh frequency modulate frequency you introduce a a hydrodynamic pressure just constantly with a five nanometer gap you can measure the local elastic property of the cell uh here there's component and you can get the k prime k double prime so that's the normal ac measurement you can A AC measurement. You can do it. Now you can do a scanning of the cell. Here's the example: you get an image, and now you can do a typing mode. You can do it, but you do another frequency. And then at the same time, you have a map of a local elasticity for different things. So one thing is heterogeneous during the normal sale cycle, but you get the mitotic rounding at that, which time you can see the multi. Which time you can see the modulus very uniform for the purpose, they have to because they have to get protein separation evenly. So, you need a homogeneous medium trying to understand. So, I'm just showing the thing. Indeed, we can do it. And, you know, that's the way we understand it. But between the interface, it's sort of a very complex distribution modulus property compared with metallic phase, which. Compared with metallotic phase, which is rather uniform. Okay, we can even see the polarization of leaving cell. You know, the polarization, you have more ATP, you have more acting in the front side that's more elastic. So you can measure it. Indeed, we can see it. Okay, I'm running out of time. So here's my summary. Thank you so much.
