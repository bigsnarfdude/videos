So also deep fundamental problems in that connection, that ended up being thermodynamics. But later on we have had other fields taking the clause of thermodynamics dynamics in the sense that they use the same mathematical structure as thermodynamics, but it's not thermodynamics. And the classical example here is compilation theory. We've already met that at this conference. At that, at this conference, it is non-thermal, has nothing to do with temperature and things like that at all, but it is the same mathematical structure. Another example is one that came in 1989, introduced by Sam Edwards at Cambridge. That was how to describe sand in a bucket, minus 30 and so forth. How to describe how the sandbox is. Describe how the sand-based are packed. And it turns out that you can develop a thermodynamics for that, and it took a long time until 2014 before we actually did numerical experiments that demonstrated that this was okay. And that was done by Dan Franklin and his group, and that's the husband. Oh, okay, guys. And then we have a third example. It's not important, namely what I'm going to describe here. Perhaps somebody would also say that corporate phase transactions would be non-thermal, but that is mixed in with thermodynamics, I wouldn't add that. But these are the examples I know about where you have a structure of thermodynamics without being thermodynamics. All right. So let's start with describing the problem. And let's start in the lab, the lab of Molley. Molly, Marcel Mooner, and others. So here's a Helshorse cell. You see it from above. That's two glass plates. And in between, you have glass beads, 100 to 100 microns, glass beads that are glued in place. So this is a two-dimensional force medium. The edges of this edges here and here, they're closed off. So it's now sending the league here and it comes out here. And the point now is that I've done. Here. And the protons are a black liquid and a white liquid, and they are immiscible. But you squeeze them in here at the same time. They go in here, here, here. And in this region here, you end up in a steady state. And this is what it looks like. We're going to start the system. Mainly, you see here, start after the thing filled with the black liquid, and here comes the black and white liquid mixture. This is after two and a half hours, seven. Two and a half hours, seven and a half hours, and after six and a half hours, you have a steady state. In this here, you have activity. I mean, there are clusters that are merging and splitting up all the time, but they have well-defined macroscopic averages. And also, another important point here is that in this system here, there are no macroscopic saturation gradients. And what that means is that we don't have to bother with trying. don't have to model it with trying to model any capillary pressure function. So here's the system again. Now this is a paper that came out in 2009. And what they measured is the pressure difference between here and here. So this is a pressure difference and that's a function of the Kepler number but the Kepler number is proportional to the average velocity. Proportional to the average velocity, flood velocity inside here. So, what you have here is pressure as a function of the coupling number. And you see, this is one and a half decays over how long? And so what you're seeing here is now, as I said, the average velocity. And if you want to write down a constant evolution for what you see here, this is that's the velocity, here is the mobility, and here's the pressure. Mobility and here's the pressure gradient to some exponent, and that exponent turns out to be around two. Now, since then, there's a lot of experiments that have done on this, for example, the group by Martin Blunt at Imperial. A few guys in Paris have done it and so forth. And and depending on the characteristics of the liquids, you get the exponent from one and a half up to a little bit more than two. Up to a little bit more than two. But this is very much like a non-Atonian liquid. If you have a special liquid, I mean a stress liquid, in a coarse medium, you're going to see a law like this. And that exponent is going to depend on the yield stress, but it's also going to depend on the non-linearities of the liquid absolute stress limit. So this is an example of. So, this is an example of effectively a non-neutral non-liquid on the Darcy scale, but it is actually two neutron non-liquids at the same time. Now, the traditional description of this problem is through relative permeability theory, and let me just use one minute, I've gone through it. You start out with old Darcy law from 1853: velocity, pressure gradient, proportional multi-factor here, that contains. Multifactor here that contains the information about the porous medium, its permeability. Here's the viscosity and as a liquid, and you have here the porosity because you want this to be the average fork velocity and not the Darcy velocity. Now, what you do is you split this into two here, two Darcy laws. And the idea is this: okay, let me see. I'm now the writing liquid. What do I see? Well, I see the matrix. I can't go into the matrix. I can't go into the matrix and I see the other liquid. I can't go into another liquid. And these two together end up in a reduced space I can move in. And that means that we have reduction of the permeability body of reduction factor. And this is a relative permeability. This is a wetting relative permeability. And this is a non-wetting relative permeability. And we get the saturation here because you still want this to be the average port velocity. Now you've got. You haven't said anything. We can all write anything in this form here. But here comes the physics: namely, the assumption that the two relative probabilities are dependent on the saturation alone. And look, this is from 1936. And this is what people use today, with the exception of an amendment that came in 1941 by Everett Labrett, namely what happens if you have pressure gradients. Change in the pressure here, a letting pressure and a non-letting pressure, and the difference is the capillary pressure function. But that's it, that's what everybody's using today. This is an idea state. And here's the problem. So if you start out with a constitutive equation like this, here is the velocity, it can be split up in like this, but then But then, how do you turn a single velocity into two velocities? Well, you can't do it in a unique way. You can only guess, which means that the whole thing is just, well, it just doesn't work. Another thing is that the idea of this being a pressure dependent on saturation alone just goes up the window. So it just cannot handle this. And remember now, this non-linearity here comes from the competition between disease forces. The competition between viscous forces and capillary forces, which means that you are smacked right in the region where this is supposed to function. So, yeah, we're in trouble, simply. It just can't really work. But everybody's using it, everybody's using it. Now, so this, let's try now to start from scratch and develop a theory. A theory called this, which is different from the simple relative and relative theory. So, here is a cut through a core sample. So, a core sample is like this, it would be thing like this, it's a coarse medium, and you send the liquids through, steady state. And what you see here is the white matrix. You have the non-wetting blue liquid, and then you have the red wetting liquid. You can characterize this by the core area, that's the area of the red and blue. Area of the red and blue, and then you have the wetting area that is the area of just the red here, and then of course you get the blue area also as a non-wetting area, and you have a volumetric flow rate going through all here. But you have more because you know the structure here, you can add one more parameter here or variables, namely the entropy associated with this, the information entropy. This. The information entropy sitting in this, that's a single number. Right? And let's try to use this here now. And note, and this is extremely important what I'm saying right now. So here is, you have a core sample like this. Make a cut here, cut here, like this. You get pictures like this. And I scramble them, I give them to you, and then I ask, can you just put them back in order? In order? Cannot evolve. That means there is no production or shaman entropy in the slices. It doesn't evolve into anything. So it is actually, in terms of the slices, we're dealing with not steady state, we're dealing with equilibrium. Another way of seeing this is if the flow goes like this, you can sort of see this like a sort of a pseudo-time axis, and you're not generating energy. And that means. That means you can actually use the machine that Jaynes invented in the 1950s. Until then, you had statistical mechanics, asset theory for molecules, and how you scale up molecules into thermodynamics. I mean that's all stuff. James said, Well, actually this is a that's a scope problem. Why not just set down the rules for Set down the rules for finding out when you can use statistical mechanics, general statistical mechanics, to scale up your problem. And when you go through the criteria he set up, the system we're looking at, really takes all the boxes. It can be used. So we're going very, very quickly describe the starting point here. So here's the post media. There's nothing point here. So, here's the pour's medium, which is a box, sending you two liquids. Inside here, you have a steady-state formula, and you define not a representative elementary volume, but a representative elementary area. And that area is now characterized by flow coming through it. And pour area, that's the area here which are pores, and the part of the that area which is the wetting area. That area, which is the wetting area. And these are going to depend on the configurations inside here. Right? The statistical thing is first or not. And then you run the Jaynes machine. And what you end up with is the generating function for the statistics of the system here. And this X here is the configuration. Is the configuration that means where are the liquids, where are the pores, and what are the velocity fields? That's the thing. And you have to integrate this over all possible physically feasible configurations. And here are the corresponding flow rate, areas, poor area, and wetting area. Now what you see? There are three more variables that are shown up. More variables that are shown up. There may be this one here, this one here, and this one here. This one, we named it agitor. That's short for agitation temperature, but we don't want the word temperature to appear in what it looks like. Temperature, because it's not temperature. And then you have another variable here, mu, that's, I call it the flow derivative. That would, in classical language, I mean molecular so. Language, I mean molecule, so forth. This would be like a chemical potential. Then you have this one here, the flow pressure, that is the conjugate of the porosity. That has no equivalent in standard thermodynamics. Alright, so statistical mechanics. Statistical mechanics, what you have done now is to transform the flow problem into a mathematical problem, namely due this integral. This integral. But there are two things here. One thing is that if you have an integral of this form here, you're going to end up with a thermodynamics, something that looks like a thermodynamics. It's not thermodynamics, but it's a pseudothermodynamics. It's the same mathematical structure. You've got emergent variables here, and you have relations between them. This is a scale-up, and it's very important. Read more is different by Philip Anderson's. By Philip Anderson's famous 1972 paper in NASA Science that says when you scale up things, don't use the variables you started out with, expect new emergent variables. Anyway, but then there's another thing, and that is, you know, in thermodynamics, you have the machine, this big set of equations. But then you have to put in the physics of your system, and that you do by adding the equations of state. What do you have to do? State. What you have to do here in this pseudo-thermonators is to put in the constitutive equation, this one here, or whatever you choose. Put that in, and get everything here. And the thing now is, if I could do this integral here, I would end up with the correct positive equation. But that is hysterically difficult. Don't even think of trying. I mean, it can't be done. I don't think it's can be done. It's super difficult. It's damn difficult enough in this simple Damn difficult enough in these simple models like Ising model and so forth. It's it's horrible. People have gotten Nobel Prizes for doing approximate solutions to this. Ken Wilson, the realization group, that's an approximative method to solve this problem for simple models, anyway. So it's some password practical to actually calculate this. But what do you get? What does this semi-dynamics look like? Well, you have Thermodynamics look like? Well, they have velocities. These are not the velocities that people usually think. I want to get to that afterwards. But these are the thermodynamic velocities. They are the top of flow, right? Take the derivative with respect to these areas, and we get our velocities. You have this flow derivative. This is average velocity. And you can, for example, demonstrate that the relation between this velocity here, that's a non-value. Here, that's a non-wetting thermodynamic velocity, and an average velocity is an evolved regulation transform with respect to the saturation. Nobody could have guessed that, but that's it is. And the saturation, then you can get from this derivative. No, here. It's here. And so forth. You have the whole machinery at your hands. It's just, I mean, you know how much, I mean. It's just, I mean, you know how much. I mean, thermal is the closest thing you get in physics to a free launch. At your tour, this is thermal, this is the temperature light thing. Here's the force meter. Here's the force meter with a different velocity, for example, whatever. And sending in, here's a partition between them. And I'm sending in a fluid here with this attractor, on this side, this attractor. On this side, this attributor, and then as I move upwards, the partition ends and they start mixing. What happens? Well, if this is thermodynamics, I have to end up with the same attitude. Two bodies in contact will have the same temperature. But look, if I replace attitude with pressure gradient, here's one pressure gradient, here's another pressure gradient. What happens up here? Well, they are up with the same pressure gradient. Otherwise, they have cross-fall, and you won't. And you want. So editor is actually the pressure gradient and has to be the absolute value because my representative elementary area I can put in at any angle. So if it has to be invariant, or it has to be that. It could be just a function, but this is a simple simple idea. So you have now something that is actually quite complete. Now, here Now, here are the thermodynamic velocities, these dilatives, and this is what you actually measure in the map. So, you have here your system is sending the liquids. What you measure on the other side is how much comes out per time of the wetting liquid and non-wetting liquid. Divide by essentially the average areas of each of them. That gives you the velocities. These are the interstitial velocities for each. It's not the same as this one. It's not the same as this one, but they're related. They are related to a new velocity vm here. This is the most general thing direction you can write down. You can put a lot of mathematics around this. But of course, I won't go into that. But, anyways, you have the Kohling velocity here. And that is very interesting because now suddenly. Is very interesting because now suddenly what we had with rectified theory, we didn't have this one. So you can do a mapping from here to here, but you can't go this way. But now we have two other. So I can really go. If you have a constitutive equation for this and this one, you have these two. And just to demonstrate what these equations look like, here is going from vetting and non-vetting velocities into the average velocity and the common velocity. That's the expression for the common velocity. And then here was this Vushondov transform I had between average velocity and the non-weighting terminal velocity. I use the expression for the common velocity. I just exchange this for this, and I have this expression for it. And I could do the other one, and then I have the opposite. And then I have the opposite dimensions. So I have a two-way transformation now. Now I can deal with this. Because I just plug this in here. So what I need to do now is to look at what does that look like. And this has been a real shocker because you can reverse engineer from relative valuity data. I mean, the literature is really full of The literature is really full of relative mobility data. So, here is the average velocity as a function of relative mobility functions, and here's a colony velocity. It's not elegant, this equation, but that's what you get when you have dealing with something which is just guessed. The computers are just guessed. Alright, so the theory dictates that the good variables for the Cohen loster should be the For the component losses, should be the adjective or the pressure gradient and μ the flow derivative. And here we take data from Benjamin and Baku. We plot the average velocity as a function of saturation. We plot Kong velocity as a function of saturation. But then we use Kong velocity as a function of u. Straight time. Straight time. We do it again. Another set of data. Again, another set of data. Sorry, sorry. Okay, so what this indicates is that you have the M like this, where this A and B are dependent on the pressure gradient. So they change for the flow. But this mu is linear in mu. Here's another data set from the literature. Oak is a very famous three-phase system. Here's not one. Here's not one. This year published in 22. Is republished in 22. Here's another one. There's another one. Another one. And then Stefan Beg in January, he's a research scientist, chief research scientist at Schell. And he looked at public relative mobility data. He did that for them. And here are some of the ones he looked at. Here's the relative mobility curves, and here's the corresponding common luminosity. Here's another example. It's not an example. It's not an example. It's not there. It's not there. It's another. It's not there. It's not there. You know, there are straight lines. And then, actually, last week in Transport and Course Media, we published a paper with Van Armstrong and his group in Australia. So what they did, they had North C sandstone and Thai sandstone and this one I'll get to. And uh this one I'll get to. But the point now is that you have to reconstruct the post medium, you know, um model of it. And then you use uh Spoltzmann and you can change the wetting angle. So this is relative and lift this and measure using different wetting angles. And here's the same for Bentimer. And this is an experimental result, I mean a system where they have a ductilated using liquids that have different Yeah, that was. And so here is the average velocity as an average saturation. Here is the common velocity as a function of saturation. And here is a common velocity as a function of mu. And they all fall on top of each other. Here's the Ben Timer system. Again, the same thing. And here's the experimental system. So, and this is a big mystery. Why is this common velocity? Well, one thing is why is it linear? I have a paper. Linear. I have a paper in review now that maps this linearity onto a seemingly simpler statement. It's a step in the right direction, but definitely no CR. See what happens. And I don't know. But anyway, why this should be okay, some consequence of this? Well, we have solutions to this equation. You can set up an equation between two. You can set up an equation between the two relative variables because they are now suddenly not independent anymore. And for regulative vulnerabilities or the equal index, they are solutions to this equation. And then you have suggested relative vulnerability by a gentleman over there. And that turns out also to be a solution to this equation. But a bunch of them are not. They are not. They more or less curved behavior. And then, in this paper, published last week, if you know the wetting vertical, then we construct the non-wetting vertical vertical, and the data really looks quite nicely. So, there is something here. I mean, to get So there's something here. I mean, to get straight lines sort of things that's like that, that's yeah. Interesting. Now can I use anything for can I use this theory for something? Yes, here's a proof of concept, the business fingers. Let me try to do business fingers. And let me assume I know the constitutive equation for the average velocity. I use I use here is the beta exponent. And I put it now here, because now I want gradiency and saturation. And let me just put in a catalytic pressure. Of course, this is just guesswork from my side. I'll try to, I mean, I'll use a few years down in front of you, not quite well doing this. But anyway, let me just use it here. And I have here the mobility. And I just curve like this as a function of saturation. The coupler pressure, I use a Brooks coil form, just a standard thing that people use in the literature. And this exponent here, I know that if saturation is one or zero, that i should be equal to one. And then it has something in in the maximum here, which is around two. Which is round two, and I could have had something like this, whatever, but let me just choose something simple. It seems to be dependent on saturation, which, as a physicist, makes me a little bit like this because exponents are very difficult to change. Because the Sala system is a system where you have an exponent depends on variables that shouldn't depend on what it does. So it can happen. So I'm using that. Can happen. So I'm using that. And for the cool wind velocity, well, let me just do a linear form. Form 7 is a typical value. So then the equations that I have to solve and remember this is where you end up with something very simple. This is the incompressibility. This equation here just describes that the saturation is transported by the wetting velocity. Your wetting velocity. And this is the non-thermal equation, non-thermal thermodynamics equation relating the wetting velocity to the velocity and the final velocity. I put it all together and this is what the finish looks like. There's no disorder in the system. So I have here a concentration of non-whitting liquid. I'm sending it in at the given. I'm sending it in at the given pressure, and I start up with these little notches like that, and I see how they develop. This is a critical concept. This is using console, it's not completely stable and so forth, but the point is that I can do it. This is non-linear. This is not, you couldn't do this with any methods existing today. Summary information-based Information-based statistical mechanics leads to a non-thermal thermodynamics. That means it gives me a set of formulas I can use at that scale. And this is now, since all the premises are in place to do the statistical mechanics, you can really believe that this non-thermodynamics is a correct description of the system on the Darcy scale. And it has this. And it has this relative permeability framework. It's a special case of a non-thermal thermal density in the sense that I can put that in as with my equation of state or constitutive equation and I get the usual stuff comes. There's a new velocity parameter, that's an emergent variable. You wouldn't be able to guess that at the post gear, it doesn't exist. Just conveniently. Combining velocity has a surprisingly simple form. And I can model non-linear misconceptions. So that's it. Thank you.
