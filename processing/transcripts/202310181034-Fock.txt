Well I can learn more. Um the well my my the subject I'm going to speak is uh well something which I learned relatively recently and I was technically put sighted simply that this subject is very simple, namely the same symbol and I'll try to convince you that it's really simple simple so simple and simple and that the it can be used for plenty of Be used for plenty of questions, in particular for clusters, which is very important too. And well, originally it was, well, the symbol, well, the name is given by the link, so very simple. So as far as I know, it belongs to the ring and payload sum. De Ling and Berlinson more or less simultaneously they wrote two papers, De Ling of 50 pages and Balinson of two pages. But more or less it's the same. So I first start with the definition. What is a big symbol? The definition, what is a big symbol? So, paying symbol is something which takes two functions that give you a number. So, you have the functions f and g and two functions from a circle. So, I imagine the circle as r washi dy qi z. And the formula, which I try to comment a lot. So, the So, the number f and g, which is an element of c star, non-zero. Ah, sorry, and I was also forgot to mention if this is mapped to c star. So it's a functions which are nowhere zero on the circle, and this is given by the exponent of one over t pi i integral of f plot f plus g uh times to the from here integral from x to x plus to pi p of x times minus degree of f. And by definition, degree is just how many times f go around zero. Uh so f means degree of f. degree of f is 1 over 2 pi i the integral of d over f. So this this formula well it's but it's this symbol has certain properties. So the properties of this simple IO properties So, the first one is that maybe I will write because I know that here it's not very visible. So, it's well defined. Property n number zero, it's well defined. So, it's a good exercise for third-year students. Exercise for third-year students. Well, I even tried this with them. So this well-defined, so therefore, it doesn't depend on the point of x of integration. So without this term, for example, it would be not well defined because of all the many branches. So it doesn't depend on the branches of the logarithm. You have chosen, it doesn't depend on any arbitrary numbers you get. Second, it's juicy metric. It's given symmetric. Fg equals minus times g f is one. Second property is that if you have multiplicative, f g1 g2 equals fg1 times fg2. Well, both proofs is easy exercises. A little bit, well, third property, that F with minus F is one. This is also an easy exercise. And there is a property which is number four, which is not so easy exercise, but still easy. That f Uh f one minus f is equal to one. But somehow the most interesting property is this one. So what is the one minus that could have some zero? It could be, well, of course I require that there are no, there is no zero. So the So the uh what is the geometric meaning of uh of that? So geometric meaning. So I show that this is actually a certain monogramy of certain connection. So the uh the idea is the following. Let's consider the uh space construct a line bundle of over C star cross C star. C star cross C star. So there is a distinguished line bundle there with connection. So just recall, let's take the case C star cross C cross C with coordinates Z, X, Y. And this on this space you can have a form alpha which is dz over Z, well d over Z, dz over Z, minus one over two pi five. 1 over 2 pi i x d y. This form is invariant under the following transformation. So invariant under the transformation z x y goes to that x y x z x y plus two pi i. Zxy plus 2 pi i, this is obvious, and another transformation which takes it z to the e to the y, x plus 2 pi i. So, well, even easier exercise verify that this form is invariant. So therefore, on the quotient you have this i this this form is well defined under the quotient of this transformation. So we have to Of this transformation. So we have some. Now, finally, we get a form on. Now let's take, so you have a line bundle, E, which is equal to, well, C star squared. Here you have the coordinates f which is equal to e to the x and g equal to e to the y. equal to e to the y. These are coordinates on the quotient by this group. And the form alpha in this on the quotient, which I'll denote by the same letter, it's dz over z minus log f g of g. So exactly the form which we have integrated here. So the So this can be considered as a connection form. So alpha is not well defined, of course, as a just form, but it's defined as a connection form in a line bundle. And the final that fg is nothing but, well, if you have two functions, so fg is a map, is a map from from the circle, from s1 to From S1 to C star per C star. And you compute the monodromy. So Fg, this symbol, is nothing but the monodromy of this, well, this map Fg star, monodromy of Fg star of. So it's just monodromy of your connection. You have your C star squared. You have your C star squared, uh and you have line button. Yeah, you have line button, you have one. The the connection is not flat, of course. The differential of this form is is differential of alpha is equal to f in one g, which is not equal to zero. So it strongly depends on the so this is the So this is the D log F. D log F d of F D D log F I know the geometrical implementation of this statement. Now the okay, now I'll I'll speak a little bit about well some some particular cases for for for that. Cases for that. Maybe I will. Well, some applications. So applications will be the application number A. Actually, this quantity can be seen as a cosycle on a On a group. So let's H is a group of this group of functions. Well, the space of functions like that is this space is, I'll denote by equating H, and this is just a group, multiplicative group. So H is, I claim that this. That this Fg, well, and actually you need to multiply by minus 1 to the F damg, is F, which is, I write it as E of G, is a cocycle on H. Actually, you have seen it plenty of times, this cosycle, and this is what is called. And this is what is called Heisenberg group. So this is a Heisenberg country you've seen millions of times, and this is maybe seen only thousands of times because it's just a group corresponding to the Heisenberg algebra. Well, it's much less less popular somehow, but nevertheless, it's well defined. However, the group cycle kind of much completely, well, this formula is a little bit. This formal is a little bit more complicated than the formal for ordinary concycle, for outward concepts. So concycle on H, so therefore there exists a for that you have a central extension of H, which I'll deliver by H hat. And this is a H zero, one and the Uh and uh the the uh well if you fix some some splitting of this exact sequence, not as a but just as a set, and uh in physical literature this map is defined by two columns and this is a we well means that the central extension is defined by the property that the product of F and G That the product of F G is equal to the cosycle C of F G F this is a just equal cycle for another well application number B it's just that we are speaking pearl so this is a very We are speaking pearls, so this is a very simple, simple particular cases. So let f and g be the functions, just homotic functions, from the sigma minus the points to complete numbers. So you have two functions. So you have two functions defined on the Riemann surface, but sigma Riemann surface. And you have two functions defined everywhere except maybe hiding the many points. Then the we can define the symbol Fg. Symbol FG with gamma at the bottom, which is just by definition the F restricted to gamma, G restricted to gamma. So this is just if you have path on a surface, so any path of the surface, you can define its own symbol. So it gives actually a map. So this thing gives you a map from Fg with is a map from pi 1 over h1 of the surface. So it's homology class h1 of sigma to c star. So we have a cohomology class in C star. Example, well maybe I will Worthwhile. Uh example if F and G, well so it's maybe application number C if your F and G are meromorphic then F and gamma F and gamma Fg computed at the, if you have a point P and a circle, which is just a small circle around this point P, then this is equal to F minus one to the power degree F degree G F to the power degree G divided by g to the power degree f and restricted to the point p. So this function, well we have chosen the powers in such a way that the ratio is non-singular at at the point P, and you can compute its value at P, and this is enough. Well, perhaps we've you've seen this formula many times. seen this form many times in your life and the well maybe this third application is that this is a well point wild reciprocity formula so wild reciprocity formula namely if you have Namely, if you have two functions, not necessarily meromorphic, it could be any function just with finitely many singularities, then you have product over all points P in your sigma of Fg around the point P, then this is equal to one. And this is this formula is kind of obvious because. This formula is kind of obvious because you have, if you interpret that as a really, if you interpret this symbol as a connection on a line bundle, so you have a map Fg which goes for sigma, which Fg, which sigma to C star squared. Here you have the connection form alpha, so you can pull back your connection. Can pull back your connection to sigma as you have connection, the line bundle on sigma with connection. Now, connection is flat, just for dimensional reasons, because here is two dimensions, the connection is not flat, but the image is one-dimensional, and that when the worst image, of course, is that curvature vanishes. So you have a flat connection on your line bundle, and the product of monodrome is around points where this connection. Points where this connection is not defined is equal to. This is just a well, it's just raised to theorem, but multiplicity version. Well, this is a famous, well, strictly speaking, why reciprocity proof well is formulated for meromorphic functions, but it's quite good, works perfectly well with functions of with essentials in your So this is a can you also use the same symbol to produce the central extension on a one? Pardon me like if you have a compact Lee group and you want to produce its central extension? Well, there are very good question. My dream is just to, well, there is a formula by Kubota and Matsumoto, Kubota Poisson 2 and Matsumoto for MySON. For my so n for central exemptions for all groups. But somehow this formula, well, for me are they are too complicated. I do not quite understand their meaning. Well, I think that clusters could help, but I didn't yet understand this in the beginning of this course. Yeah, so this is a well. Well, maybe another down-to-s application of this symbol, so you have f and g polynomials. And you have a curve, well, gamma is such that the roots of F are inside, and there is the roots of G. So the curve. So the curve, this gamma, separates that. The roots of this f and g is just resultant of f and g. And the fact that the result is multiplicative is just a consequence of this form. So, well, since we were speaking about tau function, About tau functions, I will just give some well in the contrary, so I will say a few words: what's the relation between this and the tau function. So, what's the tau function in using this terminology? So, you have this group, H hat, uh and uh well the let's consider the the well for for uh you Well, for sigma surface, hell function. So the sigma is a Riemann surface. Well, tau functions, not arbitrary one, but what's called finite gap, so something related to Riemann surface. So there are tau functions are more general objects, but I uh this class overlooks. This class of cow functionality. So, sigma is a Riemann surface. Surface. And for any P is a point here. And we can define just the group HP is just the group of germs of functions. Or functions, what is called quasi-meromorphic functions. Well, maybe I will do the same quality thing. Germs of quasi-meromorphic functions on sigma. So what's quasi-meromorphic function? It's a function f is equal to meromorphic Sign e to the meromorphic. Locally, every such function can be represented as f is equal to, well, at the vicinity of the point, the function has a form z to the k times e to the sum of z to the a t k z to the minus k. Z to the minus k equals maybe minus k k equals n to infinity. So it's or n series, finite to the left. So this is a the form of this function. And this is the such function form a group with respect to multiplication. Now, HP HP is the germs of quasi-meromorphic functions on P. around p and one can use the the tame symbol in order to define its central extension so h p hat is central extension so h p hat can be uh contained two subgroups one subgroup is is HP plus this is a commutative subgroup of consisting of F with F homomorphic, F homomorphic and such that F of P is not zero. So this is just functions with So, this is just functions which have positive series decomposition. And Hp minus, which is the same thing, but these are the functions of the type, well, f with f is equal to z to the k e to the minus sum, so to the sum of negative e to the k. TJ T minus K is e to the k, k is positive, k is negative. Well, this the H P minus, this group is non-canonical, which is very non-canonical, to depend, depends on the choice of the local coordinates. Non-canonical. But of course, there is a representation rule which is representation rho which is a representation of H P plus to C star and the representation is the following that rho of the central charge central element well x is equal to x if x is central and rho of any other function function is equal to 1. So it can be written also that rho of x times f is equal to x. So this is the one-dimensional representation. Trivial one. And then you can induce, let's take BP the induced representations. You take representation from H plus. From H plus to H of the representation row. And this is an extended representation of the, well, once again, this is just a reformulation of representation of Heisenberg group, which you know very well. Well, here I overrace. Now, what's the tau function? So, let's consider the quotient h, well, h minus p is just as a set of, well, as a As a set, it's just enumerated by what? By the number k is the numbers which are t1, t2, t3, etc. So these are each, in mind that these are just coordinates on the negative part of the modulus. So what is induced representation? Induced representation by definition is a representation in functions in the quotient of In the quotient of, well, in HH minus, subject to certain conditions, well, subject to certain natural conditions, which I'm going to write now. So therefore, my representation of this H algebra just can be thought of as functions on this HP minus. Now let's consider the product. So let's consider. product. So let's consider sigma. To sigma we associate the product and the product over all points of sigma of dp of representations. So we have in every point we have a representation. Of course you should understand this product is kind of identical and so you have all vectors are trivial except for finitely many points. And on this space you have an action of h p Of tensor product of HP hat. But on the other hand, in this tensor product, you have there the space of global functions HP H of sigma. I do not put hat here. Well, why? Because there is a well there is a, well, wider diversity implies that the non-centrally extended functions are embedded into the tensor product. Because the product of, if you compute the tensor of charge onto functions, then you take the product over all points and the product of all here, and the product of all points equal to one. So this is a no-central extension of this. So this group sits in. So, this group sits in this big gender product as a Debirian group. And so, therefore, you can take the by definition tau functions is a vector in B B T uh yeah tau is a variant, tau is just the well, the only is is Well, the only is necessary to prove that the only BP invariant sorry, HP vector. But you should imagine this toll as a function of on this H P minus. So otherwise. So, otherwise, you have a surface, you fix finitely many points. Yet at every point you have k, well, k1, k1, t11, t21, etc. Another point you have k two, t one, two, t two, well, two one, t two. To one, t to s to two, etc. So at every point you have one integer variable and many, many continuous variables, and that the tau function is just function of this variable. So this is just literary function. So for example, if you take a surface with one point, then the corresponding tau function is, well, you have actually k equals zero because. Actually, k equals zero because otherwise it's zero. You have T1, etc., T2, T2, etc. This is this corresponds to Kp in the hierarchy. If you have a surface with a hyper elliptic surface, and the point you take is just invariant of that, then you consider the K dB tau function, etc. So the tau function. Etc. So the tell function is just. Yeah. Is it in just a single BP or is it in the tensor product? In both the tell function and invariant under H of sigma? I have H of C, yeah. H of sigma invariant. Thank you. So that's the way how one can define tau function. And well, the f the Yeah, well, the f the the now I'll go to costors finally. So the so suppose we have, well, for a moment, let's state just be, well, so C. So C star squared, C star to the n is with coordinates A1, etc. A n. This is just a torus. And the torus is equipped with the symptomic form, which is equal to sum over epsilon ij. Epsilon ij is a Q symmetric matrix. An integer, integral skew symmetric. And you have a form which is alpha, which is equal to omega, which is equal to d log sum of ij such that epsilon ij is positive. That epsilon ij is positive, d of Ai, d log Aj. So this is a torus equipped with symplectic form. Well, not necessarily symplectic, just two forms. It can be degenerate. And this is it, for those who know, so this is just a chart of a cluster memory. So L in this C star N. This C star N is Bohr Samberfeld if it is Lagrangian. Well, I imagine L is a complex subvaluate. This Lagrangian Lagrangian and the for any path gamma which sends the circle S1 to my C star to the n what it means it means that the point T is sent to A1 of T A n of t A n of C. So I require that the monodromy, certain monotromy is one. So it means that the product of the team symbols of Ai Aj to the power epsilon ij once again ij such that epsilon ij Epsilon ij is positive, this is equal to 1. So it's a condition stronger than the condition that you cannot help. Gamma I w what I wrote wrote, sorry. Gamma going to L, of course. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So, for any path in this. So, otherwise we have a K10 sub-manifold. So there are in class. Well, here is, well, there is some more strong condition on the All these K-Lagrangian sub-manifolds. So, some properties of these sub-K-Lagrangian sub-manifolds. First property is that if you have a K-Lagrangian sub-manifold in one chart, then it is in another chart. So, if L is, sorry, or is this equivalent to the KG Lagrangian then? Well, Well, hopefully. The the K2 aground trend, well, maybe I should should well maybe I should give the definition, another definition, first definition, another definition. Then, well, L is k to Lagrangian. If this is true, well, this thing is well, if it is Bohr-Nomberfeld, well, I will do an informal definition. If it is Bohr-Nomberfeld, because of this property we have. This property, which I erase, of the property that f equals f minus f equals f1 minus f is equal to 1. So the only reason why this is, well, that you can prove this statement using this property. It's called K-log ramp. Conjecturally, this equation. It's equivalent. So every Poisson effect is K-Lagrangian, but it's only conjecture. So, well, it's. So some properties of that. So if we have a C star to the N, two C star to the N. 2 C star to the n is a mutation, well I do not write the form alpha, well, omega, omega prime, is a cluster mutation. So it's birational transformation and L is so you have L here, L is here, it's real. L is here, it's mu, then mu until L is Borer-Summer Fact, that implies that mu of L is also Borer-Hungary Fact. So, this is something which really defined on the cluster variety itself. You need just to choose in one chart that this is more than that for the rest is automatically. The other thread and for the rest is automatically true. Because the charts cover everything. Examples the main example. You have the C star squared with coordinates F and G as before, and the L is equal to F 1 minus F. So otherwise, it's the space. So otherwise it's the space of well something solution for the equation f plus g equals one. And it's obviously that if you take the bracket of f of t 1 minus f of t, just because of this relation is equal to 1, therefore it's born output. This is just this standard. Standards, the standards is reached. Another example, which is a kind of version of this property, actually, if you have a cluster variety A and you have a, well, also for special, so some combination of mutations with automorphism, view one, etc. Automorphism, V1, etc., VN, which is an automorphism of a cluster automorphism, so computation of mutation, which just goes back. For example, you have local systems on the European surface as a cluster variety, and the automorphism is just the action of a magic value. Then The diagonal, the graph of this map is L in A times H graph of U1, UN is KY control. So, I want to say that K2 Lagrangians is just a conditional Lagrangian manifold. Well, there are plenty of Lagrangian manifolds. However, there are not so many K2 Lagrangian manifolds, but they are much better in a sense for, well, the moral of the story is that the quantization works for, well, if you want to quantize something, then you cannot quantize any organizations, but only those which are. Some men, but only those which I teach. And the final subject is the following. So maybe I cannot go into all the details about intriguable systems, but I will say a few words about another example for, well, in particular, can be generalized this example number one, which is a particular case of a mobile system, but Open the mobile system, but it's not clear here. So this is a the claim is a following. So let another example of you it's not an example of a K of a gram general but A K or Grammar, but the example of how to use K or Grammar is a peripheral. So let K let P of lambda mu is a planar curve with a plane K of Granger or the K Lagrangian Porosian method. Well, whatever. Player form. Then I claim, well, for this, well, let's consider its quantization of this curve. Well, quantum curve which we discussed yesterday. So let's consider the following equation out of it. So let's replace mu let mu be consider the equation, a difference equation. Equation P lambda mu P of e to the x t times psi of x equals 0. So where t psi is a function on x, so psi is a function of c to c and t of psi of x equals of x equals x to psi of x plus 2 pi di. So this is a shift. So well for any polynomial you can introduce this function. It's a kind of cheating. I'm doing the quantization but I'm cheating because the operator of shifting pi to pi i, the end multiplication pi n to the is commute. So there are something something not point. Not quantum because they are shifts, etc., but actually this quantization corresponds to q equals 1 e to the 2 pi i h and h equals to 1, not to 0. This is a kind of distinguished point, and I will try to figure out, well, to say a few words how we can generalize it for other situations. Other situations, then let's claim that let's take the psi, let's take the function psi is equal to the following integral. So x psi of x is equal to the integral ex 1 over 2 pi i, the integral of Of x ln of mu equal n of mu from zero to x maybe I shouldn't write it where where key of Mu is a solution of the equation P of e to the t mu equals zero. So it's a function of the t. Well, is the solution? Of this equation. Uh what what this well I just uh recall once again the what the the uh the uh um what is the formula for for the the symbol. So exponents of So exponents over logi i, the integral uh of uh f d log f d log g minus times g to the minus degree of f g of x. So I would say that this formula, what's the difference between these two formulas? First of all, I replaced First of all, I replaced instead of I consider what this function, on which space this function is. So we have our curve, P of lambda mu equals zero. I consider a curve which is universal, well, is a covering of that, p of e to the t mu equals zero. So this is a So, this is an infinite cover of my original curve. Now we claim that this integral, well exponentials of the integral, defines me a function on this universal cover. So this is sigma and this is sigma tilde. So this is a function on sigma tilde for this function well. For this function well defined in on sigma tilde, I need for this curve to be K-Lagrangian, because, oh, Burzemer. Because, well, of course, this curve has a topology, and the integral does depend a priori on the class of my curve. So I have a function which is a priori is not well defined, but due to the effect that this integral is. That this integral is zero, well, this integral is one, well, this expression is one, the integral doesn't depend on the path. Well, it does depend on the path, yeah, but on the other hand, what happens if we, well, on this curve, of course there is a well, there is an action of the operator key which is just shifts. The operator is shifting. The operator is shifting t to t plus 2 pi i. This shift this shift acts on the curve and therefore it acts on the function. But because this product is equal to 1, so it means that if we shift by 1 sub psi of x plus 2 pi i, plus 2 pi i mu is equal to sine of x mu at e to the x equals e to the phi mu times g of g and this particular case is just mu, mu of x. So therefore shifting is the same thing, well, a little computation we have. A little computation if you lost. So a little computation shows that p of e to the x t times psi equals p to the e to the x mu psi, and this is zero. So this is a issue. Well, one may ask that it's not a function of one It's not a function of one variable, it's a function of two variables, of x and psi, but of x and mu. So here you have mu and for every given x or t you have several mu's, but finitely many of them. And this is not a contradiction because if you have a difference equation of order n, then you expect. Then you expect to have n independent solutions. So, therefore, you have a function which is n n variant function. You can take this, I don't know, take any invariant polynomials of these values and get solutions of your original equation. So, this is the way to solve this equation. Well, this looks like a very naive example because it's just a dimension two. It's just a dimension two, but this is not. Well, I just can say a word that this class of, well, non-charoo-Kenyan equivalent system actually reduces solutions for any system to this particular problem, one-dimensional. So this is a kind of universal solution for this quantum interpretable system problem, but now in a situation where h equals to 1. h equals to 1. And maybe the last statement that is that for this particular case, this formula, so psi of x for the curve p of lambda mu equals to lambda plus mu plus 1 minus 1. The psi of x is equal to, there is here is there is no problem because it's linear new so No problem because it's linear and new, so there is no problem about multi-values. It's equal to exponentials of v2 of x e to the x, maybe minus, minus here. And so this is a just dialograph which enters the picture. And well, we definitely, and this is, this sine of x has a sine, has a, well, this. This exponential function has a has a solution of the equation e to the x minus one times psi equals to psi t psi, which is exactly exactly well this equation where you replace mu by t and lambda to mu by t and lambda to d to the f is minus. Well, on the other hand, just last remark that up to, I don't know, I'm still hoping that one can easily modify this procedure to have h different than than one, and in particular approaches the point h equals zero and consider the the the well See, well, the series in H for H is long. Well, because we know what happens, what the difference, well, how to pass from here is actually, this is what is called this function, it's called the dilogent of quantum diagram for h equals to 1 up into the x. So this is of x. And we know very well what is the quantum diagram of. Is the quantum divergent for different values of h, how it's related to diagram for h equals 1? And so perhaps it can be done for any h, but maybe I'm not going to say about that because it's not yet yet fetched. Thank you very much. Um what the relationship between this department equation and previous tau function is ignition? Uh ah pardon this equation and tau function. Uh well one well, I would like to Well, I would like to say that I cannot say that this is a bit what's the relation between this equation and tau function, but what I can definitely say is that what's the tau function if you have a p of lambda mu equals zero, so this is a curve. This is a curve which has some number of points at the field. And well, the space of curves, well, what's an integrable system relating to this polynomial? It's just the space, phrase. It's just the space, phrase space is a space of curves times for every curve you choose a line bundle of it. So it's Jacobian, a bundle of Jacobians of the curve. And this by default turned out to be cost of error. And what are the cluster functions? Well, coordinates of this cost of variety. The cluster coordinates are the following thing. You take this point at infinity, so you have a surface with some distinct points. With some distinct points. And yet you put here the numbers: well, k1, k2, etc., kn, and you compute all functions with all continuous parameters to be zero. And these are cluster qualities. T12, yes, yes, etc. So you keep only only the discrete parameters and then these discrete parameters don't turn out to be cospoordins on on the integral system uh the integral system, well, corresponding to a given polynomial. So this is a this is there is a relation, but not so direct to the this quantum curve. You mentioned that sort of the organal control Kenyan integral systems can be reduced basically to the story of a quantum curve. Is this basically some sort of separation of variables? Of separation of variables? Yeah, yeah, it's just separation of variables. Because the phase space of a bunch of Kenyan theorem system can be interpreted as just a collection of G. You have just G points on C2 squared and for through G points in the fray you can trace unique curve of G this G. Of G to G with given Newton polygons. So if you have two points here, you can place a unique curve. And these two points give you a divisor of this curve, which is the line bundle. And the curve, so pair of curves, line bundle is more or less the same thing as just two points on C2. The way to associate something two-dimensional with something in the dimension. Maybe you said it, and I just missed it. I'm sorry. So, when dilabators or quantum dilabators show up, there's sometimes usually the pentagon identities should be quantum. Right. So, where do the pentagon identities matter? Well, they come from the fact that this comes from the fact that if you have a transformative world, the element is as simple as possible. Well, the element is as simple as possible for formation what is just a b mutation goes to b tab b a plus one plus a over b one plus b over a this is an elementary mutation if you so this elementary mutation amounts to well the the the graph of of this mutation is our graph that's Of this mutation, this algorithm sub-manifolds. The generative function for this algorithm sub-manifold is diagonal. Then you take this transformation and take this fifth power. You can easily compute that this transformation to the fifth power is one. So they are where this five-time relation comes from. It's another, yeah. This is a or you, well, essentially the Or you, well, essentially the same computation, you take the form A dB. So if you take this transformation, then A dB goes to A D B plus, well, this transformation preserves the vector form, but doesn't preserve the one form of A d B. So it goes to plus D of E2 of A. So this is that means that if you make five times such transformation, then you add well, this proves that the sum of the diagrams is not equal to, well, is equal to constant. You cannot prove the constant. But the sums of every time you get differential of a diagram, so the sum of five times must give you something differential of. It must give you something differential feature zero, so it's another equivalent way to do this by circulation. So it's probably about fifty quick one. About h by equal to one or whatever. Yeah. But then if you do like computer like wk here or h by equal to zero, like the leading term you have the same, right? Yes. If you could see quite a one a record about a responsible Yeah, yeah, for me, for Europe where I was carrying it. There are very sort of like technologies. I mean, you can take them like sorry, what is What do you mean? Ah, yeah. So well so we just think that if I just submit the spark version, I will find yeah, like It's another another level. This is one and another one, which I use or try to find a week will do well, for example. That's a nice one. Yeah, you know, it's an actual squared. The idea is that it's a little bit different. Those are these areas. You're really going to say my brother, my sister, my son. No that my sister. I have an itinerary. What is the side itinerary? No mistake. I mean the worst gate. I would for a while. One issue of the product, one is the same. Ah, the product, right? Then the grave. Then we can talk like a lot of sense. I think Samson says, but I would say I'll call it. But I would say I've got a lot of six different name. Actually, so that maybe you have any possible Well, we know that the framework is a very important thing. Okay, okay, now you should not be able to. So far, basically in paper, not the general and solving functions.
