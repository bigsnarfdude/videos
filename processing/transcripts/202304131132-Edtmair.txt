And he's going to talk about convexity, Hamiltonian dynamics, and syntactic dynamics. Okay, well, thank you for the invitation. So the goal of my talk is to try to motivate several different notions of convexity that become relevant if you are interested in thermodynamics or symplectic embedded questions. Okay, so let's start with basic definitions. So take a symplectic manifold M, and for the most part, it's five. M and for the most part it's fine to just keep Liquidian space. So all these questions already relevant in New Killian space. And if inside this particular manifold we have this hypersurface of real co-dimension one, then the symplectic form introduces this one-dimensional volation and that called characteristic volation, which is everywhere tangent to the kernel of the restriction of symplectic form to the hypersurface. And so the way I want to think about this is that I want to think of this hypersurface. Is that I want to think of this hypersurface really as an energy double set, so double set of some Hamiltonian function H. And you have such a Hamiltonian that uses a Hamiltonian vector field, Hamiltonian flow, and that's exactly the vector field that's tangent to the characteristic foliation. So first of all, it's tangent to the level sets because it's energy preserving, and it's also tangential to this characteristic foliation. So really, it's a characteristic foliation that can encode the Hamilton dynamics without. Encode the Hamilton dynamics without referencing specific Hamilton. You just have to remember what the level set was. Okay, so maybe the easiest example is if we take the round sphere inside Argument, Cn, then this voliation is just a Helper equation. So all the flow lines are periodic of the same unit. So this is maybe a bit of a misleading example because for a general hypersurface, this dynamics is extremely chaotic, which was mainly main observations. Maybe not the main observation of Ponkeri 100 years ago that kind of started the whole theme of dynamics. So it's extremely chaotic and extremely sensitive to small perturbation of the hypersurface. So only change the vector for a little bit, but if I flow for a long time, then changes things completely. Okay. So one of the goals of modern symbolic geometry is to prove non-trivial things about this modern dynamics. And kind of two very early results in this direction are the following rule. Direction that following rule. So Weinstein proved if you take a convex hypersurface inside R2n, that it must have a perfect ovant in the semoton flow on it. And here convex, I mean just something with positive definite second phenomena forms, most kind of classical sets. Okay, so you have this big class of dynamical systems, so they're extremely complicated, and they always must have a closed token. So that's a pretty cool theorem. And at the same time, actually, Rabinobitz proved something even cooler. So he proved that if we have a star. So he proved that if we have a star-shaped hypercirculus, that's one that's transverse to this radial vector field here, that also must carry a radio system in the general plastic systems. Okay, so one annoying thing here is that whether or not you have a periodic orbit, that's a completely symplectic notion, but convex and star-shaped are not preserved by ambient symptomorphisms. So Weinstein thought about what is the correct kind of symplectic. What is the correct kind of symplectic assumption in these theorems? And then he came up with the notion of a contact-type hypersurface. So that's a hypersurface where the flow on that sequence is a rate of goal. So there exists this contact-form lambda such that the T lambda is the restriction of the symbolic form. And that's equivalent to saying there's a transverse dual vector of UT behind the surface. Yeah, so that's sometimes also called confirmation. Sometimes also called convex. That's maybe bad terminology because convex is already overloaded, but we can view this as some sort of convexity assumption that kind of is also related to pseudo-convexity. So we get this kind of context structure on the hypersurface. The flow is a ray flow. And these star-shaped hypersurfaces, they are convective because they transfer to the radial rubble vector field. And there's more and more interesting examples. For example, hypersurface in the code. Well, hypersurface in the co-design bundle that are fiberwise star-shaped, important in classical mechanics. What founders are domains? Okay, so he came up with this notion and then he conjectured every contact-type hypersurface should actually be a very lobby, which is known as the Einstein conjecture we just heard about. It's kind of very hard and open in general, and there's like many interesting cases where you do know it. For example, conjectured hypersurfaces inside equipment space or the free. In space or the three-dimensional case, and it's not true in general. So you can't just drop the assumption altogether. So there's this kind of notion of convexity called contact type that is kind of very important for the question of very holes. Okay, so now I want to give a short introduction to symplectic embeddings. So we take two symplectic manifolds, x and y, of the same dimension. X and Y of the same dimension, and then a symplectic embedding is a smooth embedding that preserves a symplectic structure. And the fundamental question is: given X and Y, does such an exist or not? And typically for this question of interesting, X should have boundary. So if X is closed, then you're just asking X and Y to be sympathetomorphic. So really, X is something with boundary, and most of the time it's something very simple. Just a ball or ellipsoid or a star shaped domain. And then Y could be anything could be closed. Anything could be closed, could have boundary, and then we just ask: can we fit X inside Y? Right, and then the first kind of easy abstraction is this volume. So the semantic embedding preserves the somatic forms, it preserves volume. So that abstracts many embeddings, and then the question is, is there some more than that? Is it an interesting question, or is it just trivial? And then ground proof, it is interesting. So if you take the ball of symmetric size A and the Sunday, that's the size B. So it's just. The cylinder is just a two-dimensional disk across the remaining C factors. That can be proved that we can inject the ball in the cylinder if and only if A is less than or equal to B. So one direction is easy. If A is less than or equal to B, then the ball is just by definition contained in the cylinder. The other direction is the surprising hard one. So the cylinder is infinite volume, so there's no structure there, but still we have this result. So this is saying study simple decimaling problems, it's interesting as the result. Okay, so if you want to study them kind of in a more systematic way, there's this notion of a symplectic capacity that's useful, but organizes symplectic penetrating constructions. So capacity is just a function that inputs a symplectic manifold with some dimension and outputs a non-negative real number or maybe infinity. And if you satisfy these two properties, it should be kind of monotonic. If we have an embedding of x into y, then the capacity of x should be less than the capacity of y. Less than capacity of y. But in other words, if we have some y of capacity less than capacity of x, then there does not exist any embedding, so it's an embedding construction. And the symbolic form measures two-dimensional areas, so it also can scale like a two-dimensional quantity, which is composed of a symbolic form. And sometimes we also require that uh to be normalized, meaning it should the capacity and the call and the solid should agree and uh hey. So the easiest example is the volume, the correct exponent. That's a very scaling property. It's certainly not normalized because the student has infinite volume, but it's a capacity. And then what are capacities that are very easy to define? One by definition are the chronof width and the cylindrical capacities. The chromosome width measures the size of the largest ball that fits inside. That fits inside, and just linear capacity measures the size of the smallest cylinder I can fit my X in. Right, and it turns out that these two actually are normal dash capacities, which is very non-trivial. It's essentially a reformulation of the chromatin squeezing theorem. Okay, so we have these first capacities. Now, if I want to learn something new about some black embeddings, it's useless because unless I already understand embeddings, it can never compute. The standard embeddings, I can never compute the standard. It's kind of circular. So, I really want to get something new and interesting. I should better define capacities in terms of something else, and then I can import some other insight into the goal embeddings and actually get something new. And one very common way of doing that is to use dynamics. So, right, so if we take a global domain, so it's an exact symbolic manifold with context-type boundaries, that's this convexity assumption. Context-type boundary, that's this convexity assumption I mentioned earlier. Then it has this rate flow on the boundary, and the rape orbits, the closed orbits, have actions, which are just integral of the convex flow of the orbit. And then there's a kind of a long list of capacities that essentially are kind of very sophisticated ways of selecting certain action values. There's this ray flow, it has many closed orbits maybe, and then there's min-max procedures that kind of select certain action values. Select certain action values. And yeah, that's kind of a recipe for defining a long list of capacities. So, which should have you, there's the professindle capacity, there's some black homology capacity, equal and overcapacity, scrolling capacity, PCH capacities. Some of them appear in infinite families. There's a whole lot of these capacities. And many of them actually are normalized. The first capacities in infinite families are normalized and then guess what as well. There's many normalized capacities and even more. Normalized capacities and even more non-normalized ones. A lot of them are defined by dynamics. And so then kind of this definition doesn't involve symmetric embeddings. If maybe I understand the dynamics well, I can compute them and I get non-trivial constructions to symbolic embeddings. Okay, now I want to explain a very interesting conjecture of objects that of this of connected convexity. Of connected convexity, it's called Viderbo's conjecture. So, if you have one of these dual domains, I just want to define a minimum infinimum of all the actions of the early orbits. So, that's some possible number, or infinity if the bind-chain conjecture fails, if there's no orbit, that's infinite. Right, and then it's a conjecture called Viderbo conjecture. So, I think it's called Viderbo conjecture because it was the first person to write it down. But in his paper, he actually says it has been believed for. Says it has been believed for a long time that older conjecture, actually. Right, and so if you take a convex domain set R to n, and that's now the just classical notion of convexity, then it's conjectured that this solid ratio should always be less than or equal to one. So thisolic ratio is essentially taking the minimal action among all the orbits and we normalize it by volume to make it scale invariant, and we normalize it so that the ball has ratio one. That the ball has ratio one. Right, and then the conjecture is it's always less than equal to that. If equality fix actually, you have the domain is symbolic more than all. So, one way to view this is the sort of symplectic aspirometric inequality. So, instead of kind of trying to maximize volume among domains with constant surface area, we try to maximize the minimal action among all domains with constant volume. And this conjecture says everything that's in the ball is exactly the optimal shape for this. Is exactly the optimal shape for this problem. And so the ball should have the longest, shortest, orbit among all public states. Right, so there's a kind of stronger version of that called the strong redevelopment. It implies the weak one that says that all normalized capacities should agree on all complex domains. So to get from the strong to the weak one, so if we replace this minimal action here with a corrosive, then the inequality becomes easy because it's just the same. Becomes easy because it's just the same sympathetic embeddings that volume preserving. And it turns out that the minimal action is a capacity in context domains. So if the minimal action has to agree with the Chromoff width and the inequality is true for the Chromoff width, then it has to be true for the minimum action. The strong one, the weak one. But it's fairly strong. It's something about all normalized capacities. Okay, and so just some remarks about this conjecture. So we therefore actually proved. So, we therefore actually prove that the systolic ratio is uniformly bounded in non-convex domains. So, there's some finite constants such as the systolic ratio is always less than equal to that. And the conjecture is we can choose this constant to be one, where it's not known. But there's some finite explicit constant, where it is, maybe 10, I don't know. Right, on the other hand, among star-shaped domains, which is a special class of domains with conjecture boundary, the solar equation can be arbitrarily large. That's a result of Hubble-Mannel-Willprimmer. That's a result of prime harmoniation Saloma. So the notion is being star-shaped means having this contact-like boundary, and this notion of convexity is not enough for the general conjecture. So we need something stronger notion of convexity. Yeah, so now we actually have quite a bit of numerical evidence for this conjecture by Dash and Hutchings, where they compute the minimal action actually on convex polydopes and then try to optimize. Polytopes, and then try to optimize this flood ratio among convex polytopes on a computer. And it turns out you can't really find counterexamples that way. That's that the conjecture is true. Right, and also this conjecture has kind of many connections outside of symplectic geometry. And so clearly it's kind of already kind of interesting in just purely within symplectic geometry, and where it kind of connects to things even outside. So there's this kind of famous old problem called Marler's conjecture from convex geometry. Conjecture from convex geometry. I don't really want to explain what it is, but it's a kind of very hard, long-standing open problem. And it's implied that it needs to be able to conjecture. So this conjecture is kind of at least as hard as the other one. And also kind of has many interesting connections to remand against manifolds and the sort of closed geodesics. Quite some difference. Even outside spectrometry, which have some nice connections. Okay, so now I want to kind of explain some heuristics. So, now I want to kind of explain some heuristic for the Viking Devun lecture. So, that doesn't prove it, but I can read that heuristic. So, we assume that we have some smooth, strictly convex domain that actually maximizes the SOLIC ratio. So, we don't know this thing exists, but if we had such a thing, I want to claim that the boundary of this thing must actually be foliated by minimal action bullets. So, we're looking for the ball, for the round ball. For the ball, for the round ball, the foliation was just a hub vibration. So, this thing is true for the round ball. And when we say that for any maximizer that is smooth and strictly convex, it would have to be true as well. And this kind of works for contradiction. So, if you have some point, P in the boundary, that doesn't have a minimizing mobile fluid, essentially you can just shave off a little bit from the domain, and that decreases the volume, but it leaves the the minimal action constant, uh so it increases its own ratio. So it increases its own range. So essentially, what we do is we have quickly convex domain, and then there's some point P, and there's just no, so the flow line through P is not a minimizing closed orbit. So if we kind of slightly remove a bit from the domain here, we can do this and keep the domain smooth and strictly convex. We don't create any shorter orbits. Like all the minimizing orbits are kind of away from this point are not affected. I'm away from this point, not affected. Right, and so that would be a contradiction. So, any smooth street-based maximizer has to have this property to be correlated by minimizing orbits. And this, in fact, implies that the solid ratio should be equal to one. And probably it also implies that the thing must be symptomorphic at all, although we don't know that in higher dimension, or the dimension four. Right, the problem is there might just not be a strictly convex smooth maximum mass. If we knew that, we would keep done, but be fine. Okay. Now, right, in the remaining 10 minutes, I want to summarize my own work that is connected to convexity. So what is known about the toric convex domains? Is that what it looks like? Yeah, yeah. So if a toric, so even if you just have less symmetry, just S1 symmetry. Be just S1 symmetry, then it's kind of known and not that hard. So the hard thing is if there's close symmetry. Right, so as I mentioned earlier, being convex in this classical sense is not a symplectic notion. References the ambient linear structure. Then it might be kind of annoying from the point of view of symplectic geometry. We have this assumption which you can't drop and it's kind of not really symplectic. Really symplectic. So, an important problem is to find some more intrinsic acquisition of what convexity could be. And there is one notion of convexity which is kind of much more restrictive than having a convective boundary. It's called dynamically convex. It goes back to Hubisky Saylor. And for many problems, that turns out to be the right intrinsic notion of convexity. This is an important assumption in many papers. So, what it's saying is saying that every Saying that every periodic orbit and the boundary should have Kondlisinde index at least n plus one, n dimension. So if you haven't seen it, so the condisinder index, it looks at a cabinet orbit and then we can kind of look at the linearized flow along the closed orbit. So we choose, look at kind of this Mormon bundle of this closed orbit, and the linearized flow is kind of this family of linear maps Of linear maps that flow along the orbit. And one kind of measures how much that rotates around the orbit. So it's kind of measuring very nearby orbits how much due to the twist around the orbit. That's what this coin is in measure. And it turns out that a property of convex domains is that every such orbit has coincidental index at least n plus one, so everything that's convex is dynamically convex, and that kind of motivates this condition. The idea is that the linear So the idea is that the linearized flow is governed by the second fundamental form. And if we have a convex, then we always have to rotate positively. So on convex things, we get these lower bounds on this index. And then you just say anything that has properties called dynamic index, and maybe that was the violence. So it's clearly intrinsic. Right, and it is the right condition for many applications. And then the question is: is it the right condition for the Debbie's conjecture? Another question is, is it in fact a covalent convexity? Is it in fact a covalent to convexity? That's been my question. It's been open for it along. Maybe that's exactly the right thing that captures convexity. And then recently there was this work of HNS, and they constructed these dynamically convex domains of four that violate Viderbo's colour X. So actually it's close to two. So then after this paper, there was kind of two options. Either dynamical convexity is exactly the same thing as convexity and the contexture is just wrong, or these two notions are different. Or these two notions are different, and dynamic convexity is just not the right notion of convexity yet. That was enough open, and then Julian Jadez proved that there are dynamic convex domains that you can't make convex by any Yami and support hypothesis. So these two notions are not the same, and then some of these features can show you need something that's even stronger than the high confessor. And after this, we don't know yet what the right influency function is. Okay, then some more positive results. Essentially, if you know what the Arnold conjecture is, it's about fixed points of Hamoldomorphisms of symplectic manifolds. And Arnold conjecture is easy to prove if you assume that it be morphism is C1 close to identity. There's some generating function argument, and it's easy in this case and much harder in general. So then, such as maybe we should. So then, such as maybe we should kind of do some perturbative results. Let's just look at convex domains that are already close to the portal and see where we can compare. And then there has been obviously with respect to APH and S, and then later by Abundel and Benedetti, that proved that the B-Query Debo conjecture is true for all convex domains that are sufficiently closed to the mountain ball. And this turns out to be quite a lot harder than the C1 closed animal conjecture. So these are kind of. So these are kind of very important and serious papers. But yet, it's a bit exciting. You default the normal beef view developer conjecture. And I was able to push that with a strong conjecture. It's actually saying something about the Chromov width and this linear capacity. And if you need a ball in dimension four, then I get a strong conjecture both as well. And then I guess even more recently, and that's work in progress together with Alberto and Alberto and Gabriela, we can extend this second result to any dimension. So essentially, in this perturbative setting, I have no good understanding of the level conjecture, but not really for things that go far away from the ball. The interesting thing is, these things near the ball, if you look at the dynamics, that's already completely chaotic. So you have the ball with the completely periodic dynamics and you predict the. Completely the relative dynamics, and you predict it a bit, the dynamics becomes like a revolved already. So you kind of have to deal with that. But yeah, please result. And when you perturb it, is the rep vector field like C1 close? How close is the rep vector field after this? Yeah, so I guess if the domains are C3 closed, that means that the contact forms are C3. Contact forms C3 close as well. And then if you go to the array vector field, you have to differentiate the contact form. So you go to C2 close vector fields. Yeah. So yeah, probably one can maybe push the regularity a bit and see something about C2 close things. I mean there are some results, like say the full strength. But yeah, so I'm saying nearly around the pole being close. And already that is kind of surprising. And uh already that it's no surprise how difficult it is. Okay, so that's uh these results and uh then five on this left side that's good. One more result, something maybe a bit more global, far away from the ball. So the first remark is that any normalized capacity has to lie between the cross-width and smooth capacity. That kind of falls essentially from the definition and density of capacities. So the smallest normalized capacity. So it's the smallest, normalest capacity, the biggest one, everything else in between. And okay, so then we have this theorem, and it's like a theorem over many years by many people, and probably I've forgotten some in this list. But yeah, there was this kind of capacity coming from dynamics. So you have a whole lot of complicated ways of extracting actions of orbits. And now we know that many of these procedures actually give the same number, just a minimal action convex dependence. The minimal action on convex domains. So it's saying we have come up with very non-trivial ways of extracting the minimal action of the convex domain. So that's good. At least all of these extract the same thing. And then roughly speaking, the same, like among all the known normalized capacities, there's kind of three gaps. Graph width, the minimal action historical capacity. And then there's kind of these two gaps. We can kind of cut the strong between. Kind of cut the strong Vicabo conjecture in two halves. The minimal action they grow up with and the mismanagement capacity. And so this last result is essentially saying that in dimension 4 I can almost close the upper gap, almost the upper half of the conjecture. And so if x is star-shaped main inside of four, then its boundary is in S3. Than its boundaries in S3. So, in this low dimension, we can talk about knot types of vertic orbits. And I want to define this quantity A half, which is similar to the minimal action. But here just take the actions where the orbit is regarded to be an unknot and have self-linking number minus one with respect to the light context structure. So, the reason it's called a hop orbit is that the hop fibers of the hop vibration are unknots and they have. are unknots and they have self-linking number minus one. Right, then we can just take this in Pimu. And it's always bigger than or equal to a min, because a min we just need a bigger set of orbits. And it's very much conjectured that it actually agrees with the minimal action. So you would hope that the shortest orbit is simple and unnot. And I've known this in many cases, but not quite yet for all context domains. But this is kind of a much more tractable problem than the overall conjecture. Problem in the overall conjecture. Anyway, so then I can prove if we have a dynamical convex domain, then the cylindrical capacity actually agrees with this upper fashion. Right, so some here the assumption really is dynamical convexity. So somehow for the upper half of the conjecture, the dynamical convexity actually was the right notion. It's just for the lower half, it isn't. And so, what I like about this result is. So, what I like about this result is that Pinwheeler is like a sharp embedding result that exactly tells you when you can embed something into the cylinder. And this AHOP, at least in principle, you can compute in the computer. Just simulate the rate flow for a short time that you can do in a computer. So, in principle, you can figure out what this point it is, and then you know exactly which embedded to meet into. And what's very interesting about this is that most embedding results, we only know. Embedding results, we only know for things where the rate dynamics is essentially integrable, where we know all the results. And this is a result for just dynamic repeats domains, it's like a big class of domains with a lot of chaotic dynamics in it, and still we get a nice sharp result of many embedded results. Uh right, so that's uh the last resort dimension. That's like uh almost the easier half of the conjecture in dimension four. Of the conjecture in dimension four, at least something. Yeah, so time is over essentially, so I want to finish my talk here. Thank you and have a good lunch. That domain you have dynamically convex but not convex. Does the conjecture hold for that domain? Might actually get might hold for that special domain. Yeah, an interesting thing. Yeah, so there's this dynamically convex domain where the stoic ratio is close to two. And actually, this one actually could still be convex. We don't know that. We just have some other domains that are convex but not convex. But this one actually still could be. That this one actually still could be convex in the counterexample, but it's not very likely that it's not. Yeah? Is there any relation between convexity and the rate flow being right-handed? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's some recent work of Rinieric and Anna Florio, and essentially they prove that Essentially, they proved that they proved that for a certain big class of convex domains, we have maybe some curvature pinching assumption, but it's like some big non-trivial class. The rate flow must always be right-handed, which is very interesting because then you have this big class of dynamical systems, and the flow being right-handed has like extremely strong, like strong conclusions for the. Strong conclusions for the dynamics. So, for example, all the closed orbits must be fibered knots. Which is like if you have a very long orbit, you probably expect it to be not fibered because maybe not so many knots are fibered. But then you have this big class of dynamical systems where you know that all the orbits, even the extremely long ones, have to be fibered knots. Yeah, so there's these connections that it's known for some classes of complex time. For some classes of convex domains. It might be true for all convex domains, but that'd be better.
