Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks a lot to the organizers for the kind invitation and for giving me the opportunity of being here in this wonderful place and this great work. So today we speak about non-classicality in temporal processes. And I will use a notion of classicality and non-classicality that directly refers to the multi-time probability distributions. Probability distributions associated with sequential measurements of the observables. And we will be interested in particular on the connection, on the relation between this notion of classicality and the properties of the underlying temporal process, and of course, in particular, on its Markovian or non-Markovian nature. But before starting, I would like to thank all the people I work with in this research, the people at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, at the University of Ul, at the ECO. Of Ul at the Icoke Center in Vienna and also an experimental group in Padua. Okay, so the central question we are interested in is the Diodoro question: what makes the quantum description of the physical world different from the classical description? Of course, this is a question as old as quantum mechanics, but recently it has attracted a renewed interest and also, I would say, new perspectives of investigation, both from a foundation. Both from a fundamental point of view, and we can think, for example, to the recent developments in the theory of contextuality or to the recently introduced resource theory of coherence, and also from a more applied perspective. And here I would say the main reason is that the enhanced experimental capabilities have led to the observation of possibly quantum phenomena in regimes so far unexplored from this point of view. And we can think This point of view. And we can think as a relevant example to quantum biology and, for example, the possible role of quantum coherence in photosynthetic processes. And of course, in all these settings, when we ask whether a certain phenomenon is quantum, in the end we are asking how and if we can exclude the existence of any possible classical description of this phenomenon. And of course, besides that, we are also in Of course, besides that, we are also interested in understanding which are the key properties that exclude the existence of this classical description. And so, typically the role of quantum coherences and the role of quantum correlations, as we will see. So, as said, I will discuss, I will address this problem from the point of view of sequential measurements in time, so this approach to non-classicality. And the starting point. And the starting point will be the quantum description of the statistics. So we will always consider finite-dimensional hybrid spaces. And then, as we all know, if we consider sequential measurements at different times, and for most of the talk we will focus on the case of projective measurements of one and the same observable at different times. Then, the multi-time statistics, so the joint probability distributions of getting a certain Distributions of getting a certain value at time x1 at time t1, x2 at time t2, and so on and so forth, is fixed by the Borrowitz rule that you see here written in the language of super operators. So here we have the super operators. Each one acts on everything at its own values. And so this, the collection of these joint probability distributions, is the object are the objects uh of interest of our investigation, and so we can phrase the question we started from. The question we started from about the classicality or non-classicality of a certain phenomenon in this way. So imagine that we are given a collection of probability distribution as an input, as Philip was saying this morning, is the same kind of framework, the same kind of approach. And this might come from some experimental data or from some quantum modeling of a certain physical system. Then, is there a way to exclude the existence of any class? The existence of any classical description of providing the same description. Just a quick clarification: is there only one possible measurement basis at each time or is there freedom of choice? So in general, there is freedom of choice. At the very end, I will show some results where we can have any measurement, even non-projective measurements. But let's say in the first part, we have projective measurements because there is... But also you had only one choice of measurement. Only one choice of measurement cases projected at each time. You could always replicate it with a classical finite state machine. But not a dimensions based on the machine. Exactly. So this is... I will comment on that in a second because it's related with the discussion we had this morning, right, about the invasive assessments. And uh exactly. So first thing we have to clarify what we mean classically. To clarify what we mean with classical. And here, the notion of classicality we use is exactly the same that Felix was mentioning this morning: that is the validity of the cold model of consistency conditions. So the reason for this is that, of course, we are studying classicality in a multi-time settings, and here this is a natural choice because this is the defining property of classical stochastic processes. We have already heard this this morning, so I could completely skip this slide, but everyone, just to refresh our Just to refresh our memory, let's say. So the consistency conditions mean that if we sum up, if we are given a joint probability distribution and we sum up over all the possible values at a certain time, possibly also an intermediate time, then we end up with a joint probability distribution at the lower level of the hero. So we see here we start from a three time probability distribution, we sum up over all the possible values at the intermediate time, and we end up with the joint probability at the initial and final time. At the initial and final style. So, now the key point why we use this is that not only all the joint probability distributions of classical stochastic processes satisfy this, but also the converse statement is true. So, if we are given this collection of probability distributions as an input and they satisfy the Kolmogorov consistency conditions, then by virtue of the Kolmogorov extension theorem, we know that there exists a classical stochastic process. There exists a classical stochastic process reproducing exactly the same joint covariance. So, this is the alternative, if you want, classical description we are looking for. So, there is always a freedom of choice of not measuring. There is. So, here we are comparing with the freedom of choice of non-measuring. You are absolutely right. And also, let me emphasize this: that of course this is a kind of classicality. If you want, you can think of this as a sort of strong form. A sort of strong form of classicality in the sense that this kind of classicality really means the possibility to perform non-invasive measurements. So, measurements without altering the multi-time statistics, which is the same kind of classicality that lies behind Laggert-Garde inequalities or also more recently the non-signaling and time condition. There, of course, I agree, also at the classical level, we can have something invasive. In basic, but then it becomes, in a way, more tricky to say what is classical and what is non-classical, if you want, or in a more pragmatic point of view, you can say, okay, this is a starting point. We use a strong notion of classicality, really meaning we have a classical stochastic process with a fixed, let's say, hierarchy of joint probability distribution, and then maybe we can also compare this with some classical invasive invasive process. And okay, about this, let me recall. About this, let me recall once again this very nice recent work by Philippe, where this approach is reviewed and also, as he said, is compared with the description of the emergence of classicality given by the theory of the coherence, also with the interpretation of quantum mechanics given by the coherent history approach. So, this is our notion of classicality, and then, of course, if we want to And then, of course, if we want to describe or model explicitly the multi-time statistics that we want to understand whether it's classical or not, we have to take into account that the system we are dealing with in general, so the system that is being measured in general is interacting with the surrounding environment, so it has to be treated as an open system. We all know that. I will not go into the details of this. Let me just say that, at least for this first part of the talk, I will always consider it. First part of the talk, they will always consider an initial product state with a fixed state of the environment and the global unitary evolution. So, the open system and the environment together are a closed system. This allows us to determine the reduced dynamical maps, the family of completely positive trace-preserving maps that describe the evolution of the organ system state. And for us, it's very important to stress that this family of dynamical maps fixes the one-time probabilities via. Time probabilities via the corresponding, of course, expectation value of the projectors. So if we have the state of the system at the time t, let's say this one, given by the dynamical maps, then we know the probabilities are associated with measurements at one time. We can change this time, but we only know one time probabilities. And in general, we cannot infer from dynamical maps also higher-order probability distributions. In order to do that, we would have to. To do that, we would have to go back, so to speak, to the unitary definition that now involves the open system and the environment, and to apply the definition we started from and deal with the global unitary evolution. This is always the case, unless some quite special circumstances apply, let's say, that essentially allow us to apply the quantum regression theorem. This can be described This can be described qualitatively by saying that the system-environment correlations that are built up by the interaction between the system and the environment are negligible for what concerns the impact on the multi-time statistics at any time. If this is the case, then we can apply the quantum regression theorem. And the quantum regression theorem, as you see here, allows us to express all the hierarchy of joint probability distributions in terms of the open system state. In terms of the open system state and the reduced dynamical mass. So here we have the dynamical mass describing the evolution of the open system and the corresponding propagators also. So if you want here, we are also assuming that the evolution of the open system is divisible in order to define the propagators. But okay, so we can replace in the general definition the global unitary with the reduced dynamical maps. So in this case, they also fix the reduced dynamics of the multi-time probability distributions. But this is a Probability distributions, but this is a rather special case, let's say. And also, as also Philip said this morning, this case essentially corresponds to what we mean with Markovianity. On the one hand, it guarantees the validity of the property he showed, so that the conditional probability of having a certain value on the previous history only depends on the last value. And this, in turn, is equivalent to this property that is, let's say, more relevant from other. That is more relevant from our perspective, so that the whole hierarchy of probability distribution can be reconstructed from the one-time probabilities and, let's say, the lowest order, the one-to-one conditional probabilities. Let me say that this is true irrespectively of whether the multi-time statistics is classical or non-classical. This is guaranteed by the quantum regression theorem, what you have to specify if it is associated with the o with the with the with an observable that is non degenerate. Observable that is non-degenerate. So then from the quantum regression theorem, this follows. So in fact, you have a measurement on the system. Yes, yes, absolutely. Why should this be true? I don't understand why you should not. Yeah, sure, sure. Because the thing is that in general, imagine that you make a measurement at the intermediate. So let's say the definition you should start from this one. Right? So the multi-time object is defined in terms of the global state, the global unitary, and then observables, or in this case, superoperators acting on the system only. Now, if you perform only one single measurement at the definition, let's say time T1 and you apply Initial, let's say, time t1, and you apply this, you have the partial trace, and this buildup builds up this mass. But now, it's a naive way to see why it doesn't work in general. If you have two measurements, at time t1 and time t2, you only have one partial trace. So you cannot build up the maps, this first map at time t1, and then the propagator. A more elaborated way to see it, if you want, is that when you make a measurement at an intermediate time, At an intermediate time, you are modifying first the state of the environment and second also the correlations between the system and the environment. So you cannot, let's say, you cannot go from time T1 to time T2 as if there was no measurement at time T1. Something about those sort of in the codeplex, basically that's that memory or that age of memory coming along. Yes. And unless that memory is cut. So when you make the approximation, basically that memory is cut off and never. Absolutely. So, this I will also refuse. Memory effects of the environment which correlate with different measurements and, so to speak, modifies if you want the map that you use between time T1 and time T2. So, for example, if you allowed for having some stochastic map here, so some map condition. Some map condition on the value of the measurement, you could use some map defining the open system model. But this would be all another thing. So, but that's the reason. As it also has to do with the fact that you can only define lambda on an initial probability state, right? Yes, so this lambda exactly true if you start an HTTP power. Exactly. So that's exactly the case. In fact, if you want a rough way to see when the quantum theory holds, this is whether you can also. Holds this whether you can also at the intermediate times plug in a product state. So, let's say like the ball mark of approximation in a hard way. You really plug in the product state at any time, then you can build up the propagators. Then you can build up the propaganda. And this is the validity of the quantum theorem, it's the definition of Markovianity we will use, and let me stress that this is our. We will use, and let me stress that this is actually strictly related to a notion introduced by Mauro, Calvan, and others, and reduced in this paper, and also to an approach by Adrian in this introduction. Okay, so in the Marcomian case, in this spatial regime, it's possible actually to establish a one-to-one correspondence between non-classicality and the specific property of quantum coherence. One, coherence, which is in particular the capability of the dynamics to generate and detect coherence, which we call without so much imagination CGD, so coherent energy and detecting dynamics. And that can be expressed formally via the total diffacing map. So the total diffacing map is a map that cancels all the coherences with respect to reference bases. Of course, for us, the reference basis is the basis associated with projective measurements, and that's also why here we are focusing on projective measurements. On projective measurements. And so we say that a dynamics is CGD if there are times such that this inequality holds, which essentially means that there are times such that plugging in a dephasing at the intermediate time, we get a state transformation that is different compared to the one where we have dephasing only at the initial and final time. So in other terms, dephasing is an invasive operation for the dynamics. And we will go back to this later. To this later. And an equivalent way to see this property is that a dynamics is CGD if some coherences are generated by the dynamics and the same coherences are turned into populations. So it's not enough, so to speak, to have coherences. We really need that we go from population to coherences and then from these coherences back to populations. In one of the previous talks. Yes, exactly. Exactly. I I I would say, yes. What makes these coherences quantum? By itself, nothing. So I would say in general nothing. What I will show in a second is that under some circumstances this can be connected with non-classicality. But in general, I don't say nothing. But in general, I don't say nothing. Okay, absolutely. But I will go back on this more concisely in a second. Which essentially with this result, that tells us that, let's say, if we consider an open system observable that is non-degenerate, again, this is something we need, and we consider the multi-time probabilities associated with sequential measurements of it. If we have a Markovian statistic, If we have a Markovian statistics, then there is a one-to-one correspondence. So, if we have a Markovian statistics, then the statistics is classical for an initial diagonal state if and only if the dynamics is not CGD. So, in other terms, if the dynamics is statistics, if the statistics is Markovian, then the capability of the dynamics to generate coherences and turn them into populations is in one-to-one corresponding. Is in one-to-one correspondence with non-classicality. And the reason for this really lies in this requirement of every Markovian. Because the key point is that here we want to connect a property of the whole hierarchy of the probability distributions, which is classicality or non-classicality, with the property of the dynamics, so with the property of something that lives at the level of one time probability distributions. So in general, there is no direct connection. There is no direct connection between these two things because, of course, we can go one way by taking the marginals over the last value, which is something we can always do, also quantum mechanics, causality. But in general, we cannot go the other way around. So we cannot have a one-to-one correspondence from something living here and the whole area. Unless, as said, the statistics is Markovian. Because if the statistics is Markovian, this is precisely what allows us to reconstruct the whole. Allows us to reconstruct the holiery in terms of the lowest level and the one-to-one conditional probabilities. And then, if the statistics is Markovian, we can have this one-to-one correspondence with one-to-one coherence. Or more in general, with the property of the dynamics. In general, we cannot. So, if we want to go beyond the Markovian case, we can no longer rely on this, so on inferring the whole here. The whole hierarchy from the lowest order one, which is in the end related with the fact that we can no longer rely only at least on dynamical maps, right? Because dynamical maps, when use dynamical maps, so dynamical maps in the open system do not fix the multi-time statistics. So we need something on change. So then I guess in so when when we apply so here you're talking about just that should be But when we don't, let's say, controller, we measure only at the end, but we apply pulses in the middle. But the pulse in the middle also reveals the presence of that, like the normal cognitive. So can I think of, in that case it would be the probability of X1, XN at N conditional application pulses. So I really don't have like a multi-time correlation function, but is the presence of the false or not? Can I think of that? not? Is that can I think of a similar computing? Absolutely, and actually there are some words that go in that direction. I will have to forget, I don't know what these are. That connect the legged calc inequalities to something like that. So the idea that in the end, the unitary of the task that you are putting there is still an intervention. So if you compare them with the situation, so and and so you can do a situation. And I mean, it was actually done for for the lack of guidance. I mean, it doesn't Exactly, which is my core goals. Yes. Sorry, Andrea, here are your Hamiltonianist independent? Maybe, right? Or not? Not necessarily, I would say. I mean, you can include that case in state-independent Hamiltonian. If I understood correctly, that would be to compare the situation where I have pulses with the situation where I don't have pulses. So I could include these. So I could include this, but let's say the definition would not of classicality and non-classicality I'm using would not directly apply because here I am really thinking about let's say putting the projective measurements, but it can be extended to include that actually via the code format. And actually this is this is in a way exactly what I Precisely what I want to say, in the sense that to deal with the original situation, we need, as we've heard already several times by now, quantum comms or process tensors, if you prefer, that were introduced to describe the most general quantum sequence, they are the finest multilinear function on the set of quantum operations, and let's say most importantly for us, they map the sequence of any sequence of interventions. Sequence of interventions, so any sequence of completely positive and traced on increasing operations into the corresponding probability of occurrence. And so if we plug in objective measurements, we have the object essentially we were thinking, we were discussing until now. And also for us, it's important to stress, as it was already mentioned, that quantum comms analog. That quantum comms analogously to quantum channels, they have a unitary dilation. So one can always introduce an environment and a unitary on the system of interest and the environment. So that this definition really becomes the one we started from with the unitary at the level of system and the environment. And okay, they include the information of the impact of the environment on the multi-phase statistics, and so at least in principle, they can be reconstructed by a multi-time tomography. Reconstructed by a multi-time tomography at the level of the open system only, and as I said, they are strictly related to the process states. And so, in our context, the first thing we did related with quantum comms was in a way to give a characterization explicit, maybe not very easy to deal with, but explicit about classical comps, so about comms associated with a classical probability. Classical, probably with a classical multi-time statistics, classical in the sense of Kolmogorov. And the basic idea here is that Kolmogorov consists of condition, if you think of it, it can be solved when applied to quantum objects by saying that a non-invasive measurement is equivalent to doing nothing. So with comms, plugging in the identity or plugging in the total be phasing should be the same. So full be phasing is a non-infaced. This means essentially. Is a non-invasive, this means essentially fully phasing is a non-invasive operation for the multi-tank statistics. It cannot be distinguished from the identity. This is, the core model conditioned phrase in the language of cores. But classically, you have fixed base, and here now your definition depends on base. Absolutely, absolutely, yes, yes. The definition of something can be non-commodoring in one base and co-ordering. This is absolutely true. I will say one thing about a possible process that can. A possible process that is classical, or sorry, non-classical, irrespectively of the basis at the very end. But until now, everything I'm saying is basis-related, analogously to what happens in the coherent steel basis. You're absolutely right. And so from this, one can get an explicit characterization of classical comms using essentially the Choi-Amiolkovsky somorphism for comms that works similarly, let's say, to the one we would for. Let's say to the one we would for channels, one and some would call a multi-time choice state, if you want acting on a multipartite hyper space. And the thing is that any comb or the choice state of any comb can be written as the sum of two terms. The first one that is a combination of terms that are given by the product, by the tensor products of the projectors associated with the projected measurement. Associated with the projected measurement we are looking at. And this term here describes the part that can be accessed by the measurements on these reference spaces. So these measurements would provide a joint probability distribution that we see here. The second term is all the rest. And what we've shown is that, so we have a classical comp if this term satisfies this constraint. Now, without going into the details of this constraint, on the one hand, it gives us a way to give Hand, it gives us a way to give a structural characterization of classical comps. And on the other hand, it already shows up that for this to hold, we don't need this term chi to be zero. So in other terms, also here, in order for the multi-time statistics, for the COM to be classical, we don't need it to be diagonal in this, if you want, multi-time basis, reference basis. Also, here we need the B, if you want to. Here we need that what we call this coherent multi-time coherences are generated and then can be detected by a measurement in these reference basis. So just mention I would think that for basis independence you would want something like as preserved under entanglement breaking channel. So if you have an entanglement brain channel, instead of the coherence channel, the two things are equal. Is that something about that? Okay, not from this perspective. Not from this perspective, one thing that I cannot be related to what we mentioned in the last slide. Exactly. So, one thing, in a way, it's related in the sense that more than entanglement breaking, or at least from this perspective, is really about macro. So that is about the correlations in time. I I have one intervention so that it is But it is not guaranteed that for Q plus one intervention is good. Yes, so here we are speaking about, you're absolutely right. So here, to be precise, I should speak of classic, if you want, K classicality. So I fix in advance the number of interventions and also the times of interventions. That's correct, please. And besides this, so we also related this classicality to a property of the global evolution, which is zero discord of the global state, of course, zero discord with respect to the reference bases. So one can see that, of course, if the global state That of course, if the global state has a zero discord at any time, yes. So, zero discord, let's say if you want one definition, so in a way, these are these two, so to speak, or let's say to be more precise, this is the definition of zero discourse state. So, the zero discourse state on the let's say on the system side. So, the idea is that, so this would be called in the language of discourse, that may be a bit confusing here, but let's say a classical quantum state in the sense that. Quantum state in the sense that we have on the system side, we can write this state if you want as a separable state, so with the convex combinations of tensor products on the system and environment side, but on top of that, the states on the system side, they form an orthogonal basis. And the reason why this is, so to speak, special is precisely that if we perform a non-selective measurement on this basis, Measurement on this basis on the system side, we don't modify the global state. So, in this sense, a reference, a measurement in this basis can be seen as classical in the sense that it doesn't modify the global state. And this, let's see, in the paper where this was introduced by Zure, was related you can think of this as related with the emergence of the pointer base. Emergence of the pointer basis. So, this is also related to the theory of the coherence. Of course, in that case, the zero discord part would be on the environment. While here, since we are looking at the measurements directly on the open system, so to speak, to have classicality, we need zero D score on the system side. Here uh you fix the the phase. Yes, yes. When usually when there were physical state exact. So this is zero discord with the fixed basis, you're right. So it's this let's this is also I think the definition the let's say as the original definition by Zurek apart from the fact that he was on the environmental side and this is the system. But I agree that the more general at least the definition of zero discord can be also based This can be also basis independent. But this is a basis-dependent COD score. And so, besides this, we also show not only that 0D score implies a classicality because 4D phasing is non-invasive for the global state and then for the statistics, but also here that the convert statement is true, so that we have a classical statistics, even though if the dynamics, so a non-classical. So, in non-classical statistics, if and only if the global dynamics generates quantum discourse that can be then later detected by a measurement on loops. And very briefly, we can recover the Macovian case precisely when the comb factorizes. So, factorizes means that the comb reduces to the application of the project of the propagators of the dynamics, and then the definition we started from essentially reduces to the to the quantum regression theorem. The quantum derivation theorem, and also this property here reduces to the CGT we've seen before. So, the Markovian case is precisely when the common factorizes. And very last thing, also related to the things you've asked. So, until now, we've also spoken about classicality in one fixed measurement. What about if we change measurements, which we allow for any possible measurement, even possibly different measurements at different times? Is there a process that is Is there a process that is non-classical irrespective of the measurement we make? It's quite easy to see that in the Markovian case, this cannot happen. And the reason for this is, again, Markovian case means that everything is fixed by the propagators of the dynamics, of the reduced dynamics, and everything is fixed by the open system state at different times. And then, if we plug in, if we make projective measurements at different times with respect to the eigenbasis of the regulation. The eigenbasis of the reduced system state, by definition, a non-selective measurement in this basis will not modify the state of the open system. So we always have at least one measurement that is classical, if the statistics is Markovian. While if the statistics is non-Markovian, we can have, we found an example of a situation where we do have a process that is non-classical for any possible measurement. Any possible measurement scheme? Maybe we can speak about this later for someone who's interested. If you want to ask more details about this person, because I would just, okay, this is what we have seen, just to say a couple of words of future investigation. On the one hand, we would like to, let's say, apply this approach to understand the non-classicality quantum in the sense. Classicality, quantum in the sense of non-classicality in different areas, for example in quantum thermodynamics, for example, understanding what is the role of non-classicality in quantum thermal machines, for example. And also, we would like to understand from a more microscopic point of view what determines the classicality or non-classicality of Markov or non-Markovan processes, right? Because here never spoken about a microscopic derivation of the different Microscope derivation of the different results. And here, of course, as usual, the big difficulty is the non-trivial interplay in the genetic micro regime between the memory effects directly due to the interaction between the system and the environment, and the memory in the measurement, so to speak. So the back action, if you want, due to the measurement, to the conditioning on the previous results of the measurements. Okay, here you can find more details about. Here you can find more details about this, and thank you for your attention. Questions? I get the feeling that your very last slide with that definition is very similar to thinking about it as identity versus uh entanglement breaking operation, because if you have freedom to choose any possible projective measurement, Choose any possible projective measurement. If you don't affect something, then that means that there's kind of no entanglement as well, right? At least no. I'm not 100% sure. We would say entanglement in time, I don't see both. So speaking of the choice state of the cone, then. Then, of course, there is a whole line of research about, let's say, translating or seeing the relation between entanglement in time, so to speak, and entanglement in space. So, this might also be a matter of time. Right, so that actually might second my question. This coherence, this property of non-classicality, does it translate to a natural property of the choice state of the comb? So, from the choice state of the comb, yes. So, from the choice state of the code, yes, it's so natural. I don't know how natural it is, but let's say this one, you could also write. So, this one you could also write in terms of the choice state. Right, but you could think of all the choice states that satisfy this constraint. Right, but it's not something very simple, like the choice state has no discord non-I wouldn't say at least it's not obvious. Choice state entanglement is slightly stronger in the sense that a microbian process is a product state, and so that would be considered classical because you could always kind of simulate it with classical resources, even though it would be quite complicated. So it's like entanglement in the choice data is a lot stronger in terms of consensus. It seems to be always the question of is it classical or not classical? Can you use these criteria of not being classical and make a measure out of this somehow? Measure how much unclassical? Actually, yes, this is something I didn't have, let's say, time to put on the slides. But yes, we also devised a measure on classicality based on that, essentially based on a kind of distinguishability criterion. Of distinguishability criterion, so to speak. So, if we are given a comb, how close we can go via all the classical codes. And this provides a measure of non-classicality that actually we showed it can also be translated into a semi-definite program, so it can be evaluated. That is related to some measures of non-classicality that one could introduce, let's say, that are also used, for example, I don't know, the absolute. That are also used, for example, I don't know, the absolute value of the difference between what you get by marginalization and the lower order probability, for example. I cannot say questions technically again and our next talk is that for certain no
