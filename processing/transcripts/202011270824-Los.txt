Okay, hello everyone, thank you very much for the introduction. So I'm going to talk about viscoelastic rate type fluid models of Gorgas type. Visceralistic rate-type models of higher order are used to describe materials with complex macrostructure. For example, geomaterials like asphalt binders, some synthetic abbers, also biomaterials like the vitrus and the eye. Because they are capable of capturing more relaxation mechanisms. We have some experimental results which I can mention at the references at the end from this century by, for example, Sharif Kashani Monism It Saikor for the Jeomet. Meats for the geometry, especially for those asphalt winders. The results for synthetic rubbers is very recent. It was done by Rehoch, I think, in 2020. You see some pictures of the Bohemian and of the asphalt, just for the beginning. The standard model that belongs to the right-type fluid models of second order is the model due to Burgers. We are in incompressible setting, and at my talk, I will concentrate also on the isothermal setting. Isothermal setting. And in the formulations of equations, most of the constants are set to be equal to one. The first equation is the incompressibility condition. The second is the balance of momentum, where the non-Newtonian part of the Cauchy stress tensor S. Tensor S is such that the second order equation for S holds here the time derivative is it is actually so-called upper convective older derivative. It is it is M. It is an objective derivative, which means that if I rotate the matrix A by a rotational matrix Q with determinant one, then Q T A Q T, this auto right, is equal to Qt L Q A or the right Qt so that is observer invariant, which the ordinary material time derivative would not be, but it is non-linear thanks to the terms gradient of V A and A times gradient of V transposed, which makes the problem quite difficult. This setting for the Burgers model or for the Or for the second-order model, that does not provide a priori estimates given by data of the problem. And when it is written as a second-order equation, there is also a problem how to give the interpretation for the time derivative of S, how to describe the time derivative of S at the beginning. However, there was some recent observations. I saw it computed by Mark in 2015. This setting for the Burgers model falls from the setting of a mixed. From the setting of a mixture of two ordroid B models of the first order, where the non-Newtonian part of the Cauchy stress is a combination of sensors B1, B2 for which the first order time derivative holds. And provided that we set the The connection between constants between material parameters O and G in this slide and the material parameters alphas and betas from the previous slide. As you see here, then the setting for these two algorithm models implies implies the setting implies the formulation for the Burgess model of the second order which you saw in the previous slide this viewpoint allows one to develop an hierarchy of Burger State models of the of mixtures of Of mixtures of two models of the first order, of two models of the first order. And here in the terms bi, there are some exponents. If lambdas are equal to one, then it corresponds to the One that it corresponds to the mixture of two Android B models, but now we have an here are here of models for lambdas from R which all which can be all derived from similar thermodynamical principles as the older B models, yes, or as the mixture of the Models, yes, or as the mixture of the two order B models. The concepts are that if we suppose that B has the form F F T, such that determinant F T F is such the determinant of F is positive. Then no. Then f are some deformation tensors, and the thermodynamical principle is that the deformation tensor can be split in a multiplicative way into the part that is elastic and into the part that is inelastic and. The the the yes and and there are the and there are yes so that is the condition that yes and those F corresponds to the to the elastic response of the ice component of the body and there are more And there are more relaxation mechanisms. Here, in the case, we have two relaxation mechanisms. So, we have i equal to one or two. And all those models comes from all those models comes from some conservative equations relating the state variables. The state variables such as the density, velocity, temperature with the stresses, fluxes, etc. Yes, those conservative equations must be formulated in order to get the whole system of equations. And the constitutive equations come from Comes from the relations for free energy and raw of and trade of the entropy production. And as you can see, let me briefly mention that the non-Newtonian part of Helmholtz free energy is, as you can see, it is It is always no, it takes the minimum if there is no deformation, if the tensor B responsible for the deformation is equal to identity. And you may observe that if B is equal to identity, then the elastic part of the free energy is equal to zero. Yes, and it so the elastic part of the free energy contains the deformation tensors B, its invariance, it is non-negative and it is equal to, it takes the minimum and this is equal to zero when there is no deformation. So it sounds quite logical. In the isothermal setting, it holds the so-called reduced thermodynamical identity in the form which you see here. And if we sum the let us say energy equality for kinetic energy acquired from Acquired from the balance of momentum tested from the balance of momentum multiplied scalarly by velocity and from this reduced thermodynamic identity we see that all these models provide a priori estimates for the for the velocity. For the velocity and for trace of B minus logarithmus of determinant of B at time t, and they are estimated by V and trace of B minus logarithmus of determinant B at time zero. So it is it is acquired from the energy equality and from the reduced thermodynamic identity where Identity where free energy and rate of entropy production have this form. And it is common for all models yamda. Oh, like me, why? Yes, yes. So I'm going to talk about mathematical results, especially about globally. Globally solutions. For simplicity, let me now in this talk consider only one deformation tensor, the second deformation tensor is identically equal to zero. We can acquire from a priori estimates that the The problems P lambda has the property that B is L1 if lambda is less than or equal to zero, and the time derivative of B is integrable with respect to time if lambda is less than or equal to zero. And there are very few results concerning the weeks. The weak solutions, the global weak solutions of these late-type fluid models of let us say Burgess type. It is those models E lambda. And for example, the question about Android V model is open. There is some result from 2000, from Leon's and Mass Moody. From Leon's and Mass Moude to remodel similar to Aldroy, but instead of the upper convective derivative that they used an objective time derivative, but instead of gradient of V, they used its anti-symmetrical part, which simplifies the analysis, but it does not come from, it does not. From it does not come from the thermodynamical principles which I described before. In 2011, Mass Moudi gave some sketch of the proof of weak sequential stability of weak solutions to the so-called Gizekus model. The Gizakus model is when we set lambda equal to zero. Mass Mouli gave us some Are some very important ideas, but as I said, it is only a stage of the proof, and there are some mistakes. So we decided to do it correctly, not to do even weak sequential stability, but to introduce also suitable approximations and Approximations and to get mathematical sense of everything as well as we can. We were capable to do it in two dimensions and we were capable of Capable of considering two natural configurations, not only one, but two, B1 and B2. For both of them, the exponents lambdas are equal to zero. Yes, and it is not a problem, but we are capable to do it only in two dimensions. Dimensions. Let me mention the main program. So, under the assumptions that Omega is a bounded Lipsheets domain, in the assumptions of initial data and also let determinant of f at time zero is 0 is positive and logarithm of determinant f at time 0 is integrable over omega. We can find a weak solution to the so-called generalized Burgers system. It is the win-to-plu of functions v, f's, and b's that That are in the spaces coming from the a priori estimates, that they are also continuous with respect to time, and their time derivatives are integrable with respect to time. And here you can see the weak formulation, the balance of momentum in the weak formulation, and this is the equation for. This is the equation for B in the weak formulation. The first four terms are B aldroid, and the rest is B squared minus B is equal to zero. And B must have the form F F I T where the determinant of F i is greater than zero. So under the assumptions on initial conditions and proper properties of Properties of determinants of F at initial time, we are capable to prove the existence of such weak solutions to the system, which I have just described. Let me briefly say some crucial ideas about the proof. Now, at this talk, I will again. I will again omit the second tensor, B2. I will only talk about the case when B2 is identically equal to zero and in the row of B1 there is B. Yes? I would have F, V, F and B satisfying this weak formulation. So, So the first crucial idea by it is it was given by Masmouri. It was to consider instead of equations for B equal to FFT, only the equations for F. And some of this equation, yes, the equation one multiplied scalarly by F transposed from right, then takes transposed. Then take transposition of one multiplied scalarly by f from left, gives after summation exactly the formulation of the equation for b broid plus b squared minus b equal to zero. What are the advantages of this? First advantage is that we are that we are almost about to Almost about to test the equation for f by its solution. We can prove the positivity of determinant of f and we get the form b equal to f directly. Now, let me talk briefly about weak sequential stability. It is It is a very important part of the existence proof. So, let us consider a sequence of solutions to the problem balance of momentum and this equation one for F. The sequence V epsilon, F epsilon. sequence of weak solutions. We are capable of proof some uniform estimates and from these estimates we have subsequences converging in some sense to V respectively to F but not all terms are compact and we need to prove yield bars Bars denotes the weak limits, and we need to prove that the weak limits are exactly what we want. And for this purpose, it suffices to prove the compactness of the approximations f epsilon in L2. There are actually three main steps how to do it. As a starting point, point starting point is to consider those two formulas. The first one, it is actually the equation for the approximate equation for f epsilon multiplied by f epsilon phi and taking the limit as epsilon goes to zero. goes to zero. The second, it is the equation, it is the limited equation for f tested or multiplied by f phi. And we will be interested about the quantity f squared bar minus f squared. minus f squared and to prove that it is equal to zero almost everywhere which is equivalent to the fact that f epsilon is compact in l2 yes for the first formula it it suffices only in this inequality yes it needn't be equality it suffices only this inequality so from step one we should Step one, we should derive something like it is prepared for using the Granvaul slena, yes. Something like find derivative of the desired quantity f squared bar minus f squared is bounded by by L F squared bar minus F squared, well, where L is an L two Q T function. L is an L2 Qt function. And by using something like Ronvald's inequality, we are capable of proof that F squared bar is equal to F squared. So that the F epsilon are compact. We are not. Yes. Well, we are not allowed to use the groundwater lemon directly. Use the Granville lemma directly because the functions are not regular enough, and also we do not know anything about the continuity about f squared bar. Yes, we know about the continuity of f epsilon and about the continuity of f, but nothing about the continuity of f squared bar. So that we must do some modification, not only with respect to space, but also with respect to time. We need to extend all functions by zero and then take modifications over time and space. And as you can see, all derivatives are applied to the smooth stress functions so that there is no problem to extend everything by zero outside of Qt. outside of Qt and to use the fact that from negative times and also and outside of omingle the smooth functions are equal to zero and it is also equal to zero in some suitable sense after taking the limit. This was the part that This was the part that Masmuli did not do, but we did. Here I skipped how to prove the step two. I only commented how to get from step two, the step three. Yes? Briefly. And it is in mathematical symbols, it is described here. It is described here. So if L was regular enough, small f, it is the desired quantity, was continuous with respect to time, then it would be direct, but it is not the case. So we have, as I said, we need to do time-space modifying and re-normalizations to get this. To get this equation for it is the inequality from the step two, to get the renormalized inequality, to extend it for the test functions supported up to the boundary of omega, and then after choosing suitable renormalization function, you get that the desired quantity f is just equal to zero. just equal to zero that f squared bar minus f squared is equal to zero almost everywhere in qt which which gives the compactness of approximation and it is a crucial point of weak sequential stability of of approximations i will probably have to have to finish i'm sorry there is too much time i also wanted to mention I also wanted to mention that we are capable of proof existence of the approximations V epsilon, F epsilon with properties described above. And it is the same model, but only with stress diffusion. Yes, you have a priori estimate. Yes, and we do it. Yes, and we do it by Virkins' method. I think we should try to wrap it up because you know we are already 15 minutes over time. Yes, I am very sorry. Yes. And we have here we have controls of gradients. So from the Galerkin level to the level F epsilon, we get the compactness of Fn for And for free, yes. There were the problem about additional patterns because the systems are for FX are not the same, but it is easy to overcome them. I I'm very sorry for ex exceeding the limit, and thank you very much for attention. Okay, well, thank you very much. Okay, well, thank you very much.
