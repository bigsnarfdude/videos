And hopefully sharing your screen. Yeah, thanks, Nathan. Let me try to share my screen. How's that? Can you see something? That's good. This is my second talk since I bought a tablet. Awesome. Okay. Awesome. Okay. So I'm going to be talking about, I guess, romotion of plane partitions. And I'm going to try to tell you sort of everything I know about romotion of plane partitions, which is like everything that is known about remotion of plane partitions. But in particular, I'm going to aim at this recent work with Becky Petrius, who's in the audience. And this talk is being recorded, and there's also slides somewhere and Slides somewhere, and the paper is on the archive. Okay, so most of you, I think, were here yesterday, and we learned several times over about real motion, but let me very briefly talk about that. So, this is a dynamical action you can have on any posset, maybe a finite poset. So, I have a finite poset, I have jp being the set of its order ideals, and real motion is a way of taking an order ideal and producing a new one. I'm going to take my A new one. I'm going to take my order ideal and I'm going to send it to the smallest order ideal that contains the minimal elements of its complement. Okay, so I take my order ideal, look at the complement, take the smallest elements of that, let them generate a new order ideal. And we're interested in the dynamical structure of this action. You can iterate this action, and you want to sort of understand what permutation do you get. Well, if you just take an arbitrary postset, it seems like not very much nice happened. Like, not very much nice happens, or at least we don't seem to know anything in that case. But if you're the kind of person who's at this conference, you probably have a favorite post set. And whatever your favorite post set is, if you do this on your favorite post set, probably nice things will happen. This is sort of the philosophy. And today, our favorite post set is just going to be a product of three chain post-sets, sort of one of the basic post-set examples of post-sets 101. Of PostSets 101. Not because other post-sets aren't interesting, but this is maybe one of the cases where we know the most. So first let's talk about the case where C equals one. If C equals one, then really I have a product of only two chains instead of three chains. And here we know sort of everything that you might want. We know the order of the action. The order of the action is a plus b. And it's a plus b. And it's a plus b in sort of the obvious way. All the orbit sizes divide a plus b, but there really is an orbit of full size a plus b, namely if you take the empty order ideal, that gives you an a plus b sized orbit. And better than just knowing this, so if this tells us the order of the action, it tells us some of the orbits will divide that, but we can actually know exactly how many orbits there are of every size through the cyclic sitting result. So I guess no one yesterday talked about. I guess no one yesterday talked about cyclic sieving, so maybe I'll say very quickly what that means. But I have some generating function, f of q. This is just q enumerating the set of order ideals according to cardinality. And in addition to being this q enumeration by cardinality, it's sort of some kind of twisted generating function for the orbit structure in the sense that the number of fixed points Of some kth iterate of our operator is given by evaluations of this polynomial. So here zeta is a primitive, I guess, a plus b root of unity. So you can plug in various roots of unity and extract all the verb structure. Extract all the verb structure out of this polynomial. So we know sort of everything there. And then there's also a nice sort of homomesy result. So obviously, if I take a random order ideal, random order ideal will contain half the elements. So it will be size AB over 2. But you can restrict to any particular row motion orbit and take a random order ideal from that orbit, and you'll have the same expected value, the same expected ideal size. So this is the theorem of prop and Okay, so this is a theorem of Propanruby. I just wanted to mention independently and significantly later, it's a theorem of Buchan-Wang and their thinking about quantum Schubert calculus. And they don't really even know what is real motion. They know none of this literature. But they just find themselves in quantum Schubert calculus land needing exactly this theorem. And so they just go and. Actually, this theorem, and so they just go and prove it themselves. I thought that's a neat thing. Okay, so let's move on to the case C equals two. Now we're actually in three dimensions, and we know sort of all the same stuff, although more recently. So we know the order of the action. The order of the action goes up by one and in the obvious way. And we still have a cyclic sitting. This middle theorem here is essentially the same theorem we had on the previous. Essentially, the same theorem we had on the previous slide. You take essentially the same Q enumerator and plug in roots of unity and extract the full orbit structure. And we get basically the same kind of homomusey result. An average order ideal will have size A times B, and that's still true if you restrict to any particular orbit. This is the work that Corey talked about yesterday. Okay, well, we can just try inching our way up. We can go to We can just try inching our way up. We can go to c equals three, and suddenly stuff starts falling apart. We don't know the order anymore. We only have a conjecture. Conjecture is that the order goes up by one again. But we don't know that. This is sort of work in progress with, I'm not going to get these authors in the right order, but Stryker and Petrieus. And Petrius and Tomatsko. And Becky will be talking about this in the next talk a little bit. So stay tuned. The CSP dies a horrible death. If you just take the obvious Q enumerator we had before and try to get a CSP out of it, it doesn't work. Maybe there's a different thing you can do, but it's not the obvious thing. And the homomesis seems like fundamentally broken. Music seems like fundamentally broken. So much less going on. And if we get past C equals 3, we get to C 4 or above. Now everything's really hard. We don't have any idea what the order is of this action. If it was going up by 1 every time, we'd expect A plus B plus C minus 1. And that's not what happens. It's generally much bigger than that. But we don't know how big. We don't even have reasonable bounds on how big. Bounds on how big. I'll just show you a couple examples. So if I have A, B, and C all equal to 4, then instead of getting order 11, I get order 3 times that. And if I take A still equal to 4, but I make B and C equal to 11, then instead of getting order 25, the order is at least 309 times the thing you might have guessed, and maybe bigger, and that's the biggest I could find. Okay, so that doesn't seem to be a cyclic civic. Also, there doesn't seem to be a cyclic sieving in an obvious way. It's hard to even know how to start when you don't know the order of the action. And the homo music seems really bad. So can we say anything in this case? Well, sort of. There's this relatively strong conjecture of Peter Cameron and Dima von der Floss that says, well, at least in the case that you have this number being prime, That you have this number being prime, then maybe the orbits aren't that size, the size you may be expected to begin with, but all the orbits will be multiples of that size. So they could be huge multiples. We don't know like which orbit sizes appear, but we have a lot of control conjecturally on orbit sizes that don't appear. Namely, all the orbit sizes have to be multiples of this number. Okay, so this would give us a lot of structure into Structure into what these orbits look like. So, their evidence for this was: well, we know it's true for small values of C, and they can also prove it for large values of C. And then more recently, in work with Kevin Dilks and Jessica Stryker, we proved it for slightly smaller values of C. And it seemed like you could maybe sneak up on it a little bit more that way. But finally, Becky and I. Becky and I can actually resolve the whole conjecture. So that's what I'm going to sort of aim at today. And sort of the key to making this work is dropping the primality condition. So when you drop the primality condition, the correct version turns out to be that you have this number, a plus b plus c minus one, and it's never allowed to be relatively prime to any orbit size. So if it's prime, this means the orbit sizes have to be multiplied. means the orbit sizes have to be multiples of that number. If it's not prime, they could be multiples, they could be divisors, you know, there's some choice. But this is the way to express it. Okay, so the main tool that goes into our proof, just like a lot of things we saw on Monday, it's going to be through this sort of k-theoretic tableau dynamics. And so I'm going to explain this again. I'm going to do it slightly differently. To explain this again, I'm going to do it slightly differently than we saw on Monday, although it ends up being equivalent. So I'm going to talk about this k-theoretic jus decap operator on increasing tableau. So I'm going to start with two partitions. I have two partitions nested inside each other, thought of as young diagrams. So I get some kind of shape like this. And I'm going to fill the complement of lambda inside nu with positive integers. With positive integers, and I want them to strictly increase from left to right and strictly increase from top to bottom, something like this. So, this is an increasing tableau. And it's an increasing tableau of skew shape, but there's this k-theoretic je de quin operation that's going to take this tableau of skew shape and turn it into a tableau of straight shape, a tableau whose shape is a partition. Partition. And so the motivation for this is something in k-thetic geometry, but we don't really need the geometry. I'm just going to tell you combinatorially how to squash this thing down. Okay, so the algorithm goes like this. I'm going to take my skew tableau and I'm going to fill all the inner corners with a little bullet. So all the boxes of the skewed out shape that are maximally southeast in the skewed out shape. I'll put bullets in. In the skewed out shape, I'll put bullets in all of them. And now I'm going to apply a bunch of little swap moves, they're sort of toggles. Each toggle carries about two symbols. And what it does is it turns each symbol into the other symbol if it was next to a copy of the other symbol. So here I start by applying the swap to bullets and ones. This bullet isn't next to a one, so it doesn't do anything. This bullet's also not next to a one, so it won't do anything. Next to a one, so it won't do anything. This bullet is, so it turns into a one, and this one's next to a bullet, so it turns into a bullet. Okay, so let's see that. Okay, now I'm going to continue, and I'm going to do the bullets and the twos. So this bullet will stay put, and these will all swap with each other. And I'll swap the bullets and the threes and the bullets and the fours. I just keep going until all my bullets are on the outside, and then I will throw those away. So here I've got So here I've got a new tableau. Now it's still a skew-shaped tableau, but it's sort of less skew. There are fewer boxes here, so I will just repeat this with a new set of inner corners, and eventually I get down to a tableau of partition shape. So this is a way of rectifying a tableau. It's analogous to what you may have learned at some point. you may have learned at some point for standard tableau but with standard tableau you generally only start with one inner corner at a time although it turns out you could have used all of them okay so in the same way you use ordinary classical juda de quin to develop promotion of standard young tableau you can do the same thing for increasing tableau so let's look at the set of all increasing tableau of shape lambda Of shape lambda with entries between one and q. And I'll show you how to extract the promotion here. So the first thing we do is we get rid of the number one. Oliver, could you say a few words about what happens if a bullet is next to two elements of the same size? Just remind us how that K-theory works. You mean like here? Here? Yes. So this bullet is next to some twos. So it's going to turn into a two. You imagine that these twos have like some two disease. And if you sit next to them and you're a bullet, then it's contagious and you turn into a two. But like bullet disease is also contagious. So the twos, this two is next to two bullets, this two is only next to one bullet, but they like both contract bullet disease. And so And so they end up becoming the other kind of thing. Bustle of X here is nice and quarantined, very safe. Then I still have, I was the one who asked the question. Now you've got a boy which is next to both a three and a four. How do you decide whether it turns into the three or the four? So I'm applying these operators in order. So first I'm applying. You always have, right, gotcha. Yeah, so my alphabet has an order on it. Excellent. So first the bullet and the three infect each other. Bullet and the three infect each other. And now this bullet is now safe from the four, which escaped off to the outside. Got it. Yeah. So it's important that you have this order to go through things. And if you take a different order, you'll get a very different action. And just to be clear, the number of ones or twos or threes can change as you do this. Indeed, and generally does. But the existence of ones and twos and threes, that does not change. They can never go away completely. They can never go away completely or appear out of nothing. Any other questions on this? Okay. So I'm going to show you how to do this promotion. And it's a little bit easier than the general case. So I'm going to delete the one. And now I'm going to make all the numbers one smaller. Like that. And now I'm going to. Like that. And now I'm going to do the k rectification. And this is a little easier than it might have seemed because there's only this one inner corner to deal with because I only deleted one thing. So I'll do that here so we can see another example. So I'm going to do this sequence of swaps. First, I swap the bullets and ones. Then I swap the bullets and twos, but nothing happens because the bullet and two are not next to each other. Then I swap the bullet and the threes and both threes get infected. And the threes, and both threes get infected. And then I'll swap the bullets and the fours. And I get this. So notice things did change quantity as I went along. And the last step is going to be that I'm going to take my empty box and I'm going to fill it with the value q. Okay, so it's important now that we know what this value q is. So here I'm putting a 5 in. So here I'm putting a five in. So this tableau I started with, it lived in ink five of this shape. But you know, you could have thought of it as living in ink seven of the same shape or living in ink 20 of the shape. And if you do that, you're going to get a different promotion. The promotion cares about the tableau and sort of which place you're thinking of it as living in. Okay, so this is the K-theoretic promotion of this tableau. Of this tableau. And the key fact that Jessica talked about last time we were here is that there's an equivariant bijection between this action on increasing tableau and the row motion action we had before on plane partitions in the product of three chains. And so I'm calling them both psi, and that's okay because somehow they're the same thing. So it's not really obvious why this helps you to have. Really obvious why this helps you to have this other form that seems to confuse people. And I don't really have a complete explanation of why it's so useful to jump across this bijection, but empirically it is. And I'm going to take a moment to like try to explain that, but not entirely so satisfactorily. So one thing I like about moving to Tableau land is you can actually do computations by hand, like a lot more easily. Trying to compute row motion of a plane per To compute real motion of a plane partition, like a three-dimensional thing, on a piece of paper, like I can't do it reliably. But you know, promotion of this, this is like inherently a two-dimensional object and the algorithm, I don't know, I can do it. So you can just do examples. Then the other thing that's helpful is that because this came out of K-theoretic Schubert calculus, there's just a lot of literature. There's a lot of combinatorial tools that were developed by Tools that were developed by combinatorial geometers that you can use. In theory, you should be able to use the actual geometry to do something, but no one's been able to pull that off. I don't know how to really use the geometry. But the combinatorics that comes out of the geometry is very helpful. Okay, another really nice fact about looking at the Tableau side is you don't have to look at all of the Tableau. You can just restrict to looking at the Tableau that Restrict to looking at the tableau that genuinely use all the numbers between 1 and Q. So the point is that if I take this tableau that like seems to have an alphabet of size 7, but really only uses 5 things, I could have rewritten it like this. 5 is the fourth biggest thing. Why don't I just turn them into fours? And 7 is the fifth biggest label. Seven is the fifth biggest label. Why don't I just turn that into a five? I could think instead about this tableau. And somehow it's very similar. The other thing I keep track of is I could keep track of some sort of binary string of which letters of the alphabet that I actually use. So here I used in this Tableau, I used one and I used two and I used three and I didn't use four, but I did use five. But I did use five, and I didn't use six, and I did use seven. And so the point is that if I know this deflated version of the tableau, and I know this content vector, I can recover the tableau that I started with. And somehow that means that like all the periodicity information about this tableau is somehow controlled by what's going on with this gapless tableau and this vector. So, you can focus on this set of Tableau and because much smaller and still know everything. So, I said you can somehow construct the orbit structure of the Tableau before you squashed it down. And the formula is a little more complicated than you might hope, but like, here's a formula for how you translate back. Okay, so that the neat thing is that, like, suppose I want to understand plane partitions. Plane partitions of shape 8 by 8 by C for various values of C. Well, the bijection tells me I can turn this into increasing tableau of shape 8 by 8, where the alphabet can be sort of arbitrarily large. But by these observations, you can restrict just to 8 by 8 tableau that actually use the full alphabet size. And this And this is a finite set. Whereas this is definitely not finite. And so, at least in theory, everything here is computable. And yet it controls everything going on here. So you've sort of taken this infinite problem and made it something you can actually compute in. So you can really know what's going on in a useful way. Okay. But somehow there's more than that. But somehow, there's more than that. Somehow, like, we use this bijection a lot, and it's very powerful for mysterious reasons. So, let me talk again about the case C equals one. So, C equals one, that ends up being the same as increasing tableau with one row. Increasing tableau with one row should be controlled by gapless increasing tableau with one row. There is only one increasing tableau of one row that is gapless. You just write the numbers in order. Gapless, you just write the numbers in order. It's fixed by promotion. So, sort of, nothing very interesting can go on here. It's very clear to see that for an arbitrary tableau of one row, the order of promotion is Q. That's equivalent to the thing we had before. But another thing you can do is you can say increasing, sorry, order ideals in A cross B cross one, that's the same as. One, that's the same as increasing tableau of arbitrary rectangular shape a cross b, but with a fixed alphabet size, fixed based on the shape that you're working with. And again, we then know by the theorem we had on that first slide that the order of k-promotion here has to be a plus b. Okay, so I'm going to start collecting open problems for the future. Open problem here, give a direct proof of this. Give a direct proof of this fact. The only proof I know is to run through this bijection. Somehow that's not so satisfying. You should just be able to see this on the top low side. Okay, so what about the case C equals 2? Well, I can take plane partitions of height 2. I can take them to increasing tableau with two rows, or I can take them to increasing tableau of arbitrary rectangular shape, but with a fixed alphabet size. A fixed alphabet size. So we learned that the order on two-row tableau is Q. In fact, I had already done that a few years earlier, just looking at the tableau without knowing this bijection. But you can also figure this out for arbitrary shape at fixed alphabet size. And again, I don't know a direct proof. So that's another open problem. Another open problem, very similar to the one on the previous slide. How do you actually do that? You can get a different sort of cyclic sieving. So we had a cyclic sieving before for height two plane partitions, but it turns out you can restrict just to two row increasing tableau that are gapless, which is a smaller set, take a different enumeration, enumerate them by major index, and again you get a cyclic sieving. And this is also true. Is also true. And we get a different sort of homo music. If I take, so I look in my tableau, here's my tableau, and I'm going to take some boxes that are fixed by rotation 180 degrees. And I'm going to look at the sum of the entries in those boxes. I claim the average sum is always the same, regardless of which orbit I choose from. It's different than the homo music we had before. I don't know why that's there now. Okay. Can I make it go away? Okay. And so here's another fact about increasing Tableau that I proved a few years ago, and I didn't really know why I was doing it. It didn't seem like it had a lot of applications, but it was definitely true and seemed surprising. Seemed surprising. And it turns out to be exactly what we need to establish the conjecture of Cameron and Fonderfloss. So I'm going to think about the frame of my tableau. By the frame, I mean the union of the first and last, sorry, the first row and first column with the last row and last column. So here's the frame. So I'll do things around the outside of my tableau. And so here's a tableau with alphabet 1 through 11. It one through 11. And here I've promoted it 11 times. And it's not the same Tableau. But notice that the places where it went wrong are not on the outside. It's not on the frame. The places where it went wrong are here and here, right in the middle. And this turns out to be always true. You can take any rectangular increasing tableau. If you do promotion alphabet size number of times, you don't get the same tableau back. You don't get the same tableau back again, but it has the same boundary entries, the same entries in the frame. Okay, and sort of off the time, all I could think of to do with this was to improve that homo musey a bit. So before you had a homo musey for two row things, on the two row tableau, you should notice that the entire tableau is in the frame. And so the general statement turns out to be: take your Take your rotationally symmetric boxes to live in the frame. And then you can add up their values, and you'll always get the same average sum, regardless of which orbit you restrict to. And so Cori also has a way to turn this into some kind of homo misi for plane partitions, but it ends up looking really weird. Somehow, this notion Somehow, this notion of frame doesn't translate in a really natural way, I would say. Okay, so this turns out to be like all you need. Like once you have this, like you're almost done. So here's sort of the tableau version of this camera and von der Floss conjecture. So I'm going to take an orbit. I'm going to take a big orbit and that has cardinality k. Cardinality k, and I also have an alphabet size of q. And the statement is that k and q can never be relatively prime, except in the degenerate case that q is so small that there's only one tableau that exists, and then there's only one tableau, so obviously the orbit size is size one, and that's okay. Okay, and so here's basically the entire proof. The point is, I'm going to look. The point is, I'm going to look at my orbit. Here's my orbit, all these K things. And what we said was that when I do Q-fold promotion, I'm going to get the same frame. So here is my first tableau, and I promote Q times, and now I have the same frame, and now I promote Q more times, and I got the same frame. I just keep going. And the point is, if K and Q are relatively prime, then this. Prime, then this eventually hits everything. So if they're relatively prime, then every single Tableau in this orbit has to have the same frame. In particular, my Tableau that I started with and its promotion have the same frame. And this is just really hard to have happen. So if I look at my tableau and I look at an entry in the frame, An entry in the frame. I'm imagining it didn't change when I did promotion. Well, if it didn't participate in any of those little swaps, then it would have gotten one smaller. Because like the first thing we did was we made everything one smaller, and then we did swaps. So like it had better do something. So somehow the entire frame has to be involved in swapping. But like if it's involved from swapping, then like this entry had to move here and also get one small. And also get one smaller. So the entry that used to be here has to be one bigger than the entry that used to be there. So they like just literally have to be consecutive along this row, and then they just have to be consecutive down this column, and then also down this row and down this column. And so just everything is consecutive around the outside, which means the alphabet is tiny. Which means we are then in the case that the alphabet is really small, and there's only one thing to fill in. Okay, that's basically the whole proof. Okay, so you can translate this back to plane partitions, and you get the theorem I showed you before without this primality condition. But in particular, you extract the proof of this conjecture of Cameron and Fonderfloss that when the orbit size you expected was a prime number, then all the orbits you get will actually be multiplied. All the orbits you get will actually be multiples of that. You might be worried what happened to this degenerate case where you only had things of size one, but that ends up mapping under the equivariant map to the case C equals zero. So we're looking at plane partitions. Well, they're like not really plane partitions. We have A cross B cross a sine of size a chain of size zero. There's not really anything there. We can just ignore that. We can just ignore that. Okay, great. So, this tells us a lot of structure. This tells us that although we don't know which orbit sizes appear, we can restrict the possible orbit sizes to like a very sparse list. It's very natural to wonder what multiples actually occur. So, here's another one. So here's another one of these open problems. A weaker open problem is: well, maybe even if I didn't know exactly which multiples occur, could I at least give some bounds on them? Could I at least show these orbits aren't too huge? Experimentally, they're quite small relative to the size of the set you're working with. But I don't know how to control that in any meaningful way. There's also a stronger way to Stronger way to ask this question. Even if I knew all the multiples that showed up, I could wonder about their frequency. How often do they show up? And it doesn't seem like they're distributed in the obvious way. In particular, you're going to get odd multiples of Q more often than even multiples of Q. So we'll get some things that are two times Q, sometimes that are three. times q, sometimes they're three times q, some things that are five times q, but you'll find a lot more three q's and five q's than you'll find two q's and four q's experimentally. And I don't know why, and I don't know how you would even begin to prove such a thing. But it does seem to be the case. So if I have time, I'll pull up some SAGE code and try to show you what's going on here. But let me finish with my slides first. Let me finish with my slides first. So, the other very open thing is that we know that with standard Tableau, you can interpret the orbit structures here in terms of real Schubert calculus, in terms of some geometry. It's telling you about some monogyomy in real Schubert calculus. And it would be nice if... It would be nice if we could understand what's going on with plane partitions with increasing tableau in the same way. But I don't know how to do it, and I don't understand how to understand the fact that you get these multiples in any sort of way. Okay, so another thing you can do is think about other postsets. So before we were looking at A cross B cross C, A cross B looks like this. It's a rectangle. And rectangles are an example of minuscule posets, just like Al was talking about last time. Minuscule posets are nice. If things work for rectangles, they probably work for more general minuscule. More general minuscule posets. So here's the other minuscule posets, and you can ask all the same questions again. So here's a theorem that's not written up yet, but I can verify that the analog of this Cameron-Fondry-Floss theorem does hold for plane partitions over all of these bases. And the proof is bad. The proof is case by case and like partly. Case by case, and like partly computational, but it is true. So, I guess another open problem here is to give a uniform proof of this. And another open problem is, I guess, to just think about other posets. I think we don't know sort of anything of this nature for other postets. Of this nature for other post-sets, I think there's like not even very much computational data for what's going on in other cases. Okay, I still have four minutes, right? Yeah, that's right. Okay, I'm gonna try to show you a stage computation. While you're doing that, I'll ask: have you, I mean, you said not much is known for other. I mean, you said not much is known for other posts. What about doppelgangers? That's a good question. I don't know anything. It seems like Mike and Sam may know something about the trapezoid case. Okay, can you see my code now? All right, so we're going to generate a thousand Tableau whose shape is Whose shape is 8 by 4, and whose alphabet has only 12 entries. Let's make it 13 entries for fun. And so here they come. So let me show you how to read the data out of this. What? Oh, I forgot to run the thing. Sorry. You may need to adjust your print state. You may need to adjust your print statements. Dari points out that with Python 3. No, I already fixed it. I'm running the wrong code as the problem. Here, here's the thing I mean to run. So I'm going to do 8 by 4 alphabet sizes, 22. Okay, so now it's generated 50 tableau. 50 of the tableau had orbits of size exactly 1 times q. 43 of them had 1 times q. 1 of them had orbit size 4q. 5 of them had orbit sizes 3q. And 2 of them had orbit sizes of 2q. Okay, so now we've got some more things. Most of the orbits you can see are in fact size q exactly. But look at how many of them are three times q. I've got 21 that are I've got 21 that are three times q and only seven that are two times q and if we look at this I got like a lot of threes some fives some sevens uh here I got 21 times q I just noticed like how many more things are odd numbers here than even numbers okay and this is like not cherry-picked data I'm just like running some fake stuff at some like uh you know random Some like random examples. Okay, so you can't show my thank you slide anymore because I'm showing you CoCalc. But thank you. Okay, let's thank Oliver. And let's see, there were some nice questions in the chat. So Dari has a question regarding the title shift. Dari? So if you mean the title shift, So if you mean the saddle shift, I don't actually believe that the saddle shift is real motion. Can you explain the connection? Yeah, it just is real motion in type A. But how? Because the sidel shift, basically, it always makes the partition either larger, strictly, or strictly smaller in the sense of subset containment. Whereas with raw motion, somehow minimum becomes maximum, the two latest paths get intertwined in some way. Is that some kind of raw motion twisted by something like shift or something? No, no, it's just literally a raw motion on the nose. Really? Yeah. So with what bijection? Is the partition just a lattice path or? Yeah. So I mean, it may be that you're not looking at all possible lattice paths. Okay. So, Oliver, I'm going to put in the chat. Oliver, I'm going to put in the chat the reference Dari provided. Is that the correct one? Sorry, that's not very useful, actually. Well, if it has a Zenl shift, it should be the correct one. You think it's the correct one? Okay. Maybe we can move on. Dari, you had another question. I think it was regarding the order of A cross B cross three plane partitions, being that it divides A plus B plus two. Did that get answered for you? If it's it, I've forgotten it. I've forgotten it. Is that a divisor? I forgot. Oliver, can you comment? I don't understand the question. Oh, the order of romotion on an A cross B cross 3 poset dividing A plus B plus 2. Your conjecture was that it was A plus B plus 2, I think. That's right. But Dari was asking, does it divide at least? Well, some of the orbits would divide. Oh, you definitely have an orbit that is the full size. Have an orbit that is the full size. So it's still the case if you take the empty order ideal and you look at its orbit, you get the thing you expected. Cool. Anna Schilling had an interesting question that Sam Hopkins basically answered, but if you wanted to say a few words about the connection to the K-theory of the Grassmannian and the K-theoretic promotion. So, this promotion, I don't know how to really relate. The je d'état kin, so like class. So, like classically with standard tableau, you do this je can operation. You take some skew tableau and you rectify it and you look at what you get. And this is telling you the product structure in the cohomology ring of a Grass Many or something. And so when you're doing this with these increasing tableau, with this sort of more complicated Chudican operation, you're computing the structure coefficients in the k-theory ring of a Grafmanian. But I don't know how to understand promotion in terms of any kind of geometry. And I think that would be really interesting and really powerful. Okay. Any other questions? I have a quick comment. Your frame result really reminds me of the Ben Vieland gyration on ASMs, fixing the Fixing the outside. Is there some way that you can encode ASMs at a certain increasing Tableau or something? Not that I know of. Yeah, so I mean, the one possibility is somehow that's the same story as what we're doing here, but I think more likely there's just like a general reasons why you get this kind of behavior that we don't know. Behavior that we don't know. Okay, well, let's thank Oliver again. The code finished running, by the way.
