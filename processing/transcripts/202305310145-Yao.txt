Okay. So let's uh we move to our next speaker, Yao Yao from the National University of Singapore, and she's going to talk about suppression of chemotactic blow-up by active. Thank you, Marco, for the introduction. So, first, I'd like to thank the organizers for the kind I'd like to thank the organizers for the kind invitation. It's my great pleasure to participate in this workshop and come back to Granada, my favorite city in Spain. So today I'm going to talk about the joint work with Jong Tian Pu, a grad student at Duke University, and Sasha Kisilev, also at Duke. So it's going to be the Keller-Segal equation. And then we are going to add a flow to it and ask ourselves that, well, whether the flow can suppress the flow up in Keller-Siegel equation or not. Flow up in Keller-Siegel equation or not. And the flow that we're adding is the active vection, which I'm going to introduce to you what it is. So the Keller-Siegel equation models the collective motions of cells attracted by some kind of chemical substance that they emit themselves. And this is the parabolic elliptic version of the Keller-Siegel equation. Many people in this room have already made significant contributions to the study of this model. So here we Model. So here ρ is the cell density, and the first equation describes that they're doing Brownian motion, and meanwhile, they're attracted by this chemical density C, and they tend to go into the direction where C increased the height fastest. And the second equation describes that, well, so C is diffusing and produced by rho, but as the time derivative coefficient goes to zero, we arrive at this parabolic elliptic version. Okay, so it is well known. Okay, um, so it is well known that when this problem is set up in the whole plane, there is a critical mass phenomena where the mass is the integral of ρ, such that if the mass is bigger than 8 pi, all the solution with initially finite second moment blows up in finite time. If the mass is below 8 pi, then the solutions stay globally well posed and actually they dissipate according to the heat equation scaling as time goes to infinity. And at the critical mass, there is no. Critical mass, there's no blow-up, but solution may aggregate as time goes to infinity and blows up at infinite time. So if we are in a bounded domain with smooth boundary, then the usual boundary condition that people assume for the bacteria density is that they satisfy the no flux density, so that's the mass is still conserved. And then the chemical. And then the chemical is also often assumed to satisfy this zero-Neumann boundary condition. But notice that in this case, one cannot just solve this elliptic equation because the integral of rho needs to be equal to zero in order for the equation to have a solution. So the way that people modify this equation is that they either say that, well, we solve this elliptic equation with the right-hand side being rho minus the average density. The average density, so that's the right-hand side is mean zero, or one can also put the right-hand side into row and then change the left-hand side with the additional plus C term. Okay, so in either case, the critical mass now becomes 4 pi instead of 8 pi. And the way to think about it is that, so if the blow up is really close to the boundary, then it's the boundary, the curvature of the boundary. It's the boundary, the curvature of the boundary is no longer important. It's almost like a flat line. And then in this case, we could do the even extension so that even the 4π mass actually looks like an 8 pi mass when we are reflecting across that. But in either case, we see that, well, there is a critical mass such that above it, there could be a finite time blow-up. So in this talk, well, we are going to, instead of focusing on the Keller-Siegel equation itself, Focusing on the Keller-Siegel equation itself. So, many people have realized that, well, these chemotectic processes often take place in some ambient fluid. And for that reason, we are going to study this equation for rho, but with this additional advection term. And we are going to assume that this advection term, this flow u, is a divergence-free velocity field. Field. And now I'm going to review the literature in the two cases where U can be either passive, which means that it's not determined by rho, it's something that is given to you, or it can also be active, which means that the velocity u could be generated by the density rho. Okay, so in both of these cases, I will review what is known about whether adding a flow can suppress blow-up. So let's first consider the passive advection case. The passive advection case where U is a given divergence-free vector field. And I'm also going to put a coefficient A here just to emphasize that, well, we can tune this parameter, this amplitude, to make it weaker or stronger. And the results are as follows. So, given any initial condition, no matter how concentrated it is, it's known that. It's known that there exists a certain flow that can blow up, that can prevent the blow up as long as their amplitude is large enough. Okay, so notice that here, the order is usually that, well, you first give me an initial data, and then I tell you how big the amplitude needs to be. So what kind of flow can do that job? Kisinwev and Chu shows that if the flow have certain mixing property, which means that, well, given Which means that, well, given any initial, given any density, so it you does a really good job of spreading things around, or they are diffusion enhancing, which means that they do a really good job of increasing the H1 norm of the solution, and therefore it is helping the diffusion term to smooth it out. Then, for these kinds of flow, they say that you give me any initial data, I can choose a large enough. I can choose a large enough amplitude such that no blow-up will happen. Okay. And Bedrosi and Hu, in a series of work, they studied the monotone shear flow, where the flow looks like this. And then they show that, well, for such kind of flow, as long as it is sufficiently strong, it can also prevent blow-up in 2D calorse. Okay, so the reason for this is. So, the reason for this is intuitively what the shear flow does is that because of the velocity goes this way, so if it is only a vection without the other diffusion or the aggregation term, then for any density, if we abvect it by a really strong U, it's going to, the shear is going to make it wrap around. So, they're working with a periodic domain, by the way. And then, after you wrap it around, in turn, After you wrap it around, in terms of the distribution, it almost looked like a one-dimensional function, right? Originally, we were in 2D, but this one almost looked like a 1D function. It has very little change in horizontal direction. And then we know that 1D Keller-Sego doesn't blow up, right? So that's why they show that such kind of sufficiently strong monotone shear flow prevents blow-up in 2D. But in 3D, when you are doing this shear flow, you can be made very Can you be made very close to a 2D function, but 2D calorsego can still blow up? So they show that in 3D, there actually is this critical mass that as if they're in 2D. So both of these results are in the spirit of you first give me an initial data and then there are sufficiently large amplitudes that stops the blow-up. However, if the process is done the other way around, let's say you first give me a flow that is fixed. Give me a flow that is fixed, then it is known that any passive, any given flow will not change the critical mass. So Winkler shows that for any given flow, so and for any mass that is slightly bigger than the critical mass, you can always choose the initial data to be with this mass and sufficiently concentrated such that it still leads to a blowout. That it still leads to a blow-up in finite time. Okay, so it means any passive flow does not change the critical mass. And meanwhile, so I think physically it makes more sense to consider the flows that are not a given background flow, but it's actually something that is generated by the density themselves. So, in the past decades, there has been a growing interest in coupling the chemotaxis. In coupling the chemotaxis equation with these fluid flows that are actually generated by themselves. And the coupling is usually done by the gravity force. So I think up to now, this started in these works in 2010. And up to today, I believe there are more than 200 or 300 people already on these topics. So I am not able to review all of them, but let me point out that. But let me point out that all these global existence results are usually can be grouped to two kinds. So one is the chemotexis coupled with fluids where the chemical, where it's actually the oxygen, it's consumed by the bacteria instead of generated by them. Okay, so that makes a system slightly So that makes the system slightly nicer in the sense that the chemical density itself can blow up because it's only consumed, not generated. So one only needs to worry about the gradient. And then the other class is, well, you cover, you couple the Kaler Siegel with the fluid equations. Okay. And to the best of our knowledge, among all these global existence results, they either work with small data or Data or they work in the situation so there are some other mechanism that is still stopping the blow-off. So, for example, one can either add nonlinear diffusion or one can add an additional reaction term suppressing the density to blow-off, or one can add some in the drift term, one can do some flux limitation. Okay, so in other words, so to the best of our knowledge, all these Of our knowledge, all these global existence results would still hold if we are so removing the flow, setting it equal to zero. Okay, so in other words, these are so it's the global existence is not really contributed by the presence of flow. So, in our joint work with Jong Tian and Sasha, we want to look at a relative To look at a relatively simple model coupling the Keller-Sego equation with the fluid flow and here the flow obeys Tharsis law, which I'm going to explain to you. Okay, so first of all, for the density equation, there is nothing too special. So it's still the usual Caler-Siegel equation. And then because we are going to work with a bounded domain, so we consider this domain. We consider this domain that has an upper and lower boundary, and it is periodic in the horizontal direction. Okay, and because of the presence of the boundary, so for the chemical density when solving the elliptic equation, so this is the inverse Laplacian with the Neumann zero-Neumann boundary condition. Again, also we need to subtract this average density easy. This average density so that we can invert the Laplacian. So, this equation is pretty much the regular parabolic, just the normal parabolic elliptic Heller Segal, except that we are also adding this advection term. Okay, so now what is the rule for this advection? Well, so this equation is the Darcy's law. It says that the velocity u is directly proportional. Is directly proportional to the force. So notice that there is this difference between Darcy's law with the Newton's second law, which leads to the Navier-Stokes equation. So Darcy's law says that your mu is equal to proportional to the force, which is given by, so the force has one term that is the gravity, where G is the gravitational constant. Is the gravitational constant, and the heavier it is, so the heavier the dense gravitational force it is, and E2 is this vertical direction. And if we change this u into the material derivative of u, which is ut equal plus u dot red u, then it becomes the next equation. Okay, so throughout our work, we are going to work with Our work, we are going to work with the Garcia's law because it's easier. It has this quasi-static structure that every time you give me a row, I can tell you what is you at that moment, right? It has no memory. It makes our life easier. And one comment that I would like to make is that if you find this pressure term P annoying and you want to get rid of it, there is a way to do so. And by the way, so this is called the Darcy's Law for Incompressible Force Media via gravity. Media via gravity. It is incompressible in the sense that P is implicitly determined by the constraint that the divergence of U has to be equal to zero. Okay, so there is a way that you can easily write down U explicitly in terms of rho. So the way to do it is that, well, because U is a flow that lives in this domain with U dot N equal to With u dot n equal to zero, then mu can be written as the grad curve of a string function psi, where grad curve is the gradient rotated by 90 degree. And then if we apply the grad curve to this equation, the grad perk will be nicely canceling with the gradient of p so that we arrive at an elliptic equation that the plus of the string function is equal. Of the string function is equal to negative g partial x1 of rho, and that gives that u can be explicitly written as the red work of psi, which can be solved like this. So here d means that when solving this elliptic problem, it's the zero Dirichlet. So such u can be explicitly solved. And in fact, if we take such u. In fact, if we take such U and couple it with the transport equation, then this equation is called the incompressible force media equation. It's studied by Cordoba, Ganceto, and Arive. They obtained the local well-posedness and blow-up criteria. However, for this equation, whether smooth initial data can lead to a finite time blow-up is still an open question. Okay, so now you may wonder that, well, now when we are coupling this with the Keller-Siegel together. With this, with the Keller-Siegel together, whether this equation is locally well-posed. It turns out the local well-posedness is not an issue if we are working on nice enough, let's say, smooth initial data. And a pretty standard argument allows us to obtain that so the solution stays smooth for a short time, and as long as rows stay bounded, so the smooth. Bounded so the smooth solution can be continued. Okay, and actually, a closer look will tell us that as long as the L2 norm of the rho does not blow up, so as long as this Keller-Siegel term does not drive the blow-up in the L2 norm, then the smooth solution can be further continued in time. Okay, so all we need to ask ourselves is that, well, does the L2 norm blow up in finite time? Oh, and by the way, so here's the picture that intuitively tells you how these row look like. These rows you look like. So, if you have a density where the darker color means the heavier density, then the gravity itself just wants to drag this down, this part down, right? However, the whole flow cannot stay strictly down because that will violate the divergence-free structure. So, what it ended up doing is that this right-hand side velocity. This right-hand side velocity field vector field is projected to the divergence-free vector fields in the closest L2 norm sets. And so that's the actual vector field looks like something like this. The heavier part is still sort of going down, but the whole flow creates this kind of role because it has to be divergence-free. And then it tends to make the solution more stratified in the sense that the heavier one tends to go to the bottom, the lighter one. One tends to go to the bottom, the lighter one tends to go up. Okay, so heuristically, because the heavier one should go down, the lighter one should go up, then if this is really true, if it tends to make the solution horizontally stratified, then maybe we can use the same idea that, well, because the 1D Keller sigma doesn't blow up, maybe if G doesn't is sufficiently large, it could prevent blow up. Okay, so that was the kind of results that we hoped. That was the kind of results that we hoped to show when we started this project. However, halfway during our project, we realized that we can actually do something better. So, this is our main result in this theorem, in the paper. So, surprisingly, it turns out for any gravity coefficient g, blow-up is prevented. Okay, so apparently g has to be non-zero because when g is equal to zero, there is no u anymore, right? There is no U anymore, right? You are having exactly the Keller-Segal equation, which we know that there will be a blow-up if your mass exceeds the critical mass, right? But our result says that: well, as long as you add a teeny tiny bit of gravity coefficient, then you can give me as big initial data as you want, as concentrated as you want. And in fact, we can show that the solution is globally intact. Okay, so the main idea of the proof is. Of the proof is that now I'm going to sketch it to you in the next few slides. I'm going to introduce two main characters in the proof. One is our old friend, this L2 norm. We're going to track the evolution of it. And the other one is a new friend that is the potential energy. So given that the density is driven down by gravity, it makes sense to consider its evolution. Evolution, right? And then you will see that somehow, when we are tracking the evolution of two of them together, some magic happens. Namely, the main thing that we are going to prove is that towards a contradiction, assume somehow the L2 norm blows up, then we show that the gravitational, the potential energy needs to be driven down to minus infinity. Okay, and what's wrong with it? Well, but if you look at the different. Well, but if you look at the definition of this potential energy and the definition of our domain, so rho is always something that is a non-negative density, and our domain x2 is bounded, right? Well, we set the lower border to be zero, it doesn't really matter, but in any case, our E is a non-negative quantity for all time, right? So, if it somehow is driven to minus infinity, it means that something is wrong, right? So, this assumption that there is a finite time blow-up cannot be true because there is this. Cannot be true because there is this. Um, well, I'm quoting this famous novel by Milan Condera, The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Um, so here it's like, well, there's no blow-off because if there is, there will be an unbearable heaviness of being, right? Um, so yeah, that is like the overall main strategy. And now let me uh introduce to you these two characters. Okay, so F1 is that, well, the character L2 norm, our old friend, enters the stage and Stage. And well, this part, there is nothing new. Everyone who has read about the Keller-Siegel energy estimate should be familiar with this. So if we just do the most naive energy estimate for how does the L2 norm grow, then there is this term that is contributed by the diffusion. And then there is an integral of rho to the power three term that is contributed by the aggregation. So if we do Aggregation. So, if we do the holder's inequality on that part, because we want to try to write down everything in terms of the L2 norm, right? And then we do the holder's inequality and also the Gaguelado-Nureberg. So at the end, if we want to write down this bad term in terms of the L2 norm, the power would be four. Okay, so that is a very standard computation. And then there's also this harmless constant term, which we up here. And what it means is that, well, if we look at the square of the L2 norm, the square of the L2 norm. So because it satisfies this simple ODE y prime less than or equal to y squared, then we know that, well, if this L2 norm squared wants to double at this level 2 to the power n, it will take at least 2 to the minus n time. Well, it's a simple observation, but it's going to be useful later. And another thing that I'm going to do is that Another thing that I'm going to do is that I'm going to decompose my density at each moment into a horizontally stratified part and the orthogonal part. So rho, which is the function of x1, x2, and actually I'm going to omit the t-dependence, is rho bar plus rho t dependent. So rho bar is going to be the horizontal average, which means that I grab my rho here. I grab my row here, I do the integral in x1, and then I take the average over the length of this interval. So the rho bar is going to be a level set looks like this. It's a horizontally stratified function, and then rho tilde will automatically have horizontal average zero. So in other words, these two parts will be orthogonal. And if you prefer to look in the Fourier side, as we are Side, as we are expanding it in these Fourier modes K1 and K2, the information of rho star is stored in these modes on the vertical line, and the information of rho tilde is everywhere else. So that is, we break them into two parts. And after we break them apart, we want to identify that, well, out of these two things, if there is a blow-up, who is the culprit? Right? So one can do the So, one can do the Galdealdo-Nirenberg inequalities to get that. Well, so for these two H1 norm, if we are doing it for rho bar, this nice horizontal stratified thing, then this can be bounded below by the L2 norm to the power 6, which is good enough to beat this power 4 in the batch term, right? And but for rho tilde, we get exactly this critical power, right? That is exactly what makes the two. That is exactly what makes the 2D Keller Seagull to be critical. So it means that this robot guy is really innocent, right? It's not going to drive the blow-up. So if there is a hypothetical blow-up, the culprit has to be driven by rho tilde. And therefore, we can just erase this rho bar from the energy estimate, right? At the expense of, well, it will at most contribute a constant on the right-hand side. Okay, so everything here is standard, nothing. Everything here is standard, nothing is new. And now I'm going to introduce to you the new character that is the potential energy. Okay, and by the way, the potential energy is not our invention. So it's well known that it can be some quantity that makes sense to track in the setting for, for example, in the incompressible force media equation. Okay, so now we want to know that, well, given the potential energy defined like this. Potential energy defined like this, as we are taking its time derivative, what does it look like? Right? Well, because rho has basically three effects in its time evolution. There is advection, there's diffusion, there's aggregation. Naturally, we will see all these three effects appear in the time derivative of the potential energy, right? So, I am highlighting this term that is caused by the abaction. And by the way, this is. And by the way, this is a very quick computation. So if we only have a vection, then the derivative of the potential energy would be rho times the horizontal velocity. And the horizontal velocity from this explicit relation between u and rho, we have u2 is partial one of minus 1 plus. Of minus Laplacian partial one of L. Okay, so then one can do integration by parts to move one of the partial derivative here, and one can also distribute half of the inverse Laplacian layer. So that is why for the advection term, it's easy to see that it gives a negative contribution to the potential energy, well, which makes sense because the whole advection is driven by the gravity. It should go down, right? And then there's this contribution. And then there's this contribution that is the H minus one norm of the horizontal derivative of rho. Okay, and then there are the other two contributions from diffusion and Keller-Siegel nonlinearity, which I don't want you to look at yet, but it turns out they are lower order term compared to this. Okay, and if we just focus on the abaction term and ask ourselves, well, what is this? Then expanding row into these Expanding row into these Fourier series, we have that this main term that is contributed by the eviction in terms of the Fourier symbol, it is k1 over the modulus of k. So this is of power zero, right? Which means that it's like the L2 norm, but not quite the same because the wave is, it depends on the angle of this K1, K2 mode, right? So if the angle is almost horizontal, If the angle is almost horizontal, then the weight would be one. If the angle is almost vertical, then the weight will be 10. Right? So we know that this term is clearly bounded by the L2 norm squared, but it could be either comparable or it could be much smaller, depending on what row looks like. Okay, so so far, this is just the introduction of the two main characters, and now it's the time to let them meet. The time to let them meet. So the two main characters, this L2 norm squared and also this H minus one norm of the partial X1, so the two of them are linked together by the following lemma, which is sort of like a Gagliado-Nuremberg inequality. Okay, so we have already seen the importance of the Gagliado-Nuremberg inequality in many talks in this workshop, including Jean's talk, Nikita's talk, and also Jose's talk for today. Nikita's talk and also Jose's talk for today. And in our talk, so we in our work, so what plays a key role is the sort of unisentropic version of the Nash inequality. Okay, so if we look at this conclusion right here, then it looks like the Nash inequality, if we ignore this epsilon to something, right? So then we know that, well, this is the right power. Well, this is the right power of it, and then the coefficient in front of the Nash inequality usually is given by the domain, right? Once there is the fixed domain, there is this optimal constant, which is of order one, and that constant cannot be made smaller than that, because otherwise there will be counterexamples, right? And then we want to ask ourselves the question that, well, but if we want to make this constant really tiny, is there a way to do it? Right? So it turns out. Right, so it turns out this constant in front of the Nash inequality can be made to be arbitrarily small if, well, we are comparing this H minus one norm in a previous slide. So if this guy, so we already know that, well, this is either comparable to the L2 norm or less than, right? So if this one is much less than the L2 norm, then it turns out we are able. Then it turns out we are able to say that, well, given this assumption, we are able to improve this constant in front of this right-hand side to be something that is also arbitrarily small. So these two things are linked together. Okay, so we are unable to directly find such a reference in the literature. And by the way, if you happen to know something like this is already known, we would appreciate it. Please let me know. Appreciate it, please let me know. So, we worked it out by hand. And some complexity is also created by the fact that, so when we are taking this inversal fashion in the H minus one norm, this one is taken in the with directially zero boundary, so because we have a boundary. If we are in the torus case, then we can actually achieve the power, the sharp power one-half, but we are in the boundary. But we are in the boundary, so maybe some non-shock power could be resulting from that. Because we have to, when evaluating the H minus one norm here, it's more natural to expand in Dirichulai eigenfunctions. But however, rho itself does not satisfy Dirichlet boundary condition. Actually, we don't need to satisfy any boundary condition here. So it's something that is independent of the Kaler-Sigo equation. So we have to also translate these Dirichlet eigenfunctions to Dirichlet eigenfunctions to Neumann eigenfunctions. Okay, but roughly the idea for this lemma is that, well, if this H minus one norm is much less than the L2 norm, it means that, so because the weight in this H1 norm is only tiny when you are close to this hard, this vertical axis, right? So it means that if you draw this tiny cone with slope one over square root of epsilon, One over square root of epsilon, then at least a half of the L2 norm is contributed by modes that are living in this cone. Okay, but this is the very thin cone, so that allows us to get a better constant in this mesh inequality. Okay, and then so that is the lemma linking the two together. And now, finally, how does the proof work? Well, so let's say that suppose our L2 normal. Say that suppose our L2 norm is monotone increasing to infinity, okay? Which, of course, it sounds fishy, right? Why do you know it's monotone increases? But let's say, suppose this is the case, because in this case, the proof will be really short. So, if the L2 norm somehow monotone increases to infinity, on the one hand, we know from this naive energy estimate that in order for the L2 norm to increase. For the L2 norm to increase. So we need this bad guy to beat the good guy, right? So it means that the reverse direction of this national inequality needs to always hold with some universal constant right here. And then it means that, well, if this coefficient is not small, then applying this lemma, it means that this H minus one norm This H minus one norm can't be much smaller than L2 norm, right? So the two of them have to be stay comparable to all time. And then what's wrong with it? Well, remember, it is the unbearable heaviness of life. So now it's the time that's the potential energy takes place. So as we, the L2 norm, if it wants to blow up, it needs to increase to infinity. So as it increases from 2 to the power n to 2 to the power n plus 1, on the one hand, we know that On the one hand, we know that it can happen instantaneously, right? It takes at least a certain amount of time for it to happen. And also, during this time interval, we know that, because the previous line already give us that the H minus one norm of this quantity and the L2 norm, they need to be comparable. So if the L2 norm are comparable to 2 to the power n, the H minus 1 norm are also comparable to that. And therefore, if we, and remember, this is like how much the potential. Remember, this is like how much the potential energy is decreasing, right? This is a time derivative. So multiplying 2 to the n with 2 to the minus n give us that the potential energy needs to drop by order one in this time interval. Okay, so what's wrong with it? Well, every time when your L2 norm squared wants to double, you need to pay the expense of lowering your potential energy by a constant of order one, right? So if the L2 norm manages. So, if the L2 norm manages to double and double and double all the way double to infinity, then your potential energy needs to decrease by one and one and one in all this process. So, the potential energy needs to drop to minus infinity, and that is a contradiction, right? So, that is the very rough sketch, and you probably already figured out that some part of it are sketchy. So, namely, there are mainly two things. One is that, well, in the previous hand-waving argument. The previous hand-waving argument, I am assuming that the L2 norm is just a monotone increase to infinity. And you may ask that, well, but this doesn't have to be the case, right? All we know is that it goes to infinity at some time, but it could be going, let's say, it could be doubling for time two and then lowering down and then doubling again. It could be going like a roller coaster up and down way to infinity, right? So, what if this is the case? If this is the case, and the other thing that is species is that so far I am only talking about well, as if the time derivative of the potential energy is only given by this negative term, right? But there are the other two terms that are also here. One is contributed by diffusion, the other one is contributed by Keller-Siegel nonlinearity. And these two terms can actually drive up the potential energy, right? So we need to take care of both of these. To take care of both of these two things. And in order to fix them, the first thing that we do is that we introduce a good and bad time interval. So the good and bad are in the sense that whether they contribute to a blow up or whether they are preventing a blow. So good means it's towards the blow up and bad means driving away from blow up. Okay, and so we introduce this sort of like a stopping time thing. Stopping time thing that we mark. So, for this sequence, 2 to the power n, we mark these times where whenever your solution is hitting this time while so not hitting this again until you, so it's, so how should I say it? It's like every time, so once you are at 2 to the power n, you only record the next time. only record the next time if you are going uh if you are hitting to the power to the power n plus one or two to the power uh n minus one again okay so that we are having this sequence of time and then in between each sequence uh we know that your solution is comparable to this value here and then it either goes down by two by half or it goes up by two okay so then we call these intervals to be a level n time interval To be a level n time interval. And we call it either a good interval if the two endpoints, so if your potential energy doubles within this time interval, or a bad time interval if your potential energy gets a half in this time interval. Okay, so one thing that one can quickly check is that in this definition, at every level n, because the so the good and bad interval have to interlace. So if we're only counting the things happening at level n, not at the other level. Things happening at level n, not at the other level, then, like, here they're interlacing, and even if there are something else at level n in the future, they would be still interlacing. And because the solution eventually blows up, the number of good intervals needs to exceed the bad one by one. Okay, so that is the simple observation from the definition. And then we need to do a more careful estimate on both the good interval and the bad interval. And this time we cannot just ignore them. Time, we cannot just ignore them. We need to take them in. Okay, so this is the technical part. And I think, given the time constraint, maybe it's a good idea that I hide it from you. But please trust me that at the end of the day, the estimates that we get is that on the good interval of level N, the potential energy, well, now we are no longer decreasing by one because of these additional terms, but they are still decreasing at least to the power and to the minus. To the power n to the minus one. Okay, we don't know whether this is the optimal power, but it serves our purpose. And on a bad interval, it's like something much smaller: two to the minus n over three. So now if we are summing up all these good and time, bad time intervals at all the level, then because the harmonic series is exactly going to diverge, right, it means that for any gravitational constant, the Gravitational constant, the potential energy will still become minus infinity, which gives us a contradiction. Okay, so that is how the whole proof works. And this leaves some open questions that actually many open questions, because we think that, well, this is like a good, it's a good starting point where many of, so it's the first time. So, it's the first time that it is really this active advection that is stopping the blow-up. So, we did not try to do it in the full generality. Okay, so one could ask, well, what about the full domain case? In this case, the same arguments that we use can show that it's impossible to blow up if you are having a finite potential energy at that moment. But we are wondering, well, whether it is possible that so. Is possible that so you are forming a delta function, and meanwhile, at the time that you blow up, actually, you also go down to minus infinity. In this case, there is no contradiction. We think it's unlikely, though. And also, the other directions are, well, we worked with the parabolic elliptic Keller-Siegel. So, what about the parabolic-parabolic case? And also, what if we change the Starz's law to either Stokes' equation or the Nabier-Stokes equation? And finally, so. And finally, so it's also intriguing that well, now there is global well-posedness. What can we say about the long-time behavior? So, we are not able to find any gradient flow structure. Actually, we are not even able to find some Lyopno functional that is monotone decreasing. We tried to do the most natural thing to add this free energy functional for Calar Sego with the potential energy together, but the sum doesn't look like it's decreasing, so we don't know what else. Look like it's decreasing, so we don't know what else to try, but we are not able to find something that is momentarily. Okay, um, so with that, I would like to conclude my talk. And so, maybe, well, I'm showing this the otters in Singapore picture, and maybe they are forming a finite time blow-up only in the land because we proved that, well, it's impossible to do it in the water. Thank you for your attention. Thanks, Yal, for the very nice talk. Any questions? Yeah, can you sort of describe the fact of the obscure from a physical point of view? Sure. So from a physical point of view, this part is the gravity force. Is the gravity force, right? So, this is the part that the full body is actually experiencing. However, so the Thursday law says that the velocity is proportional to the total force. And this term, negative grid, so this pressure term is also there because we have another constraint that the flow needs to be divergence-free, right? Like in the water. Like in the water. So it means that the actual velocity field is this equation combined with the divergence-free condition. And also on the boundary, you cannot penetrate the boundaries. Also, with this boundary condition, that's 2.n equal to 0. Sorry, just a quick signal. I noticed that you mentioned that you want to couple colours to equal with stokes or netiostokes, for instance. Do you think that maybe it would be? Do you think that maybe it would be reasonable to instead of having say something like this, if you also be noise, for instance? Like a random effect. Because in full dynamics, this is quite natural. To prevent worldly adding noise. Red, right. Would that be a natural question? Yeah, I think it's also a natural question. So, in this case, I think it depends on whether your noise is Your noise is just driven by some random effect or random source term, or whether your force is actually driven by the density itself. So if the velocity, if the force is just driven by random force, then there is this work by Bajerosian, Blumento, and Pong Chan-Smith. They show that the solution to Navier-Stokes equation with this. Solution to Nader-Stokes equation with this random forcing is mixing in some sense, right? So, my guess is that once it is mixing, maybe the previous, so because in this case, it's still a passive flow, right? So, maybe the previous theories of mixing passive flow can still apply. But if it is driven by the, if it is connected to the density itself, then I think it's more complicated. Yeah, you said that you don't know what happens. Yeah, you said that you don't know what happens with all the flow asymptotically, but do you know the steady state signal? Do you know if anyone's linearized? Steady states. So first of all, all the horizontally stratified states are steady because in this case, the flow U is equal to zero, the Calar Sigo is also. Oh no, not all the, sorry, I correct myself. Not all the horse, but so among the horizontally. So, among the horizontally stratified states, I think one can plug it into the Kersego and figure out the steady states. However, I think there should be, if the gravitational constant is tiny, then I think there should be also non-stratified steady states because they still try to clump up together, right, as much as possible. No, we haven't looked at the steady states equation yet. And so, maybe a second question, in the beginning, in the spirit of what you Compression in the spirit of what Jean and Gita are doing, this diagonally quoted that you were showing. Is it really possible to put instead of a condition, first line as a condition, to put it as an error term in your gun, to get one closed equation with maybe the first line appearing as an error term and the one where absolute time, for example? Yeah, that is a good point. So let's see. In this way, I think if you really want to combine them into I think if you really want to combine them into one equation, this is doable, right? Because you solve for epsilon in terms of the ratio, and that ratio would also appear here, right? But that would be an inequality that involves both the L2, L1, H1, and this H minus 1. So I think we can write it into one single inequality if we want. So where does this proof fail in the long time delay? Fail in the long time limit because it looks like if it's monotone increasing, I didn't see where it changed with finite time. Yeah, that is a great point. So it is because if the when I say that E is monotone decreasing, I am lying to you in the sense that it would be monotone decreasing if we only have a vection, right? But in the reality, there is also the other two terms whose sign could be positive. So it's So it's only monotone decreasing if we are on, if the if the solution tries to blow up, right? So this is really a proof by contradiction argument. It's like if the density tries to get very high, then in the interval where it's the L2 norm increases, we can show E decreases. But on the band interval, actually, the potential energy could increase a little bit. Okay, I also have a quick question. You mentioned at the beginning about the last. Uh, you mentioned at the beginning about the lack of the uh structure or the other functional etc. Uh, could it be that this is due to the fact that your fluid coupling is sort of quite static and uh you don't have also a fluid component for the uh nutrients slash oxygen, whatever. Like, have you tried, for example, to consider models where you have time derivatives in the uh nutrient equation and the full coupling in the nutrient equation as well? Oh, I see. Uh, so yeah, we've tried. I see. So, yeah, we try to add a time derivative to it. And then, in that case, actually, we are not even able to show the absence of blow-up yet. So, we did not look at like, yeah, without knowing whether it blows up or not, we did not look at the loss of the C a push or the U equals even oh, let's see. Uh actually if we add time derivative to either C or U, then I think there are some difficulties which we don't know whether they're technical or fundamental. Whether they are technical or fundamental. And the fluid company, the C equation, that's also an interesting thing, right? Because right now you are only so your fluid is only affecting the movement of the cell densities to the cells, but not somehow of the nutrient cells. Right, right. Yeah, I agree. So far, we are taking C just be this inverse applaution, right? But one could also ask that, what if C is also affected by you? We try to add that term. That also creates some technical. So it seems like this. Create some technical. So it seems like this argument works magically. We don't know to what extent it can be tweaked yet, because this argument was only, this paper was only done by three weeks ago. It's like a first step. I think there are many open things that are left. Okay, so let's just call all other questions that we've got three. So let's take the answer. And we really have ten passengers. I wanted to show you a good presentation on the other side.
