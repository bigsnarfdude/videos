Towards tempered anathelium recovery of lengths in market geometry. Thank you very much. Thank you to the organizers for this nice conference and in this very beautiful center. So my talk of today enters in the realm of Habelian geometry. So I will not speak about any derived category or anything like this. In the title, Yeah, in in in in the title and and and the abstract I advertise about uh r some anabelian result about the length of uh anabe. So I changed a bit. I mean I will still speak about this but I want also to introduce maybe more the more basic notions of tempered group and of generally a little survey about Nabelian geometry in Berkovich spaces. So, yes, what we saw is the talk of Eukopsticks, for instance, was Sticks for instance was an an abelian geometry in its uh classical framework of uh algebraic geometry. And but there are some other uh geometries where an abelian questions uh make sense. So I work with a field uh algebraic closed field, complete monarch mutiny field. And also I take mixed characteristics. So characteristic characteristic zero and the residue field has finite characteristic. For instance, you can take a CP okay, so Okay, so QP, the algebraic closure, and you complete. So and also I take X, that is a curve, so analytic, K analytic curve in the back of each setting. In the leverage setting. So here it's in all my thoughts, it's not necessary. I will try not to enter the technical details. So what I want to convey is just the ideas that there are some adabelian phenomenons. It's okay if you don't know precisely what means back of geometry and what exactly are the points. The question of an abelian geometry. The question of analyzing geometry, the same vague question. It's what information? Let's say geometric information that the fundamental group theory. But here in this question, But here i in this question uh I need to precise, of course. Uh for instance I need to precise what means fundamental group? Is it something like a disk or a curve? Sorry? No, like a curve just dimension one, it's a curve I mean it's an analytic space in the sense of Berkovich that has pure dimension one. So disks. Mentioned one. So discs are curves. You can take annually. There is the analytic line, projective line. And somehow, yes, it's very important to understand disks and NLV because there is what we call skeleton and symptomically related to this. So there will be three parts. In the first part, I I will speak about the fundamental group. Fundamental group. It will be the temporal group. Then in the second part, I will just speak about the results the the answers that are known of the of these questions. And in the third part, I will speak about the lengths. I will speak about the length of anule. So it's also of an abling nature. I mean, the question. You will see that the result is just a partial result. So less satisfactory than the result I will present here. But I want to present this because I think the proof is interesting. So let me begin begin to explaining what is a tempered group. So first, so I have my curve you can connect it so that things work well. So the actual geometry has very good uh topology. Okay, so very nice. Very nice topology. So X is a locally compact, locally alcohol is connected, locally contractible. So it's possible to define topological covering and all the theory of universal topological coverings. So there is a very nice topology. So the theory of uh topological coverings. Political coverings political coverings. So this theory works very well. So it gives rise to the topological fundamental group of X. But when I think about an abelian questions, this group is not satisfactory because it's too little. It's too little problem. Too little. So why is it too little? I can give an example. So we know from the talk of Jacob that the first example that we would like to be an abelian is hyperbolic curves. So we can look at the topological group of a Of the projective line. I mean, I take the identification of the projective line minus three points, 01 infinity. But this, it's the trivial group. It's a topologically simply connected. But we would like this to be to be an abelian. So somehow To be an abelian. So somehow this ruby is not enough. Then X is not only a topological space, it's also, I mean, it has also a structure, algebraic structure. So it's possible to speak about finite coverings. Uh so there is a magnificent. So there is a good theory of inetical coverings. There is a gal Galo Galois category. So there is uh it's exactly like in algebraic geometry. This gives rise to the group. So here I just write algebraic because there will be some et al group but uh not finite et al. It's close. It classifies finite etal coverings. It's a profinite group. It's exactly like in classical algebraic geometry. And even if you have that if you take this group, if you take the identification If you take the identification, so yeah, maybe I should not use X. Let's say the identification of algebraic curve. So the identification is a perfect curve, so we can pick this, and it's exactly the usual meaning usually it's called etal, but yeah, the the usual group. Um but this one is it's also not not satisfactory because uh not satisfactory because uh um it doesn't carry so much so many information uh in character heuristic zero when the field is algebraically closed. For algebraic curves, it depends on the genus and on the number of cusps. So I still need something else. But then there is a notion of etalical rings defined by De Lung. And uh it means that so this is uh is entire if locally on the base X if it is a disjoint union of finite etal coverings. Of finite data et al. So then the the category of etal coveries, uh so you say it's not a gala theory in in the usual sense, but it's a Theory in the usual sense, but it's what is called a tame infinite Gaula theory, a category. It's not finite just because here the union can be infinite, so the fibers can be infinite. But still, as it's a nice category, then there is a group that classifies this category of methetal coverings. It's just not a profile group, but it's so it gives it gives rise to this to a group that is called a data. So a group that is called uh one that I I write like this, theta. So it's not profinite and it actually it's very big. But the problem is that it is too big. So here I will not tell you exactly in which sense, just that De Jung studies this group and there are some lots of questions that can be super big. So problem. Still be yes, exactly. Yeah, please. For example, the P1 is not simply connected at all. It's not simply connected. Because there are some things you can consider if you want the term of It is CP and it is very big and and uh there are some questions that are in the form SLN of QP. It's what the youngest shows, so it's very big and uh yeah. So it's too big to do something to be able to do something interesting. This definition of et al. would open immersion be et al or? No, I Colour? No okay. Uh yeah, I I want to uh to be also uh I mean if it's colouring it should be uh subjective but the branch is subjective. So I mean it's it's a tablet, it's not recovering. I mean it's it's a tab, it's not a covering. So so then the the good candidate is is uh what's called the ten part covering. So what the temporal covering um I I define it. It's a it is ethyl covering. It is some ethyl covering. Some etal covering that becomes topological after a finite etal base change becoming topological after finite data states change so in other words It means that if you have x, y, and it's a eta if it if it uh fits a diagram of this kind so if it is a quotient of a topology topological covering of a finite atol finite finite bulk. It's bulk covering. Okay. So this is the notion of tempered covering. So it means that etal covering is tempered. Somehow the degree of this finite etal covering that enters into the definition is bounded such that it fits this diagram. So there is a So there is a yeah maybe so there it there is also this so this category is also a new I mean a tame infinite category. So it gives rise to the group which is called the tampered group of X that classifies the tempered coverings. It's a pro-discrete group Pro-discrete. And why is it pro-discrete? It's because, so when you consider the classical algebraic group, it's pro-finite because it's the limit of the just of finite etal coverings, of the group, finite groups of finite etal coverings. And here you take exactly this the same finite etal coverings, but you don't you take the Galois group of the topologic universal topological coverings of these finite etal coverings. Coverings of these finite detail coverings. So that's why it's not pro-finite anymore, but it is pro-discrete. Yes, so this theory of temperature covalent encapsulates both the topological phenomena and finite et al. So finite et al. So for this it's included in temples. Tempered that is itself included into petal coverings. Okay? But it's not a. So I will give some example. So because of this because of this, there is a morphism, natural morphism from a tambourine group. To the topological group. Okay? And this is subjective. So is subjective. So first point. Second point. Because any finite covering is tempered, there is a natural morphism from the fi I mean the algebraic group. I mean, an algebraic group to the sampled group, and it has that image. And I can even say that it is okay, this notion of template, it works in any dimension. But this one, it's also injected in dimension one. So in particular, the algebraic group, so the finite group, is the profinite completion of the tempered group. And here you can think about what happens in complex geometry. In complex geometries, you have this when this is replaced by the topological group. So, maybe I can give some examples. Yeah, also from this, from the fact that, sorry, here, I confused the stampered here. Because the first point means that temperature somehow is big enough, and here it's small enough. But from the second point, From the second point, you have that example that there is no temper the coverings of the affine or protective line, simply connected and temper the meaning. When I say projective or a fine line, I mean the an identification because it should live in it should be a project space. So you distributed all so a fine line. So any here you can consider, so there is some non-trivial SR coverings. So for example, the logarithm from the From the unit disk, open unit disk to the affine line. It is etal, but it's but it's not temple because of because of this. Okay, so So some other examples, I can yes, if you have, for instance, five one time of the identification of the multiplicative group. The mutative group. Here it is the same as the finite etal group. Topologically, it's interconnected. And then something interesting is if you take E from elliptic curve, the template group somehow sees the bad or good reduction. So if If E has good reduction the temple group of the identification is a that hat times the hat the hat and and and the if bad re if bad reduction It is Z times Z hat. And this Z comes from the fact that the stable reduction is a motor picture to a circle and it's a topological covering of the wall. Okay, so now I define the temple group. I'm going to speak about an abelian results. But first I should define the skeleton of a curve. So I mean so what is what is the cover? Can you write it down? I mean if it has bad reduction and you have this infinite is it any specification? Yeah, the the identification is a it's like a a disk like this, you know, with plenty of identifications. Uh and then um so this comes from the topological coverings of the natural topological coverings of this curve. But I will explain uh after all. I will explain after also some more deep presence why it's relative to the reduction. So I define the skeleton of X, the set of points that don't belong to any open disk, so that X doesn't belong to any open disk. Open this. So, this is a skeleton of fix. And this is a finite, another locally finite graph. It contains the boundary. I mean, I will not say everything. But I know what is important is that there exists a deformation retraction R from S. From X to the skeleton, then it is even topologically proper. So this is, yes, so somehow X and the skeleton have the same chromatopy type. And if, imagine if X is a breaker, maybe I will say Y, just not to confuse. If Y Algebraic curve. Maybe I will write here. So you can consider the stable model, stable model of oil. Then from the stable model, you can consider the special fiber, the special fiber the special fiber, the special of the stable model. And then from this uh special fiber, it considers what is called the dual graph. So the vertices it's irreducible components. It's irreducible component of this uh of this special fiber. And the edge it is a node between the irreducible components. This is some graph that I pre-read doesn't have any relation with the identification of coil, but there is a very But there is a very remarkable result. It's that it lives naturally in the end an identification. There is a canonical topological embedding between this. Between this this dual graph in the identification such that with respect to this identification this real graph is exactly the skeleton of y. Yes, also it's very remarkable I think. Freeory doesn't have a I think a freeory doesn't have any relation with any identification, and then it leads naturally, canonically, into this. So it means that the skeleton so first we say X has the same autopy type as a skeleton. And here we see that the skeleton is intimately related to to the stable reduction. Does this also work a higher dimension? Does this also work in higher dimension? Sorry? Does this also work in higher dimension? Oh, yeah, but in three dimensions, it's very complex. The skeleton exists, it's a commitment real object, but it's much more complex, so I'm not sure. Things work well in dimension one. So now I'm going to present the results. So take two curves. Take two two curves two curves and such that the tempered group is isomorphic. So isomorphism Okay, then the result is this isomorphism determines a unique and so here there will be several cases unique isomorphism so here's the big result so the first first point So the first first point is uh unique isomorphism between the skeleton okay that this is not always true, but it is true for hyperbolic curves. So an identification of Classification of hyperbolic curves. And this is due to Machizuki. 2006, I think. So this is a really big result. This is the semi-graphs of an evaluate and temperature and lots of machinery. And then uh in in in my PhD I I I generalize this. Um I will not enter into the details, more uh general curves because in the first point it it is the curves that are identifications of uh hyperbolic curves, so they have of algebraic nature. Uh me I showed that it works also. Uh It works also for a lot of curves that are not algebraic nature, just analytic nature. And actually, the point is not really algebraic nature, it's just what is important, is some kind of hyperbolicity at each vertex of the skeleton. So here I will not tell more about this because it would take lots of time. Also, there are plenty of other curves where this works. And here, what is important? What is important? It is the isomorphism as graphs. Graphs. Sorry, before the second point, I should say something is that the skeleton is naturally, or canonically, let's say, canonically, a metric graph. Um this comes from the fact that when you take if you take a edge of the skeleton, the pre-image of this edge with respect to the this canonical retraction is an analysis. And I will speak about the natural way to give a length to any analysis. So the second point is it induces some isomorphism isomorphism between the skeleton as a metric graph means that it preserves the the length of each edge entering graph and it is true if it is it is true if if x one and x two are hyperbolic mumfort curve. Not for its cover. So it's also in so it is identifications of hyperbolic memfold curve. And memfault curve uh it can be defined in lots of ways, but uh let's say that um So it is some hyperbolic curves why such that the identification is locally isomorphic to the projective layer. I mean to open some of the projective layer. Can be rephrased in lots of ways. It's just that there is no points of hierogenesis. And yes, so here it works, but it's really this assumption that is lots of constraints. A priori, there is no result for. There is no result for more general curves that are not of algebraic nature and that are not monfox curves. And then the third point is that it induces a unique isomorphism of corresponding topological spaces, like two, as a topological space. And this, it is true for Manfred curve, exactly the same. Yes, I should say that this this result here is due to Emanuel Lepage uh in 2010. In 2010. And this one also, Emmanuel Leparge, in 2012 uses a resolution of non-singularities. So it's a strong result. So now we have the example for one that it is not true and true and not true for It is not true and three are not true for parts? Ah, yes, good question. No, so I mean no, I mean delta should only go like this, but others otherwise, uh I know even uh no sorry, when No, you've uh no sorry, so no uh I don't think I don't think we have got some control both. Both of them are already algebraic and hydroborn? You should assume this. And in fact, here when I when I present it like this, it looks like um B and abelian result. Yeah, but it's also more than a billion in the meaning that's possible to In the meaning, that's possible to construct the skeleton. In fact, for the skeleton apart from open edges, you need it's enough to have a P' version of the tampered group, and the vertex corresponds to compact maximal subgroup, I mean the conjugation, and the edge corresponds to the intersection of two maximal compact subgroups. Here I don't want to enter too much into the details. Much into the details. And then a natural question is: is the second point true for other curves? And somehow the most simple curve that one can think about is analyze. Because the skeleton of Hanui is just one edge like this. So yes, it's really the natural question. Does the tempered group of some handulus determine the length of this analyst? So Yeah, I'm going to d to define the the length of analysis. So I remind you, or just I tell you for those who do not know, that o what is the analytication of the the affine line? Then it is the the multiplicative seminars. The multiplicative seminars multiplicative seminars on a let's say in the polylinear ring that extend the norm on k by extending the value k. With the topology that makes evaluation continuous. So, the set of points of the identification is the multiplicative semi-norm on the polynomial ring. So, then I will define what is endulous. So, let's take the definition. Let's say it arrays some interval of Of strictly positive numbers. I define CI like a set of points in the analytic affine line such that the norm, the summary norm of t belongs to this interval. This is the definition of analyst rig. Of analyst with respect to this interval. And then curve C is analyzed if and only if there is such interval and subject C is isomorphic to C. Isomorphic to C I isomorphic. Okay, and suppose to show it is undifficult that Ci is isomorphic to C I prime if and only if I prime is almost I up to inversion and up to mu multiplication by the value group. Multiplication by the value group of k. So it belongs to so then I can define the length. If an analyst C is isomorphic to Cπ, I define the length of C. This is the logarithm in the P of the Of the supramoment I and because of this property above, it doesn't depend on the choice of the interval. So now, here I'm going to state the result of the length, the theorem. Um to take two anul so C one and C two anuline with isomorphic with isomorphic temperature group And then, so the natural question is: does the length of C1 equal to length of C2? So, what I showed is that the length of C1 is finite even only if the length of C two is finite. Okay, and in this case, And in this case, I can bound the difference of the lengths by this bound that depends on NP. And yeah, I will not attend to the details, but in some cases possibly Attractive details, but in some cases it's possible to reduce by two, means to forget about this two. But here I want more to explain the general ideas of the proof. So I have a 15 minutes. I should think about what I said. There is an astromorphism. Okay, so if you take consider the torsors, mu n torsor. So they are classified by the h1 of. So I take C. So I take C, some under this. And there is a canonical morphism. I mean, independent on the orientation, but it doesn't matter. From C to this Z over and Z. Here, we are not entering into the details, but just to tell you that when you take a torso. When you take a torsor here, locally it's given by some invertible function on the analysis up to the powers of n. And when you take this invertible function, the condition of being invertible means that uh there is a strictly dominant mono monomial because the function is like a uh series a series in one variable that that converges on the that that converges on the uh on the analysis. And so this morphism, in fact it's given locally, but globally also because it should be the same, by the degree of the strictly dominant monomial that defines locally a torso. So there is there is this morphism. I call it code code chain morphism. Here it seems a bit artificial because it just uh Because the skeleton of C is just one segment, but in fact there is such morphism also for more general curves. But here I just stick to the to the end of this. And the And I don't have time to enter into all the details, but it's just that if you take F, that is MUP, a torsor, and C and the address. Then let's say that this is a rigid point, alpha. So maybe for those who So, maybe for those who don't know which spaces, if we're not speaking ringable, but I'll just explain quickly. And here, the part of the skeleton, okay, so here it's the retraction of alpha. And then this torsor, this torsor, it will look like this. At one moment, it splits and no, uh I consider And now I consider at which moment it splits. I call it the splitting radius. Okay, and in fact, the splitting radius depends on whether or not the constraint is at zero. So it's f is in the kernel. So here we have the index n. So that's Here I put the index n so that I can put here the index p. Let's say it's not in the kernel if and only if this splitting rated equals something that is minus minus one. Here it doesn't really matter. I mean it matters, but and then f is independent. If and only if this radius is strictly greater than this same bone, which means that one can detect the fact that it it's not in the kernel, it's characterized by the splitting radius. And so you can rephrase this. So let's say that for this torso f, I call D of F the splitting set. So it's the X in the analysis C such that F splits splits about It's about x. So so this can be rephrased as a f is in the kernel if and only if there exists f prime torsor, mu b torsor. So the F, so the splitting set of F is not included into D of F. So this is really a set theoretical condition. And in fact, here, for some reasons, I can take just the sets of two points. It's because it's given by such a It's because it's given by such a such formula and and uh it belongs to the value group. For those who don't know what two points mean, it's not a problem. So this is really a set theoretical condition. And then, because of the same property that I wrote here, I can give a set theoretical condition about the length. So length of C is greater than 2p over p minus. Over p minus one, but if and only if so for all F uh unique torso you consider the splitting set uh Set intersected with the analytic skeleton of C, and this should be non-empty. And here you can take the two points. So this is a second set of theoretical condition. Let's call this one A and let's call this one B. And in fact, now I want to use quickly what is called the resolution of non-singularities. Of non-singularities to tell you why these two sets can be determined by the template group. So let's say that you take a point x in a even x here, it's not important, but it's analyzed. It's not important that it's analyzed. But is it solvable if and only if there is a finite etal covering covering, so we'll say y x and so that there is a point above little x that is a ver a vertex of the skeleton. The vertex of the skeleton. So and y of X such that Y is a vertex, vertex of the skeleton. And somehow it is called this kind of things, it's called the resolution of not. resolution of non-singularities because X can be normal, I mean just normal points without anything specific, and it is solvable if after some finite detail covering one can make it singular in the meaning that it's something that the the vertex or vertex of the skeleton, it's not an any point. It's something very very specific. Very very specific. So it's solvable if it can be made as specific, noticeable, after finite covering. And let's say that I call x rest the set of solvable points points of x and I say that x satisfies So, resolution of known singularities if the set of servable points is all the sets of two type two points. Because this is always included in type two points. Okay? So this condition, i i if it's satisfied, it it if it's satisfied it it yeah it's um it defines the resolution of non-singular utilities. And uh something very important in what I I mean in this context is that resolution of non-singular abilities has very an abelian nature because property is that the tempered group of X Of X is enough to meant the set is enough to know the following sets. First, the set of solvable points. One can know if a point is solvable looking at the template group and then let's say Say it's enough to know the solvable points that are in the skeleton. This is the skeleton intersected by the solvable points. And then if f is a torsor, let's say I'm a torsor. We can know the solvable points. Know the solvable points where this torso splits so it's splitting set intersected with the solvable points. So I will not explain in detail this, but what I can say is for instance, if you take a point x, it's solvable if the if and only if the decomposition group inside temporal group, so it's a maximal compact compact group. Compact group. So, in general, this decomposition group is such that there exists an open subgroup of finite index corresponding to the finite stack overling. So, let's say H of this stacker's group. Then you consider the intersection, the decomposition group and this H, and you send it to the P prime to the p prime uh version of h. It's not exactly the p prime uh profile completion, but it's uh also a completion. And it is solvable if and only if this image is non-commutative. So there are this kind of reasoning that uh tell this it's almost time. Uh so what I what I can tell you the is that um Um it's for an obvious proposition. But unless any analysis satisfies resolution of non-singularities resolution of non-singularities. So it means that these two sets, so if you look at Okay, so here I forgot it should be in in the kernel. Okay, so now if you look really at this set, in fact by resolution of non-singular kit, as the type two points, it's exactly the solvable point. These sets A and B can be known from the template group. C can can be known from the template group. The coro corollary uh A and B are determined by p1% of C. So in particular From the tripled group of C, it's possible to know if C has length greater than 2p over p minus 1. Know if the length of slit is greater than 2p over p Over P, the minus one. So I'm almost done. Yeah, I just want to say that also from the tabled group, we can have access to all the mu n torsors when n is prime to p. And the torsor, let's say a mu n torsor of a analyst, it's Q mer, so it defines another analyst which length is a Next is a n of c over n for n prime to p. So for n prime to p it is possible to know from temporal group. If the length of C over L, p it corresponds of the length of the less defined by the new N torsor is greater than 2p over p minus 1. And now that if you have C1 and C2 that have the isomorphic temperature group, you have that. Group here, that this is true for one, if and only if it's true for the other, and that's how I got the results that I presented you. So that's all for today. Questions? An example design where those uh of a curve which doesn't satisfy this argus, a point that a tiny point that can't be lifted to one of the solid points. You mean some example of a curve that doesn't satisfy the resolution of non-singularities? Yeah. Uh if you take any I mean uh the projective line doesn't satisfy it because the uh Because anyway, the skeleton is empty, but because there is no finite covering. But then if you ask me the example of a curve where this result is non-trivial, actually, no. No, I don't have it. No, I don't have examples. And because actually, initially, it's Emmanuel Lepage that showed that there is a resolution of non-singularities for Manford curves, and that's how he got the results with the topological spaces, you know, this isomorphism. And then it's possible to prove, I mean, I did it to prove that it also satisfies the resolution of an. It also satisfies the resolution of non-singularities for more larger curves but that don't have any point of uh of strictly positive positive genus then the question would be there is a curve that has a type to point of positive genus since only uh I don't know what's gonna you also expect those networks under Expect the network functor to move toward the analytic structures, or to really any parts of the curve. It has been answered and maybe I should have told. So in a very, very specific uh um point i it's it's a d uh two two demo. 2G moral, we showed that the tempered group gives the of the curves, means that these curves are isomorphic. If the curves are over analytifications of curves over cupid bar that are just you fix some number, I think you fix some number n and then you take just a projective line without endpoints. So it's yeah. So it's yeah very specific examples otherwise uh otherwise uh I don't know but here so I I showed you the this partial result about the lengths but there is I really think that it's possible to recover the lengths even in the case where it's not monvertible, I mean in some more general case. I just don't know how to prove it, but an intuition that even for analysts, right, everything Even for end of us, I really think that it's possible to recover the links. You gave us all these different candidates for py1, and some were just both worthy. What is what each of those groups is? Or sort of for P1, say? For the projective uh line. Uh so th th they are uh all zero, I ex expect uh but not the big et al one. This one is very big because uh uh So, the Jung, when he defines what means a type of ring, he shows that there are some questions, I mean, a lot of questions that are very big and that are linear groups over QP. Then I didn't say about, in fact, there are some other coverings that are possible to define that lives between the tempered ones and the etal ones. It's all the work carried on recently by Pierre-Kinger, Martin Lara, and Alex. Frecken Ger, Martin Larat and Alex Sussis. So they define some coverings that are between, that also are time-infinite categories, it gives rise to a group. These groups are quite big, but these coverings have very nice property. Do they expect some other area? I feel that it's really the template blue that is because all what we can do is back a bit scars. I mean, the information is the all this pattern, all this topology, and I don't really see which. See which behavior, an ability can be explained by some things that are etal but not tampered. It's a good question. I don't know at all. And then is it possible to recover the tampered? So what is the relation between the tampered and this new? But is is the tampered included in? Yeah, no not tampered is is a. Template is a pro-discrete completion or pro-virtually discrete completion. So, yes, there is some link between. So, template is more or less a quotient of this big geometric group. I don't know if my question entirely makes sense, but so if you start with just like an algebraic curve and like would get the model and reduce the fibers and Model reduces the fiber, etc. Graph that you get, the metric graph. Is that metric somehow related to this length function? Related to what? The length that you defined. Yes, exactly, the length. It's exactly. Yes, just because I told you that this graph I met canonically in the analytic curve. So it so and it is a skeleton, in fact. So then to to make it a metric graph, you need to to put a a length to each edge. Put a a length to each each edge. And in fact, the skeletal retraction from the curve to the skeleton. And when you take just one edge, the pre-image, it's analysis, exactly as an analysis. So it's defined like this. Thank you very much.
