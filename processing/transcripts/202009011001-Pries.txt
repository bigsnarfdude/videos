And she'll be talking about principal polarizations and shimura data for family of cyclic covers of the projective line. Thanks, Niels. When I woke up this morning in Fort Collins, the air was very crisp and it reminded me of the mountains of Banff. I came downstairs half expecting to find a poached egg and fresh fruit and a table. Fresh fruit and a table of friendly people from the audience having an inspiring conversation. There was no such luck in my household this morning, but I just wanted to thank the organizers for helping us connect virtually this week. And I hope that those of you who have never been to Banff before will have the chance to do that soon. So today I'm going to be talking about joint work with Wanlin Lee, Elena Montevideo. Wanlin Li, Elena Mantavan, and Yunqing Tang. And so here's an overview of what we're going to do. We're going to look at cyclic covers of the projective line that have invariants like the degree M, the number of branch points, N, the genus G. We have Hurwitz spaces which parametrize families of curves with the same invariance. The Jacobians of these curves are principally. The Jacobians of these curves are principally polarized abelian varieties, and they also have invariants like the dimension, g, the endomorphisms, the signature, and we have Shmur varieties that parametrize families of abelian varieties with the same invariance. And our main result is that under a condition on the class number of qzeta m for an arbitrary capital N, we determine the Hermitian form and integral Schmidt. In the Hermitian form, an integral Shmur datum of the component of the Shmur variety containing the Trelle locus of Jacobians of curves. And in this talk, I'd like to focus on the more geometric parts of the project, which are identifying a distinguished point in the boundary of the family. And this point represents a cover of singular curves, and each component of that singular curve has. Has a Jacobian with complex multiplication. And we will sort of skip the algebraic parts of this talk, which you can go see my aunt's talk if you'd like to hear more about that, about how to really understand the torus, C to the G, mod the lattice, and the Hermitian form coming from the polarization on those Jacobians with complex multiplication. So the cyclic covers. So, the cyclic covers of the projective line are given by a formula like y to the m is a product of x minus a branch point bi raised to the ai. And if there are n branch points, we can write this cover like this. And the singularities of this equation are no big deal. We can find a unique smooth projective curve which has this affine equation. equation. These numbers AI tell us a lot of information about this family. In particular, there can be families of these covers that have different inertia types. So the set of these numbers a1 through a n is called the inertia type. You can of course rearrange the values of a by moving permuting the branch points and you can also And you can also switch the choice of your nth root of unity, which multiplies all the Ai's by some number relatively prime to m. And the sum of the Ai's is 0 mod M, and for the curve to be connected, the G C D of all of them with M is 1. And so we're going to fix this data of the degree, the number of branch points, and the inertia type. And using the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, you can Using the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, you can then find the genus of the curve. The other thing we can do is look at the Jacobian, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension G. And we can look at the one forms on that Jacobian and decompose them into eigenspaces given by how the automorphism of order M acts on the one-forms. And the signature type keeps track. Signature type keeps track of the dimensions of these eigenspaces. So g has to be the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces. And in a paper by Connie, you can find a formula for these dimensions in terms of the inertia type. You can also determine the inertia type in terms of these dimensions. The formula is a little complicated because it has to be invariant under permutations of the A's, and it also The A's. And it also, as you, if you multiply all the A's by a fixed number J, you have to permute the values of the signature type. And so this is the formula where these angle brackets represent the fractional part of this fraction. So, for example, let's say we look at degree five and four branch points, and inertia type one, two, three, four. The genus is. Three, four. The genus is four. We can write this curve like this, but by moving the branch points to 0, 1, and infinity, then we can write an easier equation for this curve. This one turns out to have signature 1, 1, 1, 1. And we can see that in the moduli space of curves of genus 4, this is a one-dimensional family of curves, just given by adjusting t. With a little more work, you can see that in the moduli space of abelian varieties of dimension four, the family of these has dimension two. And so the image of the trelle locus is not open and dense inside the image in A4. So we have a Hurwitz space, the moduli space of. Space, the moduli space of μm covers with monodromy type gamma, and it's irreducible. And also, this data determines a PEL-type Shimura variety whose points represent principally polarized abelian varieties with an action of Z mu m of this signature. And this can have many components. And so we want to look at the component of the Shmur variety, which contains the image. Which contains the image of the Hurwitz space. And our goal is to determine the integral Shimura datum for that component. We're especially interested in Moonen's 20 special families, where the dimension of the Shimura variety equals the dimension of the Hurwitz space, but our approach is not restricted to these and, in fact, works for arbitrarily large genus. So just a So just a review of what an integral Schmoard datum is. So for the moduli space of abelian varieties, Delene looked at the vector space V, which is Q to the 2G. And in there, we can find a lattice, Z to the 2G, and we have a standard symplectic form, which is integral on that lattice. Associated with this data, there's a group of symplectic solimitudes. Solimitudes and certain homomorphisms that define Hodge structures. So when we add this action of an nth root of unity, we change the group and the data of the signature is a little bit complicated. So our goal is to find the integral Schmurr data for s gamma. And so to do that, we need to express v as a vector space over the Vector space over the cyclotomic field, find a lattice for the ring of integers in the cyclotomic field, and explicitly find a Hermitian form on that vector space taking integral values on the lattice. And so what we do is, and so in the next two slides, I'm going to restrict to the case that m is an odd prime because it's much easier to write down what happens. And what we do is we look And what we do is we look at the Hurwitz space and we find a distinguished point in that. And that distinguished point represents a cover of singular curves. The curve T has genus zero, but it's now a tree of projective lines. The curve C has compact type, and it has a bunch of irreducible components, and each of which is a curve of genus. m minus 1 over 2, which is a μm cover of P1 branched at three points. So the Jacobian of each of the components C is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension m minus 1 over 2 with complex multiplication by the ring of integers in the cyclotomic field. And because of that, under some really stringent conditions on M, On M. First, we need this eclatomic field to have class number one, and so there's a very short list of M for which that's true. And then we also need to make sure that the CM types of the Jacobians that show up are going to be simple. I'll say more about that in a bit, but luckily that condition is automatic for four of these values. Is automatic for four of these values of m, and it happens for infinitely many inertia types for the other values of m on this list. And so once we have those CM types, we can compute numbers beta j, complex numbers, associated with those CM types. And then we're able to find the Shmur datum for this component of the Shmur variety containing the Schmoord variety containing the Hurwitz space. And it's just given by the vector space f to the r, the standard OF lattice OF to the R, and a Hermitian form, which is given by the trace determined by this diagonal matrix B, whose entries are the betas. So the explanation of part one. The explanation of part one is not so complicated. It comes from the theory of boundaries of Hurwitz spaces and admissible covers of curves. If you have two muam covers, you can clutch them together by identifying the last ramification point of one with the first ramification point of the other. And this produces a cover and the Jacobian of that curve of compact. Of that curve of compact type decomposes into the product of the Jacobians of the two curves with the product polarization. So if it's admissible, meaning that the values of the inertia type are inverses mod m, this curve will then deform to a mu m cover of smooth curves. And it's a very short combinatorial argument to show that you can work backwards. Backwards. So, if you have a family of covers of curves, a Hurwitz space with more than four branch points, because those Hurwitz spaces are affine, you can deform to the boundary by letting the branch points collide. And the only thing you need to be careful about when the branch points collide, that you need to make sure that the singular curve you get has compact type. And that can be just verified. And that can be just verified by making sure that we collide two branch points whose inertia values are not inverses mod m. And so doing that repeatedly, we can then find degenerate completely to the boundary of the moduli space. So I have a bunch of So, I have a bunch of examples here. They're not in particular important, except to say that we can handle all the cases for all monodromy data when M is 3. In that case, the Hurwitz family is determined by the signature. And there are two complex numbers, beta 1 and beta 2, which are plus or minus the square root of minus 3. And so once you know the signature of your Hurwitz space, Signature of your Hurwitz space that completely determines the Shimura data because the matrix B is going to have the right number of entries of beta 1 and beta 2. And this includes three of the special moon and families. We can also handle all monodromy data when M is 5, but it's not so easy to write a closed form description of that result. Description of that result. So here's just an example. In this case, the betas are 5 over zeta 5 cubed minus zeta 5 squared. And this is just an example of how you, what these two curves in the boundary look like. Once you, so for instance, like with this inertia type 1, 2, 3, 4, by specializing the branch points. Specializing the branch points with inertia values one and two together, we kind of pull off a component whose inertia type is one, two, and the remaining value has to be two. And then what we're left with is the one with inertia values three and four. And so that the third inertia value has to be three. And so from those inertia types, you can find the signature, and then you can find the CM type, and then you can determine the principal polarization. Determine the principal polarization. So, what are these values? Beta, what's, oh, and here we have more examples when m is 5. And in particular, we can handle the two of the moon in special families by taking these degenerations. So, I wanted to say a little bit about where these betas come from. So, from algebraic number theory, From algebraic number theory, we learn about how an ambelian variety that has complex multiplication by the ring of integers in the cyclotomic field and a fixed CM type that has uniquely determined up to isomorphism when F is class number one. And von Waumelen wrote an algorithm about principal polarizations on these C. am abelian varieties. C. am abelian varieties. And the important thing is that these principal polarizations are uniquely determined under a condition on the narrow class number of the real subfield of the cyclotomic field. And so in all cases when m is an odd prime power, you can see that this real cyclotomic field has narrow class number one, and so it has units of independent signs. Of independent signs. And so we can apply this whole theory as long as the CM type is simple, meaning that it's not induced from a CM type for a proper CM field. So really concretely, to define a principal polarization on C to the N mod phi of OF, we need to have an element beta in OF, which generates a codifferent, which Which is purely imaginary, and such that when you look at the values of the embeddings on beta, their imaginary parts are all positive. And from that, you can really explicitly write down the Riemann form. So, for cyclotomic fields, we can just use the cyclotomic polynomials to generate, to find out a generator for the code. To find out a generator for the codifferent. And so, in particular, we need beta to be an associate of this very concrete complex number. But that complex number may not have the right signature, it might not have the right positivity conditions. And so we just need to look at the signs of the imaginary part of the embeddings on this element. The embeddings on this element, and then fix them by adjusting beta knot by a totally real unit which has the right signs. And that's always possible to do if your real cyclotomic field has units of independent signs. So very concretely, when m is 5, beta naught is this element 5 over zeta 5 cubed minus zeta 5 squared. And so if And so, if your embeddings include the first and the third embedding of the cyclotomic field into C, we can just choose a very easy unit, minus one, and find out what beta should be. And if you have a more complicated CM type, you just need a more complicated unit to get the right signs on this complex number. Okay, so the simple condition is unfortunately a little bit harder to deal with. So a CM type is simple if it's not induced from a proper CM field. And that is luckily automatic for the values of M being 3, 5, and 17, and also for a bunch of others. But for M equals 7, not every CM type is simple. Not every CM type is simple, and some of the distinguished points that we might naturally compute will end up with non-simple CM types. In particular, this moon and family M17 when M is 7, N is 4, and this is the inertia type. And so we're circumventing this problem for this particular family using a different distinguished points with onomorphisms and using more algebraic number theory. Theory. So, just in the last minute, I may say that it's possible to do a lot of this theory when m is not prime, but you just need to be a little bit careful because some of the distinguished points don't have compact type. So that's something that needs to be just checked, and it depends on what the inertia type is. And another issue that comes up is that the Jacobian might not have complex multiplication. The Jacobian might not have complex multiplication by a maximal order. And so, again, that's something that sometimes will be true and sometimes will not be true, depending on the inertia type. And so in situations when that is true, we can compute the Shimura data. And that's true for infinitely many families, but it seems hard to characterize which ones fit the theory that we have and which ones don't. Which ones don't. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much for that talk. Are there any questions for Rachel? I'll ask a question. So, can you say anything about the reflex field or anything like that about this or the canonical model for these Shimora varieties? Yeah, a little bit, but we haven't finished writing it up yet. Okay, thanks. Who was that? Abby. Abby, thank you. Any further questions? I have a question. So now that you have, like, it seems like very explicit in the when that your conditions are satisfied, you have good control over the image of Torelli. Do you think you can study if you have something not in the image, like how many times the reduction mod P becomes in the image of Torelli? Becomes in the image of Turelli? Does that seem so? Um, well, maybe there are two parts of your question. One is that I don't really know how to deal with the components that are not in the image of Torelli. There's some facts about the Shimura variety that are the same for every component, but the Shimura data is not the same, not necessarily the same for every component. Necessarily the same for every component, and I think we really don't have techniques to look at those other components. Then you were also asking about whether we could tell whether the reduction mod P is in the image of the Torelli. I'm not sure. Yeah, I don't think so. Thanks. Any further questions? I was wondering, do you get, can you sort of see from this data what type of anomorphism rings are possible on these Jacobians and whether you see certain anomorphism rings on not on Jacobians that you would otherwise expect on a median varieties? Expect on a medium variety to find some doesn't really directly answer your question, but one thing we're sort of grappling with is that there are many different diagonal matrices that can describe the same Hermitian form. And so we haven't really found a great way yet of really saying, describing each. Saying, describing each isomorphism class of Hermitian form. And then I say somehow that the constraints on the endomorphisms have a lot to do with that Hermitian form, but we haven't really worked that out. Okay, thank you. Any further questions? No? In that case, let us thank the speaker. That case, let us thank the speaker again. We have a little break now. We reconvene at 40 past the hour. There are several possibilities for what you're going to do in that break. I think that, yeah, because going to yeah, going to this. To yeah, going to this other place. That's the gather town place is probably not doable in the time permitted, so you should probably use it to just get some coffee chat here. And getting coffee is probably exactly what I'm gonna do. So, I'll see you too.
