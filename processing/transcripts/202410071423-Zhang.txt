We'll cover it in my talk today. So, first thing is the habitat amount. A lot of time we see fragmentation, the impact of fragmentation, there's some might cause by some confounding factors such as habitat loss. If you're losing 50% habitat, that's not going to be good. And habitat amount hypothesis, if you haven't heard about that, that means people think fragmentation can only play a big role to the species only if we have maybe. Species only if we have maybe 20 or 30 percent habitat available. So if we still have 80, 60 percent habitat available, fragmentation might not have a strong impact that we can measure in the field. And on the same time, there's another debate going on for a couple decades between single large and several small. I know a lot of mathematicians you might be interested in the patch, you know, size. I know that's a big topic in math. So, what that means is, do we prefer a single large habitat or Large habitat, or do we prefer several small patches, assuming the total area and size is equivalent? And there's a lot of debate between do we prefer single large or several small? Do we even care about several small patches, right? And we summarize this figure, just give some ideas about some pros and cons between single large and several small. I'm not going to go to details, but a lot of having literatures in the field right now. And two years ago, there's a great theory. Years ago, there's a great theoretical work published trying to propose a new idea called single large and several small. So, I think mathematicians think probably ahead of ecologists is that instead of arguing whether we want a single big large or several small patches, why don't we combine them and you get all the benefits? So, this is a new perspective that proposed mathematically or theoretically, who never been tested empirically. So, single large meaning. So single large means we got a single large patch, several small means, you could have several small patches. I think the intermediate one in the middle is you have a smaller but still big patch plus several small ones. So we're interested in testing whether different configuration plays a role to understand the responses to fragmentation. And going back to the confusion around fragmentation, something that they highlighted is the term called fragmentation per se. That means we should look at fragmentation impact independently. Fragmentation impact independent of other factors, especially habitat mount. Because a lot of times we see things that are actually caused by habitat loss, not fragmentation. But how to separate those two things separately in a real field empirical system, that's pretty challenging. And what they argue is that among 25%, most cited fragmentation articles published between 2017 to 2021. 2017 to 2021, there's only one work that completely separates fragmentation and habitat area. So, most of the work kind of just put everything together, so it's still not clear enough. And if we try to understand more of the impact of fragmentation per se, that will actually help us to solve some of the confusion we have about fragmentation. And that will make maybe better suggestions to the conservation team whether they should prioritize their efforts to come. Should prioritize their efforts to conserve the species in the field. The last confusion that my lab is also interested to give some more information is the species information, right? So when we talk about the response to fragmentation, every species will have different responses. And for instance, people look at maybe larger species or species at a higher trophic level, they might be more likely to go extinction when we lose the habitat. But what about Habitat. But what about movement strategies, right? That's a big topic in math: diffusion and dispersal terms in the equation. So, how would a species with different movement strategies, will that be a big factor needs to be considered if we want to understand the impact of fragmentation? And we wanted to argue that, you know, even for the same species, they could have very different movement strategies, try to help them to adapt to different changing environment. To different changing environments. For instance, if you live in the United States, you heard about a very cute frog called a green tree frog. They're about this big, very cute. They're commonly distributed in the southeast of the United States. And this is actually one, probably the only native species that having a natural range expansion under climate change. So the gray area on the map, that's a historical range. They've been there even. Historical ranch. They've been there even for probably 100 years. The yellow range are the new counties since the 1980s that recorded the frogs. The frogs is expanding their range up to the north, probably to track a cooler temperature. And then my student was interested in whether the frogs that live in the historical range comparing to the expanding range, whether they not evolve, but they show different dispersal capacities. Capacities. What we did is we collected frogs from different areas and we did a CT scan on those frogs, each individual frog, and then you can get all those cool pictures and you can measure the length of their bones. And the length could indicate their dispersal abilities. And what we found is that this is the same species within really just not too long time difference, but all the frogs we collected from the expansion rent showed significant. The expansion rant showed significant longer leg lengths than the one that collected in the historical rant. If you look at our sampling map, those sites are not that far from each other. It's not one from Miami, one from up north. They're really close, but they already showed a very significant difference in their leg lengths, which could indicate the one that moving up north may have a stronger dispersal abilities. So that's why we should consider different movement strategies from the perspective of biology and ecology. perspective of biology and ecology. And some other study we also did also find different movement strategies is all in different systems. For instance, we recently did a meta-analysis that summarized the dispersal rate of invasive plant species and native plant species. And we showed that invasive plants have significant higher dispersal rate than native plants, which explain why they are invasive because they can move much faster. And some other studies from And some other studies from other people they find those toads is an invasive species. If you measure their travel distance at the invasion front comparing to the long-established population area like back there, the frog will have a longer travel distance if they're at the front of the invasion line. So, meaning that even the same species they're experiencing this climate change or probably fragmentation too, they Or probably fragmentation too, they could have very different movement strategies. That's why we really try to argue that we need to consider movement if we want to understand the fragmentation impact. So the work that I did with two of my grad students, Jamo and Gabriel, is we set up an interesting laboratory system using the worm called C. elegans. If you're from our biology department, you heard a lot of talks about the worms. They're very popular because Worms, they're very popular because they're a big system used in biology. But this worms, they know every gene of this single worm. So, in principle, you can create any kind of mutations you want and create different personalities that you want if you want to test some theoretical questions. And the work we're interested in is, okay, now we know that with different environment changing or different conditions, species could have different movement strategies, which movement strategies will be better. Which movement strategies will be better or have more advantage responding to fragmentation? So, to answer this question, we use three strings. They're completely identical in terms of their reproduction, growth rate. The only difference is the three strings have different dispersal rates. So the roamer moves faster than the control strain, like intermediate level, and then the dweller barely move. And they only have random diffusion, they don't have any directed movement. So we try to try to keep. Any directed movement. So we try to keep things simple at this point. And my students, we use 3D printer, something like this, and you can print any shapes of the polygon. So you can design any kind of habitat configurations in a lab setup on a teacher dish like this big. And the worms are very tiny. So this side to them is pretty good. And we've been recently using a much giant teacher dish like this big, look like your dish plate, so that creates a much larger space. So, that creates a much larger space for those worms. And this is how they look under the microscope. So, if you take a picture, they will look like this: just look like a worm. And then we have the worms without fluorescent and some with fluorescent. So, we can have two strains live in the same environment. And because one has the fluorescent on the head, we can identify them under the microscope. So, we are running computation experiments. So, you're able to identify the two species, and you can run more like computation experiments. And you can run more like a computation experiment to answer more questions. And I'm just showing one video. If you know me enough, you might already seen this video, but for some of you, I'm just going to show you right here. So the one that with fluorescent has a higher dispersal speed than this duel. So dueler, when they find food, you know, those gray area, they don't really move much. Even they only have random diffusion, but they still spend more time just staying instead of moving around. Moving around. This data or this experiment? This is the experiment. This is the video that we took under the microscope. Alright, so let's see what we did. So first thing is we wanted to understand, you know, with two level of habitat loss, what does that mean is for the low habitat loss case, we cover the petri dish has six columns. So we cover five columns out of six with food. So you only lose one column without. only lose one column with our food so it's a little bit habitat loss for the high habitat loss case we cover only two columns out of six you lose quite a bit habitat and within each level we create a three level fragmentation by moving the empty columns you know in different locations to mimic a stronger habitat fragmentation or less connectivity. And we use the three streams. We only let them grow separately. So we're only looking at their abundance for this work. The abundance for this work, but we're running like competition trials right now. So, first, what do we find at a high habitat loss case? So, left is low fragmentation, right is more fragmentation. So, when there's low fragmentation, actually no fragmentation, because the two columns are right next to each other, we find that the red and green boxes, those are the low and intermediate dispersal rate strings, they have significant higher, larger abundance than Higher, larger abundance than the fast strain. So remember, those worms, in principle, should produce the same amount of eggs and babies within the same amount of time. And that's for the same amount of food we give to the plate. And the slow strength seems to be a better strategy. And we started the experiment putting the worm in the center of the plate. So just keep that in your mind. And then when we increase the fragmentation level by moving those two column weights of food farther and farther from each other, we see two things. From each other, we see two things. One is for the fast strings, the blue box, there's no significant difference among the three fragmentation. In our other words, the fast string didn't do very well, but they're not very sensitive when we increase fragmentation. For the slow strings, we find a significant decrease in their population, which indicate they are more harmed by fragmentation. And yes, please. The the leftmost blue one, why is the variance so high on that one? But on the rest, they're all pretty. One, but on the rest, they're all pretty. No, that's just real data. That's a little matter. Yeah. You have the same control data on the full plate without having errors. Would they result in a similar abundance? If we cover the whole thing with, oh yes, they will. We actually even measure a single worm of each string, how many eggs they can produce within the same amount of time. Can produce weight in the same amount of time and they produce the same X. Yeah. Well, that's a good question. And one explanation is the fast movement might create this mismatch between the population distribution and the resource distribution. Because if you look at the correlation between abundance and distance to food, so lower distance means you're very close to food, which you shouldn't be, right? The longer distance means you're too far from food. And you look at the red and green, they are much higher. Look at the red and green, they have much higher abundance when they're close to food, but they're lower abundance when they're away from food. So, that's a much better strategy to help them when the food is next to each other. But the fast movement, they are kind of evenly distributed on the plate. That's why they're not a very good strategy, but that's also why they're not sensitive to the configuration change. And another interesting thing that we saw is with the low habitat loss case. So, according to habitat hypothesis, you think, okay, A lot of hypothesis, you think, okay, if you cover two, five out of six, fragmentation shouldn't have a big role there. But what we see here is that for the slow string, it has a much higher abundance in this case. But when we increase the fragmentation, there's no change for the fast string, but slow string had a significant lower abundance when we increase fragmentation. Even if we cover five out of six columns with food, that still plays a big impact to the one that. Impact to the one that moves slower. Sorry, what's the time scale of the experiment? It's actually very short. So the generation of the worm is only seven days, but we run the experiment for four days before they deplete the food. We don't want to go starving. And also we started the experiment before the worm laid any eggs. So all the worm has not laid any eggs and then they started the experiment, start laying eggs and create babies and grow the population. So only four days. That's exactly the beauty of the system. You can run like evolution experiment. Like there's one paper 20 years ago with the system looking at the evolution of diffusion. Only eight generations you can see some changes over there. So it's a very rapid system. But here for us, only four days, there's not any evolution happening. Some other work we've been doing, so I come. Other work we've been doing, so I come, I live in Oklahoma, that's the state right here above Texas. So, what we also did is we also tried some real configurations, like real polygon shapes, then the artificial design. One thing we did is there's an important ecoregion called cross-timberland. It's an important ecoregion for a lot of species in the place where I live. And we use remote sensing. We can crop the ecoregion and then print it with a 3D printer and then. With a 3D printer, and then project that on the picture dip so we can create a small cross-timber length on our picture dip, so there's no fragmentation. We usually joke because we print it in orange around Halloween time and looks like a witch. And then we test a few different ways of fragmentation. One way is we added a highway to here. So I think this is the highway, the 40, and this is the highway, the 30 something. And then we chopped the wedge into half and each. The witch into half and even into small pieces by adding the highway into our polygon. Another thing we also did is this is around like I think Oklahoma City, something like a big city. So we increased the area, the size, to mimic more like fragmentation by losing more like habitat. So there are a few different ways we're testing just to say whether we can see similar response if we're using a real configuration. Yes? Oh, two minutes. Okay. Oh, two minutes, okay. So, we see very consistent results. I'm not going to go into much details, but overall, you know, slow strain showed a significant stronger decrease in the abundance under fragmentation regime compared to the fast one. And another new thing that we've been working on is the single large and several small debate. And because there's no data, not really no data, but the new perspective, there's no data to test that. And we're trying to test that by creating different single large, several. Different single large, several small, and the combined case. Like, for instance, in the single large case, when you have just like two columns covered by food, we find the slow string seems doing better than the fast string, which is consistent from the previous work. And when we have tested a few different, several small cases, I'm only putting one example here, we see that we also add a corridor to connect those small patches because when there's no corridor, there's no difference because you only have a few. There's no difference because you only have a few same amounts of patches. But when we add in corridor, we find that corridor mainly benefits the one that moves faster. So, in other words, even we add a corridor for the slow stream, they barely use it. So, for the several small, they are not doing very good. And then the most exciting part is when we test the several, the single large and several small case, we actually say that, you know, with our corridor, there's no difference. But when we add a corridor, especially adding a short distance corridor, Adding a short-distance corridor, we can pretty much make the slow and the fast doing equally good in this case. So, putting everything together, we show some new results related to habitat among hypothesis that the fragmentation could have a strong negative impact, especially the one that moves slower. And that's because the and also the fast strain don't do very well because they have the mismatch between the population distribution and resource distribution. Distribution and resource distribution. And the new work that we've been doing with the SLAS, the single large and the several small, we hope that encourage more work switching from just debate which one is better into something like this and considering corridor might be able to make more impact to the conservation efforts. So I want to thank you. I didn't see any of the mathematical work, but the paper we published, there's a lot of mathematical input from Adrian, Hawong. Input from Adrian, Haoong, and Yuri. I would like them to talk. And I want to thank everyone in my lab. Last picture, very important. When I was a grad student, that was 2012, and I know a lot of you was there. I was a grad student standing right there in the corner, trying to figure out what to do for my grad school. And I kind of continued this dispersal, diffusion, heterogeneity thing since then. So I feel very honored to. Now we have a new picture. So thank you very much for your attention. Very much for your attention. Oh, one last, even more important question. You should show this because my baby is much older now, but I like to show this if I see something too boring and make you sleep. I hope now you wake up. So, thank you. Any quick questions, sweet, because we've got the rolling up because we've got a lot of questions. So, maybe we'll start from the furthest. So, maybe we'll start from the furthest and move in. Sure. Great talk, thank you. So, the paper that you're referring to earlier one, the Friedenberg paper from 2003, did you use the same strains of C. elegans as they did? Yeah. Because one of their results seems similar, like the spatial heterogeneity selects for the less mobile strain. Yeah. Okay, okay. And they also looked at the effect of temporal heterogeneity. Are you considering that? That's also what we're trying to do. Okay, cool. That paper was actually really. Yeah, yeah. That paper was actually the only one using the system for that evolution. Pretty cool. Yeah, it's very cool. I was curious if you found any evidence for other changes in movement. Was it speed per se, or were there tortuosity changes or search strategy changes or anything along those lines? Yeah, so that's a really good question. At this point, we try to keep the first step simple, just looking at the dispersal rate. And honestly, we particularly choose the strain with different Particular choose the strain with different dispersal rates. So they're not going to evolve any new things within the time that we run the experiment. But if we are running the evolution experiment, we should be able to say other strategies which might evolve. And there's a lot of math work that may help us to make the predictions. And the worm do have memories. So for instance, if they ever been starved, next time they see the food, they're going to eat, eat, eat, and not stop. So there's some burning for that system. Learning for that system. Yes, of course. It would seem like it would be fairly simple to just numerically compute solutions to linear diffusion equations with those different simple configurations. Was that part of what you did, that methane suppressed? Or if not, maybe it would be an interesting thing to do to see if that matched. Analytically, it would be hard to do that, but numerically, it would be pretty straightforward. But in there it would be pretty straightforward. It's a linear equation. That's right. So the theory part. So Engine you can also answer. So the theory part is. That's how we start working together. So I think how F3 used the eigenvalue method to study fragmentation. And then later on, we find out that if there's toxin, Finally, that if there's toxins and there's nutrients, you cannot always treat the toxins as negative growth rate. So we use some of your switching. I wasn't going to laugh, but thank you. We will send you the paper that we got accepted to you. That would be very interesting. Very interesting stuff. Thanks. Thank God.
