So one of the studies we did a couple of years ago is we wanted to use electronic health records data to forecast PTSD risk in patients who were admitted to the emergency department after a potential traumatic event and who had a risk for developing PTSD. And the problem is that everyone of you who has been to an emergency department knows it's a very hectic place. Pective place. The providers have usually around 15 minutes of probation. They don't have time to take care of the psychological toll of the traumatic event. And so we had the chance to collaborate with colleagues at Emory together. And we built a machine learning algorithm using electronic health records data plus four questions about the immediate psychological stress responsibility. And we were able. And we were able to see also externally validated algorithm with pretty high predictive accuracy, as you can see down below. However, when you look at the feature important is the darker blue ones are the psychological stress response indeed. And I thought in the beginning I was very naive. I thought like four questions. It's very easy to implement into routine care. The providers just have to ask these four questions. You can implement. These four questions, you can implement it together with EHR, super easy, and we are very good in broadcasting PD0s through one year after trauma. But then I got like a lot of pushback from providers who said like we don't have time for four questions, it's not feasible. And also only 7% of BDs really regularly screen for PTs dealers. So we were like thinking, okay, how can we replace this and have like a And have like a more objective alternative to these psychological stress response. And this is how I became interested in a different field using data, more active digital phenotypes that we already discussed a little bit in the last couple of days. But why I became interested is kind of also what you can see here. So immediately after trauma, also during the traumatic event. Or during the traumatic event, there's a biological hard-wired reaction of us to it. And you can see it also in the facial expressivity of those people who are just now experiencing the traumatic event. And we tried to combine different areas. We wanted to see more mimic how a psychotherapist or psychiatrist would use it, like combining the posture and movement patterns, facial expressivity, but also voice processing and speech content. Voice proceeding speech content. And we conducted a proof of concept studies a couple of years ago with trauma survivors when we were able to just extract from these digital biomarkers from the facial, from the audio and video files, to alcoholically identify patients with PTSD depression with also syndicated. So we were thinking like can we combine this, this like the two works, that two projects that I just discussed. That I just discussed. And we designed a study where we wanted to see: can we extract those digital biomarkers directly in the ED from a standard question that every ED clinician asks, which is what happens? And we are conducting this study now since three years, and we enroll around 350 trauma survivors in two emergency departments in New York. And directly, when they are coming to the emergency department, we are video and audio recording the standard question: what happened? And we extract those digital biomarkers from it and combine it with the allotron plasma. So this is the longitudinal study because PTSD risk develops over in the future and is not already in the ED visible, and it's also very difficult to prognosticate it already in the ED. So we have through one year. So we have through one year follow-ups, but we are examining the video recordings in the emergency department. But you can imagine, this is very challenging. It is not like in a clean, like with constant light, it's very noisy, there are a lot of like peeping noises from all the instruments, there are different people speaking, there are different people passing behind the participants. Passing behind the participant in the video. So, how can we deal with all those challenges? I already mentioned those. And then, also, like, because we wanted to do it very authentic, how providers could do it. So, we use equipment that providers have automatically, which is an iPad, but the person holds it when the patient are answering that question. So, there are also movements of the cameras, so it's very difficult to distinguish the movement of the camera. Difficult to distinguish the movement of the camera and the movement of the patient. So I have a lot of computer scientists and engineers who really have, and I want to emphasize two of them, Jodi and Vicki, who are working on it non-stop day and night. And I will not go into depth, but like also how to denoise the video and also the audio files. But I know we don't have much time, but who is interested can come to me, we can talk. Who is interested can come to me, we can talk more about this more. But this is a year-long process of it. And then we wanted to see can we use those digital biomarkers in DD to forecast future PTSD risks? And I just present like few examples of pilot data from this bigger grant that we um looked into. One is just the digital biomarkers, which is the uh the facial expressivity, voice versus the speech content and movement patterns. Content and movement patterns, and we were able to do it with a pretty high accuracy. But we were very frustrated, not frustrated, but we were thinking, okay, just the video recording is more complex than just like looking at the narratives. And then in the last couple of years, and we are all know the magic development of large language models, so we were thinking, okay, can we use LLMs to also examine the narrative in the D2 forecast region? In the DH2 forecast future PTSD risk. And we are pretty excited that from the small sample that we had, we had like with a pretty high sensitivity, we were able to do this. And we are working on it more currently. And now I want to, which is associated with that study, is, and we talked about a lot of like texting data, social media use data, and And passo-sensing data, paso-sensing data will come later too, but we have like a sub-study that is associated in it that we talked about social interaction and it's like not as clear how social interaction really impacts patient symptomatology, but also the patient symptomatology impacts them the social interaction and the social support. So, we have an additional study and looking in those people who are coming with them. And those people who are coming with them in the emergency department, we're building diets. We follow both the supporter and the patient over one year. We look at the symptomatology of both, the perceived and given social support. And what we also do in all of our 350 patients at the end of the study participation, we ask them to retrospectively donate their texting, call and social media data. Call and social media data. We are working together with colleagues of mine from Germany who built a platform where you can retrospectively donate this data, also iMessage data. And we ask that at the end of the study because I don't want that it impacts the way of how they are communicating. And we look at data three months prior to the traumatic event to see how the social interaction is changing. And we know, for example, Changing. And we know, for example, of course, like we said, we look at the top five people who are, or the top ten people they are communicating to see also if the pattern changes with that person. But of course, it could be also, as you said, we try to avoid that. It's not like a delivery because it's really about the retrospective, like communication between two. So we look at this data and then we also. At this data, and then we also have a different study because, like, in mental health, also, neurocognitive performance is very important. We talked yesterday also about attention and like how far, like, how fast am I typing, what kind of errors am I doing that. And so, we look also at proxies for neurocognitive performance because neurocognitive performance, everyone who did that is like very, very costly and time-consuming itself. Costly and time-consuming assessment. So, we looked at: can we use those digital biomarkers that struggle from the video and audio data as proxies for neurocognitive performance? And we looked at this at different neurocognitive domains, motor coordination, emotional bias, processing speed, sustained attention, controlled attention, flexibility, inhibition, executive functioning. And in this proof of concept study, we were able to explain a huge amount of Huge amount of variants of these different neurocognitive domains from analyzing these digital biomarkers. And currently, we are conducting with a three-year follow-up study in emergency department providers, where we look at every six months we do a new cognitive assessment, mental health assessment, and also a semi-structured interview about a stressful event. Interview about a stress from defined at work where we extract those digital biomarkers. Because what I'm very interested in is: can we use those digital biomarkers also to see the change of symptomatology within one person, even in high-functioning individuals such as emergency department providers? Is it sensitive enough? And we do also a yearly blood draw to look at immune inflammatory marker indicators of metabolic syndrome and other stress indicators. And other stress indicators, and also markers of more chronic stress, such as steroids from hair samples, to see, because I'm very interested in those digital biomarkers, are they really associated with real biomarkers of stress? And also, do they change over time? And can those digital biomarkers affect those data shifts? And then we also develop together with our colleagues from. Together with our colleagues from neuroscience behavioral apps that we can use to, because what we see is like patients and also in general individuals like to do more active apps than EMA is horrible. Sorry, EMA is very difficult to really do it with a high compliance over a long time and then really have active data. So we try to find better proxies that are more engaging, more fun for the patients, but still are very informative. For the patients, but still are very informative about the syndromatology. And we also, and Ati, I think you talked about like a study in pregnant women. We are nearly done with a study in pregnant women where we looked, also we used also the aura ring as a variable where we look at multiple indicators and see if we can use also the change of the stress indicators for the mom and how they are associated with. And how they are associated with birth outcomes, but also I have like an incredible smart colleague. She's an expert in feet and brain fMRI, which is really difficult to do, but we really also see how these changes are associated with changes or also outcomes really in the development of the and then the last very fast is also Very fast is also where we try to implement, can be used ostitiously biomarkers also. Another reward scenario is a multi-center multi-I study with like colleagues from Switzerland and it's in patients who are discharged after a psychiatric inpatient stay after a severe suicidal ideation or severe suicide attempt. And when they're about to be discharged, then there's a We just search, then there's a moment where we contact them. We have like a very extensive clinical assessment, but then we developed an app that we give those patients and where we follow them over one week where they use the app. We have also passive sensing and also all these positive digital phenotypes that we also discussed here. However, what we also do is we have like video and audio EMAs because what we see is EMAs, because what we see is again patients feel it's usually easier to give just like a short diary in the end of the day than out like questionnaire. And because the first months after the shot is very critical for them to have like a new crisis, so we want to see how we can better identify this in patients. And just like one other thing is like, so this is all these different data types that we are collecting, but as you also We are collecting, but as you also know, and we discussed a little bit about this, it's not very easy to combine all these different data types because, as you can see here already, it's like different data that is different at different times. Some is 24-7, some is like once a week, then there's a lot of missingness patterns. So, we really like try to find good ways of how to combine it because for us, it is really and it is like that is the complexity. That is the complexity, but also, yeah, the really big challenge actually in psychiatry and psychology is like it's very multi-dimensional. It's like when we look at one indicators, it's very difficult to indicate really changes of behavior or risk in individuals. So we need to combine different data types to have a more holistic picture of the patient. But then, of course, it's associated with a lot of challenges. So we look, right now, for example, combining them, we work a lot on the Combine and then we look, we work a lot on this transformer models, and we also just cast them together. And then I just wanted to do I just have a minute? And then I just wanted to say because I think what is like really important in that field, at least like from my perspective, is really not only a very big interdisciplinary collaboration, but also. Interdisciplinary collaboration, but also with industry partners because they usually have a different access and also different overview of different innovations in the field. And I had the chance to like Google and Wellcome and NIH. They organized a very small meeting in New York a couple of, I think, a year ago, where they wanted us to advise them on new developments. But we also got a good But we also got a good view on what kind of new developments in digital health and digital applications Google has. And it was really interesting. We published two, one will be out in the next couple of weeks, but it's accepted, two papers on Dutch language models and also puzzle sensing, what kind of field should look. How the field should also work together, what kind of steps we would think that it can be really used, especially in the mental health community. And another thing is where we try to, where you see also challenges, but what we try to do, we also work a lot with like really like for example the NATO and also the UN to really build tools that are usable in even humanitarian settings. In humanitarian settings, and we built an application that we are currently deploying in war zones where we also combine different digital biomarkers, plus large language models, plus real-life chatbots for those who can work online and offline because also there are a lot of challenges, of course, in monitoring for things. But as another example of how we use those. Very impressive quality of yours. So thanks, Persia. I had a question about your study where you're trying to predict the course of PTSD. So you mentioned like in the four IM screen, I was a I think screener was a value to the workflow in getting a curate. I was wondering if you have any data on the taking cascadio or whatever. Yeah, so that's why, yeah, when we designed the study, we were talking also with leadership at DevOps at the time, so at Columbia, but now also at NYU, where we MOU, where we discuss how could it be designed that also providers could implement it and how could we integrate it in the EHR. That's why we focus on this question that every clinician in the way asks, which is like what happened? And we also only use the equipment that the providers use. We see that this is actually not as much a problem for providers. We thought more this could be a problem for patients. Is it could be a problem for patients because of privacy concerns? Because you know, you're answering it's an important question. And what we really see, and this is really funny, we already enrolled 300 patients in it. And so we're nearly done. And the patients, like we s we don't have like actually like the patients don't want to do it. When we can explain them how the data is saved, how is it pre processed Saved house and pre-processed slide protected. They usually don't refuse that. The only thing is, and this is like what I didn't discuss in more depth, is more the processing because we have patients, half of the face is bloody. Sorry for like it's like no, because they're like coming from a serious accident, or and this is more like the issue, so to how to process it, but like the data collection. To process it, but like the data collection actually and also like the compliance of providers and patients has not been issued more. How can we make sure the signal that we are receiving is a correct signal and not just outcomes? I don't think that analogies are there. So you mentioned the So you mentioned a lot of data there. I see one paper is about how to implement processing inventory. You mean like how we process the other modalities? Yeah. Yeah. So we have like we have the biggest challenges, and that's why I focus on it more, was like on the video and audio data because it's not. On the video and audio data, because it's not, they are also not necessarily previous work that really exactly. But we also see that, as also you guys also discussed, that we have the same issues that you just have other type of data, especially like password sensing. Yeah. Yeah, we can talk in Japanese. Two questions. Great work. The first question is from your experience, because now there is a lot of interest between being integrated digital health tools. Quite often this work is led by faculty, right? We get R1, U1, and then we integrate and then the system starts pushing back into logistics, etc. So, from your experience, From your experience, what was successful? What were the success stories and the non-success stories? What tools might look great on the surface, but probably never going to work out in the clinic and outside. My second question would be about kind of hospital indexed information collected during hard hospitalization and was discharge and information would be collected there and how this to emerge and Yeah, to your first question, it completely depends also on the infrastructure of your hospital, how far you can go. I'm very lucky at NYU Lango because not only in my discipline, but more actually in different disciplines, it's b that we have like a lot of digital tools that are really where the hospital is like open for implementing it into routine and test it out. Into routine care and test it out, how it works, how really providers deal with it, what are the issues. And so, for example, that's why for example for this study, and we have like future studies that are currently in the planning process where we directly work together with our IT, our informatics teams, different teams to really implement that already in team care and test it out how also these different data. Out how also these different data streams can be combined also in nearly real time be feedback to the provider and also the patient. To your question about after discharge, actually we have like this study planned where we, because I think like especially like the time after discharge or when they're not in the hospital system, it's a very critical time. We have studies underway where we also collect data there and try to again also feedback it back to the EHR systems to then feedback it back to the provider who can then intervene. But yeah, but this is just in the planning process right now. But this is the Right, great. So should we take a small break and then return fresh continuated brains? Yeah. They anticipated that we would be.  Oh, okay. I haven't asked for speakers. And probably covers all the stuff. I mean, do you think that there's any NPLO and the US? I mean, like, I think we also work on signals. So just killing that. Yeah, you know, I couldn't tell much. But I think that's why you may have to have a question. So like once I feel the paintings you go like every hour, but it's not just. How does it work? But I mean like I think I think like if that also I don't know how many means we know like folks on all labs or you distribute the labs. I mean some people aren't using the emotional. Ask him which one is bigger. I agree with you. I don't think you're like not really confident at all at the same time. I feel like maybe I think where I where I suppose to go with it is I I would be much more interested in trying to actually delegate to this one. The other papers that John was forwarded, they're not exactly the same. We have like a different vision. So some of those are like not books at all. Not code terms. Some of them appear on a website. And the ones that do appear in terms of not code here, talk to your JASA project. And I'm not saying I want to digitally to give it. What I would say is, I think if we flush out an outline, let's say things we're enthusiastic response. Then together the response we have a vision for this paper three match parts without being able to pass automatically for the most time. But if you see even if like for each even if he sees the outline, he's like, I like this, I think we're going to have the travels quite not the But keep it in mind that anything you write is going to have to do something processed, get a little early feedback from the editor of the normal here. But that's like a whole game to what you want. I mean, I feel like the playground doesn't feel sort of out here not well. Well, and this is like I would like I wouldn't put everything else like VSIM clip. Yeah. I mean, I would like, whatever, we might just completely change the mind of the mind, no matter what. I will say like in the meetings that we've had with the this kind of thing, more so discourse. That makes me feel better. This is why I don't think. This is why I don't think I should have to allow issues. I think right now, but it's more likely both. Yeah, that's why I find it's more likely because we're probably depending on your spectrum. Because we probably did not have to talk, anyway, we're talking about a change. I think I'm in here. I think I'll use it. I don't think so. I think I'll say something because it works for me. I think we could say, like, Yeah, we're gonna hear. Sounds like when he was like, I want to do it for people in the next one. What's the response to each? Second response is how do we work in like math and then we'll be winning it together for that day? So let's see if you say the actual had the same thing basically. Have this thing basically. Like, that's the kind of stuff that makes those real signs on it. Again, I don't think he's saying he wants to watch it. I was thinking it was used, but it's not so secure. I think she's saying he hasn't. And look, we set up a frame collection. The second company probably wanted, right? But I think if we send them for everyone, it's like, all right, yeah, this is like close, but like important division, but I know it's paper, I'm not reading something. I can't remember what I know. I think that is just like, that's all I have to buy for. Yeah. Wait. Yeah, you want to make three questions. How much more can I use it total? Five to six months. I think he's like excited. Timeline is out there. But you were saying like a month. He's saying six months, right? I didn't say that. The other thing that like helped me government. My favorite thing here. For me, if he's like, he's the person who's not so that to me. That makes me like so much more excited about this paper than like, hey, we're going to do it. I have one. Yeah, we'll see. We'll see what happens. Yeah, yeah. It's circle banging. Yeah, it's like really like that. Waterfall, and then there was that we didn't slip shooting. We didn't slide. No, slides tried. There was another guy who was hipping out. Oh, yeah, yeah, I swear. How was it? Yeah. It was like. It was like a little bit soft, just like hard. Like, it was software to be more disconnected. Yeah, it was nice. Yeah, software. Yeah, that's much too much. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I can place this the external. Oh, you can work on it. Oh, you can worry. I'm going to care. I'm going to go ahead and do it. I'm going to go back to the path. Thank you for having me to finish. We got what we got, Lily. Chicron hated that. Painful. Painful. Yeah, tissue. That's not also painful. No, no, I think of the teacher, isn't it? Oh, yeah, I mean, it is sticky. No, he's gonna give it back one or something. Sure. I don't think Uh I think your method could be directly to polysomography sleep. So in many respects, like you have somewhat of an aligned time sign, not exactly. You like carves like lights on, lights off. But what you have is essentially each 30-second categorized, it's like one of five stops. Categorized one of five things. So, like, and that's a good random random people. So, it's very similar in the methodology. I don't know if it becomes super complex computationally or anything like that. And you don't have multiple days, right? Well, we do have multiple. We didn't account for that in the data clustering, but we also did week clustering. So then it was five days, or like week.
