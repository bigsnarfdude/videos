So yes, the title is about temporal pulse replication. So before I get into any equations, let me show you what I'm turned back. So here are the numerics that sort of began this project here. So I think maybe this is pretty familiar. So I think maybe this is pretty familiar to all of us who've seen these types of before, but I'm starting off with one pulse right here. You see this primary excursion. And what's happening is just over time we're evolving, we're taking up more peaks like this. And so that in and of itself is not necessarily unique or something that we've never seen before. But what is interesting is what this behavior is actually mitigating. Behavior is actually mitigating. So, I'll apologize in advance for how many times you're about to see Paul's name on my slides. This all sort of comes about from both his work when he's in my shoes as a Baron Massage Leds PhD student, a paper that they wrote in 2021. But these solutions, these profiles that you're seeing here are actually mimicking solutions in the delightfully named homoclinic that now. So, this is a parametric. So, this is a parametric family of solutions that fits your model equations, beginning with these one pulses and ending with two pulses. Well, that later they end with two pulses and two pulses. So, sort of the central question that we're interested in is why exactly are we tracing out this purely parametric phenomenon of a dynamic So, the talk is going to consist of about three parts. So, first, I would like to go over the construction of this home plant banana, some of the details of that relevant seed going forward. Next, I want to talk about that paper from 2021, which talked about the stability of these pulses as we go along this panel. And spoiler alert is that if you were hoping that they were sort of all stable and that there were sort of very natural explanations. And that they're a sort of very natural explanation for whatever's standing close to them. That, in fact, is very much not the case. They are actually very severely unstable. And then sort of finally, I'll talk about sort of the small directions that we take to try to understand this. Very much stuff working on this. This is most of my work here. So, just to sort of fix ideas, we've talked Sort of fix ideas. We've talked a lot about fixing Krumman equation today. This is the working with. When we're talking about these pulse solutions, the way that we look for them is to go traveling the onset for them as whole government solutions to these. And because it's the last talk of the day, I take the opposite convention that Paul and Jorn took in there at the different uh lectures, just to keep everybody on their toes. And so this is the resulting And so, this is the resulting system. Here, of course, exists the vast weather system. So, our particular problem has all the critical manifold structure. So, you know, looking back on those equations, we know that our variable b needs to be zero, and that we've got this cubic critical manifold as well. Critical manifold as well. So that manifold can again be divided into a left and a center and a right part. And like it was touched on earlier, again, because we're just touched on earlier. This manifold, in our case, because we've taken this opposite convention, the center portion is sort of purely normally repellent, but the left and right portions are Probably a little bit of unnecessary details, but just writing that down explicitly, so looking at the fast subsystem here, you can opiate that stability. And I think this is just nice because it's easy to see that these two points dividing our manifold three here are full points. You can see determinant of the Jacobian. It will Uh it will serve precisely. So these two parts here, because they're the saddle type, we have a slow drain on the one. So that's going to be one part you get for this trend. Uh the next portion is, again, something that's already covered, so I won't spend too much time on it, but we've got these jumps in a fast subsystem. These are kind of fast subsystem. These are heterochronic uh connections, which are basically allowing us to move from this left branch to the right branch back again. And so this, sort of putting that all together, is how all of these pulses in the entire family form start. We begin over here, and then we jump over, travel up, you know, you pen fold, we jump back, and then we come back down. So again, you notice all of this solution. So, again, you notice all of those solutions, they're initial excursion. Where things begin to get more interesting is what happens after you make that primary excursion. So, after that, the solutions actually are organized by NAR.NS and origin, and you spend a little bit of time drifting along that center portion before eventually jumping on a fast connection and And based on the height that you jump, how long you spend along that middle portion, that tells you whether you're looking at a one pulse or a two pulse. So just a brief summary of what the result looks like in this case. So this summary is taken from the fun paper because this is most of the details that we're going to need. So for each So for each 0 less than dana less than 4, and each sufficiently small epsilon greater than 0, we've got this one parameter family of travel pulses. So it parametrized S here. And it's nice and smooth, and this S and epsilon. And so when S is small, this is sort of the beginning of our transition. This is my first one pulses. And then as I increase S, which is really Increase S, which is really faithful because if you jump off in that direction, eventually you wind up with these double masses. And sort of what we might expect, because the secondary excursion is organized by these canard dynamics, the values of the parameters for each of these pulses are actually exponentially close to some sort of critical values. One of that is not particularly important, but this is. particularly important. But this is one reason why it sort of makes sense that um we might see the temporal dynamics following if everything is happening almost at the same value of the parameters. So it is sort of in a sense permissible that we can follow along the temporary even though we're not touching the parameters at any point, as long as we start reasonably close to the template. And so these, what I'm about to show you are going to be some of the numerics of the transition. Again, this is not the temporal dynamics. This is the parametric, you know, the original homeless of the data. The solutions are going to be shown in blue. And then there will be a derivative of the solution with respect to the length parameter S. Our dynamics here, and you can sort of see that from the oscillatory tail we're growing this section. And just some interesting sort of points of analysis, something that we're hoping to get into in the future. You can see that the, you know, the derivative with respect to the arc length is kind of split into two portions. So there's a couple length working that really to get a better idea of the feature. And also, of course, you can see the bicarbonation diagram. So, of course, you can see them by rotation by that. I'll frequently, colloquially call this like the stem back button and message while we're talking. That's what I'm referring to. So that was sort of the basics of the construction of everything, and this is where we begin to get into the bad news. So we want to talk about the stability of as we go up this backbone of the banana here, what exactly is happening to the spectrum of our solutions. Of our solutions. And this is actually referring to point spectrum specifically. And what you're seeing is that this point spectrum is actually reaching into the right half plane. And the first bit of bad news is that it's not reaching over in a way that's small in epsilon. This is actually a little bit long excursion here. And the really bad news is that the number of eigenvalues that's accumulating on this region that's quite happening is actually the order of one over ursene. So not only do we have unstable directions, we have um you know We have, you know, an unbounded amount of session. So I want to emphasize that this is not just a summary of the proof, but I'd like to give a little bit of the intuition for why you might expect this kind of thing. So the first ingredient is something that I've already talked about. It's that the solution, sort of go to the job. The solution. So we're going to jump to either to the left or to the right at some height related to S. So we're bringing this figure back again. Everybody, once you make your primary excursion, you're going to go along this center direction for some amount of time. You're going to go this way. And because we're traveling along the center portion of the critical. Along the center portion of the critical manifold, we're drifting, and so the amount of time that we spend long there is on the order of one graph. Okay? So putting those two points together, if you have any eigenfunction that has support basically along this local here, but support along the center portion of the manifold. So basically it has its support wherever the solutions have their support corresponding. Their support corresponding to these functions. Any eigenfunctions with support there are essentially solving a boundary value problem with a domain of size, no, on the order of correct. So here's where the bad news begins to come to us, is that the spectra of an operator on a domain of this size, as epsilon tends to zero, accumulates on the absolute spectrum of the operator. Expect from a shop. Something that my advisor and Arn proved previously. Again, this is a little bit of an informal statement. You can sometimes escape this if you have periodic boundary conditions, but we're talking about separated boundary conditions here. I don't know what it means to say something is bad news, but bad news. I don't know. Yeah, that's so that's a fair point. So what we would hope, right, because we're sort of mimicking this transition, right? Making this transition, like maybe overall stable in some sense, you a little bit easier to imagine how it would be attractive to them and follow as they go up this back button. But when, you know, because these solutions are not just unstable, they have this many unstable directions, it's a little bit more difficult to sort of accurate analysis how this transition is occurring. Maybe not bad news, but part of the challenge. This whole talk is a little bit part of the challenge. So anyways, yeah, and I think many people in this room, potentially all of you, are familiar with what the absolute spectrum is, but just in case you're not, we discussed the essential spectrum. We discussed the essential spectrum a little bit earlier, and the absolute spectrum is calculated very simply. We're taking our eigenvalue problem for our PE, we're writing it as a system of OEs, and we're allowing our variable to tend to plus or minus the 50. Whereas, however, where the essential spectrum of these problems is typically characterized by having like some spatial heigenomy of that matrix on the imaginary axis. Of that matrix on the imaginary axis, the absolute spectrum is characterized by some pair of those eigenvalues at the same pair of points. And so the intuition for that can be a little bit tricky to nail down. But essentially, one way to think about it is that with the appropriate exponential weight for your problem, you could shift these eigenvalues onto the imaginary axis, right? And because we're talking about a finite length domain, right, adding an exponential weight doesn't actually, it gives you an equivalent norm. So in some, again, sort of a poetic sense, there's not a way to temper the problem to tell which norm is the correct one. And so the absolute spectrum is basically the case where you can't actually use an exponential way. we use an exponential weight to get this kind of that's the one that uh becomes apparent by high but large problems but anyways that's you know neither here nor there for us the problem for us is that the absolute spectrum that you see as you travel along the center part of the domain has this ordered one discursion into it. Order one excursion into the travel up the center manifold, you're seeing this excursion, and because of the results that I alluded to, you're accumulating eigenvalues onto that. And these are not, you know, this result sort of comes up in the context of this observation, but in this case, these really are eigenvalue solutions. They are point spectrums and so on. So that's sort of the final painting here we cover here. That's sort of everything prelude. These are the facts that were known and this is sort of where I came into this project. And so at this point we're looking for a way to make progress. For a way to make progress on understanding why in fact at a high level, suppose that we're considering some solutions to fix HUMO of this form. So this gamma sub epsilon, this is the value, this is the homoclinic banana given some fixed value of epsilon. On. S is referring to that same parameter that we have before, which tells you if this is along. But we're going to, in this particular onslaught, we're going to allow this S to vary back. And then, of course, we've got our remainder term for your V, and this variable Y is just so we're interested in a few things. One, we would like to determine the speed of travel, ds, dt, belonging, along the lane line. So, one thing that's interesting. So one thing that's interesting to note is that the speed seems to be also not particularly fast. This is again at an informal level, but there is the potential that there might be some multiple time scales occurring evenly. And then obviously, the million-dollar question: can we prove that these fall for some programme? Is it small? But is it small? Yeah, well yes, it it is. Well actually okay that's a fair point. No, we don't actually have a particular one in the computer I think this is supposed to be any discussion and no no that's a I mean that's a fair honestly that's a fair question. Kind of really explicitly not really Not really merely but again the million dollar question ideally is if you would be small at some points and build so sort of the overall approach that we are taking here. Um if you write this in your humo that OD not some bottom up space kind of thing very formally where you're just gonna take both arching practices. We might denote the values of the parameters, the ones that give you your prediction on the banana, by the star. And then you would want to plug in that on-site screen for the side, which would slide and expand. So again, this is all more of a formal calculation, but you know, here's what we would ultimately find. And if you assume that we also have Hilbert space structure, then you reject. Space structure, then you jet in some direction, and this is the ultimate position of the function. So, the idea, and what we've been mostly working on during my thesis so far, is we would like to find some P or some set of projections P which is going to give us an appropriate small scale or finite dimensional model that would hopefully be sit at the scene. This has pre-communicated. Uh this has proved challenging. It's not really clear um which projection p is going to simplify this, even at the formal part, enough to get an appropriate uh system of the piece. Thought a little bit about like spectral projections, which would allow you to do something with this here. Um like to you know have some projection that is a little bit related to D. Is a little bit related to DS. Um just going back to the animation read um but if you recall from that animation, there seem to be some similarities between the sort of the DUDX, which represents the translation symmetry, and also DUDS, which is an approximate Which is an approximate symmetry given that A and C are varying in this estimate region. So we're hoping that you can take advantage of that. But so far, the appropriate finite dimensional model is we also attempted what I would call taking the bifurcation diagram literally. I think I'm going to raise it as well. I'll do it the academic way. So essentially the first thing that we tried before we even went into projections had some dynamics and we essentially allowed this axis to be invariant as long as our small parameter is zero. And so this basically, this V represents the deviations away from the V banana. Again, highly simple. Would be an banana again highly simplified. And then, as you go along, you know, as we all as you drift up this direction, the attraction of the axis changes. So down here, we would be stable. In the middle, unstable again would represent that order one excursion to the right-hand plane. And then towards the top, we would be stable. Again, that's actually a little bit of a simplification from the folder problem, because it's known that these two pulses have at least one unstable direction. We can't say the direction. But again, just trying to get started. And actually, to our surprise, it turns out that we can't even observe a similar behavior. So I think that's all that I have. So thank you for your attention. Okay, questions? But again, this is just how much of the stable paraphrase you have in there. Because yeah, the cana arts with the heads should be more stable than the maximum can article, what I picked up correctly. So we've got this picture, you know. Yeah, I yeah, I think I don't know which picture. Is it this picture? That one. This one we try. So one is not too bad, two is worse, three is the worst, and four is getting better, and five is getting better, or the sun is better. So actually, I think there was a reason that I went to this other picture to me, as well. So again, this sort of height roughly corresponds to X, which is how far along. To pass, which is how far along that critical threshold. So, along sort of when you get up to the middle, roughly, but that's a center portion, that's when the excursion is at its worst, and then it's actually symmetric without that better. So, that's really it's getting better, right? Yeah, okay, so that's that's exactly. on this metaphor. So so first s so maybe on on that pessimism are they twenty years ago I asked Jens to understand a transfer transfer and Jens thought of a home. He did not understand that this is not always speaking. And it's a good problem. But when we looked at this, it seems like these pulses, like in the beginning this is slow. In the beginning this is slow, but the actual notification, like the whole excursion on that stem of your banana, that doesn't slow. Is that actually slow dynamically? As in like how fast it drifts off in direct similar function. It's been a while since I've actually I remember like we discussed this, but maybe my map. The other question I had, sort of this absolute spectrum hanging around S. So that is that destabilizer somewhere on that middle branch. Because there's like this long piece of the banana. When does the absolute spectrum? All these icons, when do they start passing? Is the first one right at the edge at the bottom seven? No, actually, so this is again yeah, this is why I find news of the same patients. You do have to go a little bit up the The diamond with then you have basically a hub bifurcation, right? I know that, you know, there's also, I mean, as each of these is crossing over into the right half line, you have like a whole series of saddle frictions. The the horizontal axis is like the real axis, and the vertical is the Like the real axis, and the vertical is the additional length of all the real axis. They're all real. So yeah, they're they're actually not hops, they're it's a series. Then they become complex, right? No, they do, that would that face mean. Well, I mean, I put off the voting on the internet, which is more likely I know they do all cost and everything. This paper specifically looked at open apps to spectrum, right? So that was sort of like that was told. But it's worth pointing out, I mean, you're not looking for every single item that I've got in the point spectrum here, but the I like you was just to assemble. Here was the kind of idea was just to establish this instance of the act that actually suffices just a little bit. In some sense, this is like transient dynamics, right? So it's finite time transient things to pick up a piles. So this is within the reach of our techniques different. Different, right? Yeah. Yeah, um, so I mean, that's kind of the thing, right? So this at the end here, I'm not sure if this is within the reach of the thing, right? I mean, this is sort of a difficult, I don't want to put cardboard forward, but it won't be for free projections to find the fine-dimensional models. Um, certainly I think the part that puts it within the scope of this talk is the construction right there. It's not ethicism, it's just honest answers I think. Maybe just one last thing. Just related to that. So you still keep this formal, but in terms of which kind of spaces you would use here, right? So this is also really looking actually for the potentially right colour for the spaces. Yeah, yeah. There are a lot there are a lot of unplayers for such. I think that's that's what makes it a tricky problem, but it is also what makes it an interesting problem. But do you have any idea that regularity related? Like how would you take this? Yeah, I'm not answering that. And then we have a discussion by challenge. So, thanks again to all the speakers of this.
