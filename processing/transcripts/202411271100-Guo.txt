All right, okay. So can you see my screen? Yes, yes, yes. Thanks for the invitation and thanks for the organizer. Sorry that there is some visa issue, so I'm not able to attend the conference in person. But let me deliver my talk virtually. So the talk is based on some works joint with Some works joint with Ramah Roni, Eddie Berger, and Daniel Kotler from Isa Real. So, don't worry if you do not understand anything about matrix. We'll give the basic definition. So, let's start with the basic definition of hypergraph. So, to make the thing simple, to use the notation, we just identify the hypergraph with its edge side. Is edge side so a hypergraph is just a collection of subsides of some vertex side V, so that is a hypergraph. And we can also talk about the induced sub hypergraph of some hypergraph. For example, if you have a hypergraph H on the vertex set V and you have a vertex subset U, then the induced subhypergraph of H on U is just all the edges. On U is just all the edges of H, which is contained in the vertex subset U. So that is the induced sub-apprograph. And we can also see the rank of some vertex subset. That is just the maximum size of the edges in U-induced sub-hypergraph on the vertex side. And we can also define the runoff hypergraph, which is just the maximum size of an edge in your hypergraph. In your hypergraph. So that is the basic definition of hypergraph. And a special kind of hypergraph is what we call abstract simplicial complex. And we also name it complex. So a hypergraph is a complex if it is closed under taking subsidies. So it means if you have an edge E is in your complex, then any subset of E. Then, any subset of E is also continuous in your hypergraph. So, such kind of hypergraph is called complex. And here are some examples of the complex. For example, if you have a graph G, then you know that the collection of all the input side, which we denote by IG, on the vertex side of G, they form a complex because any subset of an input side is also an. Set of an input set is also an input set. And another simple example is the matching complex of a graph G. So this time the matching complex is on the edge side of G. That is the collection of all the matchings in your graph G. So because any subset of a matching is a matching, therefore it is a context. So here, a basic definition of a context. And furthermore, special And for the more special kind of complex is called matrix. So, what is a metroid? It is a complex. And to avoid some trivial case, we assume that the complex is not empty, which means the empty side is new complex. And furthermore, it satisfies one more condition, which is called the independence augmenting property. So, if you have two edges, see S and P in the complex I. In the complex I, and the size of i is strictly less than the size of T, then you can find that vertex V that is in T minus I such that I's union with V is also an edge in your convex M. So if a convex M satisfies such property, it is called a matrix. And for example, you can quickly check that if you have a matrix. side if you have a matri and induced on some vertex subside then it is a matrix so that is called a submitroid and one more example of matrix is the following example and it helps explain what is the meaning of the infancy augmenting property so consider the following matrix so that your vertex side is some finite field some vector space over finite field Our finite field, and the edges are just a collection of all the linearly independent vectors. So, that if you have a set of linearly infinite vectors, the s and another set of linearly infinite vector t, and the size of s is less than the size of t, then you can find a vector that is not spanned by the vector in your s. So that's why it's called the independence augmenting property. Independence augmenting property. So, such a collection of linearly independent vectors, they form a matrix. So, there are many, so you can see the connection of matrix with linear algebra. If you are interested in set theory, here is another type of matrix, which is called partition matrix. So, assume you have set V and you have some partition, partition the side. Some partition partition sign into V1 up to V8, they are disjoint. Then I change you partition matrix if and only if it intersects each part at most ones. So you can check that such under such definition, the P is a matrix because if you have set Ice, which has set less than T and satisfy this condition, then it means your T must intersect with some part. intersect with some part that u s does not intersect therefore you can add that element into s which still satisfies this condition therefore this uh partition therefore we verify it's a matrix and we call it partition matrix and similarly we can have some generalized partition matrix so this time you have some partition and some numbers some positive integers say p. Positive integers, say p1 up to p8, such that an igcli if and only if the size of i's intersecting each part is not just one, but pi times. And you can also check that under such definition, this is a matrix, which we call the generalized partition matrix, because the intersection of each part is not one. So here are some, here we know the definition of matrix. Is there any question about the definition of which way? All right, so if not, we can move on. So what is the connection between a complex and metroid? Because we know a metroid is a special complex. But on the other way, maybe we can write a complex as the intersection of metroid. So, what does it mean? Section of mid-trains. What does it mean? For example, we introduce the matching complex, which is this collection of all the matchings. So assume we have a bipartite graph G on two sides X and Y, then we can actually write the matching complex of G as intersection of two partition matrix. So the partition matrix are made by the following. So one partition matrix has the part side. The part side, all the edges incident to each vertex in one side, and another partition metric is all the edges incident to each vertex in another side. And you can see that if you have a matching, then it is incident to each vertex at most once. So that is in the intersection of these two matrix, right? It's incident with this part at most once. With this part at most once, and each vertex on this part at most once. Therefore, you can write this complex as intersection of two matrix. And generally, we prove that for any complex on n vertex side, you can write it as an intersection of, say, two to the n many, not just matrix, but you can even write it as intersection of two to the n generalized partition matrix. And actually, And actually, this exponentially many is not too bad because we also gave an example showing that there is this complex such that if you want to write it as an intersection of some matrix, then you must need this exponentially mundane matrix to write it as intersection. Another property we want to study about Property we want to study about a complex is called the chromatic number. So, before I give you the definition of chromatic number of complex, so let me remind you the classic definition of chromatic number of a graph. So, recall that the chromatic number of a graph is just the mean number of the input side of a graph G, such that their union is equal to the vertex side of G. So another, if you will it in another way, you can validate like that, you give each vertex a list of colors, say 1 to k, and you want to choose one color for each vertex such that all the vertices receive a same color from an infant side. So that is a chromatic number. And there is another. And there is another definition which is called the list chromatic number. So, at this time, you also give each vertex a list, but these lists are not the same for each vertex. And you only have the control on the size of list. So the list crew number is just the minimum number k, such that if you give each vertex a list of size k, then you can choose a color from. A color from the list of each vertex, such that the set of vertices that receive the same color for my input side. If you can do it for all the colors, then it is a proper list coloring. So as I have explained, if you give all the vertex the same color list, you can see that the crew-n number is just a lower bound of the least creme. Just a lower bound of the least chromatic number. That's some classical results, even for the complete bipartite graph, because we know a bipartite graph has chromatic number two. But even for such graph, the least chromatic number of case three is greater than two, and the gap between the least creme number and creme number can be arbitrarily large. So, here is some classical result by Erdos in the 1970s. In the 1970s. And okay, so that's the definition of Chromium number of a graph. So we can then move on to define what is the cremain number of a complex. So this time we just replace this independence complex by any complex. So the chromatin number of a complex is just the mean number of side in a complex, such that their union is equal to the vertex set of c. And Edmonds in 1965 proved that if you have matrix, then the Chromat number is equal to this delta R, the ceiling of the delta R. So what is delta R? That is the maximum. You take subside over all the vertex side. That is the size of I s divided by the rank of S. Recall that the rank of S is just the maximum size. The maximum size of edges in US. So it's easy to see that this is the lower bound because if you have many edges that cover all the vertex side, then if you induce on the ice, each edge has size at most this one. Therefore, to cover so many vertices, you really need this many of edges. So you can see that it's a lower bottom. So you can see that it's a lower bound and Edmonds proves that it's also an upper bound. And naturally, you can define what is a list from my number of complex. So this time, you give a list that is a minimum number k such that you give any list of colors, each outside k. You are able to choose one color from the One color from the list of each vertex, such that for every color, the set of vertices receives the same color from H in U contact C. So that is the definition of least Chromeband number. And in 1988, he proved that for a matrix, actually this time the least Chromeband number is just equal to the Chromebook number. Is just equal to the current number, not like the graph case, the independence context of graph case. And is there any question about the definition of command number? If not, I will tell you some conjecture in the command number. So actually, So actually, Aharona and Berger conjecture that for any two matrix M and N, the creme number of the intersection of two matrix is at most the maximum of the creme number and plus one. So first you can see that this is a trivial lower bound because if you can cover all the vertex side. Vertex side of these two use the edges in both of them, then you can cover all the vertexes using the same edges. Therefore, this is the lower bound. And they also have some example showing that even for the case side, crewman number of n equal to cremate number of n equal to 2, their crew man number of the intersection of them can be 3. Therefore, this plus 1 is really necessary. This conjecture is still open and we only know some cases that the conjecture is true. For example, the fierce edge coloring theorem states that if you have two partition matrix, M and N, then the Chromat number of M intersect is N equal to the maximum of them, because because edge coloring theorem says that this one is actually equal to the edge chromatic number. And you can check that this one is actually equal to the maximum degree. Recall what we have introduced before, the intersectional matching, the matching complexity is equal to the intersectional two partition matrix. And the recently we proved that if you have two prove that if you have two generalized partition matrix actually the equality also uh equality also hold and for the general matrix case uh ron and burger in 2008 uh 2006 they prove that when in two matrix m and n the chromat number of the intersection is at most twice the maximum of the chromat number of each of them and recently we improved this And recently, we improved this two-factor by this addition relation. We proved that if you have two matrix, then the Krumman number of the intersection of them is actually at most the sum of them. Here are some results about the conjecture and result regarding the Cro-Man number. And there are also some conjecture and result about the least Cro-Man number. So here, the conjecture is still open. The conjecture is still open, that is, by Caroli and Bertie etiel. They make the conjecture that if you have any two arbitrary metroid M and N on the same ground side, then they conjecture that the least chromatic number of the intersection is equal to the Chromium number of intersection. Here are some results in regard related to this conjecture. The first one is the famous Go and Is the famous Gowens result who proved the conjecture by Dennis? He proves that for any two partition matrix, the least chromatic number of the intersection of the two matrix is equal to the chromatic number of the intersection of matrix. So if you use the graph theory language, it says that the least edge cremat number of a bipartite graph is equal to the edge crematic number of bipartisan graph. To the edge permanent number by paragraph. And the proof is so beautiful. So the proof shows up in the book, or the proofs from the book. So recently we extended result by showing that if you have two generalized partition matrix, then the least chromatic number of intersection is also equal to the least creme number of, is also equal to the cremator number of intersection. They also make up a Vicker conjecture. They ask that if there exists some universal constant L such that any two matrix, the least chromatic number of the intersectional two matrix is at most L times the Chromium number. And we prove this conjecture by showing that if you convex C is intersection of not just the two matrix, but we allow. Two matrix, but we allow it for arbitrary k matrix, then the least chromatic number of your complex is at most k times the chromat number of the complex. So in their case, you can choose k equal to 2. So that is the main result I want to mention. Is there any question about this part? All right, so if not, I will briefly discuss the tools we use to prove this conjecture, to prove this result. That is the least Cromwell number of intersectional k matrices and also k times the crohn number of eight. So the first concept we need to know is cause the connectivity of a complex. So here's Of a complex. So here is the homotopic connectivity. So if you have a complex C, the intuitive definition of the connectivity is that the connectivity is just the minimum dimension K that you can find a hole in your complex C. A more serious definition is that if you have some simplification map from the sphere as k minus one to C, you cannot extend it. You cannot extend it continuously to a disk to see. And it's okay if you do not have a good feeling about this definition of connectivity. And it's enough for you to know this example, these examples. So first of all, the connectivity equal to zero if and only if your complex is empty complex. Connectivity equal to one if and only if To one, if and only if your compact is not empty and is not path connected. Because if it's not path connected, you have two connected components, you put one point in one connect component and you choose another point in another connect component. You cannot find a path to connect them, right? Therefore, your S0 cannot be extended to a B1 because S0 is 2.5. Because S0 is two points, P1 is a length, right? So that's why the connectivity of this case is one. And generally, if you have the complex all the subset of 2 to the V, all the subset of V, and you remove the biggest simple X, then you know that you only have the sphere. You cannot extend the sphere into a disk, into a ball. Therefore, the connectivity on this one is just the size of V. This one is just the sets of v minus one. But if you have all the subsets of v, then your complex is contractible, therefore, the connectivity is infinity. And also, there are some related homological connectivity which we can skip. And a good thing about this connectivity is that in one operation, you can sum up the connectivity. That is called the joint of operation. That is called the joint operation. So, if you have a complex, two complexes, C and D, the joint of them is that you make a disjoint copy of the vertex set of them. And the joint contains all the edges that exist from the union of I's with union with T, where S is an edge of C and T is an edge of D. And in this case, you know, the connectivity satisfies this subaddivity. This sub additivity relation, the joint is at least the sum of connectivity of each of them. And another tool we want to use is the topological Haus theorem. So let me first remind you of the Haus theorem in graph theory. So the Haus theorem says that if you have a bipartite graph G, there is a matching from X to Y, if and only if the size of neighbor of every subside. Of neighbor of every subset is at least the size of i, is at least the size of it. And there is a natural definition, a natural generalization of matching, which is called the d-transversal. So assume we have a complex D on a collection of vertex subset of D, say V1 up to Vn. A D-transversal is that you choose one element from each vertex side. Side. And all the n vertices you choose is an edge in D. So if you have such trace, then it is a D transversal. So for example, when D is a matching convex, and when this Vi is all the edges incident to a vertex I, then you can check that D transversal is just a matching, right? And because D transversal. And because D-transversal can be complicated, we can only expect some sufficient condition. So here is some sufficient condition, which is called the topological Hall theorem by Aharone and Hexiel. The sufficient condition is the following. So if you have a complex D and a collection of vertex subset D, then a sufficient condition for the existence of a D transversal is the following. For any index subset, For any index subset of N, the union of those Vi and the D induced on 8 is connected to at least a set of I. So if it satisfies this condition, then it has a D transversal. So that is a key K2 for us to prove our Mann theorem. So there are some previous results. What we really What we really need to prove, if we want to prove the least creme number of intersection of k matrix, is almost a k times the cremator. Together with some other result, what we really need to prove is that we need to prove the cremator of c is at most, is at most this delta eta of c, where delta eta is defined as. As you take the maximum over all the subset of C, all the subsets of C, you take the maximum of the size of S divided by the connectivity of the sub sub complex. Let me prove this result in one picture. We will finish it. So we need to prove that we need to prove that if the site If the size of the list is equal to this number for every vertex, then you should choose one color for each vertex such that all the vertices receive same color from an edge in C. So let me prove it in one picture. So assume this is all your vertices of C and assume V1 has three colors, C, C1, C2, C2. Colors C1, C2, C3, you make one copy of V1 of it. And assume V2 has these three copies, you make three copies of them. And you give the true analysis. So you take the dual analysis, that you come back at D. And for each week for each VI, V V I, it forms a subset. Vi, it forms a subset of UVD. So that is all the copies of U vertex VI. Therefore, you know the size of this one is equal to this one. And if you can find the D transversal, then you actually pick one color for each vertex. And all the vertex receiving the same color, they form a context in the C. And then you're going to be done. So you only need to check the topological health condition. The topological Hall condition holds for this complex D, and actually it holds. Okay, so that is the one-page proof. So, as a summary of this talk, we introduce what is a Chromatic number of a complex and what is the least Chromian number of a complex. We prove that if your complex is the intersection of K matrix, then the least Chromian number of your complex is at most K times the Chromium number of E complex. So the proof applies the topological Haus theorem and it also shows some conjecture by Curley and Bertie. Let me stop here. Thank you. Any questions for her? No question.
