Thank you. So I'm happy to be here and I would like to thank the organizers, especially Adrian, for kind invitation. Actually, I attended the first conference. This should be the fourth time. But the first three times are all online due to the COVID. So eventually I'm here. Okay, so I'm very super excited to be here. And today I would like to talk about some free boundary problems. Some free boundary problems. Basically, our goal is to show you some story how we construct some reaction diffusion system to give some to approximate some free boundary problem. And during this process, we can give some biological modeling meaning for the parameter in the free boundary conditions. So let's start with our talk. And this talk is based on joint works with. Talk is based on joint works with Professor Itzihara and Professor Momobe from Japan. Okay, so let's start with a model proposed by Professor Ikongdu and Tsugui Lin. In 2010, they proposed a free boundary problem to study the spreading of single species. And basically, here u is a function of t and x, and it satisfies the feature-KPP equation. The feature KPP equation. And here we can see the X is they use H of T, which is unknown, so-called the free boundary, to measure their territory size. So what they want to say is you can imagine that there is X and T and here is X equals to H of T and the territory of the species is here. And uh they just want to um focus on the Fox on the bad species spread to the right, so they put a normal boundary here. And here, they put a zero-dirit-late boundary. Here is the u equal to zero because they assume the species are vulnerable when they spread to the right. And to control this reboundary, they propose the they use the Stefan condition. The Stefan condition. Okay, so this is 1.1, and compared to classical Cauchy problems, in 1.2, the feature-KPP equation is defined in the whole space. No matter how small the initial data, in 1.2, the solution always spreads. More precisely, it's converges to a traveling wave solution with some shift. Wave solution with some shift. But however, in 1.1, they actually have so-called spread-in-finish dichotomy. So the solution of 1.1 either spread in successfully or vanish eventually in the sense that spreading means the free boundary can tend to infinity and the u tend to the current capacity locally uniformly in space. Or vanishing means the or vanishing means they couldn't always so their eventual territory size is finite and u the solution u will tends to zero by out eventually so this is a different part but however uh for 1.1 when spreading occur the solution will also converge to the corresponding charging wave but this charging wave usually calls the semi-wave because the um the Because the free boundary condition and the deletion boundary curvature to make the turbine wave for 1.1 is only defined in the half space. It's a little bit different from the classical one. Okay, so our question is what exactly the uh this uh parameter means. So may i i it's uh in some sense it shows the species tendency. Shows the species tendency to spread to the right. So the classical steven condition, like ice melting problem, so it's we know this steven condition comes from the physical problem. But somehow, biologically, we may need the explanation for the parameter mu. So in this paper, Mountain Dew Crosshealthy, they assume the species Assume the species suffer some population loss during their spreading. So it turns out that they show that mu can be represented by diffusion over some constant k. This k is used to measure the population loss. Okay, so our goal is maybe we can have some more understanding about k or Understanding about K or this mu. So it's our goal. And another, so there are so many related work. Sorry, I can just list some of them. So another work is Professor Jong-Sen-Guo and myself. We generalize the idea of the model of UNEV. We just consider one more species inside. So we consider UNV, which is this is a competition model. Uh this is a competition model. So here uh the two species they uh live together here and they compete with each other but somehow there is only one moving boundary here. So that means they share the same territory. Okay, so here we propose the steven-like condition to measure how the free vibe. To measure how the free boundary move. So, this model is a little bit weird because they compete inside the territory, but somehow they are cooperating to obtain their territory because these two turns are the same sign, have the same sign. So, why they share the same territory? That was the question that we couldn't answer. Yeah, so if we actually if we follow the Bounty Du and Karakovsky idea, maybe we will get we have two species. We will get two movie boundary. Each species has the different movie boundary. Yeah, so it could make sense more. So in that case, we have some work about this, but today we want to, so today we are not going to talk about the case that To talk about the case that two moving boundary case, but we want to create some story to show you the meaning of mu1 and mu2. Yeah, that's our goal. So, how to do that? So, question is how can we find some suitable reaction diffusion system to approximate this problem? So, uh we try to uh introduce some multiple species which can live together. Which can live together, and here is the interface major territory, and outside there are some other species we don't know. So after we introduce the competition effect, the intervase, the free boundary, could expand or shrink. That depends the interaction between these multiple species and the species living outside. Species living outside. So, this is called, this is basically motivated by the work of Hillhorst, Ida, Niura, and Nyumiya in 2001. So, it's called the spatial segregation limit. So, we put the small parameter into the system and the take limit. Ten like small parameter tends to zero, then the limiting process limiting uh system would become uh free boundary problem. Free boundary problem. And after that, we can get some meaning of the parameter in the free boundary condition. Okay, so our story is that we consider a very large domain omega bounded in R capital N. And inside this domain, we have N plus 1, small N plus 1 species. Here is the U one, U two to U N. Okay. To UN. Okay, so the black double arrow here stands for the interaction between n species. So it could be competitive, it could be cooperative, and predatory prey is okay, it doesn't matter. But somehow here, the yellow arrows means very strong competition between UI and the direct. So, what we want to do is So, what we want to do is like this is U1, this is U2, this is U3. And the W should live outside. And then, because their competition is very, very strong, so they would have interface between them. So, this is why we want to do. Okay, so this is our model. So, P epson is our model. So, without any interaction, you just drop this term. So, they just said. This turn. So they just satisfy the simple reaction diffusion equation like the feature-KPP equation. And the blue turn here measures the interstific competition from the species UJ to species UI. And the red turn here is about the competition between the species UI and the W. So the yellow arrow, actually, we use these terms to These terms to describe here. So, here epsilon here, epsilon is a small parameter. So, the smaller the parameter epsilon, the stronger competition between UI and the W. Yeah. Okay. So, typically, if you consider UI, UJ are competing with each other, then we usually take the local We usually take the local bottle type computation model. So P epson will become quite familiar with us. This is a local bottle type model. And here we have epsilon, small epsilon to measure the competition between Ui and the W. And the beta I is the ratio of competition rates between UI and W. Alright, so put some suitable initial data, we can see the Initial data, we can see the P epson is well posed. And then we have for any epsilon, we have a solution U, I, epsilon, and W epsilon. So then we take epsilon tends to zero along a subsequence. Then we will see the limiting system actually will be a free boundary problem. So we have two cases. One is W can diffuse. It can diffuse, and the other case is W does not move. So, this case dw is zero. We will discuss this first. Alright, so idea is, yeah, standard PD approach. We need to do some energy estimate and then we can show that when epsil tends to zero, then the u epsilon v u u i epsilon w Ui epsilon, w epson will has limiting limits. So let's say u hat, ui hat, and w hat. And it should satisfy some integral equation in the weak sense. Then we take limits and then we try to get the strong form, which would have under some more smoothness condition, we can say that the solution is smooth, then we have the classical solution that satisfies. Classical solution that satisfies some free boundary problem. So, this is what we want to do. So, after some analysis, we have a linear function and we have this segregation property that means UIHA and the WHA cannot coexist. So, it's natural because when epsilon is pretty small, then the competition between Competition between UI and W is very very strong. Okay, so to get the strong form, we have to assume everything is very good. For example, initially the population is segregated. So we say that U, I stay here, living they are living here, and outside the W, W naught is uh uh satisfied uh it it Satisfy. Because the segregation assumption, so W naught is defined here, positive here, and zero here. Okay, so we assume there is an interface called gamma t initially. And if the gamma t is smooth, it moves smoothly without any singularity and it does not touch the boundary omega, then we can. Do a little bit of the analysis to separate the integral form into separate pieces, and we can again do the integration by par. Then we have some boundary term because of the we assume the gamma t appears. And then eventually we have this result. So these results just say that if the species species W does not move then the limit function WHA actually satisfies an ODE equation when we fix X and how about the U? UI will satisfy this computation model and in the on the free boundary UI vanishes. Vanishes. And how this moving boundary evolves in time is determined by this time. So V is normal velocity. Okay, so you can see beta and D, this is diffusion, this is ratio of the competition rate between UI and W, and W had WHA appears here. Yeah, so this allows us to say some story about the free boundary parameter in the free boundary condition. So if you consider cross-section, you can see the solution looks like this is W satisfies some ODE. And eventually W will test to its current capacity. And inside here, the free boundary will be expanded. will extend will be expanding because of this turn. Okay, this is first result. And second result is when W can move, dw is positive, then you can see here a little bit different. So the normal velocity does not appear in our limiting model. So that means the movement of the free Of the free boundary becomes implicit. So, in this case, numerical simulation shows that the blue region could shrink. Yeah, that depends the initial data and the parameter setting. Alright, so let's revisit. So, now we So now we can revisit the model proposed by Du and Lin. So we imagine that we have a strong competitor W outside the territory of U. Then after taking epsilon tends to zero, we have a Duane means model. But a little bit different is here. Okay? Yeah. So we basically can say Basically, we can say that their population loss is exactly this term. It can be described by this. So we also use this model to estimate the standard problem about the gray scroll and the competition between grade scroll and the race score. So, because time is limited, so I should skip this part. Okay, so alright, so this part I should skip. Okay, so let's see some numerical simulation. Okay, so now we consider the problem P because we want to know is there a troubling wave in our free boundary problem? So we consider a small epsilon and And to pick some parameter to see if there is a troubling wave solution. And we consider the initial value problem. We can see if dw is zero, w does not move, then we can see the solution develop into a traveling wave, looks like a traveling wave. And when dw become bigger and bigger, we can see the The speed becomes smaller, and eventually the species start to win the competition. Alright, so this looks like traveling wave. And it looks like speech should decrease in VW. Alright, so it's suggest that we should have a trapping wave. So we consider the movie coordinate and use the shooting method and we find the trapping wave. And we found the chopping wave. And for each epsilon, we have a different speed. So finally, we have two pictures. One is we do have the monotonicity of the speed. It's a decreasing in DW. So when DW is zero, then CO is positive means the UI wins the competition. But somehow when DO is the same, competition. But somehow when W becomes larger and larger, then the speed will become negative, means the W will win the competition. But somehow if you consider the monotonicity of the speed in D1, then we find something like Professor Yuan Lao talked in this morning, diffusion induced spreading. Because we see, okay, we check the epsilon small, you can see this curve. You can see this curve. When dy is very small, then the speed is negative. That means W win. So UI is lost the competition. But somehow we have a region. So if you pick the suitable D1, then UI will win. But somehow, D1 is bigger. Okay, it's harmful to UI for UI to win the competition. Yeah, this is our. Yeah, this is all I want to share with you. So, thank you so much. Okay, I think we have time for just one question. In your basic model, the two species occupy the same habitat. And then this is two species, and then the two results is one species. So, does the company? So does the competition of two species help them to spread or is it a competition? That depends. Yeah, because if the competition is weak, then the local behavior at the free boundary is very important. And the diffusion will play a very important role near there. Play a very important role near there. Recompetition enhances this. Thank you.
