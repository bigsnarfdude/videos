Yeah, okay. Hello, everyone, and thank you for listening to me. And I hope everyone is enjoying a good time in Banff, beautiful Alberta. And I want to thank the organizer and the chair for this top-notch meeting. So I'm going to share my screen and also switch off the video to save some bandwidth. Hopefully, it goes through. Am I audible? Is everything? Through. Am I audible? Is everything good? Okay, great. So, I hope everything's good and so, okay, today I'm going to talk about motility of bacteria in Alaska Viscount. Of bacteria in elasto-viscoplastic biological fluids. And this is the work of my PhD student, Saborish Narayanan, under the supervision of Donald Coke and myself. So yes. Can you make it full screen? Oh, yeah. Perfect. Thanks. Okay, great. So here is the outline of the talk. It comes into two parts. In the first part, I'm going to introduce bacterial. Bacterial locomotion in biological elastoviscoplastic fluids. I'm going to provide a mechanistic argument and formulate the problem. In the second part of the talk, I'm going to talk about non-continuum effects and bacterial motility. So I'm going to start with a brief review of the swimming of bacteria in Newtonian fluids. At the scale of bacteria, about one micron size of the head, inertia is unimportant. Inertia is unimportant and the Reynolds number is small. In the absence of inertia, the solutions to flows of Newtonian fluids are quasi-steady and linear, leading to reversibility of the flow when the boundary forcing is reversed. Bacteria have overcome reversibility by having a handed screw flagella bundle that turns in a single direction without reversing its motion. If you look at the bottom of this slide, you can see that the cork is. Can see that the cork screw motion of flagella, like the helix. I mean, if you take a cylinder filament of the helix, in a Stokes flow of Newtonian fluid, the drag in parallel direction is half of the drag in the normal direction for the same velocity. Therefore, this drag anisotropy provides a means to generate trust forces perpendicular to the direction of the rotation of the helical filament. Of the helical filament. And that's how we get swimming. However, many organisms, many microorganisms, have evolved to swim in complex biological fluids, such as mucus. In this slide, you can see several examples, such as the sperm penetration into human cervical mucus in silica in lungs that have an interaction between mucus and flexible filament, for example. And flexible filament, for example. H. pylori is an example of bacteria capable of swimming through intestinal mucus to cause stomach ulcers. So these examples have motivated scientists to explore motility in viscoelastic fluids. So as the audience are expert, the constitutive laws for solutions to close-up viscoelastic fluids are no longer quasi, steady, linear, or Steady, linear, or reversible. Therefore, the rheology of the fully, the kinematic of the gate, and the non-linear coupling of flow and rheology affect the swimming, leading to speed reduction or enhancement. And as far as bacterial motility in complex fully is concerned, the most widely studied questions has been what is the role of viscoelasticity? Does viscoelasticity enhance or reduce the swimming speed? Or reduce the swimming speeds, and so on, and so forth. However, the scientific community has disregarded two critical facts. First, biological fullies such as mucus exhibit yellow stresses, which complicates their constitutive laws by imposing a singularity and which determines the feasibility of the onset of motion. And second is that the biological fully have microstructures on lengthy scale of relative. On length scale of relevance to flagellar propulsion. And I want to elaborate more on these two facts. So, here in this slide, you're looking at an example of polymeric biofluids that is mucus and it exhibits microstructure. So, mucus is composed of mainly water, 95% of weight is water, and mucin fibers, and some other things like DNA. Other things like DNA, dead cells, and so on and so forth. And the mucin fibers are about 10 microns long and 10 nanometer in diameter. The mucin fibers interact to form a gel that is sticky and elastoviscoplastic. I'm going to talk about it later. But here, if you look at the figure, it's the scanning electron microscopy of the mucus of horse. And you can see that this. UK soft horse. And you can see that this gel has a microstructure, has a poor size, you know, has pores. And if you look for the here, I'm showing the scanning electron microscopy of mucus of horse and the pore size is of order of 500 nanometer. For humans, it's going to be different depending on which mucus we're talking about. In nasal mucus, it could be 150 nanometer. Be 150 nanometers in cervical mucus, it's 300 nanometer, but to just give you a scaling here. So, this is the microstructure of the sticky gel. How about the macro macroscopic properties? If we look at the rheological characterization of mucus, we note that from the G prime G double prime data, the elastic modulus is larger than viscous modulus. Definitely, this is a viscoelastic fully. And also, if you look at Elastic fully, and also, if you look at the viscosity as a function of shear rate, you see this peak in viscosity that is a signature of Yulus stress. So it has Yulus. Going through data, we know that it's a shear tuning material. It exhibits Yulus stress of order of one Pascal and below. And I have given also the range for elastic modulus, relaxation, time, and power law index here. What I want to say also here is that. So here is that the yield stress varies, all of these properties vary from person to person and during the diseases. For example, in patients with cystic fibrosis diseases, the illustrous goes as high as 100 Pascal. And for healthy people, it's below 1 Pascal, but it exists and that matters. So now that I elaborated on the macrorheology and microstructure. The macrorheology and microstructure of mucus, I want to provide a purely mechanistic argument for bacterial motility. I'm going to exclude chemistry here. So we focus on the E. coli, first of all, that lives in our gut and its motility is very well studied. You can look at the left figure here, which shows the fluorescence microscopy of a swimming E. coli. The head of E. coli is about two micron About two micron length and widths of half a micron. And the flagello bundle creates a helix of the flagella bundle has a diameter of 20 nanometer and several micron in length. And if you compare now this scaling with the microstructure of mucus that I just talked about, you can come up with this conclusion that the moving That the moving head is larger than the pore size of the mucus. However, the flagella is smaller than the pore size. So therefore, flagella bundle whips or rotates in a low viscosity or the solvent of mucus that I mentioned is water, is mainly water, and it produces propulsion and it should be sufficient enough to move the head. To move the head in a continuum elasto-viscoplastic foulid or that sticky gel. So, bacterial motility is feasible if the flagella bundle produces propulsion force to overcome the yield stress of mucus. So, this mechanistic argument is consistent with the experimental results of Kuhn and his co-workers, who studied the motility of E. coli in high molecular weight PVP solution. PVP solution exhibiting shear thinning rheology. It's a dilute polymeric solution with no yellow stress elasticity. It's just a very slight shear thinning. And you can see the results on the right part of the slide. And they showed that the cell sees the macro rheology of the polymeric solution. However, the fast-rotating flagella bundle sees a lower local viscosity in its vicinity. And that is shown by that green symbol triangles here. Symbols triangles here. So, the exact physical origin of this lower viscosity was not known, but the authors postulated that the flagellum may carve out a channel essentially void of polymer as it rotates so that it sees the solvent's viscosity. So now you can think of this flagellable bundle as a nanorometer here that probes the characteristics. Probes the characteristic of the material at molecular scale. But one can ask many questions here. You can ask: How is the motion start? What is the role of yellow stress if you want to think about real polymeric fluid that exhibit elasto-viscoplastic properties? Can the bacterium overcome the yellow stress? What is the interplay of viscoelasticity and yellow stress? How do the stresses induced by the flash? Do the stresses induced by the flagella bundle affect the yielding and propagation of the head? Would it enhance or reduce the yielding? And the mechanistic argument that I just gave is very simplistic if you think about it, because I'm telling you that the force is produced by the flagella and that should overcome the yellow and the head should overcome the illustrous having that force. So I'm disregarding the. So, I'm disregarding the interaction between the head and tail, which is very extreme here, as it produces a significant error in determining the onset of the motion of the microorganism, given the fact that we're talking about yellow stress fluids. So now, the question is that how we want to solve this problem. And here, we propose a model framework that includes the interaction between the flagella bundle and the microorganism's head. And the microorganism's head, as well as the non-continuum effect. We start with the basic idea that the flagella bundle is smaller than the spacing between the mucin fibers, and the flagella bundle is inside the pores of the polymer network. Therefore, the flagella bundle sees the low viscosity medium or water solvent. In contrast, the head sees the polymeric solution that is an elasto-viscoplastic gel. Viscoplastic gels. In this view, the flagellar bundle rotates in the water to generate a stress. The resulting Newtonian stress then is transmitted to the polymeric fluid over a length scale that depends on the magnitude of the drag force, and this is called Brinkman screening length scale. Therefore, the solvent and the polymeric phase are two interacting continua that interact with a drag force. The polymeric fluid yields if the transmitted Yields if the transmitted stress is larger than the yield stress. Consequently, the head can drag itself through the medium. The swimming starts, and the whole motion is force-free and torque-free, and far away from the head, and its flagellar bundle, a stress dipole exists in the medium. So, the way that we want to solve this problem is as follows. We're going to solve the problem at the flagellar scale using a slender body theory. So, we solve a theory. Theory. So we solve it theoretically. And we use that solution to figure out the singular forces, the distribution of singular forces on the flagella. And we look at the cell. Cell is the outer problem. So it's a localized perturbation actually method. But outer problem, we solve this computationally. Having the flagella or representing flagella as a distribution of Distribution of singular forces. So, theory at the collateral escape, computational at the cell, and we merge these two solutions. And actually, the matching would give the singular force, the distribution of singular forces. And for the constitutive law of this cell, the way that we solve this computationally, we consider an elasto-viscoplastic medium. An elasto-viscoplastic medium that the below the yellow stress it acts like a gezicus model, and above that, sorry, below the yellow stress, it's a non-linear viscoelastic solid, and above that, it's a geysicus viscoelastic fluid. So that's the real problem. So I have to talk about the state of the art, but I will briefly tell you that there are just a handful of studies doing experiments with. Doing experiments with real bacteria in naniotonia and fluid. All of them correspond to dilute solutions. And there is a gap in knowledge when it comes to dense polymeric solution like mucus, which exhibit elasto-viscoplastic behavior. You can ask me questions, and I would be thrilled to talk about the state of the art. But given the microstructure of Biofluid, I hope that I convinced you any studies that. That I convinced you any studies that are focused on the synthetic swimmer is really not relevant here. So, that brings me to the second part of my talk, and that is the non-continuum effects and the bacterial motility. The first step that we take is to solve the problem theoretically completely. So, for this first step, we focus on the limit of zero-yield stress and elasticity. Of zero yield distress and elasticity to show how such non-continuum treatment that I just talked about affects the motility of bacterium. We assume the solvent and polymer phases to be two interacting continua that are Newtonians, and they have viscosities that are denoted by mu S and mu P, and velocities that are denoted by US and UP, and the flagellar bundle pushing on the solvent, and then the interaction of the solvent. And then the interaction of the solvent and the polymer leads to a slip velocity. The Darcy drag may be expected to lead the polymer and solvent velocity to approximately be equal on a length scale larger than the Brinkman screening length scale that is denoted by L of B here. You can imagine when Lb goes to zero, the sleep velocity between two phases are zero, and you're looking at a mixture. And when L B goes to zero, Mixture and when Lb goes to infinity, the two phases don't interact at all, and so yeah, there is no interaction. So, as so, what about the boundary conditions? As far as interaction between flagella bundle and the polymer phase is concerned, we are going to consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the polymer phase experiences perfect sleep, so the flagellabundance doesn't impose any tangential. Doesn't impose any tangential stresses on the polymer phase while the solvent experiences no slip boundary condition. This could be related to the case that the pore size in biological fluids is of the order of the flagellal abundant. And the case where the diameter of the pores in the polymer solution is much larger than the fiber diameter can be effectively modeled by there is no interaction. While there is no interaction between flagella and the medium. So actually, zero stress. Just a review that we are going to do slender body theory at the flagella. And in this way, we are going to include the hydrodynamic interactions between different segments that is way more accurate than resistive force theory. I know that I have, I think, perhaps about five minutes and I'm going to wrap. About five minutes, and I'm going to wrap up hopefully in that time. So, um, so here we solve this problem for just the helix rotating and moving in this two-fully medium with the first boundary condition that is polymer slipping past the helix. So, you're looking at the data of the scale drag and scale trust that is obtained theoretically. Of course, as a function of the viscosity. Of course, as a function of the viscosity ratio, you expect the increase of both drag and trust. However, the most important result is as a function of the microstructure or the Brinkman length scale. As we increase that, you can see that we have reduction in the drag and increase of the thrust. And you can, so you can conclude that the That the trust to drag ratio increases. And this increased trust can be understood in terms of the increased drag anisotropy for this case. Here we show a segment of the helix that rotates with omega and translates with U. And in the case of noisily boundary condition, the segment is subject to resistance in both parallel and perpendicular direction. While for the case Direction. While for the case where the fluid can slip, the parallel resistance to motion is zero, which results in an increase in the thrust force. Here we adopt a pitch angle of pi over four for the flagella bundle that is physically relevant. So I'm going to skip this explaining this slide. This is for the case of polymer that doesn't interact with the helix. Again, we see that there is an enhanced. We see that there is an enhancement of trust-to-drag ratio due to the role of microstructure. And now we combine all the results and calculate the kinematic parameters of a force-free and torque-free swimming bacterium in a two-fluid medium using resistive force theory. That would be the leading order to a slender body theory. And we note that taking into account the Taking into account the non-continuum effects, either by assuming a slip or no interaction between flagella bundle and polymer phase, result in the enhanced swimming speed. And the results are also in very good agreement with the experimental results. So, we have established a framework, a physical framework for the observation of motility in polymeric solution. Polymeric solution. So, back to the original problem. Now, I just talked about the Newtonian, the benchmark Newtonian case that we had theoretical handle on. So, to solve this problem, we have to really solve the flow around the spheroid, the spheroid or the head accurately for this problem. Immersed boundary method doesn't work because there is an error in the stress. There is an error in the stress that we get, and this really highly affects the understanding of the onset of motion. So, a finite difference code was developed by a former student of Don Cook in Prolatus Feroidal Coordinate System for viscoelastic fully. We got the code and we developed that for two fully medium. Medium with elasto-viscoplastic material. And I'm not going to show anything about how we did that. It's a long paper in JFM that I would be happy to share with you if you're interested in. So this is a typical example of results. I really don't have that much to show here as far as elastoviscoplastic fully is concerned, but for two Newtonian fully, you can see that when the Brinkman is See that when the Brinchman skinning length on the left on the right of the slide is small, the interaction of solvent and polymer is huge. And you can see that how close to flagella bundle the velocity is perturbed. Whereas if you increase the Brinkman screening length, that interaction is really minuscule. And we have a lot of basically simulations that are. Basically, simulations that are launched now and they are running, and some of them are not complete. I just grabbed two to show the effect of elasticity and the effect of yield stress. So, this is just, for example, when we have a demo or number of order 0.6 and Bingham number of 0.01. And I should say yield number, not Bingham number, really, because I'm actually scaling everything with the Everything with the torque of motor, but you can see that as we increase a slight yield of stress, the swimming velocity decreases. So, to give you a physical understanding, I think I should come hopefully in two years in Banff to show more results. But this is how the yield surface evolves around the swimming bacterium as the motion starts. So, many questions that can be asked. Many questions that can be asked here and answered here, but we are exploring a wide range of dimensionless parameters to have a better physical understanding when it comes to Gillusris elasto-viscoplastic fluids. So to summarize, the moving head or cell sees the mucus structure as an elasto-viscoplastic fleet, while the flagella see mucus as a discrete matrix. In the presence of non-continuum effect, the resistance to tangential. Effect the resistance to tangential motion of the flagella bundle will be small. And as a result, we have a drag and isotropy that is enhanced and that leads to enhancement of the swimming. And you're now exploring the larger space for the dimensionless number associated for the problem to come up with a physical understanding. I want to acknowledge Ian for fruitful discussions at the beginning. At the beginning of this research, it was he's always there for me, and that was very beneficial. I want to acknowledge the support of NSF, and these are some of the references that I made a presentation from today. And thank you for your attention, and I would be happy to take your question.
