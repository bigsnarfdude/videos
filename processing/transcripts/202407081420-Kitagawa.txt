So it's my pleasure to introduce the next speaker, Ozatoshi Ktegaba from the University of Tokyo, who will talk on patterns of algebra in the branching problem. Thank you. I would like to thank the organizers to give me this opportunity. First, this talk is based on these two preprints. And in this talk, In this talk, I will say Professor Washington's paper in 1998 and this means this paper. And also, I may, I will say, conjecture by Professor Kubesh. These are one thing, this paper. Let me explain the motivation in this talk. Any unitary presentation of a reductive D group G has a unique irreducible decomposition as this. Without any assumption, this decomposition Any decomposition can occur. But in the context of the branching problem or harmonicaness, the evisible different position is expected to have good form like this, where there is a good set of unitary characters. Good set of unitary characters. PR. PR is a parabolic server product of GR. For example, positive colour and affine space. My purpose is to understand the size and the shape of these continuous spectrums. These continuous spectrums in this talk, consider an algebraic counterpart of this. The goal is to consider the toggle action. This is the center of the universal end of algebra of gay. The reactions on gay modules and define a length of gay modules. length of game materials and two types of Carlton sub-algebra for game materials. Lung is an analogy of the size of spectrum and Curton sub-algeval is an analogy of the shape of spectrum. Let me fix uh setting. G is a connective reactive LW group over C and fixed T, fixed maximum torus of G and while group. And A is a unital associated algebra with a home policy from UK to A. For the branching problem of disactive degrades, I used the following notation. GR is a connected DR form of G and K is a maximal complexion of a maximal compact subgroup of G R and itself. The definition of lung is the following. Let V given without any assumption. RKB is a space of vectors whose support has dimension less than or equal to k. This is k. This is K module, K sub module of Bui, and lower local rank Bui is defined by the minimum value of K with Rk is not zero. Upper local length is defined by this one, and global length of V is defined by the dimension of. The dimension, the variety determined by an irregular rank, these two local ranks equal, we say that blue is equally rank and light simply this form without any bar. Of course, this definition does not depends only on that k action. And R K defines the exhaustive K-module filter of grid. For example, local rank of function space over g over k. Over G over K is Z. This is a completely deducible G module, a K module. And global length of this module is equal to the real length of GR and local length of this module is equal to the real length. equal to the real length of GR for non-zero KKMOS of atmospheric dimension local length width is there if and only any finite dimension any finitely generated submodule has finite length and this is equivalent to that a P is discrete decomposer. is this creative decomposer. So this slide is a generalization of the theory of discrete decomposability. Do you study the language? To study the lamps, I need a general spair. Let A be a unit accessive algebra with an algebra homomorphism from UA to A. We say that Ag is a general spair. It is a interaction of K on A by bracket lead to a large energy action. So I assume G is deductive, so A is continued and completely deducible and locally finite, G motion. For example, the pair of UG and G plane is a general pair, where G plane is a subgroup of G, a connective subgroup of G. And this pair at the dx is the global section of the shift of differential operators on x. If this pair is a general spair, if x is 3, this is a typical example, but other, sorry. The first main segment is following. Let B be a module, NA module, then RKB. This is the filtration of K motules, is actually a filtration of K-motion. In particular, if B is irreducible, then B is equal to. Is equilibrant. As a colory, one can show this that we be a irreducible LK major of at most counter dimension. If the restriction of b to k has an irreducible submodule, then this is discouraged. This is discretely decomposed. And this is equivalent to the language language level. The idea of this and the proof of this selling. the proof of this is the same as professor's proof of discovery and it is multiplication is a multiplication of a is a pencil product and quotient in this case a is a direct sum finite dimensional irreducibility submodule so So canceling a finite dimensional game module is very easy and does not change the length. The length can be defined for reintended representation and more generally continuous. More generally, continuous representation. Let HB continuous representation of GR on the current complete convex space. In this case, the length is defined using smooth vectors. And to define a parallel rank, need to Need to define, need to take the closure. For example, apology length of L2 GR over Kr. Here is a maximal compact. This length is equal to the real length of GR by the Harry-Schunder's pressure form. And if F is a compact homogeneous space with a non-zero With a non-zero invariance measure, then this upper local length is there. So this rank can be considered as a DL length of X. I don't know what is this. The next The links for a unitary presentation and smooth representation and diagonal representation and KT module has the following relation. The upper rank, local rank is for the unitary representation is smaller, smallest. And for gaymark. GTMOS for GTMOS info is largest. If the length of local length of for GK module is less than or equal to one, then these three lengths are equal and 1850 is equivalent. About this selling, I have a conjecture which is a generalization of Professor Kovas conjecture. Let ATBL reuse pseudo-integer representation of G2DR, then the length, apolar local length of image representation is equal to the Is equal to the that of KTM module. This conviction does not hold for admissible, irreducible filament of the presentation. Okay, next. I want to define a curtains algorithm for representation. Q stands for the quotient map from t star to t star over f double g. And that we be a non-self game module. Causional algebra A of t is a t is the maximum torus. A of t is a small. Because L is a small curtain subrecible for 3. If any variety defined by the associated prime in Lui of Fluid is written as this form. So it is an image of a fine space, a fine subspace in T star. So this means support of any vector as Z2G module is union of affine subspace. Yeah. Mozilla, modular group action. And I could centralize everyone. And a concentration of T is a Curtain sub-reserve for V if the value defined by the annihilator of Vui is a little at this point. If this of algebra defined is the length can be defined by can be. Can be defined by can be determined by dimension of the cultural sample reserves. For example, this game shift has small Kauta sub-arzibal, which is the same as much smaller average substrate of the case. So this is a reason why I call this Carton Sabalg for Mosul. Breathe for any module breathe or atomos can. There is a small counter subversion for breathing. For finitely generated scheme of a small curtain subversible and curtain subversible for Buy are the same. This is a main cell of this talk. Let V be an irreducible A module of atmospheric dimension. This is an essential assumption. And then we have a small country, A. More. A moreover, a star, its zero of A, is spanned by some difference of weights in A, mu minus mu prime. In many cases, the set of weights in A is often a lattice in T star. So this is a This is the mu minus mu prime is also weights the weight in A. So A star is spanned by some weights in A. For large Carlton Sabrise Ebra, the existence of Carlton Sabrise Ebra depends only on analyta of Bui. So one can replace Bui Let Bui be an A module. Suppose that there exists an irreducible A module. With an irreducible amount of V prime of atmospheric dimension. So V prime has a small counter. And V prime satisfies the destruction to K is finitely generated and the entire letter of V and V prime are the same. Then we have the cardinal subrange. This technique is used in many places. For example, Presminder used a similar technique to compute the theta lifting of immutational characters. And if A is simple, then of course, any irreducible module has the same analysis. And by the flow, that analyta of an irreducible game motion is equal to that of some irreducible higher state motion. So existence problem of curtain surveys of the hobby can be reduced to irreduced highest rate motive case. G twisting b by as a inner automatic at G I define G2 domain VG then the annihilator of V and V G the same to find a finitely generate module The criterion given by the professor Yamaster is useful. Let BB irreducible K2 module and assume that this PI is diagnosed. Then there is G such that the distribution of Vuichi is finitely genetic. Genetic genetics. So combining the this proportion and the main segment for any irreducible module, we have a turtle subversion where this pi is DRSP. I think this terror falls without this remaining 20 minutes. Next, I want to consider a new co-invariant to study the game module. So picks p tilde and be as bolt subgroups of g and g2 and with an illusion of gate tilde module the get the gate action on boot action on board is not not easy, but it can be reduced to the UT action on V or by UG. So I want to study this phase. But applying the main cell to this module, I need to find a good large I need to find a good large reduction on this space. To this, derives this space using co-homod homolog, gay homolog as this. Then this part This part is important. And there are several differential operators on Geo value acts on this space. This space is identified with the set of all distributions on zero by U supported on point, one point. So using this action, we obtain the large objective action on the state of the homology, geo homology. And this cohomology is This cohomology homology can be realized using holonomic D module. So the VU is getting that module and this is DG over U module. So this is a module of D modules on this can be realized as D modules on this space. This space is polite if irreduced we get to the k to the module. So, using holonomy theory of theory of holonomy modules, I obtained this theorem. Let V D irreducible gate to the K 0 modules, then the length of this module is finite. So, So I obtained the large algebra on this space. As a corollary, there is finite exhaustive demo virtualization of the homologous group, such that consequent question has. Good question, has a small car on summarize. At the last, I want to talk about a geometric counterpart of the part and subarray. Part of our sequence. Let R be a filter Xi algebra such that good R is the finitely generate integral domain of a C. And for finality generate most your BUI and like good filters of BUI. Of free. Associate variety of food is defined by the associate variety of good. This is commutative algebra. So this is a variety of state good. Some variety of state could have. And this is not depend on this does not depend on the choice of the filtration. Choice of the with the filter. For non-finite regenerative module, I want to extend this definition. Let BLR module, if any finite region in all the sub-module has the same associated paradigm. In this case, we did not buy the same notation as a paradigm pile. Parity, there are parity level variety associated with variety. Q stands the projection Q to the projection of these spaces. And using the existence of small curtains over, I have this proposal. Let me be an introduced rule module. Then the asset validity of the destruction of V to K and destruction B to ZK are defined. Defined. Well defined. If we have a small countance of algebra A, for example, V is of the atmosphere dimension, then one has this formula and by the same principle. But the same proof of Professor Kubach for the discrete decomposer precise how well has this inclusion. Professor Kubash conjectured that this is equality for where this module is discretely decomposer. Lawset gave a definition of counter-subraises, for example, near-potential cojan pygmy orbits. If this conjecture holds the small Curtin sub-variable and the Curtin sub-variables for it are computed by the near-potential quadrant of it and the diagram. quadrant orbit and the dagrangian subvariety associated to grid. This dagrangian subvariety means associated variety. In this context, list gay is the moment map of the Poisson variety guessed for the important quasi-introduction. One case and G2 and G is a symmetric pair, then projection this variety coincides with. Yeah, that's all. Thank you for your talk. Thank you very much. Other questions? Anyone else? I just had a naive question. You define the associated variety for potentially infinite length module. Give an example where the associated variety is the same for all the Variety is the same for all the finite submodules. This was the original definition of the framework. This is the this gives an example. For BUIS, it is a CBA model. It is a CBA module. So if A is very large, then the restrictions also very large. For example, things are product of highest rate module and lowest rate module, but is it in the case? Uh and the research of V2K is not uh is not uh finite nice. Are all the pieces somehow similar? Yes, yes. Okay, so uh you have main several uh assumptions on how to do it. Assumption combatable dimensionality. Yes. You are original is the atmosphere with dimensions or not. I need only but my question is: so if RTRA is of atomic countable dimension, and we edit then we should. Then it's automatically countable. So, if you also consider no countable dimensional algebra, eh? No. So, I've got a question. Then the age, so let's see. So the module is flat line. So the module is only going to twist it or this is twisted demos.
