And if I'm not yet in this time zone, but hopefully before my flight, I will. Yeah, so I want to talk about sort of a new approach to Ethereum that we've already seen. Let me give the setup. Oh, and I should say this is all joint with Christian Schnell. All right, so let All right, so let X be a smooth hypertail manifold of dimension, let's say, 2n. The smoothness is not too important, but whatever it's fine right now. And let's consider a Lagrangian vibration, which has Which has shown up enough already this week that maybe I won't sort of give my usual preamble on what these objects are. And already in Roda's talk, we saw the sort of general expectation that for any Lagrangian vibration of an irreducible home of a symplectic manifold, the base should be projected space. Half-dimensional projective space. Projective space. Okay, and I guess there's several pieces of evidence for this that I'll describe in a second, but the sort of main progress on this conjecture is which says that if you assume B is smooth, this is true. If B smooth, then it is in fact isomorphic. Isomorphic. Okay, and so the goal today is to sort of give a new proof that uses as much Hodge theory as possible. And in doing so, maybe give a simpler proof, new proof by a hot spirit. Okay, and let me also remark that very recently is another proof, so due to Julie Pizlati. Also, having a proof. Which, in some respects, is kind of a similar strategy, and I'll point out the sort of main similarities and differences. And varieties and differences, they also sort of lean much more heavily on Hodge than Bond, although they use some additional sort of metric and curvature arguments that we kind of package all into the Hodge. So secretly, there's probably some metric arguments going on, but for us, they're sort of all subsumed into the world of Hodge theory, results from Hodge theory. Okay, so from now on, let's assume B smooth. Now on, let's assume. Assume the smooth. Okay, so like I said, there's a couple of things we know, many of them due to Matsushita. The important things that we know going in about B are that is that Is that B is Fano? So it's an anti-economic one-day example. And also, it has the cohomology of projective space. For us, we actually are just going to use the second Betty number as possible. Guess those are the two main things that will appear in the crew for us. Okay, so what's the strategy here? How are we going to go about doing this? Well, I mean, we need to use some criterion for. Need to use some criterion for, you know, how do we tell that we end up with projective space? And we use the following criterion, which is good to Joe, Miyoka, Shepard Baron, Shepard, and also to Kapakos, which says that only just write it down. So if B Smooth uni-ruled, uni-ruled, okay? Then if all of its, so it's uni-ruled, so it has lots of rational curves. If all of its rational curves have sort of large anti-conomical degree, then it has to be projected space, okay? If B is smooth, uni-ruled, and for every rational curve. Rational curve G C. So I'm going to write G C to B a lot, and that always means a rational curve. For every rational curve through a generic point, we have that if I compute the anti-canonical degree, then it's bigger than or equal to. Then it's bigger than or equal to the dimension of b plus one, okay? Uh, then it then it's projected. Somehow, the idea here is sort of using Maury theory, you can play bend and break games to get rational curves that are sort of founded from above by a You know, bounded from above by a degree like this. And so, somehow, if you can't get anything less, then you can show that that forces it to be predicted. This is the same sort of, this is how to say, let me call this main input number one. This is also the same criterion that Leon Tosati want to use to show that B has to be the job of space. To be the checker space. Okay, so the other thing that's floating around is going to be the variation of hodge structures that we get from this generic family of abelian varieties. Okay, so let B naught inside of B be the locus where the fibers are smooth. Locus where Where f has moved fibers. Okay, and then this is going to be a pretty common notation for me. So whenever you see a circle, that's going to mean that I'm restricting to this sort of big open set. So sort of F naught from X naught. B naught is going to be the restriction of Lubagradian vibration to B naught. I'm also going to denote by the I'm also going to denote by delta the discriminant divisor, so just the just the complement. Okay. And so if we look at the first cohomology of the fibers, this gives us a nice variation of weight one-pod structures. And this is sort of pretty critically linked to the geometry of B via following a construction that. Following a construction that I'm sure many of you are familiar with. The point is that, so this is a BHI, at least on the locus of smooth fibers, contraction with the symplectic form gives us an identification between the sort of F1 Hodge filtration piece and the tangent bundle piece. Have natural map from the tangent bundle of the, at least on the Of the at least on the on this open locus to the F1 part of this variation, where I just take a tangent vector, I lift it upstairs, I contract with the symplectic form. Now I have a one form, I restrict to the fibers and take the duramphomology. So lift, contract, restrict, take dynamic homology. And because it's Lagrangian, this makes sense, doesn't. Lagrangian, this makes sense, doesn't depend on the choice of lift. And the simple non-degenerateness means that this is a nice mark. Okay. So we want to somehow assume that it's not projective space, therefore that it has low-degree curves via this theorem. And we want to somehow conclude something about the variation of hot structure and ultimately end up with a contradiction. And the thing we're going to contradict, the thing we're going to contradict the thing we're going to uh well maybe i'll put it over here so both of my inputs are in the same place the thing we're going to contradict is something again we've already seen this is to the main input too well i certainly learned this from a paper of claire uh i think uh a gizzard at some point maybe uh uh also uh used the similar So, used a similar thing, but the point is that this variation of hot structure is irreducible. It doesn't admit any non-trivial ways of splitting it up. That's going to be exceedingly important. Okay, so what is this? Sorry, what is the strategy behind this proof? Well, the very simple idea is that we're going to Is that we're going to show that low-degree rational curve is forced to have a fixed part of its variational patch structure. So show that if we have a low degree rational curve, when I say degree, I always mean anti-canonical degree, implies that the pullback, really, I mean, on the open part, I take the pullback. Pullback of the variation has a fixed part. And somehow, if we have this for many rational curves, we want to show that then we get a decomposition of V that is non-trivial, and that's going to be the contribution by sort of V has a non-trivial composition of contribution. Okay, great. So that's the idea. So let's do that. Well, that's what, in some sense, that's what they do. I mean, it's a little more nuanced because they're only going to sort of use this generic point, but it's very similar to sort of Maury's argument to show that the ampleness of the tangent bundle implies. But we're only going to use this. We're going to use this input in the sense that we're going to assume it's not projected space, so there is a low degree curve. Oh, oh, the normal movement of the curve. Yeah, exactly. That's right. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right. So same idea. You want to somehow show that you want to use the fact that the variation is related to the tangent bundle to show that if you have a If you have a trivial normal trivial part to your normal bundle, that then forces you to have a trivial part of your variation. And this is what they do by a metric arguments. They show that there's a port. Okay. Okay. So, how do we make this precise? Well, here's the main Well, here's the main sort of input from Hodge theory: following proposition. Suppose G from C to B is a rational curve, meeting the sort of the open part, meeting the good locus, the locus where we have smooth plappers. Then two things. Two things. First, the restriction of the Hodge bundle, sorry, the restriction of the tangent bundle is semi-positive. And second, this is essentially what Claire was saying. We're going to show that this is semi-positive and that any degree zero quotient has to come from a fixed part of the variation. Any degree Degree zero quotient of this it comes from is the F1 of a trivial part of the variation in this region. Okay, great. I think I've made this complicated for the people at the cameras because I'm sort of going back and forth between boards. Sorry about that. Let me make an observation here. This proposition is good because, you know, using this main input number one, if we assume Input number one: if we assume there's a curve for which the tangent bundle has degree less than or equal to the dimension of b, namely n, then uh, we're forced to get a degree zero part. Okay, so why is that? So observe that if the degree of the pullback of the tangent bundle is less than or equal to n, which is you know what we would assume given that criterion, then this has a uh Has an O factor. Let me just say a few words about this. It's a rational curve, so we know everything splits into O n's, and it's semi-positive, so all the n's that show up are non-negative. And okay, well, you might say I have a rank n bundle. I'm assuming its degree is less than or equal to n. Why does that force it to have an O factor? Well, that's because it's the tangent bundle, so it contains a copy of the tangent bundle. So, it contains a copy of the tangent bundle of the rational curve, which is O2. And so, G T B contains an O2 factor, because this is just the 10 bundle of the curve itself. Okay, so that one extra degree I get for free means that as soon as you're less than or equal to n, there must be an O. Okay, so by this proposition, that means it has to come from a, if you assume that you have a curve of anti-economic degree. Curve of anti-economic degree less than or equal to the dimension of b, then it has to the variation has to have a trivial function. Okay, let me get rid of this now. Okay, so, like I said, this is some like Hodge theoretic input. So, let's give a recap on where this sort of semi-puzzle. Where this sort of semi-positivity comes from. So, suppose we have a curve, C, and we have some Zariski open on this curve. So, we've deleted some number of points. So, let's say we have C0 inside of C. And suppose we have a local system V on C naught. Then, and let's assume for simplicity has quasi-unipotent local module. It's always the case for local systems coming from geometry. Coming from geometry. Yeah, so there's a very nice extension of the associated flat vector bundle to the entire curve, which is called the De Doing extension. So it's usually denoted maybe curly V bigger than or equal to minus one. So extension, the Deline extension of O tensor V C See and sort of what picks out this nice extension. Well, it's an extension of the flat bundle. There's natural connection here coming from the flat sections here. The connection doesn't extend, but it extends with log poles. And this bigger than or equal to minus one means that the eigenvalues of the residue of that connection are between minus one and zero. Eigenvalues. Eigenvalues of the residue connection are in minus one to zero. So, I mean, the way you should think about this is as sort of the minimal semi-positive extension of v. Why is that? Well, it's easiest to think about the case where you have finite local monodroming. So, imagine you have a flat section that around one of these punctures gets multiplied by some root of unity. By some root of unity, all we're doing to form this extension is we're sort of multiplying by the smallest negative power of a local uniformizer such that we get a monogramian variant section. Okay, so you should think of this extension as sort of introducing possibly fractional poles to make a monogramian variant sections of the lowest possible order. Okay, and that's that's in some sense with. Okay, and that's that's in some sense where the the uh the positivity is secretly by the Yes We will use something related to that, yes. We will use something related to that, yes. Yeah. Oh, we'll get to that right after this. I mean, somehow this in co-dimension one, that's what Matsu Shito shows. It shows that the tangent bundle is this domain kinetic extension. Then things get a little messy in co-dimension two. And that's where we're going to use Hudge modules to sort of rescue some functoriality that the DeLean extension doesn't have in the non-log smooth. Lean extension doesn't have in the non-log's mood situation. Okay, so here's a theorem: old theorem of Peters, which also has a sort of enhancement that we need due to Christian and Utgier Yang. And the statement is that if, in this situation, if V sort of underlies ABHS, then basically we have both of these. Basically, we have both of these properties. So, if you take the lowest piece of the Hodge filtration, so the lowest, I'll just call the lowest piece the descending filtration. So, that's a filtration piece of top degree of this is a semi-positive one and two. It has this quotient property that any degree zero quotient comes from a fixed part. Any degree, sorry, let me be a little more precise. Sorry, let me be a little more precise. Any degree zero quotient comes from a flat quotient of V with no monogram, with no local monograph. So, this is important. So, it's both the like non-flatness. It's both like non-flatness that would contribute to the positivity as well as local mark. Okay. And okay, well, now the point is that, you know, how to say that, well, I'll get to this in a second. But the reason over here, we're going to be able to do so that we actually have a trivial part is using that it's a rational curve, right? So we're not there yet, but here we would just be able to conclude you get some flat part of V that extends. Get some flat part of V that extends over the punctures flatly, okay? But you know, that means it's a flat bundle on P1, so it's trivial. Okay, so that's why trivial shows up over here, but just flat and extending over the boundary shows up here. So, yeah, yeah, this is in that situation. Yeah, this is over a curve. Over a curve. I mean, they prove a higher dimensional version that's that's a little more complicated, but over a curve, uh, this is the. Complicated, but over a curve, this is the same. Okay, but I mean, as Claire was asking, we need to sort of, I mean, we have the tangent bundle over here. How are we going to relate that to the Deline extension when we restrict? Well, we need to do something. We need to construct some nice extension of F1V on B. Okay, so we want to extend. Okay, so we want to extend V on B. Okay, well now there's sort of two, you know, this is sort of a choose your adventure. There's two things you can do here, okay? The Delaney extension works well in the log smooth situation. You can pass to a log smooth resolution and extend there and then try to descend stuff down. Okay, so you can take B prime to be log smooth. Let me be a little more clear. Yeah, I mean. Let me be a little more clear. Yeah, I mean, B is smooth, of course, by assumption, but the discriminant divisor is highly singular, and that's what we care about here, right? We want the discriminant divisor to be log smooth. So, this is a more resolution of the discriminant. Okay, so if we take this log smooth resolution, we can then form the Stillene extension here that has some nice properties, and then we can try to descend them down. Okay, and that's exactly the kind of argument. Okay, and that's exactly the kind of argument that Matsushita uses. So, you know, use the theorem of Matsushita. So this identification we had between the tangent bundle and the F1 piece of the Hodge filtration, we can upgrade that to an identification between the tangent bundle and the F1 piece of the Deleane extension in codimension one. Mention one. So, why does that live on B? Well, you know, to pass into the log-smooth resolution, then it was only at co-dimension two modification, right? The divisor is already log-smooth in co-dimension one. So I'm only sort of modifying stuff in codimension two on B. So the identification I get, you know, I get some partial identification between the tender bundle up here and the tender bundle up here and the F1 part of this galleon extension, which then can descend down. And using this, using the fact that these are green codimension one, this is what allows him to show that in fact downstairs, you have an identification on the nose between the cotangent bundle and the R1F lower star below, okay, which is already some kind of more hug theoretic type gadget. Okay, so that's kind of the situation. If you go to a log smooth The situation: if you go to a logs with resolution, you sort of modify your space so that the local monodrome is abelian, then this Deline extension works nicely, and you can play, uh, you can understand this particular nice extension versus the tangent bundle and then triggered the center. The approach of Saito is somehow rather than to modify our space so the Delaney extension works, we instead sort of allow the object we're extending. The object we're extending as to be a slightly more degenerate type of thing. So rather than trying to extend it as a, you know, a flat vector bundle with log singularities, I extend it as a filtered D module. Extend V as filtered D module. Okay, and we get some, I'll call it M sub V. M sub V, which comes with the filtration. Okay, so the basic point here is that a flat vector bundle is a D module, but sort of, you know, D modules can be more complicated than just a flat vector bundle. And here, the point is we're staying on B. We're not going up to a resolution, but we're allowing the sort of extended object to be more complicated. Okay. And this theorem. And this theorem of Matsushita, in particular, this identification in co-dimension one tells you something. This was sort of observed by Schnell. It's in some sense the same steps that Matsushita uses, but phrased in the sort of Hodge module world, tells you that if you take this particular extension of V on B, you get an identification between the tangent bundle of V and the F1 piece. And the F1 piece of this DMOP. Okay? So again, the sort of, you know, the advantage here is we haven't left B, but maybe we know less about this object. The advantage here is we've left B, but we know exactly what this Delean extension is. Which argument? What do you mean this is kind of a mutation? Well, maybe you'll see. Okay, so to get this, I mean, what we would love, I mean, what would be great is if this deliena extension worked. is if this Delaney extension were compatible with restriction, right? Because then you could, you know, you take the Delaney extension on B, it's in some sense the F1. And if you restrict it, you get the Delaney extension here, then you could extract something. Okay, that's not exactly true, but there is a functoriality for this Hodge module extension. And this is sort of the main reason why this perspective is better for this problem than this perspective. So here's the basic functoriality result you get from Hodge module theory. From Hudge module theory, basic quantitative is that if you have a map from C to B, okay, you can, on the one hand, you can take this Hodge module extension of V on B. Doing this in the correct place, yes. You can take its F1 part and you can restrict. On the other hand, you can first restrict the variation. You can first restrict the variation and then play the Hodge module extension game, which we know for a curve is just the Deween extension. Okay, so we can take the Hodge module extension of the pullback of the variation and take its F1 part, which again we know is just the F1 of the sort of the lean extension of this pullback. Okay, and over here, we know. And over here, we know that this is just the pullback of the tendon bundle. Okay, and the basic functoriality is that this has a non-zero map into there, has a natural map into there that on the open part is the obvious map. I'm using the one that's familiar to are you talking about the indexing? Yeah, I mean, this is a decreasing fluctuation. Correct, because the negative tests. I think I'm the only one who does this because that's only because you know I'm more familiar with people. Okay, great. So now we can prove this proposition. I guess I'll put it here. Proof of proposition. Okay, well, the first step is maybe I'll even just say some of it in words. The first step is clear because this we know semi-positivity for, and this contains that. Okay, so automatically this is more positive. In particular, this is semi-positive. For number two, we can also go the other way because any degree zero quotient of this has to come from a degree zero quotient of this. And then once again, we apply to that version of Peter's theorem. With that version of Peter's theorem, which tells us that it has to come from a flat part. Okay. So let me say for one, you know, one check, two, any degree zero quotient of this pullback comes from degree zero quotient. Of that one of the this, which therefore comes from a flat factor v that extends over the functions, comes from factor of v, which extends. But because it's a rational curve, if it extends, then it's trivial. Then it's trivial. See rational, therefore, trivial. Okay. This is sort of the main step that comes from Podge theory using these two. Which one? This? Yeah, yeah, we know this one's semi-positive. That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. By that theorem that was here. That was here. Well, you know, some version of semi-positives here, some version, which when you restrict, maybe it's not obvious what's happening there. Yeah, it's the statement over higher dimensional bases is a little complicated. Over curves, it's sort of very, I mean, because of this functoriality, it's sort of you immediately deduce from, you know, a consequence of this sort of functoriality is you do get semi-positivity. Functoriality is you do get semi-positivity in the sense of restriction to curves. Okay. Okay, so let me just say a few words about why this is the functoriality you should expect. Let me just draw a diagram. So if you have like a log smooth thing, if you restrict to a curve that's like transverse to the boundary, then the Delaney extension sort of commutes with restriction. Okay. Now, what happens if you restrict to a curve that's tangent to a piece of the boundary? Well, you know, if we took the minimal extension on the You know, if we took the minimal extension on the big thing, so there was like a q minus one over nv generating the extension on the big thing. When I restrict the order of q to the one over n goes up. So maybe when I restrict to a curve, I have a higher pull than I needed. That's why you get more positivity on the restrict than you did on the minimums. Cool. Check my time. Okay, so as we already discussed. Already, as we already described, from here, we deduce that if you have a rational curve through a general point, in particular, any rational curve meeting B naught, if it has degree, if it has low degree in the sense of having degree smaller than or equal to the dimension, there has to be a fixed part to the variation. That's the corollary of this part. Maybe I'll leave and write. So, I'll put it over here. So, corollary if g from c to b has minus k b dot c less than or equal to n, then this restriction has a fixed part. Okay, great. So now take a minimal degree rational curve that meets B naught and let curly M be sort of the component of the stable maps space that contains such curves. It's the sort of component of stable. Stable rational curve space with minimal degree and meeting be not okay. Let me go over here. Sorry, I know I like just wrote this, but there's a reason I Wrote this, but there's a reason I need to write this. It's a proof, so you can kind of remember the statement, you can forget it. That's because in the statement, this Chomiyoka Shipper-Barre statement, we need to handle every rational curve to that point. And you get no control. I think the point is that I, I mean, you might be right, but the way I have it in my mind. Might be right, but the way I have it in my mind is that you need this semi-positivity to know that you can deform the curve so it meets transversely. And to get that semi-positivity, you need this. The general curve. I claim that it's going to matter that we're doing. I claim that it's going to matter that we're doing it for all of the curves that make p naught. I don't think it's enough to have it for a general curve. You'll see in a second. I think we can discuss it after, but we'll see. Okay, so I have this component of the stable map space, and I look at the universal curve over it. And there's sort of a universal map to be. Let me call this pi. Okay. And so the conclusion from this corollary is that if you know, if we assume. Is that if we assume that the degree is less than or equal to n, so assume the minimal degree, the degree of these guys, no, the degree of these curves. Assume this. Okay, then what we conclude is that we do in fact get a splitting when we pull back. Okay, so if you pull back the variation, you get some splitting. You get some splitting, some non-trivial splitting, where this U is sort of universally computing the fixed part of the fibers. Okay, that's just by push-pulling and downstairs. This is just you push forward and pull back, pull back, and be. And where this W is non-trivial. Okay, so this is by assumption non-trivial. And this is also non-trivial. Why is that? Well, the tangent bundle always has at least one positive factor, namely the tangent bundle of the curve. Factor namely, the tangent bundle of the curve. Okay, so this can't be zero because the positive stuff has to live here, right? This is universally computing the degree zero part of the restriction of the tangent. Okay, so the goal now, and this will give us the contradiction with the irreducibility of the variation, is to descend this down to B. Okay, so we have to be a little careful here. So it's instructive to give a non-example here, which is the following. Take S over P1 and elliptic K3 and consider X to be the Hilbert square, which then Square which then maps down to p2. Okay, so obviously there's like a covering family of curves over here for which the variation has a fixed part. Okay, so if you know p2 looks like this, if I just go up to p1 cross p1, right, you know, in how to say over any point, the fibers here are just the two corresponding fibers of this. And so I can fix one of them or I can fix the other. Okay, and the monodrome. Okay, and the monodromy interchanges those down here, but upstairs, those just become the two fiber directions. Okay, so downstairs, we have lines along which the variation is a fixed part, and sort of upstairs they correspond to these two directions. And these two upstairs, we can separate the two components of this decomposition. Okay, so we're trying to get a contradiction, but whatever we do here shouldn't be ruling this out because this happens. Okay, that's the only point I. Okay, that's the only point I wanted to make. Okay, so point one: any curve that meets the interior is free by the semi-positivity and Semi-positivity and therefore its deformations are unobstructed. Therefore, this map is smooth there at any point on that curve. Okay, so any curve meeting B naught, yeah, and it has a semi-positive restriction of the tangent bundle, so its deformations are unobstructed. Call that discrete. And therefore, the G is smooth along points of that curve. Smooth along points of that curve. Therefore, G is smooth as points of that curve. So that means this curly C to B is smooth above B naught. So, in particular, that means if I form the Stein factorization, we take the Stein factorization. This is a proper map, so I can take a Stein factorization. So I can take a stein factorization. Wherever this map was smooth, this map is going to be a tau. Okay? So Z0 to B is a tau. Okay, so all the ramification happens above the discriminant. Okay, we know that here, because somehow the discriminant, I mean, it has some random pieces, but there's also the sort of. Pieces, but there's also the sort of diagonal on P2, which looks like a conic. And up here, that looks like this. Yes, that looks like sorry, I didn't finish my thought. And so there's the other random fibers, but like off of these low side of this map is fixed point-free, and therefore it's a fun. Okay, point two. So, what is the Stein factorization? Any point of the Stein factorization comes with a connected component of the fiber, of the corresponding fiber of this map. So, it comes with a connected component of rational curves that go through the image in B. Okay, so Z inside of Z comes with With connected component of a connected component curly CZ of curves that pass through the imaging game. Okay. And somehow, I mean, the whole game here, I mean, this descent may seem like a silly thing. Descent may seem like a silly thing, but it's a large part of the game because, again, in this example, it happens that upstairs it splits. So, somehow showing that the fibers of this map G are connected is a non-trivial step here. So, this connected family of rational curves sweeps out CZ sweeps out some sub-variety PZ inside of B. Inside of B, which contains the point that Z maps to. Okay, so over here, you know, you choose a connected component of the fiber. That's like one of these two. Okay. And well, in this case, the PZ that it sweeps out is just this rational curve. And then the other connecting component gives you this rational curve. And that corresponds to that way. Okay. Okay, once we get this sort of this point is not okay now. Here's the here's the observation. Remember, the F1 of W computes the positive part of the restriction of the tangent bundle, which is the tangent space to this locus, right? Because this is the sort of locus swept up by curves that pass through Z, and its deformation space is sort of tangent fields on the curve that vanish at Z. On the curve that vanishes at z, and that's going to kill the degree zero part. So it's only going to see the positive part. Okay, so what we're saying is that if we take the F1 part of this of the splitting, we get that the pullback of the tangent bundle splits into F1U and F1W. And this F1W is universally computing the tangent space of this locus. Okay, so in this picture, all we're saying is that, you know, if you choose one of the two, you know, a connected component at this point, that's like choosing one of these directions. And the part of the variation that's moving is the tangent direction here. And the part of the variation that's moving in this direction is the tangent. Moving in this direction is the change. Okay, sorry, I want to leave this up as long as possible. So let me, now that we know this, let me erase it. Okay, here's like a geometric fact that we need, which is that if I take two different Z's that lie above the same point, in other words, if I take two connected components of rational curves through a point that are different. That are different, the sort of spaces, the subroutines they sweep out have distinct tangent spaces. Okay, so the PZs through the same point don't intersect. Different these at the same point don't intersect. Yeah, that's somehow in this picture. You know, this is saying that like this curve corresponds to one choice of connected moment, this is another one, and the tangent, the two tangent directions are always distinct. They never coincide. Okay, four. So here's maybe the main step in this last part. So we have this etau cover Z0 to B0. We can restrict it to C, any one of you know, a generic one of these C's, and we want to say that this cover splits entirely, splits completely above C. Okay, and this is uh this is worth drawing a picture. Erased that. But so we have a curve C inside of B, okay? And at every point, we have this decomposition on the level of variations of the Podge structures, whose F1 piece is separating out the tangent space of the connected component of curves that C lives in, which sort of goes in this direction, and sort of the other ones. Maybe we have these. We have, you know, these. These are my PZs. So there's one preferred one that's the direction that C is moving in, and then there's the F ones. Okay, but we already said that this one, the one that corresponds to the direction of the curve that you're moving in, corresponds to the F1 of W. Okay? And by using, well, something like in SAI in a second, basically using the fact that this decomposition respects isotopic pieces, Respects isotopic pieces, that means that the tangents for all of these other PZs are necessarily in U. These guys are in U. The F1 U. Okay, so again, to recap, you know, we have a splitting of the tangent bundle along this curve where there's two flat factors, a W and a U. The W is the sort of tangent space. W is the sort of tangent space of the locus swept out by C. Okay, and the other ones are the tangent spaces to the locus swept out by sort of the conjugates of C, but they're all contained in U, and so they're fixed. That's the main point. All these guys are fixed as we move along C, and this subspace is also fixed as I move along C because it's just the direction of C. Oops, sorry. So the choosing, you know, a You know, the restriction of this to C is the cover of C where I choose a connected family of curves passing through the corresponding point of C, which by what I said earlier is equivalent to choosing the tangent direction of the locus swept out by those curves. But all of those are constant as I move along the curve. Okay, so that means that that cover just flips. Okay, so let me write that. You know, the cover, this cover, let me call it P. Cover, let me call it P. So P inverse C to C, maybe I'll put the C naught, is the cover, is the cover corresponding to choosing one of these connected components of the family curly Z over that point of C naught. That point of C naught. So choosing, you know, for any B in here, you choose a CZ for which the Z lies over B. Okay, but choosing this connected family of curves is the same as choosing the tangent direction it sweeps out, which along the curve are just constant along C are constant. Okay, so now we're just choosing one of however many, you know, sub-spaces of potentially field that are locally constant. And so that's some constant, that's some totally disconnected cover. Okay, so again, we see that over here, right? Take this cover, restrict to this curve. The inverse image is just this union, and it splits completely. Each of these has degree one. Each of these has degree one. Okay, so yeah, we haven't yet, you know, not ruled that out. So now we're going to, so five, and here's the main difference. This is going to imply that Z over B is unramped. Okay, so why is that? Okay, so why is that? Well, well, you know, again, we shouldn't be ruling this out. So, what is bad about this situation? Well, I'm taking a covering family of curves that isn't the entire family of curves, right? All of this covering family of curves downstairs are lines that are tangent to this connect. Okay, so I'm not taking the full space of lines inside of P2. I'm just restricting to the lines that cover that are tangent to this conic. That's a covering family of P1s. Connect. That's a covering family of P1s on which I have the splitting of the variation of Hodge structures. Okay. But that is weaker than having a splitting of the variation of Hodge structures on the entire deformation space of some rational curves. And why is that weaker? Well, for a generic curve in this family, because the tangent model is semi-positive, the curve is free. So I can deform it so it's transverse to the boundary. And deform. And form let's see so transverse to the discriminant, okay, which means that every boundary component that C hits, this map cannot ramify. Okay, but now we use that b2 is equal to one, so every component of the discriminant is ample, and so it has to hit every component. So it must hit every component. Every component since B2 is one. And so you see the only way that this is possible is because my covering family of curves is always tangent to the ramification locus, which is why I can have the splitting upstairs, but a ramified map over which the splitting occurs. Over here, since we're using the total sort of deformations. Using the total sort of deformation space of these curves, it implies that this has been ramified, yada yada yada. Okay, now to conclude, last point, six. So B is simply connected. So Z is B. Okay, so now the splitting happens over B. Maybe I should. Happens over B. Maybe I should have observed that, you know, in this time factorization, there's no difference between the fundamental, you know, how to say the fundamental group, map of fundamental groups here surjects. So if I have a splitting of local systems that are pulled back up here, I have a splitting downstairs. Okay, so I equally well get a splitting on Z a non-trivial splitting on Z. Well, Z is B. Therefore, we have V is equal to U plus W. Is equal to u plus w contribution. So, so again, just to sum up the logic, but maybe it gets a little confused. We assume there is some curve of anti-canonical degree less than or equal to n. Therefore, the sort of minimal rational curve that meets b naught has, sorry, we assume there's one curve that meets b naught degree less than or equal to n. So the minimal one that meets b naught has degree less than or equal to n. e to be not as v less than or equal to n. We form this family by the Hodge module stuff, we get a splitting and by sort of analyzing the geometry of this family, we deduce that the cover over which that splitting is defined is actually trivial and so we get a splitting downstairs and that's a construction. Okay, all right, so I have a couple of minutes left. So the sort of obvious question is, what about trying to do the general Trying to do the general case, you know, where B is not assumed to be smooth. Okay, well, the thought about this a while. It's a sort of history here is that sort of this, I don't know, maybe we figured it out in February, and then we spent a while trying to do the singular case. And the singular case is hard. I'm not going to lie. The singular case is hard. I'm not gonna lie. The main issue as far as using any of these tools is that the deformation theory of rational curves, you know, the same thing that happened in the minimal model program. The deformation theory of rational curves is hard on singular spaces. Deformation theory is hard. I think maybe to answer your question is sort of you, you know, somewhere along the line, you produce some, it's important that you take the minimal degree rational curve, and you want to know that that does deform to give you the whole to the whole thing. Now, what could happen is you have some covering family of rational curves, but it's only by taking the minimal degree one that you get a splitting of the variation, but maybe you don't know that that minimal degree one sweeps out all. That minimal degree one sweeps out all of B. And that's why we need the semi-positivity for the Hodge module thing, even for curves that might meet the bad part of the discriminant. There, you don't really know what's going on just in terms of completing extension. And that's exactly what breaks down in the singular case. If you, you know, you still have a version of this theorem of Miyoka-Cho Shepard-Bear, except now if you have a curve that sort of goes to a bed, like the singular locus in particular. Like the singular locus in particular, then you don't know how to deform it off of that. And so you don't know where to go. And maybe I'll stop there. Underline this.
