Okay, so the upstart of my talk, of course, is that we will consider these a priori estimates of possibly sign-changing solutions to various superlinear parabolic problems. And we will also mention some of their applications on blow-up rates, energy blow-up, existence of non-trivial steady state, and so on. And the methods which I will use in order to prove this approach estimate are based on energy. Estimates are based on energy, interpolation, and a bootstrap argument. And in fact, first we've discussed some known results and local problems, old ones, and then we will consider also problems with non-local nonlinearities, and I will present some new results. Okay, not only non-local nonlinearities, but also non-local differential operators, for example, fraction Laplace. Okay, so the typical problem I have in mind is just its parabolic problem, u sub t. It's a parabolic problem u sub t plus some well differential operator in x, a of u. This a can also depend on u, in fact, equals to some nonlinear function f of u, where f can again be a non-non possibly non-local operator. But what is important here that I will always consider non-linearities, say script f, such that uh there exists a potential to this to this uh non-linearity. To this nonlinearity, that means we will have an energy for this problem, an energy functional. And usually, I will consider this initial data, u0. And for simplicity, let me just consider the Dirichert problem. That means either U equals zero on the boundary, if you have a local operator, or U equals zero in the complement of omega, where omega is either bounded or unbounded. But in any case, I was assumed that the bound. In any case, I would assume that the boundary of omega is sufficiently smooth. And this function u again can be either scalar or vector valued. It is not important here. The important fact is really the, say, the gradient structure that you have a potential here. And the typical result I have in mind, I would like to show you, is that for many of such problems, you can show that the solution at time t, the norm of the solution, can be estimated by a constant, which only depends. Which only depends on the norm of the initial data and possibly some epsilon, where this epsilon is zero if you consider global solutions defined on zero infinity. And well, usually epsilon is positive if t is finite, but in some cases you can also allow epsilon equal to zero, even if capital is finite. And in most of the cases I will consider today, I will take this norm to be the L-infinity norm, but again, this is not important. But again, this is not important. You simply consider some norm where the problem is well posed. Okay, so the most simple example we can start with is the so-called Fujita equation. So just consider this parabolic problem, u sub t minus Laplacian of U equals u to the power p in omega cross zero t, u equals zero on the boundary, and this initial data. Initial data, and for simplicity now, let me start with the case where we have a scalar function u, so you have capital N equal to one, u0 is in L infinity, the set omega will be bounded, and let me consider first the global solution, that means capital T equals infinity, and this exponent P is always greater than one, so we have a superlinear problem. And classical result by Thierry Kazanov and Pierre Williams, which are. Kerry Kazanov and Pierre Lyons, which are only 40 years old, tells you that this a priori estimates, which are written down here for these global solutions, are true whenever this exponent p is less than the so-called Kaznav-Leon's exponent 3n plus 8 over 3n minus 4, when is the dimension of Rn. And the arguments which they used were based on energy estimates and interpolation. Interpolation, and I will explain these arguments slightly later in more detail. In fact, this exponent, if n is at least two, is definitely less than the critical sobo exponent. And in fact, Kazanav Leonos were also able to prove boundedness of all global solutions or in the whole subcritical case. But then the estimate of UT depended on the Depended on the initial data, not just on the normal initial data, but on the initial data itself. And this weaker type of estimate is not so important, but it can be used in the applications I have in mind. And the first application of this result, Kazan of Lyons, was done probably by Giga and Cohn in 87. In fact, what they did, they used these arguments, but not for this original equation. They considered the solution of this problem for Of this problem for finite time, they assume that the solution blows up at capital T, and then they rescale the problem using backward simulator variables, and they proved the corresponding estimate for the solutions of the rescaled problem. And this enabled them to show that the blow-up estimate for this original problem is the standard type one blow-up provided. Blow up provided omega is convex. And again, this assumption was P less than this exponent PCL. And then, well, 15 years later, I was able to say, improve these arguments by Casanaville and to show that, in fact, for this original problem, you have these a priori estimates AE in the whole subcritical range. And this is optimal. You cannot cross I mean PS. Cross sign in PS is well known. And the only additional argument which I used was a bootstrap argument, which I again will describe slightly later. And well, very soon, of course, I mean Giga, Matsuin Sasayama again used these arguments also for the risk-height problem. And therefore, they obtained this Bohabrade estimate in the full subcritical range. This was in 2004. And then later, there were There are several results again for the risk problem and the corresponding blower estimates for problems where you perturb the nonlinearity per bin Guin in the perturbation function h of u with some control of the growth. And then recently, Ham Zanzag proved the same result also for u to the power p times logarithm of 2 plus u squared. And Zang Peso did the same also for the system. Same also for the system of the vector value case. In fact, as we will see, if you perturb the nonlinearity here, then it's very easy to see that all these arguments easily pass through and you get the apparent result for the perturbed problem. But this is not so clear in the case of the risk scale problem. Because once you perturb, for example, in this way, the non-linearity, then in the well, Uh, in the well, after rescaling, you obtain something which is non-autonomous and you use the standard Lyapunov functional. So it's very difficult to find a suitable Lyapunov functional in that case. So these results are really highly non-trivial. I mean, it's not just a straightforward application of the result of the estimate for the original problem. Okay. So let me now mention some further results of this type. Results of this type for more general problems. In fact, already in 2003, I proved that these estimates remain true also for general second-order operators. This capital T can also be finite. Well, this omega can be even unbounded, the whole of Rn, and the F of U can be a general function f, which just satisfies the inequality of this types. You control the growth from above, from below. Above from below, but the difference P2 minus P1 should be controlled somehow. The perturbation shouldn't be too strong. And then I also showed that this result can be applied in order to show the blob of energy in the subcritical case and also continuity of the maximal existence time. And in a subsequent paper, also, I showed that this result can be used in order to prove the existence of non-trivial steady states or periodic solutions if the non-linearity depends also on time. Linearity depends also on time t in a periodic way, for example. And also with Philip Supley, we proved similar results also for problems with nonlinear boundary conditions. Here, the basic idea is the same, but some of the technicalities here are quite different from the case where you have the non-linearity in the equation. Yes? Sorry, do you think? Sorry? No, I mean, no, it it's a different. I mean, of course, some of the solutions may blow up and some are global. And if they are global, then you can show they remain bounded, and the bound can be controlled by the norm of the initial data. If they blow up, and if you slightly well. And if you slightly, well, if instead of the interval zero capital T, you consider interval zero capital T minus epsilon, then on this smaller interval, you can again control the growth of the solution just by the norm of the initial data. This is the typical result. No, no, it depends on the initial data itself. For some initial data, you have block profile, some not. But in this kind of problem, of course, you always have both global. Problems, of course, you always have both global solutions and solutions which blow up, then you have some threshold solutions. And the first, of course, application is that if you know this estimate for global solutions, then you can control also the threshold solution by continuity argument. So you know that the threshold solution doesn't blow up and that the omega limit consists of interesting things and so on. But you really have to have this estimate that you have to control, I mean, the bound on this global. Uh, I mean, the bound on this global solution just by the norm of the initial data, not on the initial data itself. There's a big difference, which often is somehow in many papers, it's in there are false arguments because they exchange this reply. Okay, so then slightly later, we also wish because I was reading Thomas Barge, and he was interested in say existing steady states and connecting orbits. So, we applied, I mean, this is. orbits so we apply time i mean these arguments also to the problem where you have some function a of x in front of this nonlinearity where this function a may change time and then the arguments of course are not so easy and then in fact i in the original paper i i proposed two different schemes how how you can use this bootstrap and the second scheme worked here but on not in the full subcritical range but only for some for people Range, but only for some for P less than some P hat, where P hat was close to the subcritical, well, to the Sobov subcritical, to the Sobolev exponent, but it was not equal. And then, of course, there were many applications by other authors. So, here I just listed some early applications here up to 2009, and then some recent ones. They all deals. Well, I mean, in this paper, as always, either the results or the arguments, the bootstrap arguments were used in this first case. In this first case, the auto-study convergence to equilibria in the whole space. Then, this auto-study the properties, the fine properties of the maximal existence time, invariant sets, high-energy initial data, settle for dynamics, existence of controls, multiplicity of equilibria, global dynamics, and so on. And these two recent results, which I mentioned here, in fact, the estimates which I will show you can be done also. Will show you can be done also in the supercritical and critical case, but in that case, you cannot control the L-infinite norm, just some weaker norm. The same estimate can be done, but you obtain just estimates of some weak norm where the problem need not be well posed. But still, these weaker estimates can be used. For example, this was done by Duke, and he proved that, in fact, assuming that you have a blow-up in the supercritical case or critical case, and you can control the energy, then you obtain. Energy, then you obtain some more precise estimates on the measure of the blow up set, for example. So, this can be used also in the supercritical case, which is not just restricted to supercritical case. I mean, these arguments I mentioned here. And also, Zichi Wang, with his student, considered, I mean, this Schrodinger-type system, and they used the corresponding parabolic flow in order to show that there exists. To show that there exists a radial solutions for this system, is prescribed number of sign changes for each component, which is not so easy to be done in a parallel method. And in fact, in this case, they used only the estimates of Casnablion's because you may notice that they consider just the diameter less than or equal to three, and this cubic nonlinearity is then, I mean, this exponent three is less than the exponent of Casanova Leon. So it's not necessary to do bootstrap. And in fact, you could not do use. And in fact, you could not use bootstrap because they assumed this negative sign for this beta ij. And therefore, I mean, in this case, this bootstrap doesn't work so nice. But I was able to prove that, in fact, at least in some special case for two components and this particular choice of BI, you can still get the appreciation with the full subcritical range. So instead of three, you can consider power non-initiated, well, some exponent P less than PI. Some exponent p less than ps, and but these arguments were based on uh UL type terms, so this is a different. Maybe if I have time, so on the last slide, I may say something about it, okay. So, but of course, this is a non-local conference, so let me switch to non-local problems. So, here assuming on the slide that A is just minus Laplacian, n equals one, omega is bounded. And already in my paper in 2003, I shown that these arguments can also be used. Shown that these arguments can also be used if you consider, say, non-local non-linearity on the right-hand side of this type or this type. In this case, you had Neumann boundary conditions here. Also for more general problems, if n equals one. And my postdoc, I mean slightly later, considered also this problem with F1, but instead of alpha positive, he considered alpha negative. This also can be done. And Isabelliani, Isabelliani again used similar arguments, first for this cartile nonlinearity of this type, which we are frequently used, and also for nonlinearity of the form which is parallelity u to the power q, plus or minus, I mean, this F3. And in fact, again, in this case of F3, she considered just the spatial dimension n equal to 3 and p equal to 2. To three and p equal to two, which is the most classical case, of course. But in this case, again, I mean, this exponent two is well much less than even the exponent of Casna-Lyons. So it was sufficient to use this Casino-Lyons technique. In this case, she used also the Bootstrap argument because she considered this Q to be just less than the critical servable exponent. But in this case, in fact, if Q is large, you can use just Casino Leon's, then you can. Can use just Kazanavians, then you can consider this S3 just as a perturbation of this non-linearity. So, this is not so important. And so, it was interesting. So, the first motivation was for me to try to use these booster arguments for this non-EMT S3, but with general NFP. And in fact, the reason also was that such problems have been studied by many authors, but either these authors did not prove, I mean, the corresponding apparelist. Not prove, I mean, the corresponding error estimates, or their assumptions were very restrictive. For example, in a recent paper by Li and Liu, 2020, the authors assumed that the exponent P is less than the Fujita exponent, which is very small in some sense. So therefore, I tried to show that, in fact, you can improve, I mean, this exponent P. Okay, so the first result, I will mention also other results, but let me first consider this treatment, this particular problem. So let me just consider the standard Laplacian. Considered a standard Laplacian, and on the right-hand side, you have the Chokrat type nonlinearity. It's, of course, well known that you have a potential to this. And again, zero boundary condition and this initial condition. And let me denote by P star this strange exponent. I will explain later where does it come from? And this P Cl this exponent of Casanova Leons. And the first theorem dealing with this problem is that if you have a bounded domain and the P is less than And the p is less than this p star, and you have a global solution of this problem, then these a priori estimates are true. So, you can, of course, you can also prove the local estimates and all the applications, but basically like this. And if you want to understand what this P star means, so you can look at this table. So, if n equals to 2, so we should replace this by infinity. In fact, there's no restriction while the PCL is 7. PCL is seven. If n equals to three, for example, then the critical subloacton is five. I mean, this p-star is something like 4.6 by approximately, and PCL is 3.4. And Isabell Yanni studied the problem with this P equal to 2. And this exponent considered by Li and Yu is just 1.6 periodic. And similar, of course, comparison can be done for other, I mean, dimensions. Okay. In fact, I. Okay, uh in fact I will try to to give you also the schedule of the proof and then you then you will see why this exponent or where does this exponent comes from. So let me continue with another problem, which is just again just a model problem. Consider just the power non-linearity on the right-hand side, but now let me consider fractional Laplacian instead of standard Laplacian. It's alpha between one and zero. And now u equals zero, so you consider the Richard problem. And by ps. Problem and by ps, now dependent on alpha is the corresponding critical subal exponent. And again, the corresponding theorem: now, if omega is bounded and p is less than the critical subalex, and you have a global solution to this problem, then always you have the corresponding priority estimates. And now the result is true in the whole subcritical range. Again, this is optimal. And in fact, as we will see in the proofs, hope, still time enough. Still, time enough, then the result is basically the same as in the case alpha equal to one. The only difference is that you have to know some nice properties of this linear operator on the left-hand side. Basically, it has an LP maximal regularity. So you can estimate the time derivative in this LPLQ space, that is a different P than this one, by the corresponding LPLQ estimate of the right-hand side. Q estimate of the right-hand side. I'm sorry, this P is not the same as this P. And basically, this was proved by Brou in a series of paper, and she considered much more general photo-differential operators. And she was able also to specify the domain, specifically domain of definition of the Tirichlet fractional Laplacian, which is so-called alpha transmission space. It's a bit more complicated than in a standard case, where you have just H2 alpha Q, but still. To alpha q, but still this space has nice properties. It's embedded in the corresponding LR spaces, and this condition is the same as in the case where you have H2 alpha Q here. And of course, you could consider many other examples, many other problems. For example, instead of the fractional Laplacian, you could consider, I mean, this non-local operator, depending on U. This study also, I mean, shows you, I think, in similar examples. Similar examples where, for example, this A is a continuous positive function with some time and the element of half or not? No, we consider global solutions here. So it's for all time. I see there's a solution of three, and here you have infinity, so I consider global solutions. Of course, you can prove again the same results also for T. The same results also for t finite, but then you obtain the results on zero capital T minus epsilon, and then that constant depends also on epsilon. So here, for simplicity, I just consider global solutions, but it's mentioned on the next slide, in fact, that, of course, you can also prove the corresponding estimate for finite time intervals. And then, assuming, of course, the conditions on P, you can also show that if you have blow-up, then the energy has to blow up. Blow up, then the energy has to blow up in this case, and the maximal existence time depends continuously. And also, if you consider all initial data for which the solution is global, then this set of initial data is closed in the corresponding topology. So, the threshold solutions exist globally, and so on. Okay, and then if you have something on the boundary of this set, so then you obtain an interesting dynamical behavior. Okay, so let me now continue with the sketch of the proof. Of the proof. So we will assume that alpha is either between 0, 1 or 1, and p is subcritical, omega-bounded for simplicity t equals infinity. And this operator is either fractional Laplacian or Laplacian. And Fu is either U to the power P or this Rockardite nonlinearity in the case of alpha Q to 1. And then the corresponding energy E can be written in this form, where this phi of U is simply just Of u is simply just suitable constant times this nonlinearity times u integrated over omega. And if you multiply the equation by u, what you obtain, you obtain the derivative of the L2 norm, which is just this one, is, well, just this, this is the right-hand side multiplied by u. And then this can be expressed in the form constant times the energy plus something positive, which can be estimated below by the L2 norm to. The L2 norm to the power of p plus one, and you obtain a blow-up type inequality, which guarantees, first of all, that the energy has to stay non-negative, otherwise you would have blow-up, and you assume that you have a global evolution, and also that the L2 norm has to stay bounded, because otherwise, again, this would imply blow-up. And then, also, integrating, of course, you obtain that the L2 norm of the time derivative can be estimated by the energy, and it only depends on constant which. It only depends on constant, which depends on the norm of the initial data. And now, so these are energy estimates. And then what you do, you take the L P plus one norm to the power p plus one and to the power q. And this can be, I mean, just this norm, u to the power p plus one, p plus one can be expressed in this form. This is just, I mean, oh, sorry, expressed. This can be estimated by this. Press. This can be estimated by this term. Sorry. And then using this equality here, you obtain that this can be estimated above by this term. And what Kazanavanius did, if Q equals to 2, then you can use just Cauchy inequality and use this fact, these two facts here, to show that this is estimated by a constant. And therefore, at this, if Q equals to 2, you obtain that U is bounded. You obtain that U is bounded in these spaces, and by interpolation, you obtain the estimate in a suitable ls norm where s is less than some exponent. And then if q equals 2, alpha equals 1, and p is Lyons exponent, then this s is already greater than the exponent which is necessary for the well-positiness, so we obtains of the L-infinity bounds. And our aim is now to increase this Q to obtain, I mean, this estimate for any These estimates for any Q greater than or equal to 2, and then you obtain the corresponding estimates, of course, for I mean, without this technical assumption. Well, so recall from the previous slide that you have, I mean this estimate here, and for Q equal to 2 also this one, and you want to increase this Q. This is the Bootstrap argument. So, what do you do? First, you use this inequality, this new Q tilde. Then you here, you use Hilda. Here you use Helder inequality and the estimate which you already have from the previous step. Then you use interpolation. Then, in the next step, again, you use Helder inequality and the fact that this integral is finite by the energy estimates. So, you obtain just this one. And then you use maximal regularity to show that this can be controlled by the corresponding norm of the right-hand side. And now, the bootstrap condition which will guarantee that you can increase this Q is just that this term. This q is just that this term here should be less than or equal to c times p u to the power q because this is controlled by a constant. So, in fact, this can be done for in a very general way for abstract non-linearities. The only thing which you know which you have to show is something like this. You have to estimate the right the LR norm of the right-hand side by the potential to some to this power. And this q tilde should. To this power, and this q tilde should be greater than this q. And in fact, if you consider this u to the power of p, then it's very easy. You can just choose because there is a choice, there is a possibility how to choose this r, you choose r equal to p plus one plus p. And then in that case, this is precisely equal to be this stuff. And if you plug, if you use this, then you obtain that this is true for any q. So you will obtain, I mean, what you want it to have. If you use this non-locality, then this is more difficult. So the best thing I. This is more difficult, so the best thing I could get with this choice of R is indicated here. I obtain this estimate here, maybe some constant here. And then again, this is true for any Q, but not for all P, but only for P less than P star. So here is the technical condition where this comes from. And the last slide, which I have here, deals with, say, Louis theorems. In fact, the reason why I use these old arguments based on an Based on energy and interpolation is that, in fact, in the case of Liouville theorems, of course, in the elliptic case, elliptic Liouville theorems are corresponding to the universal estimates, because Louis theorems can be used in order to get much better estimates. So these are known in the local case by Gidazprage, and Li, and in the non-local case, but for the fractional Laplacian, again by Chen and Li, but much later. Lee, but much later. And in the parabolic case, well, I proved the corresponding Lewis theorem recently in the local case for Laplacian in the full subcritical range, but they are not known if alpha less than one, just in a very particular case. And the problem is that you cannot generalize, well, do this with alpha less than one because you do not have the required non-tropic monotonic formula for the rescalic. Motonic formula for the rescale equation. There is a recent paper by Deng, CRA, and Wu, who did it for the Halat Laplacian, but only for n equals 3 and 4, and P restricted to some smaller interval. And in fact, it's not clear to me whether this monotonous informula in this paper could be used to prove this Louvre theorem. So, in fact, here there's an open problem to prove the corresponding Liouville theorem for alpha less than one. On the other hand, if F u equals H of X one times U to the power of H of x1 times u to the power p, where h satisfies suitable motion assumptions. Then, if alpha equals one, both elliptic and parabolic Liouville terms are known, due to Yi Hong Du and Li, and Peter Polachik and myself for the elliptic and the parabolic case. And this Liouville term combined with the Liver theorem for this non-linearity can be used in order to get uploaded estimates for problems with F u equals A of X times U to the power P by. A of x times u to the power p where a changes sine. If alpha less than one, again, both elliptic and parabolic global terms are known in this case, because the reason is that here you just use moving planes and that are similar as here. And the moving plane arguments can be used both for local and non-local in the local and non-local case. But well, the other arguments by Gidas and Sprague or by myself, I mean, it's not clear how to use them in the for the fractional applian. Use them in the for the fractional appliances. So that's all I would like to thank you for your attention.
