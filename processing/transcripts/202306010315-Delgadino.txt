And I please. All right, so what's the idea of the talk? The idea is to borrow some ideas that were recently developed for the aggregation diffusion equation, which we have seen for several different talks, at least usually mostly in the two species case, but this is like the single species problem. Okay, so the idea that we're going to be considering is that we have some non-local, some non-linear or linear. Some non-linear or linear diffusion, and then we have some attractive kernel W. And so the idea is that W here will always look like this. Okay, so this is my kernel W, which means that particles that are far away want to try to start condensing to air. And usually in these attraction-repulsion models, this is usually the idea of them. The idea of them, like the one that Jose presented yesterday, would be when you have some continued type in which you are trying to push things away with a higher order term. And then the diffusion, which I have in my first equation, is now trying to put things together. And so what I'm going to be working on, as I said, was like some using some non-local some ideas. Some non-local, some ideas of the non-local theory for the aggregation-diffusion equation into something that has a fraction of the plasma. So, the idea is that we can borrow the same type of variations that we were taking in this equation to work for some problem in the fraction of the film equation. And funny enough, this I guess relates back to what Irene was asking Jose in terms of like, yeah, can you take a different scaling and then you end up with a fractional thin theom equation? With a fractional thin film equation instead of the actual thin film equation. Yeah, and I will see like these guys have slightly different behavior. So yeah, I feel like if people ask me what I do, I guess it's usually gradient flows. It's the answer. So the idea is that all of these equations have some gradient flow interpretation. In this case, I'll just use the two baseline gradient flow. And you have in free energies which are of the Free energies, which are of the form of a convex and a concave one. Okay, so those are the interesting cases. Now it depends on the order of each one of them. So, you know, the LP or LM norm is at order zero, and then the convolution operator is at a negative order. And you can go the other way around, in which you take the chess norm as your diffusion, and then in this case, I'm taking the degree to be the quadratic, and the idea to take the quadratic. To be the quadratic, and the idea to take the quadratic, and this can be generalized in the sense of like any term that is here with the right sign is going to be good to do the computations that I'm trying to do. So it's more or less like you can combine all of these guys in different ways and you would still get the results that I'm talking about. But I focus on this one because it's, I guess, tying back to Jose Eduis' talks in the first talk of the conference is that. The conference is that you want to identify the variable app solutions for some type of models, and so the free energy that comes out is exactly this one. And then the free energy that Jose was like using yesterday would be the H1 norm minus the L2 norm. Okay, and this, I guess, like really highlights, you know, convex concave. But now the concept of convex concave changes with respect to your interpolation. Respect to your interpolation. And so the idea is that you can change your interpolation between objects to perhaps uncover some convexity on it. Okay, so convexity in the linear sense is not the same as Baselstein convexity, and it's not going to be the same convexity I'm going to talk about today. Okay, and so these are just the gradient flow type equations in which we have a continuity equation with some mobility m of u, which can model. Can model any sort of how does the speed change with respect to what is the density? And then the pressure or the velocity field is just the gradient of the first variations of these energies. Okay, so whatever you have this structure, like you have some sort of gradient flow interpretation, perhaps in a weak sense, but more or less the idea. Okay, so what is the general principle? General principle is u is a steady state if and only if it's a critical point of the energy. Okay, and that's the whole concept of gradient flows. So I usually when I think of gradient flows, I just think of a 1v object because in essence they behave like 1v objects. x dot is gradient of f of x. So if I have that x dot is equal to 0, then the gradient of f Of f of x. Okay, that's yeah. So, morally, the only thing that I need to kind of start thinking about is what is the energy. So, now you have to like get pretty comfortable with the energy and trying to understand what's going on. So, the problem, I mean, in 1D for an ODE, this is not much of a problem. But the idea is that when you do the Euler Lagrange conditions for this problem, what you're going to do Conditions for this problem, what you're going to be getting is a free boundary problem that depends on the support of you. Okay, and that's kind of what is going to prevent you from using more classical techniques like moving plane methods and these kind of things, because the domain, you don't know the domain where you're satisfying the equation. That's sort of the point. So, for the systems I wrote before, is that you're going to have something that looks like u to the some power plus a convolution. Some power plus a convolution is equal to a constant, but this constant can depend on the position of your in your domain. So here, if we have Rn, we can have different pieces of the domain of you. Okay, so you don't know a priori necessarily that the lambda one, lambda two, or lambda. Lambda 2 or Lambda 3 are the same constants. And so if they were the same constants, things make it much easier. And here I will always be imposing some global condition, which is that the mass is constant. But I mean, one is just a normalization. So for these free energies, the idea is that whenever you symmetrize, you're getting something better. Okay. So if I And if I symmetrize my function, I have the right inequalities. And so, depending on the terms that I'm looking at, this is called the Reese inequality, the Polysego, or the American loss. So, Polyasego, just for, I guess, reference, is when you take the gradient of F star, which is the radial decreasing rearrangement in H1 squared, is less or equal than the gradient. equals then the gradient of f in h1 squared. Okay, and all of these terms satisfy something similar. The difference is that now we can we're not looking necessarily only for global minimizers, but we're trying to understand the dynamics. So if we are trying to understand the dynamics, we need to know if there are steady states. And so one of the things that I was saying, which is the main problem, is that we have this free boundary problem in which the In which the equation is only satisfied in the support of the function. So, whenever you take a variation, you have to take a local variation in each piece of the support. So, if you take a variation, a global variation that doesn't preserve the support, then you're going to not be able to use any equation of this. So, just to say that, of course, symmetry is beautiful and you want to prove that everything is symmetric, but you know, life is not symmetric. But you know, life is not symmetric, and hence we should be like sort of going towards things that like uh exhibit patterns that we see in like in the world. So, I mean, this is just something that is probably like classically known. Um, and this is some work by Bertosi, Palaszkikov, San and Rominsky. And I guess this is the picture at least. And then there was some work afterwards that the minimizers, when you have non-local repulsion, are not going to be Are not going to be radially symmetric. Okay? So if your repulsion, instead of being some LM norm, you put some sort of negative HS, then you can see that patterns start arising, which are like different from what we're saying. And okay, I'm analyzing these type of things, just it's a completely different order of time. Okay. All right. So, but you know, with But you know, we do the easy things. So, what is the easy thing? Let's try to prove that things are symmetric. And this is a beautiful paper that was by Jose Hidmeier, Bolsoni, and Yao, in which they actually show that if doubled is attractive and not too singular, then all of the steady states of this equation have to be radially symmetric and decreasing, and the dynamics will converge towards this type of states. And the idea is that, of course, we have to take some continuous Staner symmetrization, which is some interpolation between the radial decreasing rearrangement and the function that we have already. I'll talk way more about this. This was just to sort of get the idea of how to start. So, one of the things I need to say here is they show that the Say, here is they showed that the states were regularly symmetric and decreasing, but they were not able to show at that time that they were unique. Okay, so you don't actually know what the dynamics are doing. You only know the dynamics are going to the unique steady state. I mean, if you have uniqueness, of course. And this is true when you take the potential W to be some sort of risk potential. And the idea is that, okay, so this equation is. That's okay. So, this equation is related, for instance, this is related to the HLS norm, but the proof is quite sort of surprising and rather magical in the way I have seen it, which is that they took some optimal transport interpolation, they used the Euler-Lagrange equations, and then they used Jensen's inequality to say something that is non-trivial, which is one of the few instances that I've seen this in my life. But yeah, I guess that's a polemic. Yeah, I guess that's a polemic thing to say, but I'm sure somebody will come with an application of Genesis inequality that I'll love to know. All right, so you would think that probably now that we have reduced ourselves to rarely decreasing states, everything would be unique and you have a unique critical point. But the point is that depending on the power of m, this is not actually true. So if you take the nonlinear So if you take the nonlinear diffusion with power between one and two, then you can construct some potentials W, which will not look exactly like that, in which you can have infinitely many radially decreasing critical points. Okay, so your dynamics are complicated. I mean, in the sense, like each one of these critical points, in fact, will have some basing of attraction, and it depends on what's your initial condition and depending on where you're going to converge. Depending on where you're going to converge, okay, and usually what differentiates you is like the LM norm in this case, okay. And so, as an open problem, which is actually, I think, interesting from even an applications perspective, is like if you have Brownian motion particles that are interacting through this potential W, do you actually know that you have a unique steady state or not? So, the proof that we had uses pretty strongly that. Had you sees pretty strongly that state states are going to be compactly supported. So you can basically have your potential value, cut it off somewhere, and then make it asymptotically flat so that the steady state remains a steady state. But then if you start with something flatter, it will try to get away and then we catch it again. Okay, that's more or less the idea of this proof. But this does not work with linear diffusion. And so, I mean, I think this is actually interesting, even from just the fact. Interesting, even from just the fact that a lot of models will have some similar shape like this. And what is, I guess, more surprising, or like in the other way, is that the parameter m equals to 2 is absolutely critical. And so, if you have general attractive W and your nonlinear diffusion is with power bigger than 2, and of course, we can generalize this to other sort of nonlinearities, but the sort of interesting thing. But the sort of interesting thing is that the power two actually makes a difference. You can say that this energy will emit a unique critical point. Okay, and this goes a little bit back to what I was saying earlier, that you could see the energy as a difference of a convex and a concave function. Well, it depends in which eye do you look at your energy. And so it depends if you're using the Vaster sign interpolation, if you're using linear interpolation, or if, yeah, I guess I should say that the K-Sign equation. Yeah, I guess I should say that the case n equals to two was already addressed by type and the francesco and some collaborators. So the idea is that instead of using any sort of standard interpolation, what you would actually do is, I guess, similar to saying that the pressure is the thing that you you want to be looking at in terms of the corresponding equation, the height is what you want to be looking at for non-local equations. At for non-local equations. So if you start using the height as the way of representing your function, then if you do a linear interpolation with respect to this height function, you actually obtain that both of the terms are convex under this interpolation. Okay. Yeah, so the idea is that here, if you have mass one half, and here you have this layer tape decomposition, you are sort of in each sort of You are sort of in each sort of layer, you're interpolating the height by keeping the mass constant. Okay. And it's sort of magic, but I mean, in a sense, this gives you the idea that, well, I mean, it depends how you're looking at the problem. If you are actually having a hard problem, all of a sudden it becomes convex, and then you have uniqueness of steady states. Okay, it's more or less the idea. All right, so how long? How long do I have? Let's see. Have like a little less than 10 minutes. A little less than 10 minutes. Okay, sure. All right, so we were talking about going from non-local to non-local. What is the other non-local equation? So the other non-local equation is when we are talking about sort of anomalous diffusion, which is instead of taking the Laplacian, we're taking some power of the Laplacian in which we claim, I mean, there is some fattered tales of the probability distribution. Of the probability distribution, hence particles are moving faster, farther away. That's more or less the idea. So, and this is usually the interpretation that is given. So, what I want to just present briefly is that this guy also appears naturally in fracking. So, hydraulic fracking is when you insert liquid into some, I guess it has to be an elastic solid. Solid. And so, when you introduce this liquid, the pressure of this liquid is going to create a fracture within the solid. And this is, I mean, this would be a slice of an infinite fracture going this way. And the idea is that if you project it to the to a like this single plane, you're your the equation that you're going to be getting is related to the fraction of the plasma. Fractional notches. Okay, and so of course, this happens if you're trying to extract oil, or I mean, this is one of the applications of this, but it also happens naturally if you have like magma going into some rock or even water that is fracturing some glacier somewhere. So the water itself can propagate across. And the idea is that this sort of equation is similar, really similar to the thin film equation in which thin film. Thin film equation, in which thin film equation you could be considering that is a motion by mean curvature, and here you're considering some sort of motion that's with respect to some non-local mean curvature. Okay, so that's the idea. And it's the idea is that the motion is happening because the sort of earth around you is pushing you down, pushing you back. Okay, so from the mathematical community, From the mathematical community, this equation was studied by Hmbert and Mele, in which you actually obtain exactly the half-Laplacian as the sort of pressure that is coming out from this equation. And here you have some f of t, where f of t, yeah, f of t is how much you are injecting and how strongly are you injecting into this place to see how this. See how this sort of crack is propagating. Okay, all right. So, what's the usual problem with the higher-order equations? This is there is no comparison principle. This is also non-local. And yeah, even just having to like, usually with these type of equations, if we can show existence, we are happy. And like, we are happy if we can show existence and also show that we dissipate most of the entry. We dissipate most of the entropies that we think we should be dissipating. Okay, and the idea is that if you, I mean, take a different power, you're interpolating between the Polius medium equation and the thin film equation. Okay, that's more of the idea. Okay, so just looking at this equation, we go back to Juan's talk the first day. He would say, okay, but you need to understand what is the scaling loss. And in fact, the scaling laws that are interesting from the engineering perspective. From the engineering perspective, because they want to understand what is the injection rate that I need to be giving to actually have some sort of growth and what is the size of the growth. So yeah, so we are going to do the sort of bio and blood rescaling, which I love Filippo's yesterday, bar and blood rescaling. There is two functions, pi and psi, that this just happens and it's magic. And then we're going to go to continuous timer symmetrization, but I don't think I have time. And then using Think I have time, and then using the ideas from before, we can prove the uniqueness of the barren blood profile. Um, so I would uh I would have to say that uh Juan Luis had already studied this equation and they were able to prove that under after you do the barn-blood rescaling, you are going to converge to some steady state of the equation that I was writing before with regularity H1 plus S. And they're able to identify that B tau satisfies. Identify that B tau satisfies some free boundary problem, which is like some sort of obstacle problem, but they were not able to identify which one it was. And the idea is that using these symmetrization techniques, you can actually identify what the limiting solution is. Okay, so yeah, so writing down the equation a bit nicer, the idea is that you have this d tau v and the divergence of v with this. Of v with this velocity field here, and so this is equal to zero means that you have some sort of obstacle problem that is only satisfied on the positivity set where you have a different constant at each different connected component. Okay, so if you cannot show that you have a single connected component, this problem becomes a nightmare. And even if you show that you have a single connected component, you still need to work to actually get what. To work to actually get what the profile needs to be. Okay, so this is like the result. And I guess we didn't catch the right regularity yet, but that's just a matter of keeping working. That if you have a solution to the steady state that is regular enough, then it has to be equal to the radially symmetric decreasing. And here it depends on the power of the Laplace and Inesse. What is the tail behavior? What is the tail behavior? Okay, and this goes the other way around from the porous medium in the sense that when you hit the boundary of your support, you're actually C1 plus S. So this is smooth in the boundary. And it doesn't have like some Lipschitz or some C alpha sort of regularity. So these guys are more regular. And okay, so I guess we the idea is like we need to hold on. The idea is like we need to hold on, yeah. You should have been three minutes, two, three minutes. Okay, so the idea is that we have to find, yeah, and I have way too many slides. So, um, so the idea we have to find a perturbation such that the energy is coming down, and this is we have to also be careful with the support. So, I mean, I guess I didn't do probably a terribly good job at using the Steiner symmetrization, but the idea is that you take a set and you replace it by a ball of the same size. Of the same size, okay. And this procedure will always reduce your perimeter. And so, if you can write any of your quantities with respect of the perimeter of the level sets, this is always going to help you. Okay, so the idea is that you want to be trying to reduce the perimeter in the quantities that we're interested in. But instead of doing it globally from one step, you want to do it locally. Okay, and so this was the introduced. was the introduced i guess before brought by some other people but this was used in the paper by um that i was mentioning before and okay so you have to have a semi-group property so it becomes a little bit more complicated but you know the the idea at least when i started doing this um based on the work of um carillo hidmeyer uh yao and bolsone is the idea is that they they're able to show that the energy decreases Able to show that the energy decreases, but they weren't quantifying it, I mean, in a sort of satisfying way. So the idea was to redo their computations using some other change of variables to actually get some more reasonable representation of what the energy looks like. And then you can actually take the derivative of this and find something which, in essence, what we're saying is that the derivative of this quantity is. Of this quantity is something that is measuring how asymmetric your function is. Okay, so morally, if you are asymmetric, then the derivative, the size of your gradient is going to be large. And that should be telling you that you should be equilibrating towards radial states at least. And then the question is: who can use this type of inequalities? Anyways, I think. Inequalities. Anyways, I think I'll stop here and thank you. So, some questions? Can you say maybe a bit more as to how do you show that there are non-unique steady state for your first model for M between one and two? Yeah, so the idea is starting with a super simple case. Starting with a super simple case in which you take the potential to be just the quadratic one. Okay, so if you take the potential to be the quadratic one, then you're going to have a steady state which is compactly supportive, and that is here. Okay, and so and then the idea is that, okay, so because this has compact support, it only sees a compact size of your potential W. Size of your potential W. So then the idea is that, okay, so what would happen if this was completely flat afterwards? So if this is completely flat afterwards, if you start with a super, super flat initial condition, you can show by the inequalities that this is going to stay flat. So and this is the staying flat is This is the staying flat is tracking, if I remember correctly, was the ln non-field function. Okay, so it's going to stay flat forever. And so the only thing that you do is you just catch it at infinity with some other guy here. And then, I mean, morally, I draw the picture: these are your two steady states, and then you just can keep doing this as many times as you can. Times as you can. The flatbot has lower energy, right? Ah, good question. I don't know. Another question please. Yeah, uh, what is the node for city states for the energy um with the hardware? Adding probably not a not additive when you're at where you not up energy, you can only guarantee you already the potentiality because I'm not sure what you're doing. So you're talking about this very much for the first part, like where you have this. Yeah, that's right. Anyway, the energy with the RTU and with the potential in W x minus y u e center. The non independent non L T U equals U to power M. M is smaller than one. That's no on the On the city states? Well, you know that they're radially symmetric and decreasing. And then, I mean, I guess they fall within the same class of the open question I was like writing down, because it kills the trick that I'm talking about here, in the sense that you cannot longer do this trick of cutting your potential and then not seeing what's going on because the support of your function sends everything. So, in a sense, this guy and this guy will be connected. So you don't have a indicating phenomena of symmetry breaking? No, no, symmetry breaking, no, no, that's that's within the theorem. Okay, that's okay. Just have clarification then and uh if you put these together with the result of uh Secatia and Marcus, then uh you get that uh everything register to the To the unique one that you find or uh so it's uh so okay, and I didn't say this. So, this this breaks down exactly at the case S less than a half. So, half is critical, and so over half these techniques don't work anymore because yeah, the derivative is not something that behaves well under the rearrangement. The derivative of the energy is not something that behaves well under the rearrangement. So there is some regularity concerns that needs to be addressed, but that's the idea would be to road towards that. Yes. Okay, so thanks again.
