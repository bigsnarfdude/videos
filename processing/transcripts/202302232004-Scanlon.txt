Okay, so uh I had a a different problem in mind, but since this is a neostability meeting, I changed my mind and I have a more neostability theoretic question. We are recording. So be careful. Be careful, Mador. So if Kim So, if M is weakly or minimal expansion of an ordered group then we say that it's non-valuational If it has no proper non-trivial complex refinable complex uploads Okay, so so those are So, the canonical example is take a dense pair of O-minimal structures and take the full-induced structure on the small model. So, this is the canonical example. Now, and this definition comes from the Th this definition comes from the uh paper of uh Charlie, Dugald and uh Dave on on weak real minimal structures and and there they actually show that if you if if you if if you have a field that is weakly or minimal and and valuational, then there is actually a definable valuation there. So that's the source of the source. So that's the source of the sort of the name. So Vensel has looked at such structures in various settings. And there's a paper of Kobe and a joint student of Oz Bori Huda, where we show that if you take such a structure and you let M star, M bar. Star and bar, sorry, be a static incompletion, and you just think of it as an ordered structure. So there's a natural order of it. And you put in it the following structure. You take, so M naturally embeds in M bar and you define a structure on M bar by just taking the zero definable subsets of M. Subsets of M, powers of M, and take their closures. So that's so you have a structure in the same signature as M. Well, you take all the zero-definable sets as your signature, and you just take their closures. Then what we show is that in that situation, the bar is O-minimal, and if you look at the structuring it induces on M, it is precisely. Induces on M, it is precisely the structure you started with, up to a change of signature. So now, and we also have the theory, and this looks very much like a dense pair. I mean, if you look at the pair M R M, then everything we know about dense pairs is true about this. So it has the same quantifier elimination, the same O minimal open core, whatever. Open core, whatever we know about quickly o minimal structures, we know about this. About tens pairs, we know about this. So now here's the question. So here we have an O minimal structure. Suppose it interprets a field. Does this structure interpret the field? Have you looked at this Eric Walter stuff? I think it's related, but. I think it's related, but I couldn't find. So he finds examples of structures, they're not a minimal to begin with, where you have a field in the shell series function, but there's no trace of a field in the original structure. Yeah, so it's in the p-adics, actually. It has also manpairs, I think, over years. So I haven't looked at the final version of this paper. The original version of the paper Original version of the paper, which was more accessible to me, I could not find a solution to this question. It may well be that somewhere there's a counterexample, but I think that the weekly or minimal non-valuational structures are somehow harder to come by. I mean finding examples that are not coming from dense pairs is is not completely trivial. Completely trivial. Why do you need the non-version? Otherwise, I don't know anything about this completion. I mean, it ought to be o-minimal. I mean, here it's just that you have the trichotomy for the o-minimal structures. So this naturally gives you a dichotomy for M. And the question is, can you identify it already on the level of M itself? Because Level of M itself because this is not M eq or anything. I mean, it's like taking MEQ and putting it in one structure, in one sort. If you did that, but this is not something that M sees on its own right. So the question is, if you find a field here, must there be a field around here? There's another question around this that I also find intriguing. I don't know what it means, but this LR, right? This n-bar, you take all the definable cuts from n and you put them here. So the question is, and there are examples, not many, but there are examples where you need only one definable family of cuts, where m is not a minimum. So by plugging in one definable family of cuts, you complete the, you find the full deleted completion. And the question is, if that is the situation, If that is the situation, can it be that M bar interprets a phenomen? Must it be that if this occurs, then M bar must be linear as a nominal structure. Can I ask a related question? Do we know trichotamine non-valuation of weakling structures? No. No? Only in that, that's the closest direction. In that, that's the closest I managed to get. So, connumeration seems to be a context, reasonable context where one might still expect find a centralized. Yeah, I mean, so many things behave a bit like in the ominous setting. It's not as rich a situation as the valuational one, but I think that it gives rise to intriguing multi-ready questions. I mean, so if you take, for example, If you take, for example, if you take an expansion of this set by just adding one sort, one sort of definable cuts that does not give you the whole of M bar. You lose all the structure. It's not quite o-minimal. It's probably not a group. It's terrifically ugly. Yet, the deck incompletion is o-minimal. The structure it includes. The structure it induces on it is precisely the structure you started with. So there's a lot of tameness, but how do you detect it on M itself? What are the model theoretic properties of M that tell you that this is in some way a tame structure? So there's a lot of intriguing questions there. I never personally pursued them because it got a bit hard for me, but maybe smarter people can. All right, thanks. Thank you. All right, thanks. Thank you. So I think Jim had some questions since. I have a whiskey-induced question. Yeah, so my question is My question is sort of related to the Borvik Cherlin, but more general and not in a necessarily stable context at all. So just to remind you, I have some definable group action, and this is what I'll call definably primitive. If there is no So definable G equivariant equivalence relation on X. So no way to take a quotient by an equivalence relation so that which respects G, except for the trivial one. Pardon me? Finally, finite is agreement. Pinite? What is? Just none except for the relation that makes everything equivalent or everything inequivalent. Those ones I'll call true. Okay. I'll say. Okay. So, all right, in this general context, then G, acting on facts, I'll call generically n-transitive. Not the same definition as before. If there is an orbit O of the diagram, the diagram is a very important Of the diagonal action of g on x to the n with the property that x to the n take away O is small in the spirit, say, of our team's talk. That could mean various things. So then the general question is In terms of some dimension or rank, etc. of X bound N and And I'll just say some cases. N such that what? Such that this. Such that it is. Yeah, sorry. N is generically n-transitive and bound n. Just some cases where something is known. Are you assuming it? I know the rank of G or something? Pardon me? Do you know anything about G? Well, bounding the rank of G is is really equivalent to bounding the end transitivity. The n transitivity. Because, I mean, the orbit, I mean, if this is ranked, and I mean, certainly this rank has to be, can't be any bigger than the rank of g. So as soon as you know a bound on the rank of g, you'll know a bound on f. Are you assuming the action is definably primitive? Yeah, yeah, you must assume that. Otherwise, you could just do silly things. But you must assume, I suppose, that the. Yeah, I assume it's transitive faithful. Rethog is at most n types that would have correct. Yeah, that's right. That's right. And on the other hand, if you could bound the rank of G, then the floor of the rank of G divided by N, or rank of G divided by the rank of X would bound that. Let me just say some cases where it's known, some of them stable, some not. Some of them stable, some not. So, in O-minimal structures, then of course the dimension is the dimension. And n is less than or equal to the dimension of x plus 2. That's a result of, it's not phrased in these terms, but you can learn it from. Can learn it from an old paper of McPherson, Mosley, and Tent. It's known in general for finite Morley, but what's known is that there is some bound depending only on Only on the Morley rank of x. So it's sort of surprising, but nothing is known. It's known that there is a bound which only depends on the rank of x, but nothing is known about that bound. I mean, it's a function from omega to omega. So, Jim, can I ask you a question? So, in both the o-minimal and definite Euler cases, a theorem I know is that if you have a definitely primitive action, know is that if you have a definably primitive action from g on x, then there's some function which in terms of the rank of x will bound the rank of g. Correct. And what's the relationship between that fact and this bound that you get here? They're equivalent. They're equivalent. Yeah, yeah. Because if you can bound the dimension of the group, then of course if this space has some rank and your meaning of small and your meaning of small of rank less than is that this is small rank then the orbit O has to have big rank but the orbit O can only have rank as large as the group G so yeah so yeah and I mean there's some other cases which are known but are much more specific than this like ACF0 and That's like ACF0 and DCF. If X is from the mean, well, that would be a better result. I don't know them because it wasn't known for ACF0 until we wrote that paper. So it doesn't seem easy. Yeah, okay. That's the problem. So our team at the case is. So uh team I think you said you have another question for us? Unless I also you also have a question? Okay, I'll read that. I'm really very short. Question about the question about distality. So remember that I think somebody already defined it. I think Altam do you heard. I think I'll come to you. So, when the sendable sequence is disturbed, so let's say I, okay, if whenever let's say j is I one plus I three is equivalent to I. To I and A1, A and B are such that I one plus A plus I two I three and I one plus I two. So these are in this interval, um then then everything is in this interval. Everything is in the side. Okay. That's the definition of distal in the sample sequence. Makes sense. I mean, a theory is distal if every sequence, every disseminable sequence is distal. Okay, so here's my question. It's very, very um very naive. Very naive. Yeah. So suppose I e I is A I Let's assume that D is an ideal one. Although this question makes sense in general. Is it true that if I look so let's define so Look, so let's define. So I just like so A0, A1, A2, A3, SISTO. Okay? So it's a sequence of pairs, namely. Setisto. Um anyway, yeah, this is a question that bothers me a little bit, but uh I mean I thought about it for a while and I couldn't solve it, so uh For a while, and we couldn't solve it. And I think it's very natural. And it's related to some labels in Pierre's paper on these theories, where he proved this result called the strong base change. And it seems like this strong base change is useful for that, but it doesn't exactly work. So, anyway, that's my question. So, there's a proof, right, that the traducers to symbolize. There's a proof, right, that it reduces to single tones. Yeah. So it reduces distality. Yeah, distality. But the sequence. There's no connection between the sequence of single tones and the sequence of pairs. I understand. That's what I'm asking. Is the proof local? Oh, I don't remember. It uses the storm base change itself. This proof. And the storm base change itself, I think, can be localized to some extent, but I'm not sure of that. But I'm not sure if that's good. Yeah, that's a good question too. Like I said, this was a whiskey and good question. So maybe it's stupid. About sudden finiteness. What should there be? So here's some stretching of Bness to the finite theory. Definition, let us say that the theory T is for finite thoughts. Fool like a box? Yeah. I mean, you know, all the adjectives are used already. Quasi-finite exists, pseudo-finite exists. So for finite, if there exists a sentence, let's say L theory, if there is a sentence, psi, L sentence psi, such that if I look at the set of Uh if I look at the set of all finite models of this sentence, so let us denote, let's say, by f such that if we take f to be the set of all finite models of psi then for any uh non-principal UTRA filter. Non-principle outrefilter let's say u on f the ultra product realizes here and let me say a complete l-theory sorry a complete l-theory key is for finite in this hypothesis okay so I'm saying I have a single Happens, okay? So I'm saying I have a single sentence, I look at the set of all finite models of this one sentence, and I assume that no matter which ultra-product I take, they all give me the same complete theory. They all have the same complete theory. So equivalently, it's equivalent to saying that for any other sentence phi, all but finitely many of elements of f satisfy, whether satisfy the sentence or not satisfy the sentence. Okay? So, in particular, every finite structure is co-finite. Yeah. Okay. Question. Is it different from being sudden finite and finitely axiomatizable? So there's one implication, right? So the finite fields are not for finite. No, they are not. Yeah. Because they don't. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay, so let me maybe remark, a couple of remarks. So one remark, random graph. Well, let's say should a finite fields not for finite. We need a proof, but it's too. It's because of access theorem. Yeah, using access theory. Yeah. That using some cumulatory. Well, the point really that the point is that a single The point is that a single formula cannot really define, like if I fix a single sentence, it can't really capture being like uh define nth extension action for sufficiently high n. It doesn't matter. No case works, yeah. No, no, sorry, so for fixed, sure, for fixed p, for p For fixed P, for P whether prime or zero. So no completion of the series of finite fields in a finite. That's what I meant. But I suppose infinite-dimensional FT vector spaces would be infinite-dimensional FT vector spaces? They are, yeah. There are some fun examples. So, for example, pseudofine Boolean algebras are for finite. There's a unique theory complete theory. There's a unique complete theory of. Sorry, what am I saying? So there's a unique sort of finite theory of Boolean algebras, and it is complete. Yeah, I think that is true by Tarski or something like this. And it is for finite. Linear D Law is not D Law, sorry, what um again the uni the unique the complete series should have finite orders is for finite as well, yeah. Is for finite as well. Okay. So, but if infinite dimensional FP vector spaces are for finite, they're not infinitely exponential. Infinite. I haven't thought actually about this, so I don't know. Maybe that will be an example. No, no, dense is not, no. Because l let me just say, so four finite implies four finite implies to the finite. So four finite implies to the finite. Wait, but doesn't. To the final. Wait, wait, does it deal well with this definition? Because F is F is M tip. Look at T value. Any four finite theories obviously pseudo-finite. No, it's not for finite. No, but the law cannot be for finite. What do you mean? I have a question. Why is it to define? Can you explain why finite structures are for finite if they want? Well, because a complete theory of finite structures determined by a single sentence. Only if the language is finite. If the language is finite. That is true. If the language is infinite. That is. No, no, you're right. Sorry, yeah. So, well, I didn't write anything about. Okay. So three. Okay, you're right. Finite plus finite language. Yeah, I guess we're thinking of finite language here. But okay. And you need relational. Normally, no. No, no, you don't need relational, right? You can always convert. Convert, but yeah. No, no, good point, actually. I don't know, maybe it's called Infinite Language. What do you mean by multi-filter on F? Well, for F as a set, you can take another filter on it. Okay, sorry, so enumerate f, right? Okay, enumerate f in some way, like let's say f is cut. Some way, like let's say f is at most countable set, right? So write the f as a my, for example, for some choice of the enumeration. It doesn't depend on. You can do it isomorphism, right? Yeah, yeah, of course. So that's uh, yeah. Okay. So you can just say size of F is a size. But if you take all the M's to be containing some M, but if you take M if you just take M, the universal F will be containing natural numbers. So that would be containing natural numbers. And we say that you don't have to do the universal numbers. To the what? Just take the universal entropy containing the number of entries. To the what? So that it's not a class. Then you don't have a two-year record. AFTO is a morphism, of course. It doesn't make sense if the language is infinite. Sentence only says something about finite minutes. What do you mean T? So that is completely L finite. Ah, L is finite. No, I don't know. I pared it's important to say. What do you need T? Start with C. T C and don't just say it. No, T is the theory of the limit with respect to C. Start C and say there's a class of models. That's exactly my question. Can I finish my question? So question, is co-finite equal to pseudo-finite plus finite hexameters? No. It should be quasi-finitely quasi-qua oh, quasi-finitely, sorry, of course it is. So quasifinity means one sentence plus the infinity action. Yes. Yes. One direction is too large force. Okay, so which means that it's given by a That it's given by a single sentence plus the action scheme of antiquity. Yeah, I think it's true. I should have said it's maybe just a sentence. Any sentence in T, your condition exactly says it's true of all specific large models. True, I'll be happy to share proof. I don't think that's a proof. No, it's not the proof all by finitely many. It's not the proof because my sentence, I only look at finite models. I'm not saying that. Do you see the difference? C is true in all but finitely many models. No, you can take C is true in all but finitely many models. What? What's the point? It's not exactly. Huh? Yeah, you're right. Right, what? I know it's got to prove. That's why I'm asking the question. That's why I'm asking a question. But is it no idea? I don't think it's an obvious question, but I might be drunk. I don't know. There is no obvious answer. His argument doesn't consider. Yeah, like all the C. So C is true in all by fine G media, right? In all by fine G media. Such is false. No, that's not good. No, that's not good. So, I just want to make a remarkable thing. Maybe I can explain that because I. Can I just make a small remark? So, I think I made a. I should have said that if people wrote it down, these things are infinite and like remote type 2. Yeah, if anybody wants it down, the prototype is just anywhere. Okay, this will be very quick unless somebody wants to see a definition. So I'm working with a monster model of a complete theory which doesn't satisfy that I'm going to look at global types. Huh? Is it a problem? No, no. For me to be recorded? Oh, wait a minute. I apologize. Yeah, that's what you're looking at, man. Okay, so this is. Okay, so this is uh you don't want to give permission because you don't cute for yet. Do we need is generically stable over a set A? Should I remind the definition? If in any theory? Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is a invariant and there does not exist a witness to the order property of a special kind. There does not exist a formula the xy sequences AI from x tuples, bi from y tuples Y tuples such that we have the order property. So sorry it's a little not written. EJ. Thank you. And the AI sequence is a Morley sequence in the type over A. Is it wrong? Okay. So P is over A. Huh? P is more A. It's invariable. B is more A. It's a variable. Make it no, make it no no no. Oh, no, no, what are they called? Parameters. You don't need the parameter, you can put it in if you want. The B sequent is unrestricted, so. And it's a Morley sequence in if, like this. Okay, so that's the definition. You don't have a witness to the order property using a Morley sequence in the type. Yeah, so the question then is if I have question if I have P a type in X and Q a type in Y, and these are both generically stable over some small set, which you can without loss of generality assume is the same. Then is it true that the Morley That the Morley product is generically stable. Well, even the square. Even the square could be enough. Just, yeah, set P equal to Q would even just ask that special case. I don't know. So the examples that are known are NIP. I mean, it's not like they sat down to prove this precisely, but for Shotsky, you play prove that an NIP theory is just. play prove that an NIP theory is generically the same, generically stable is the same as definable and finitely satisfiable, and it's easy to show those are both closed under Morley product. And then it's also true in NTP2 using like a fun randomness array type proof that Kyle Jaynes and I have not posted yet, but hopefully, it's short, so it's kind of just like a note. Randomness array? Yeah, like one of these, like, like from, from, you know, you know what I mean? Like, You know what I mean? Like those randomness patterns of depth, whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. INT button? Yeah. I never can remember like IMP ICT, but IMP is the paths and the stands for independent partitions. I know it stands for something. But anyway, so yeah, anyway, I'm not going to talk very long. So, but you make a special kind of like if this fails, you can make a very strong kind of randomness thing that gives you TP2. Thing that gives you TP2. But yeah, in general. And then there was a proposed counterexample in a paper by some people. I won't name them. That doesn't end up working out, but it kind of maybe could be out of some kind of an idea. Oh, okay. It's Anand, Enrique, and Hans Adler. Ah, so it's published? It's published, but yeah, it's not quite right. But maybe it's probably around the right idea. I don't know, unless it could be fixed and stuff. I think you'd like to make a DFS. And it's easy. De definable individually and finally satisfiable and easy to check. Like almost all the properties are like easy to check or false, except this one. I don't know. Yeah, the only ones I know in terms of neostability lines with proofs are these two. Okay, obviously one generalizes the other, but they're kind of different proofs. Related to some kind of I asked about nostalgia a little bit, but it's something possible to do. Same question. It's a much more complicated problem. This is equivalent to asking if P square for testal type P is still piston. Is that right? In some sense, yeah. No, it's a precise sense. In IP squared small, so to say. This is my question. It's not equivalent to your question. No, no, no. Just related in the sense of both. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Exactly what you write secretly. I mean, I think it. I don't know. I mean, I haven't thought about your question. I mean, naively thinking about his question, I see pairs. In this question, you've got a grid and you've got all these different. I've got to be executive. Every formula should be more or less. Yes. For this coherent, it's exactly a sequence of A i's, then all you have sequence of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, etc. I think it's more complicated. For P squared, it's the same sequence. I mean, it's really looking at it's really looking. I mean it's really looking at it's really looking at the the infinite grid of the sequence this way and that way and looking and then you have a specific core you know what I mean somebody what I mean calorie I don't know I mean this is also what we do with the grid this is the grid is fun right the grid The grid is wrong, right? The grid is wrong. It's wrong because you can't control the grid. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. I don't know. We don't need to discuss it, but I don't want to take more time. But that find it being. I don't look at the fucking sticky task conjecture. Because the tights conjecture. I mean, are you saying that if the answer to this was yes? Are you saying that if the answer to this was yes, then the answer to it was yes, nice? Sure, you can ask if square nice. That's a complicated transaction. So be very quick. I want to ask two questions. Two questions. One is a kind of technical question in simple theories. The other one is, can this be one question that came out of Alex Cruckman's thesis? So first one is about weekly low. Okay, so in general, we say that T is low. If whenever I give you a formula for xy, there exists a k such that if i equals bi, i less than omega, is indiscertable, then if b x b i i less than omega is inconsistent, Inconsistent, it is k inconsistent. So compactness tells you that if this is inconsistent, it's k inconsistent for some k, but I'm asking that it's always k inconsistent. So somehow this k doesn't depend on the indiscernible sequence. It just depends on the formula. So weekly glow, let's this depend on a bit more. So So we say t is weakly low if for every vx y and b And B, there is K, which depends on phi and B, such that the same thing is true. So such that if I equals BI, I listen omega is indiscernible with B0 equals B, so it starts with this given parameter and Vx VI less than omega is inconsistent, it is K inconsistent. So the question now is, um, is every simple theory equally low? Weekly low. So, this came out of something I was working on with Scott. And what's interesting is there are, of course, known examples of simple theories that are not low. But in the known examples, the moment you fix the type of the parameter, you determine how much inconsistency you can see. And we tried pretty hard to construct an example, but we always ended up making things quite complicated, at least SP3. And generally, more complicated than that. So I would really love to. Kidding that. So I would really love this to be answered either way. If it was answered positively, then we learned something about simple theories. If it was answered negatively, then we'd have an interesting example. It is weekly low. Can you illuminate time? That's also a great question. So Jung-hung proposed this. Scott looked at the proof and he said he didn't think. What's the question? If you could, under the assumption that T is weakly low, and some Under the assumption that T is weak, low, and simple, can you eliminate hypermetrics? Because you can do this with low. I think it's equal to this question, probably no. Well. I mean, simple theories probably do eliminate agriculture. There's one of the superstitial theories, I don't think. No, but I guess we know it for omega-categorical, right? No deal. He's not doing it. It's all stopped doing it. Yeah, okay. Okay, so this is my first question. And my second question is: something called. Wait, so it doesn't say overparameters, it just. So B I. Yeah, so okay, I mean, maybe a better way of saying it is that for every phi and parameter set A and B, K can depend on phi and the type of B over it. Right, so in that case, it's not. I don't see why it's involved, but in that. Yeah, so in that case, in that case, probably not. So, I mean, it depends on the formulation, but I mean, here's at least one version that I don't know. Okay. And the other thing is, sort of after Kim's thesis, sort of in the early development of simple theories, there was a survey article written by Anand and Jung-Han about simple theories. And there they proposed something called the revised, or sorry, the outrageous conjecture. Revised or sorry, the outrageous conjecture which is if T is pseudo finite and Zoe, forgive me, all of zero categorical then T is simple. Simple. Okay? And this is false. So the example is T star Q2. So Alex proved that that's pseudo-finite, and it's all zero get oracle. So that doesn't work because this is in a supreme one. Is it difficult to pull that into the point? Is it difficult to prove that this is the point that is just a tree? Yeah, it is difficult. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's a non-trivial theorem. So Alex can explain it better than I can, but basically he proves that if you have a for seal class that can be written as a sort of increasing union of for securities which have n amalgamation for all n, then it's pseudo-finite. And so you somehow stratify the for seclus into countably many pieces, each of which is pseudo-finite by counting the number of equations. By counting the number of equivalence classes at each stage. Yeah, but it's kind of difficult to see directly without the machinery that you developed. So it's a different form that you run on the web. I mean, I can apply this to what we want to do. So it's your conjecture that is LSOP1. Yes, exactly. So the revised outrageous conjecture. So it's the same hypotheses, but the conclusion should be NSOP1. Now, one comment I want to make is that a corollary of this conjecture would be that the triangle-free random graph is not pseudofinite. That's a hard question. So, is this your question, or is it a different question? No, this is a question, but it's called. Question, but it's called the outrageous conjecture. So I don't really believe that it's true. So the reason I want to mention it is because I think this is a kind of corner in which it would be really nice to have better examples. So having all of zero categorical pseudo-finite theories that didn't fit into SOP1 would be something some interesting objects for us to think about. And I just sort of wanted to advertise it because I I really hope people find examples here. So how does how does the triangle freedom grow fit into this? Well, the thing is, it's definitely all zero categorical, but whether or not it's zero definitely is something we don't know. So, I mean, like, the thing is that if you look at the finite triangle-free random graphs, they do have a 0-1 law, but the limit theory is bipartite graphs. So, the limit theory of finite triangle-free random graphs looks very different than the theory you get with the First A limit. And, you know, besides the things that You know, besides the things that Alex did in his thesis, normally it's just these kinds of arguments that give you pseudo-finiteness. So if the triangle free random graph were pseudo-finite, it would be pseudo-finite for somehow, a very different reason than the examples we know already. So anyway, I wanted to mention this just because I think there's a lot of interesting activity happening sort of beyond Inisophy I. And I think, given that, it's sort of a good time to reconsider. It's sort of a good time to reconsider if there's anything living in this category. That's all I have to say. Can you keep my answer at one question? Thanks for watching. Does anyone else have a question they want to ask? No, no, I think. I think you should. Very quick, yeah. Very quick. Very quick, yeah, very quick, very quick. Okay, so you get three minutes. I don't want to start my case. Yeah. In the afternoon second, the claim is finished before it's going to be good. Claim is plus exists x is complete. Right? Y. Take any theta. It was the arch. If not, if not. Which are you saying you're proving? It's true. The difficult one. The difficult one. If not, there is a key such that the set of size of M s M F M spice size of n? Yeah, you know, it's a set of F's. It's all class specifying C. The same is for nothing. What is maybe size of? What what is maybe size of M? You said size of M. Oh, size of M, yes, size of M on F is size of M equals M. Ah, okay. The same for not Phi. You take all three filters here, you'll get T, take all the fields here, you have not Phi, so there are two different series. I don't understand. Why? Because in one you will have a phi, in the second you have not Ph. Phi? Inside, you have not fi. How do you know it's finite? How do you know that there isn't something about that? What is attempting? Because claim is a C plus this set is a I never made that claim. That's not the definition. No, you should speak. Quasify is a quasi-finite, that's what I'm sure. No, but how do you know that it's going to be finite? You don't know it's going to be finite. You don't even know there is something. So if not, if this one is not complete, you can find sentence that's true in a MOSOP C. I will be a large size. And most V is alpha to remote V, I'll be a large size. Yeah, so what if Phi only has infinite models? Yeah, whatever. This class is empty and not relative, but if that and these. Of he but it's that and p depends on the consistent models. Oh, it doesn't have pseudo-finite models. Because normally models are still finite. No, if it doesn't have any finite models, then none of the models are. It follows from T plus axial. Because no finite models follow. You first need to show me some definite models. Yeah, this one's complete. For any state. For any state, either state is here or not state is here. If state is not here, I'm real labs. But that is, I don't know what the theory of finite seeds are. But we're talking about finite models over the smaller could be incomplete. But what you say is no finite model of cross. No, sorry. No, sorry. Is plus describes the elements are going to be a concept problem? But we can talk after the other.
