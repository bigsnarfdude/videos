Okay, thank you. I'd like to thank the organizers for the chance to be here. It's really a pleasure to treat, so I appreciate it very much. Muchas gracias percibienne. And I want to report today on joint work with Omar Offen from Brandeis. And there's a big project that I'll tell you about it. And the plan for my talk is to start with an overview of Shimura correspondences. It's a big enough subject. I could give a whole talk, a whole mini. I could give a whole talk, a whole mini-course probably about Shimura correspondences. Then I'll tell you about a conjecture I made with Dan Bump and David Ginsburg over 20 years ago. And then I'll tell you how we've been able to approach the conjecture by means of the relative trace formula and tell you about the fundamental lemma. And you know, when you're trying to do a trace formula, that's a major impediment that we've managed to resolve. So the paper about the fundamental lemma is on the archive. Fundamental lemma is on the archive, and there's some additional work in progress. I'll mention that very briefly later in the talk. Okay, so the classical Shimura lift started out taking holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight to modular forms of integral weight, and then was souped up to automorphic representations, taking automorphic representations of the metaplectic double cover of SL2. Of SL2, and for to be exact, genuine metaplectic, genuine automorphic representations, ones that really live on the double cover to automorphic representations pi of PGL2. And I'll say a little bit more about this later on in the talk. And historically, it was first constructed by the converse theorem by Shimura, and then by a theta correspondence by Niwa, Shintani, and Waltz-Berger. And Waltz-Perget, I think, really deeply clarified. I think really deeply clarified the nature of the correspondence. In particular, the theta representation depends on the choice of additive character. And as well, Walsh-Berger understood that it was a very important question to characterize the image of the lift, which automorphic representations on PGL2 really come from SL2. And he characterized it in two ways. One, the non-vanishing of a central L value. L value for pi twisted by a certain quadratic character, which is related to the additive character in the construction. And secondly, by the non-vanishing of a certain period, the integral of an automorphic form in the space of the representation over a cycle. Now, I want to stop for just a second before I go on, because there's really something to be learned from this. When you have, Langlands tells us that in many cases, we should take automorphic representations. Cases, we should take automorphic representations on one group and move them to another group. And it's generally an important question to ask which things on the second group are really in the image of the lift from the first group. Now, this isn't in the context of the formal Langlands correspondence, but that's the question that Waltz Verget was asking. If you give me something in the image, a pie, sorry, if you give me something on the second group, a pi, is it or is it not in the image? Is it or is it not in the image? And this is also the question that Daniel was talking about, Daniel Berera was talking about this morning. Can you characterize the image of the lift? And one way to do it is by means of a period. Now, a period classically might be an integral over some kind of an algebraic variety, a sub-variety. And then Daniel showed us integrating over an algebraic subgroup against a character. And I'll use period in even a more general. use period in even a more general way, where we might not only restrict to a subgroup, but integrate against something other than a character, but it will be something fixed given by the group theory of the situation. And so a period will be some kind of an integral that detects whether or not something is in the image of the lift. Now, I want to emphasize that being in the image of the lift is a global question, because of course there could be a local obstruction, but just because something is local, But just because something is locally in the image of the lift doesn't mean you can make an automorphic representation on the first group that really lifts. It's hard to make automorphic representations. So it's reasonable that there be something global that helps you tell whether something in the second group really comes from the first group or not. And that's what periods are about. So here it's the non-vanishing of a certain period. So this example of Waltz-Berger really is the sign. Waltz-Rouger really is the signpost to a very large theory. And I'll try to say a little more about that later on in the talk as well. Okay, using this period, there's something that we can do. There's a way of modifying the trace formula that Jacquet discovered, where you build a period into the trace formula, and you can do a comparison of distributions for two different groups. And Jacquet was able to use his method to give an To use his method to give a new proof of the Shimura correspondence. And it starts from knowing that there is a period and then using that in some trace formula machine to create the correspondence. Okay, so that's the classical Shimura lift, the red Shimura lift. Okay, generalizations. Well, the Shimura lift is really important. It's natural to try to generalize it. And you might want to start by replacing SL2 by a different reductive group. Of course, you could do the double cover of. Of course, you could do the double cover of sp more generally. SL2 is the first symplectic group following V, and you can get the classical theta correspondence. But I have in mind to do more than that. I want to replace SL2 by some other reductive group. And even, for example, SLN for a general end. That might be a natural thing to try to do. I also want to ask about replacing the metaplectic double cover by a higher degree cover. Well, they should. cover? Well, they showed us that the metaplectic double cover was very natural representation theoretically, but higher degree covers are not part of that theory. So what do higher degree covers even mean? So what's the number theory that leads to higher degree covers? Yes, there's a generalization, but what does it mean? What's its real content? So I want to tell you about that, and it goes back to something very classical. So to explain it, let me let n greater than or equal to 2. That'll be the degree of the cover. 2, that'll be the degree of the cover. And let f be a global field with a full set of nth roots of unity. And I want to get rid of real embeddings. So if n equals 2, I'll assume that the fourth roots of unity are in f. So f has no real embeddings. There's a slight change when there are real embeddings. Okay, so I'll be working with that. And then I'll let O be the ring of integers of my number field F. And there's a beautiful theorem of Kubota from quite a long time ago. Kubota from quite a long time ago. Kuboda looked at the SL2O and took the principal congruence subgroup of matrices congruent to the identity modulo n squared. So just a subgroup of finite index in SL2O. And he took a matrix. Whoops. He took a matrix and sent it to C over D sub N, the nth power residue symbol. So that's an nth root of unity. And he observed. And he observed that that map actually is a homomorphism. And the proof uses reciprocity. It's not a cheap statement. It really uses, in a fundamental way, reciprocity. n squared is actually not best possible, but that's what Kubota proved. And if C is 0 and D is 1, 0 over 1 is defined to be 1, just for completeness. Anyway, so Kubota showed that that map is a homomorphism. And that's going to be the start of metaplectic groups. What does it have to do with metaplectic groups? What does it have to do with covers? Well, I should, before I say that, by the way, if you're doing classical theta correspondence, you're used to a CZ plus e to the one half, but that has to do with the real Archimedean place. So if you were to write down the theta function given by the We representation over a field with no real embeddings, you would get this multiplier. So this is actually the right thing. Okay. So the key point is that the kernel of this Key point is that the kernel of this map is not a congruence subgroup. If you go back to the map, this C over D sub n, oops, this nth power residue symbol, is not a congruence subgroup. And because of that, when you take a classical function transforming under kappa, you know, it's a classical automorphic type object and addalize, because there is no subgroup of the maximal compact of finite index, which corresponds to the individual. compact of finite index, which corresponds to the kernel of kappa, when you do it carefully, when you addalyze, you must introduce a covering group. And it's all because the kernel of kappa is not a congruent subgroup. So you introduce a covering group over the end, you get the n-fold cover of SL2 by taking this and addalizing an automorphic type object that transforms under this character, which is built using nth-power reciprocity. So that's the start of That's the start of the metaplectic group. Now, I said the kernel is not a congruent subgroup, and Bass, Milner, and Serre, in a famous piece of work building on earlier work of Meneke, resolved the congruent subgroup problem. And the heart of their work were proving that there were non-congruent subgroups of finite index for other groups than SL2. And what they did is they took this Kubota map kappa and extended it to a broad class of algebraic groups. Class of algebraic groups and the O points of them. So, in fact, a long time ago, people were working with what really is the metaplectic group for groups other than SL2. And the general statement is if G is, say, a split connected reductive algebraic group over a global field, then there's an n-fold covering of the idyllic group. And you can also do it locally. The idyllic group is formed in the normal way from the local covers. You have to identify the roots of unity, of course. The roots of unity, of course, as you identify, as you put the different local covers together, but then it's the same process as normal. And you can define an enfold metaplectic cover. It's not the idyllic points of an algebraic group. We're outside the world of algebraic groups. We're outside the world of the classical Langlands correspondence. Okay, but it's a very natural object. It was constructed really in its most generality, algebrao geometrically, by Berlinski-Deline. By Berlinsky-Delin, who worked in the category of sheaves over the Big Zariski site and extended by the Sheaf K2. And you can build the covers by taking that and pushing it forward in a certain way. So there's a very natural way of making these covers. And then you can try and do automorphic forms. So you can talk about local language correspondence, global language correspondence. I just had listed some of the topics that were in earlier talks this week. You can talk about Talks this week. You can talk about Eisenstein series as Erez La P did. You can talk about theta correspondences and generalize the classical reductive dual-pair theta correspondence. I did that with David Ginsburg just a couple of years ago. You can talk about L-functions via a generalized twisted doubling, as Yal Kaplan has done in a very beautiful piece of work. And there's a surprise when you do it. It's not just cheap generalizations. Every one of these steps is very deep. Local language, core. Marty Weissman has defined an L group in a very subtle way. And we, Tech Ann and Fangau, explain how you can make a weak local Langlands correspondence from that, but it's very subtle. And when you try to do Eisenstein series and their Whitaker coefficients, it turns out that quantum groups play a fundamental role. It's quite a remarkable theory. And if you look, I won't have time to talk about it all. This is not for today. Oops. This is not for today. Oops, not for today's talk because it's just too much to cover. But if you just look on the archive, even in the last few months, a few talks, a few papers have been posted about the local theory and the Whitaker story and quantum groups will indeed play an important role in some of those papers. So there's a whole beautiful theory of both local representation theory and automorphic representation theory on metaplectic groups, but of course it's much less developed. Course, it's much less developed than for classical groups. So that's the starting point for what we're going to be doing. Okay, so the question that I want to talk about today is, is there an analog of the Shimura map? It's such an important map for the n-fold cover. If I take something on the n-fold cover of a classical group, can I make something that's an honest to goodness automorphic representation on a real life reductive group? It's a pretty natural question. It's a pretty natural question that would generalize the Shimura correspondence. It's not my question. It goes back to the 1980s. And Yuval Flicker, in a beautiful paper in Avencionas in 1980, used the trace formula, an Arthur trace formula, to establish a correspondence for a certain n-fold cover of GL2. There turned out to be more than one n-fold cover because it's not simply connected, but he did that for arbitrary n. There's a lot we don't know even about that lifting. I don't know of Even about that lifting, I don't know of a way, for example, to take something on GL2A and give me a period to tell me whether it's in the image of a lift. There's a lot I don't know about that map. And Kajdan and Patterson and Flickr and Kajdan took steps to extend this work, but they did not get global results. And then the best story about local work that I think really is worth pointing to is Gordon. worth pointing to is Gordon Savin wrote a paper in 1988 where he studied the local correspondence. I hope the yellow shows up, the local correspondence, and he established an isomorphism of Iwahori-Heke algebras between an Iwahori-Hecka algebra, genuine Iwahori-Heke algebra on a covering group and an Iwahori-Haka algebra on a real-life reductive group. So at least on the unramified and even Iwahori levels, we understand Levels, we understand what the correspondence ought to be like. And so then, of course, you can ask: is there a global correspondence that matches that? But we know this is a long standing game. You know, you can say all the local stuff, but how do you get the global correspondence? It's very hard to make automorphic representations, even if you have the local pieces. And here we by no means have all the local pieces. We just have them at level one or just at Iwahori level. Or just at Iwahori level. Okay, but that's the state of affairs. At least we have a sense that it's a reasonable set of questions. We see where we might be going with this. And so now I want to tell you about some progress. So there's one, let's see, if I got that right. Yeah, okay, good. I had mentioned Flickr doing the enfold cover of GL2 and more precisely a certain GL2 cover. But for the But for the double cover, there's more information. The double cover a little bit mimics the story that Walt Sperget explained to us for the classical Shimura correspondence. And Jaquet conjectured in 1991 that the Shimura lift from the double cover of GLR to GLR is related to the value of a standard L function and a half. There is a period. And in fact, it also can be characterized by a period along an orthogonal group. Orthogonal group. And when you have periods, you can try to use the machinery of the relative trace formula to actually make the correspondence. You can actually build it from the machinery of a trace formula of a specific kind. And in 1988, Mao established the fundamental lemma for the unit element for a relative trace formula for the double cover of GL3. And for GL4 and beyond, And for GL4 and beyond, Viet Kuang Dou, in four papers over a span of 11 years, studied the double cover of GLN, and he developed the relative trace formula, and he did it in a very nice way. He first worked in equal characteristic over function fields and proved the fundamental lemma there using algebraic geometric methods and a limit using perverse sheaves, since I know there are fans in the audience. And then he transferred from characteristic zero from characteristic zero from from equal characteristic to characteristic zero using model theory and the approach of clookers hells and loeser and that was really um those are hard papers and they were developed over a period of a decade and in fun fortunately even though these papers are consistent with the existence of a generalized shimura correspondence they give us a real sense that this map should be there um we there's still more work to be done to actually say that you can take an automorphic representation pick Take an automorphic representation, pick it up, and move it to a different group. But at least it's in progress. And I think we have good reason to believe that the local story elucidated by Flickr, Khajdan, Patterson, and Savin does fit into a global picture. These papers are certainly good evidence that that's a vision that is reasonable. Okay, now there's one extra, there are two extra papers that they fit together. Papers, they fit together and they concern the triple cover of SL2. And you might wonder about we're doing small groups, but you know, we know that it's really hard to make automorphic representations lift. And a lot of the best theorems about functoriality are in some sense for small groups. I mean, with the notable exception, of course, of Arthur's endoscopic lifts. But, you know, so it's not so surprising that we might be starting there. Now, the first piece of work. The first piece of work for the triple cover of SL2 is due to Ginsburg, Wallace, and Soudry again a long time ago in 1997. And it's a very pretty piece of work. They observed that SL2 and its triple cover fit into as a dual pair inside the threefold cover of the exceptional group G2. Well, you know, G2 has two roots of different, two simple roots of different root lengths. And because of that, the Dinkin diagram has a triple bond. Dinkin diagram as a triple bond. And so one of the SL2s splits in the cover, and the other becomes really a threefold cover when you embed it in the triple cover of G2. So that's why that statement is true. And then they were able to do something like a theta correspondence, but it's sort of it's a it's an exotic theta correspondence using a theta function on the triple cover of G2 constructed by Gordon Savin. And they were able to do a lifting of indeed genuine cospital automorphic representations of it. Automorphic representations of SL2, triple cover to the automorphic representations on SL2. And here they're really picking up automorphic forms and making new automorphic forms because it's a theta integral. So there really is something they do that's say different from what Flickr can do for the unfold cover of GL2. And they also determine the image of the period. Remember, it's always important to ask when is something in the image. When is something in the image of the list? And you seek a period to do that. And they were able to find a period that determined the image of the map. And you'll see this is a period in the extended sense that I mentioned earlier. So I'm going to show you the period and it's not the most obvious period. Okay, triple cover of SL2. So what they do is they need the theta function on the double cover of sp4, and they take the symmetric cube map from SL2 to. Cube map from SL2 to SP4, which happens to split. The image of it splits on over the double cover. And so then what they do is they take something on, sorry, I've changed which highlights I have, if that's okay. Press it twice. Okay? That wasn't what I wanted to do. No, I understand. I just didn't do it. Hold on. I got it. Very good. Great. Okay, good. Thanks. Anyway, so what they showed is that something on SL2 is in the image of this map that comes from the cubic cover if and only if an integral is non-zero. And it's sort of a crazy integral. I integrate phi in the space of pi, some automorphic form on SL2, against a theta function evaluated at the symmetric cube of g, and that turns out to be what works. So it's a pretty exact. What works. So it's a pretty exotic integral, but they were able to find that integral. And then the second approach is using the relative trace formula. Once you have a period, you can try to play the relative trace formula game. And Mal and Rawless did it. They actually did it completely. They really proved the map, not just the fundamental lemma. Though again, I think that's, I shouldn't say just it. That's what I'm going to talk about. I think that's a key step, but they did the whole thing. And they were able to use this. And they were able to use this period to establish the Shimura list. So we have two proofs for the triple cover of SL2 going up to SL2. Now, one thing we might ask ourselves is to what group should the NFO cover of SLR lift? And I won't give you the full answer, but I'll give you a partial answer. So for SL2 double cover, we went to PGL2. For SL2 triple cover, we actually go to SL2. For SL2, For SL and N-fold cover, it turns out you go to PGL, but if N and R are co-prime, then you go to SL. So there's a reason for this, and it's really explained by Gordon Savin in his work. So just so you know that whether you're going to PGL or SL depends on the relation. And today we're going to be doing something going into PGL. But so it's very much like the Waltz-Berger, Shumura, Niwa, Shintani, Lyft. Shintani Lyft. That's what we'll be doing. We'll be going up to SL. We'll be going up to PGL. Okay. So just to summarize the story, here's where we stand. The blue dots are the higher covers of GL2 or SL2. That's Flickr's work. We know the lifts exist. We don't have a period that characterizes the image. Going down this direction, we have the work of Mao and Viequang Do, where we deeply believe that Jacques... I deeply believe that Jacquet's conjecture should be true and that there should be a lift and it should be characterized by a period, but it hasn't been completely carried out. But there's really good evidence that the vision that was formulated in the 1980s is a true vision, that it's not missing something, that this really ought to be there. Okay, so that's where we stood until the work I'm going to talk about. And now I'm going to tell you about this work, which adds one dot, but we break both the boundaries. adds one dot but we break both the boundaries we go beyond sl2 or gl2 and we go and at the same time we go beyond the double cover so we'll go to the triple cover of sl3 so that's the work i'm going to tell you about today and we'll see it needs a lot of ideas okay now um the start of our work is periods and actually even though we don't know that the map exists in 19 in 2001 dan bump david ginsberg and i made some conjectures about periods and About periods. And we got it published amazingly because it's not, you know, it's all conjecture, all right, but we did get it published. And we conjectured that we should be able to characterize the image of a lift by a rather exotic period. And of course, it got published because we gave some evidence. I'll tell you the evidence in a moment. Okay, so here, first of all, is the period. And this will be the period we're going to be working with. It's really a surprising period because it involves a theta function on SO8. On SO8. And that's a theta function in the extended sense that its Fourier coefficients vanish except for the minimal non-trivial coadjoint orbit. Okay, so it's a theta function in an extended sense. It has a property in common with the theta function you would build from the Vay representation. And it lives on a split special orthogonal group, SO8, and was actually constructed by Ginsburg, Wallace, and Soudry as a multi-residue of an. As a multi-residue of an Eisenstein series on SO8, you can take the Borel-Eisenstein series, and it has poles, and you take the residues at the poles, and you get this exotic theta function. That's what they did, and that's the object we'll work with. And then, you know, what does that have to do with the cubic cover? Here's add, the adjoint representation from PGL3 to SO8. Add operates on, gives automorphisms of a Lie algebra, SL3, which is eight-dimensional. Lie algebra SL3, which is eight-dimensional. So you get a map, it turns out to SO8, and I'll explain exactly how you do that below. And these are ingredients. Now, you might be really puzzled. I mean, what does this have to do with cube roots of unity and cubic covers? And I will explain that later in the talk. It does. And if you're really enjoying yourself and love algebraic groups, you could put that as an exercise until I get to it in the talk. Okay, so let's see. So the conjecture we made 20 years ago is 20 years ago, is that something in pi, an irreducible cospidal automorphic representation of PGL3, comes from the cubic cover if and only if this exotic period is non-zero. I take my automorphic form and I integrate it against this theta function on SO8, not on a cover, it's truly on SO8. And I evaluate that theta, a theta function in the space of the theta. A theta function in the space of the theta representation on the add of g. Pretty crazy conjecture. Okay, and I do not know of an extension of this conjecture to higher rank special linear groups or to higher degree covers. This is not, unfortunately, the first case of a glorious theory as far as I know. And I should say that periods have been studied a lot lately. Sakhalaridis and Venkatesh and Ben Svi have taken a lot. Venkatesh and Ben Sfe have taken a lot of the theory of periods and tried to uniformize it. Their theory doesn't include covers. And in some sense, if the theory is going to include covers, this will be an example. I hope I'll convince you that this is really has reason to be believed by giving a fundamental lemma down the road. And so hopefully their theory will at some point incorporate this. But at the moment, this is maybe a signpost of where the theory would need to go if it were to be extended to greater generality. It would have to predict. Greater generality. It would have to predict something like this. But the study of periods is really big business. Okay, and I don't know of a generalization. Okay, now the evidence we got is the following. You might imagine that I don't try to apply this to a cuspidal automorphic representation, but of something induced from something on tau on SL2. And then you can do a formal unfolding, and you can actually relate this to the Ginsburg-Wallace-Sudri period. And that's also pretty crazy because now. And that's also pretty crazy because now you have a theta function on SO8, and you're trying to relate it to a theta function on sp4. And at the end, there's some crazy identity of a theta series involving double covers of sp8 and sp4 that we need to prove that's really non-obvious. So there's some identity of theta series that goes into this. And you can find it in that paper. And we also gave evidence from finite fields. And this might be a place to look for more structure. We looked at families of Delene-Wuste characters in general position. Loose characters in general position. There's no covering groups, but I know what the nth power Shimura map should be. It should be the nth power on induction data, sure. And then we actually were able to show that studying representations over finite fields would be able to predict our period and also it would predict the Ginsburg-Rawla-Sudri period if you didn't already know it. So that's the evidence that we gave. Okay, so now I want to get to the new work. We're going to. Um, we're going to our project, which I think is really a big project, it turns out, is to first of all prove the existence of this unknown correspondence, this unknown Shimura map from a triple cover of SL2, of sorry, of SL3 up to PGL3, and then prove the period conjecture. And we do them both at the same time by means of a relative trace formula. Okay, so a relative trace formula is a comparison of distributions. Trace formula is a comparison of distributions. I'll describe the distributions. They get a little bit complicated. And then I want to give you, state the fundamental lemma, and then tell you what is behind the proof of the fundamental lemma for the unit element in the spherical Heck algebra. Okay, so the standard notation bracket H is HA mod HF. That was what Eras Lapid was also using. And this kind of S's the Schwarz-Bruhoff functions on the ideal points of your favorite affine variety. Points of your favorite affine variety. Not just the standard notation you would expect. Okay, so I'm going to write down some distributions for you. And G will be PGL3, N will be upper triangular matrices with ones on the diagonal. Psi will be the generic character, the sort of standard stuff you would expect. And here's the distribution. So if you aren't so up on relative trace formulas, you make this. This is the kind of kernel you would make in a trace formula. It has two variables. In a trace formula, it has two variables, and I'll integrate one of the variables called g over this exotic period and the other variable called n against the generic character for PGL3. And that's the standard kind of thing that Jaquet taught us to do. But what will be hard about this set of distributions is that it will involve this exotic theta function. Theta function is in the space of a theta representation, and we're going to need to analyze these. We're going to need to analyze these things. And these are global objects. I'm integrating over a Delic mod rational. These are not local objects. Okay. And then I'll write down the other distribution at hand. It's a very well-known distribution called the Kuznetsov distribution. And it just happens to be on the cubic cover, but the notation is all the same. I'll still let N be upper triangular matrices. There's covers and all the stuff that you'll see in the formula splits over the cover. See in the formula splits over the cover by means of the trivial splitting, and SL3 splits by means of a trivial splitting. And that's actually equivalent to the Hilbert reciprocity law. So it's a statement that, you know, needs a proof and you can give a proof and it uses some number theory. Anyway, so here's another distribution. I have again a test function. So f prime will be one of these Schwartz functions. And I'll make an integral kernel by means of averaging it over gamma. means of averaging it over gamma in SL3F, the rational points embedded discretely in the idelic world. And then I'll do a unipotent orbital integration in both variables against the nontrivial, the generic character of the upper unipotent subgroup, of the unipotent radical of the Borel. So those are the distributions that our goal is to compare. And here's what you do in the relative trace formula. It's easy to sketch. In the relative trace formula, it's easy to sketch it. So, you try to show that the distributions are equal if f and f prime match globally equal. And what you're supposed to do is this. These are global objects, and you're supposed to write them as a sum over factorizable orbital integrals that you can then put in terms of local objects. And this is going to be hard in this case. This took us a year. Okay. Year. Okay. So you analyze the relevant orbits and write them as terms of factorizable orbital integrals. Then compare the orbital integral for the unit element in the local Hecke algebra. And that's the fundamental lemma. As we all know, that's difficult and deep in every case. And if you do it, you're over the hump. And that's what we'll be able to do in this case. All right, then, that's the unit element in the spherical Hecke algebra. To really do it, you have to go to the full spherical Hecke algebra. The full spherical HACA algebra. That's the step that Omer and I are working on now. And boy, is it tough. And we've been working on it a while. And I know these are not short problems. But we've made some progress, but it's not around the corner. But we've made some serious progress. But anyway. And then you have to actually match arbitrary test functions at a finite number of places, including you have to handle the Archimedean places. And so there's going to be some stuff with that to do. And then once you've done all that, you have the distributions match. All that you have the distributions match, that's the geometric sides of the trace formulas matching, and then, as you know, we go to the spectral side, and then you have to do some spectral work, maybe some truncation of some integrals. I don't think that'll be too hard in this case. There's some work to be done. I'll explain why it's not going to be too hard. And then at the end of the day, you get the global consequences. So that's the outline. And, you know, I've thought of this problem for 20 years now. I knew it was too hard to ever do with a postdoc or something. And that turned out to be right. Anyway. And that turned out to be right, anyway. Okay, so I'm going to report on our progress on steps one and two. And like I said, step three is in progress. Okay, now the first step is a reduction to local. And for this Kuznet subdistribution, where you just take the additive character on both variables, this is a well-known thing. The relevant orbits, the orbits that would contribute have been understood since the 1980s. In fact, they go back to a paper of Monk. In fact, they go back to a paper of mine in the 1980s, and I wrote it in the language of Poincaré series, motivated by analytic number theory, but it's exactly the same steps, and so it's been around for a long time. And these happen to be the relevant integral orbital, the relevant representatives when you do the Bruja decomposition for the relevant orbits. And the one that really is the hardest one, this would be the big cell in the Bruja decomposition. You have to do them all, but that's the hardest one. Do them all, but that's the hardest one. And then it's a relatively straightforward fact that this distribution is a sum of idelic integrals, which are therefore factorizable orbital integrals. And then you can hope to play the, you can hope to go to the next step of evaluating a local object. Okay, now the reason it was so hard is the other side. The distribution involves this exotic theta function and saying Exotic theta function. And saying it's a residue of a Borel-Eisenstein series is not very conducive to actually writing the thing as a factorizable, as a sum of factorizable pieces and matching the relevant orbits. This is really not so obvious. It's not obtained from the Vay representation. There's no straightforward way of doing that. That's immediate, like in the Mal Rawlis case. And we tried a lot of really good ideas that didn't work until we finally figured out what did. And what does work? What did and what does work strangely enough is to use the theta representation. Yes, we're on the triple cover, but you go, and SO8 is not on a cover, it's on, but still you can realize the automorphic minimal representation as the theta lift of the trivial representation from SL2 to SO8. So you have to bring sp16 into the picture, lo and behold, to do this lifting from SL2 triple cover to SL2. And this is actually related to And this is actually related to work of Kula and Rawlis on normalized Ziegler Vey identities, and you have to regularize the theta lift. But I don't think this will be too much of an obstacle because the regularization is very simple. In this case, you just have to impose a very modest condition on the test function at one Archimedean place. It has to be in the image of the Casimir operator. So it's a very modest condition. So when we get that far, I don't think that will be an obstruction, but time will tell. Okay, so at the end. Okay, so at the end of the day, we use all this and we are able to do an unfolding and we get to factorizable orbital integrals. We match the relevant orbits. This is the machine one wants to plug into. One has to do these steps. And finally, we reduce to local orbital integrals. Okay, now, I guess it wouldn't be honest if I didn't write down the local integrals, so I will, but they're going to be a little bit obscure, and don't panic if they're just obscure formulas. I want to show you. Just obscure formulas. I want to show you the ideas and the really are ideas. Okay, so let me formulate this precisely again. You know, I always feel guilty if I don't say something very precise in the talk. Okay, so here's all the standard notation, same notation as Sean used. F is, I believe, at least if you called it F, a non-Archimedean local field. O is the ring of integers, script P, its maximal ideal, pi, a local uniformizer, KF the residue field, P, its characteristic, trace, the trace map on the Trace the trace map on the residue fields down to Z mod PZ, Q the number of elements, Kf, dot absolute value of a normalized absolute value, the standard thing we all use. And I do want to use psi to be a character, not of conductor P inverse, but of conductor O. So it's trivial on O, but not on P inverse. That's the sort of standard thing we'll do automorphically so we can put the pieces together. Okay, so that's the standard notation. And I want Notation. And I want to assume that f contains a primitive cube root of unity rho. And so μ3 will be the full group of cube roots of unity. And of course, I need to assume that locally. All right, so here are the big cell integrals. And blah, there it is. All right. You would think it's really great. It's just a characteristic function of eight copies of O. And heck, one of the tuples of the eight vector is zero. And in fact, when I got to this point, I thought, oh, yeah, we're over the hundred. This point, I thought, oh, yeah, we're over the hump. We got again, this took a lot of work because we had to do the whole theta correspondence stuff. That was a rather naive thought, as you'll see. But anyway, here it is. And you think, come on, piadic integrals, we're home-free. Anyway, but that happens to be what you need to do. And where do we get such a crazy formula? I mean, it's not even worth, you know, trying to really look at, but there you go. There it is. Anyway, you know, where do you get such a formula? Okay, so I want to explain that. And also what this SOA stuff has to do with. What this SOA stuff has to do with Q-boots of unity. So, again, I'll embed PGL3 in GL of the Lie algebra SL3 in the standard way by the capital add representation. And I can think of the Lie algebra SL3 as a quadratic space using the bilinear form trace xy. And it's very easy to check that the adjoint, the image of add lies in the special orthogonal group that you get from using that quadratic form. Using that quadratic form. Okay, and you can even explicate it, choose a basis just to be concrete about it. And I'll choose more or less the standard basis you would think you would teach anyone to use for SL3. Okay, so you know, E11 minus E22 for the diagonal matrix 1 minus 1, 0, the usual stuff. And then you get that SO of SL3, thanks to the adjoint embedding, is SOJ, where that's the J that represents. Where that's the J that represents the quadratic form that you build the SO out of, that's stabilized by the image of add. And that's not quite the split SO8, which is what I was hoping to use for that automorphic minimal representation. But if f contains the cube words immunity, then in fact, that does give you a split SO8. You can conjugate J. It's easy to check. You can do the eigenvalues in your head, perhaps. And so lo and behold, this structure really. So lo and behold, this structure really does have the cube roots of unity hidden in it, okay, to write down the split SO8. All right. And there's what you get. It's just some formula for the record. That's the ad that you end up needing to use when you actually do, after some work, you can reduce to really worrying about this add from add G to add N. And this is the kind of thing you get. Okay, so after some work, eventually you get the formula I showed you, which is not very illuminating, but there you go. But there you go. Now I want to talk about the metaplectic group. And the question always is: where do I pay the price for being on the covering group? Because it has to be somewhere. There's some number theory there. Where is the number theory? And so I want to show you that. Okay, so I'm working with a covering group. So I'll take a group consisting of SL3 cross a cube root of unity, one row or rho squared. And it's a central extension. So the first entry is just multiplying. So the first entry is just multiply, but when I multiply the cube roots of unity, there is a two co-cycle, sigma of G1, G2. This was constructed quite a long time ago and 50 years ago, probably. I don't know. Anyway, so that's a certain two-co-cycle. And it's not too hard to see that the upper unipotents embed by the trivial section. But what doesn't, what does the group, the covering group does split. The covering group does split, but in a serious way over SL3O. And here again, I'm staying away from P equals 3. Okay, so I mean, my residue characteristic is, of course, not 3. Okay, otherwise I'd have to go to a subgroup. Okay, so K equals SO3O does split in the cubic cover, but you need a section. I'm going to call the map Kappa. It picks up 3 by 3. It picks up a three by three matrix of integers of determinant one and hands me a cube root of unity. And I'm going to need to keep track of that because I really want to do the fundamental lemma for the unit element in the genuine spherical Hecke algebra. And so that is a map, a function I'm calling F0. And I have to take into account that, you know, g has to be in K, and it's a genuine map. And it's a genuine map, but it also has to see the splitting. So, even if the formula is a little too much to take in so quickly, but it has to see the splitting in order to be the right object that's the right element in the unit Hecke algebra, in the spherical Hecke algebra, the genuine spherical Hecke algebra. So the F0, which you build into the orbital integral, sees the splitting. That's the thing I want you to take away. That's the thing I want you to take away. And that's where you really have to pay the price that you're in the cubic cover. So, how bad could it be? Here's a formula for the splitting. Okay, this is in the G is in the big cell. It's actually, this is accept a set of measure zero in the big cell. And here's a formula for the splitting. And it's in terms one, two, three, four cubic Hilbert symbols, this pairing. Hilbert symbols. This pairing dot parentheses of three is the cubic Hilbert symbol. And there's a formula. You can get it by using an algorithm presented by Bump and Hofstein in 1987. I'm not sure where it comes from. Maybe them, maybe not. I don't know. But anyway, but you have to use that and do some work. And this is what you get. So now your integral involves things like that. And you have to do it. So it's Kuznetsov integral. Those are straightforward. We've known how to do those. You know, Klusterman sums on GL. Kluestermann sums on GL3. Gosh, I wrote a paper about that in 1984 or something. But now it involves this strange thing as well. So that's what goes into it. Anyway, you do some work. And here's the fundamental lemma for the big cell orbital integral. There are other fundamental lemmas that go. And it says that the two orbital integrals, one on PGL3 and involving this exotic period, one on the cubic cover of SL3 match up. Of SL3 matches up to a factor, a transfer factor, and that's okay because as I take the product over all places, that transfer factor will be one by Hilbert reciprocity. So that's the fact that we get. We didn't know that that would be the transfer factor we would get when we started the project that came out. And in fact, the transfer factor for the other relevant orbits is different from that. So I don't know of a way to predict it in advance. We just had to do the work to find it. Okay, so that's what we've proved. Okay, so that's what we've proved. And it took us two and a half years or something. And like I said, we are at work on the full spherical HEC algebra and need some new ideas. And we'll see. I'm optimistic, but I tend to be an optimistic person. Okay. Now, I want to tell you what's behind the proof. What's really the takeaway from this? And it's sort of a beautiful and interesting story. When you do Shimura correspondences and Shimura correspondences, and we have a number of examples. We have Jacques Kay doing the classical Shimura correspondence. We have Mao Rawlis doing the cubic cover of SL2. When you do a Shimura correspondence by the relative trace formula, some real live number theory comes in. And there's always a number theoretic fact that's key. So for Jacques' work on the Shimura correspondence, it was the computation of a certain Salier sum. A Salier sum is a classical A Solier sum is a classical sum. It's like a Klustermann sum, but with an additive character. And it's a classical fact that a Klustermann sum with a quadratic, sorry, with a quadratic character, it's like a Klustermann sum with a quadratic character that can be expressed in terms of Gauss sums. So this goes back to a long time ago, but it relates a Klustermann sum to a Gauss sum, but using an exotic Klusterman sum. And that was key in Jacques's work. And that was key in Jacquet's work. And then, in the work of Mao and Wallace, there was something similar. It was surprising. It involved a cubic exponential sum, and it involved a Klustermann sum with a cubic character. And that identity is due to Duke and Avonyas, that those two things are linked, and it's related to the Davenport-Haase relation. So there's an identity of an exponential sum. Of an exponential sum and some kind of a Klusterman sum. If you're not up on Klusterman sums, one will be on the slide in just a couple of minutes. But it's a classical kind of number theoretic thing. The folks that work on Poincaré series and Kuznetsov formula, the analytic number theorists, would be writing down Kluztermann sums all day. And the point is that this equality turned out to play a role in the work of Malin Wallace. Now, I have to give you a little bit of a historical. Give you a little bit of a historical aside because it's too beautiful not to. There is, of course, an Archimedean world as well. And so you might ask, What's the Archimedean analog of all this stuff? And for Duke and Ivanyich, they actually remark in their paper that there is an analog of this at a real Archimedean place, even though it's cubic covers, never mind. But it's Nicholson's formula for the Airy integral. And none of us in this room know what Nicholson's formula for the Airy integral is, of course. integral is of course but here's a formula cosine of tq plus ty and it's expressible in terms of a special a Bessel function of the first time a k at the argument one-third what's amazing about this is that this was proved by Nicholson before the Shimura correspondence existed and I think it very likely that Nicholson had no sense that they were doing anything related to number theory whatsoever. Theory, whatsoever. And then, many, many years later, you know, generations later, this formula motivated Duke and Ivanich, which then turns out to feed into correspondences that generalize, you know, the Shimura correspondence that pick up automorphic representations on one group and move them to another group. So I think there's sort of some amazing history there. And we can hope that our work will also pay dividends years and half a century or more later. Years and half a century or more later. And here's an example where it did. So I thought that was too nice not to tell you. Okay, so I want to tell you about the work of Duka Navayev. And they start out on the cubic exponential sum with a cubic exponential sum that looks like this. Kf is the residue field, and it's basically Ax cubed plus Bx over P. And it's very important for them that the additive character is what... that the additive character is what we would call a conductor, well, P inverse or one, however, you want, you know, that there's a P to the first in the denominator. Okay, so the additive character is trivial on the ideal P, but not on the ideal O. Okay, so that's really important to them. And those are the sums that they prove match these Klusterman sums. And I'll write down integrals instead of sums, of course, but I'll write down Klusterman integrals as p at. Down cluser and integrals as piadic integrals just in another slide or two, and they will involve a cubic character, and that's going to be important. Okay. What we need to do to make our comparison is show that you can also say something when the character has the additive character is higher conductor. So instead of a p, it's a p to the n. So it's a sort of more oscillatory exponential sum with a higher power of p in the denominator. Of P in the denominator. And what we get to do is not use Davenport-Haasa, but we use the method of stationary phase. And we show that quite remarkably these facts fit together perfectly with very, very different methods. And so these identities of different kinds of exotic sums or p-adic integrals, however you want to think of them, really comes by combining Duke and Ivanyich and then combining the method of stationary phase. And that turns out to be an important. And that turns out to be an important part of our ability to affect this comparison of orbital integrals. Okay. And what ends up happening is you do these rather, these p-iadic integrals I thought were easy, but turn out to be incredibly complicated. And eventually we're able to get integrals that reduce to pairs of Klusterman integrals with cubic characters. I'll write those down, but those are the more number theoretic things. Kluestermann integrals, again, you know, analytic number theorists. Again, you know, analytic number theorists have been friendly with them for 50 years or whatever. So, but the surprising thing is they're very hard to actually evaluate explicitly. We then make them into cubic integral, cubic exponential integrals. And Lord knows no one ever evaluates cubic exponential integrals, but we actually do. We put them into pairs of cubic exponential integrals and miracles happen. And we're able to actually do the computation to compare them to the integrals on the other side. So it's actually quite. The other side. So it's actually quite a remarkable thing to make work. And a lot of different parts of sort of more algebraic stuff and more analytic stuff fit together perfectly to allow the comparison to go forward. Okay, so I thought I would finally show you what these things are. So here's a cubic exponential integral. Psi is an additive character. I'm over a local field. I'm integrating over this nice compact group O. And of course, A and B are typically not going to be an O, otherwise. Typically, not going to be an O, otherwise the psi would be identically one, but that's a cubic exponential integral. And here's the Klusterman thing I keep talking about. It's an additive character. Again, think of C and D as having a denominator. So the character, the additive character psi is not trivial. And the Klusterman business is that it has, we're integrating over units, and there's both a U and a U inverse. And that's the classically e to the 2 pi i times N A plus M A bar, where A and A are. A bar where A and A are inverses mod P. That's the thing you would see classically. And then here's this cubic character given by a cubic Hilbert symbol. And those are the things that we link. And so there's some relation that they're equal. In the first case is the conductor basically P case. And here, three doesn't divide the valuation of T. If you know your Hilbert symbols, three does divide the valuation of T, that's trivial. Of T, that's trivial. And so the Duke of Vanya stuff works when the cubic character is a non-trivial cubic character. And then the stationary phase part, the second bullet is us for stationary phase. And that works actually whether or not the character is trivial. So that's the equality we prove. And we actually happen to need an identity for the record when Dukevanus doesn't apply. And so there is. Doesn't apply. And so there is some identity. Therefore, the record is an identity. But we're really, you know, having to handle these cubic exponential integrals for valuation of x equals L. L, you know, of course, might be, well, a and b and l play off against each other so that it's non-trivial. And so we get these rather remarkable identities. And all of that feeds into the comparison of the fundamental lemma that I showed you. All right. Let's see. All right. Let's see. I must have rushed a little bit, but in my last couple of minutes, I do want to tell you what it was like to do this during the pandemic. We started this project before the pandemic. We teach at different universities, but they're five kilometers apart, the Great Advantage of Boston. We even live closer, and so we would work at one office or the other. And we worked very, very hard on this problem of taking the orbital integral and taking the distribution and write. The distribution and writing it as a sum of factorizable orbital integrals, which by the way, Yannis Sakalaridis proposed we should describe that as the geometrization, the geometrization of the distribution. So we worked very hard on geometrizing the distribution with lots of wonderful ideas that didn't turn out to work. And when the pandemic started, I think neither of us really knew whether this project, which we've been working on already for six months, was going anywhere or not. And, you know, in the beginning of the pandemic, no one. And, you know, in the beginning of the pandemic, no one was talking to anyone. We were all afraid. And eventually, you know, we got some shots and we got some masks and we started working together outside. Omer bought a blackboard, which sat in his backyard, backyard, excuse me, and we worked together in his backyard. We picked up the project again. We had other things we were working on. We picked up the project and worked together in his backyard wearing masks. And here we And here we were working together. That's Omer wearing a mask and working in his backyard. And we spent a tremendous amount of time in his backyard working together. And I have to tell you, there was a time when we got the shots and the masks came off. And even having the masks came off with someone you know well was a tremendous step forward. And we could feel how much easier it was to work together. I don't understand it. I know for a long time, but it was a difference. But, you know, we live in. But you know, we live in the real world, and at some point, the blackboard broke. But you know, you can see what we did. It involved a lot of squatting. We got very strong leg muscles, and we kept working, leaning it against the railing of his porch. But eventually, we're not engineers, but eventually we got smart and came up with a much better solution. The rocks keep it from bonking his kids because this is a little backyard. And you can see. Backyard. And you can see we really would work on that board. And we worked and worked. And this was hard. This was really hard. It took so long to make it work. And in fact, we worked on it as the seasons changed. He has a wonderful backyard to watch the leaves change. So I hope you'll all get to Boston as the leaves change. And it's a beautiful season. Anyway, so that was the story. And now, of course, we're finally back to working together indoors. Working together indoors and enjoying that a lot and pushing this project forward. And I'm hopeful that at the end of the day, our hope is to really get the correspondence of automorphic representations between genuine automorphic representations on a covering group and automorphic representations. And I think fulfill a little bit of the philosophy that people like Kajdan and Flicker and Patterson brought to us in the 1980s. And it's still a ways to go, but hopefully. It's still a ways to go, but I'm hopeful that we'll eventually be able to tell you about that. So, thank you very much. And again, thank you so much for being here. It's such a pleasure to be part of this. Do we have any questions? I don't know if you said this, I might have missed it, but is there any change? Missed it, but is there any chance that you could, for your unit elements on fundamental lemma, give some kind of geometric proof? I think it is definitely possible. One could try to apply Viecuang Do's approach. And I don't think it would be shorter than the proof we gave if you look at the steps that he needed. But it's certainly a natural question. And I, you know, have even put it to a grad student, though I think he may end up to accepting. Though I think he may end up to accepting other than that, but it's certainly a natural question. And yeah, one could probably get there with different methods. I do feel like these number theoretic facts that keep coming up would have to come up in some other guise. I mean, the things that I highlighted as key ingredients would have to come up. And indeed, some of the details could certainly be different. And so, yes, that definitely seems possible. You know, when we started this project, we had this conjecture from 20 years ago, which I think almost has been forgotten. And, you know, really the hope was to prove that it was even a reasonable conjecture. And now that we have the fundamental lemma, I think we're now at a point where we really feel that there's a firm basis for expecting that this correspondence exists. That's really the key takeaway. And then, yes, there may be other ways to get to that point. There may be other ways to get to that point. Any further questions? I mean, so you have triple covers of SL3. And what's the next thing you would try to do after that if you were brave? Well, right. So, I mean, I think that if you're going to use relative trace formula methods, you need a period. And I've thought. And I thought quite hard together with David Gunsberg about this. And as Lapid mentioned, David is really just an amazing person with understanding of how integrals ought to work and period integrals ought to work. And so we don't have a good answer. It may be that the inspiration will come from a different direction. As I mentioned, Cyclaritis and Vancatician Ben Sve have been thinking about period integrals in the concept. Thinking about period integrals in the context of reductive groups and certain period integrals, not all of them, but they have a nice picture. So, I think probably my instinct would be to try to peer more deeply into that work and see if that leads us to anything. I don't think there's an immediate next project in front of us, but I think that's the direction that to me seems the most promising. Further questions? With nothing, let's thank the speaker again. Continue half an hour.
