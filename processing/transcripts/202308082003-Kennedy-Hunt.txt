The scheme is quite rich, it's full of geometry, and consequently it's kind of a challenging object to study. And we want tools to study it. And the theme of this talk is about how I can study a Hilbert scheme with degeneration techniques. X proper? Huh? Is X proper? Yeah, X is proper, yes. Otherwise, well, I mean, I guess no. You don't need X proper. We can take X proper. I can we can take it, but you said project. Yeah, I said projector. Oh, I missed projector. Sorry, I um to test my team. Okay. Um so the plan is to study it with degeneration techniques. So what I'd like to do is I'd like to degenerate x, and maybe I want to understand the Hilbert scheme of x, and so I'm going to degenerate x into something which I hope I can understand more easily. So maybe I'm going to degenerate it into something which is a union of like irrigation. Into something which is a union of like irreducible components glued along some devices. And the question I want to address is: how should we degenerate the Hilbert scheme of X in such a way that the Hilbert scheme of that special fiber is something we can actually understand better than we could understand the original hub of the scheme? So I want to put something in the place of question mark which is easier to understand. So, how am I going to do that? By the way, I meant to say at the start, my slides are on my website if I've gone quickly and want to glance back. Okay, so I wanted to degenerate my Hilbert scheme into that question mark, and that question mark, well, the thing that that I noticed is that on the special fiber, um I I had a reducible variety. I had a reducible variety. And so let's think about the Hilbert scheme of that reducible variety. So, what's the point of that Hilbert scheme? Well, all it is that some closed subschemes. Let me just draw a closed subscheme here. And what I can notice about a closed subscheme of such a reducible guy is it has two bits. It has a bit in x1 and it has a bit in x2. So to give a point of the Hill. So, to give a point of the Hilbert scheme of the union of x1 and x2, I could give you a point of the Hilbert scheme of x1 and a point of the Hilbert scheme of x2, such that they agreed, such that they glued along the division. And so what would be nice is if the Hilbert scheme of that, the the question mark, the central fiber radar generation, was just a fiber product. But there's a big problem with this. But there's a big problem with this. And the big problem with this is that there does not exist a map from the Hilbert scheme of a variety to the Hilbert scheme of a divisor. So, what we wanted to do is we wanted to degenerate to something I can understand better, something simpler, but this naive hope that I can understand the Hope that I can understand the Hilbert scheme of each irreducible piece, including together. That's not going to be possible. It's to write down that fiber product just makes no sense. But so essentially then, what the log Hilbert scheme is going to do is it's going to resolve that issue. So it's going to let us have a map from the Hilbert scheme of x to the Hilbert scheme of divisor. Of X to the Hilbert scheme of the divisor. And that means when I degenerate into something reducible, I really can understand my special fiber as glued out of a bunch of pieces. And each piece is maybe simple to understand. And so if I understand that special fiber better, I can get to the geometry of the general fiber. Okay, so I meant to erase that and then redraw it, but I guess we've got. Okay, so what's going on here is if I told you there's If I told you there's no map from the Hilbert scheme of X, no Hilbert scheme of divisor, but there kind of wants to be a map. So we can imagine that I have P2 here, the black circle, and on P2 I have three devices. So the Toric boundary devices. And these are the things in blue. And then I have a closed sub-scheme, and I've drawn that in red. And what I would like is I'd like a map from the Hilbert scheme of S. is I'd like to map from the Hilbert scheme of X to the Hilbert scheme of my divisor. And what I can do is I can just restrict my sub scheme to that divisor. It doesn't extend to a complete map, but that makes sense a lot of the time. So I do have a rational map there. And so in particular, gonna be So what's the case? Oh, it doesn't like it when I'm drawing. Okay, that's a problem. You're on top of the cable. Oh, I'm on top of the cable. Thank you. It's not like it. If I put it flat, maybe that's going to work. Well, I'm not I think I'm going too fast, so this is an excellent like way to moderate my speed. I don't have an excellent it's a way. It's a way. Okay, so there is some open set on which this map is required. And so there are some open sets. And I'd like to highlight here that what what's happened is we've gone from this wanting to degenerate something. This wanting to degenerate something and study a degeneration problem to studying the Hilbert scheme of essentially a pair. So, what's like the natural Hilbert scheme for, instead of just a variety, a variety with a divisor on it. And this is potentially one way of thinking about what the log Hilbert scheme does. But these two questions are very related. Okay, so so far we've just been talking about Hilbert schemes. Could you say a word about the locus on which the map is going to be defined? Is it the locus of schemes that are transformed? Defined? Is it the locus of schemes that are transverse? It's a transversality condition. I think you know this Tevalev, Tevalev's transversality, this bulk flatness condition? In the presence of a Taurus action. Yeah, in the presence of a Taurus action. So it's exactly that for Tauric varieties, and it's the natural generalization for log things. Okay. Yeah. We have ways to characterize it, but they're a bit wordy for this. But they're a bit wordy for this length of talk. Okay, cool. So the goal becomes to compactify this data. And the log-Hilbert scheme resolves this issue. So there's a proper moduli space, and it has a morphism extending the rational map we talked about before. So can I ask, you know, often you can resolve a rational map by blowing up, right? So I guess there's a map from the local esteem to just the ordinary holder scheme. I don't... I don't know how to write that. In some examples, there happens to be, but in general, I don't think that's. Like there's no map in general. I don't think there should be, no. There's a rational map, because they share this disability step. Are you going to say something about what appears in the double? Are you going to say something about what appears in the document? Yes. Okay, that grease. Yeah, so there's a proper modulized space. I should say proper has a valuative criterion and also it needs to be finite type. The finite type bit is upcoming work of myself and Drew. So that's for the finite type bit of properness. Of properness. And this kind of leads, I'll just say one thing to kind of tempt people to ask me about it later. The natural thing is, it's like a K-theory version of tropicalizational list. It's kind of the ingredient that goes into the finite time part. But yeah, so this is kind of the main theorem. So it's a tropical moduli space, and it's got this map. And so it's essentially, the rest of the talk is telling you a bit about what this moduli space. Telling you a bit about what this functionized space looks like, and also trying to convince you that it's quite reasonable, it's something you can really work with. So, I should say this builds on other work. So, in the case I'm taking a Hilbert scheme of curves, this was, or even more generally, a quad scheme of things which have one-dimensional support. This is Dhruv and Devesh Mollek. Dhruv and Devash Molek, their log DT theory paper. For D, a smooth divisor, so in particular, every picture I've drawn, this was done in work of Li and Wu. And the third thing I'll say is everything I'm going to say works for quote schemes. So Hilbert schemes are special case of quote schemes. There's a very related alternative approach, which is work in progress of Bern Siebert, Petier Talcott, and Richard Thomas. Was Lee Wu also? Is Leon Blue also the curve case? Oh, no, it's smooth divisor quotes. Okay, so you have this space, it compactifies this data. One of the first things you want is examples. What's the simplest example of a Hilbert scheme? Well, it's projective space. So the moduli space of hypersurfaces. A hypersurface has an equation, and the coefficient of that equation give you the The coefficients of that equation give you the point of objective space. So, what happens when I do the log version of that? So, the log version of hypersurface in a toric variety. And this theorem is that it's as nice as you could hope. What's the nicest thing you could hope? Rather embarrassing, you're just told now that there's no map, but in this case, there is a map. So, projective space, as a log geometer, the nicest thing which is The nicest thing which isn't quite projective space is a Torik variety. So the log version of the moduli space of hybrid surfaces and a toric variety is itself a toric variety. In other words, it's a toric stat. So this is a Tauric stat. And the fan of this guy is interesting in his own right. So there are secondary polytopes. These are things that Gelfan, Petranov, and Zelovinsky defined. Defined the kind of rich combinatorial structure. And the fan of the log linear system is built out of the secondary polycode. So, really, all the interesting structure of that fan is entirely captured in the combinatorics of those secondary polycodes. And so, yeah, this is just a torrent modification. So, this is something you can tell your computer about. If it's a fan, you can really. It's a fan you can really tell a computer about. It's something which is entirely combinatorial to say. And so the boundary points in that LLS, what are they parametrizing? So these are hypersurfaces and some other blow-up of projective space? Yeah, I will get to that in like three slides. It's coming, I promise. Okay, thanks. Which means of Torrex thing. So like stacky fans. So like you have like a, you know what I mean. You know what I mean? I don't in I don't in sounds I mean they were actually the points correspond to like topical episodes using the fancy topic. Sorry. Yeah yeah. Okay. But before what everyone wants me to actually say, let me try and convince you that these places are not like Convince you that these spaces are not like horrendously wacky, and that we can actually do something with them. So, we've already talked about hypersurfaces in target things. That's a nice example, which we can work with. What else do Hilbert schemes do for us? Well, if you're in a numerative geometer, you might care about DP theory. So, that's a Hilbert scheme of threefold, personal threefold. And that has a virtual fundamental. And that has a virtual fundamental class. And Druvan Devesch do this construction for curves, and they showed you have a virtual fundamental class. You can do the enumerative geometry. Also, for the quartz scheme case, you have enumerative invariance. So it plays well with enumerative geometry. Another nice example of a Hilbert scheme is the Hilbert scheme of points on the surface. That's, for example, smooth. example smooth. If I take the Hilbert scheme, so this is a result of again driven Devesh. If I take the so this should be S and C pair of the surface, X surface, this is also an S and C pair. Another way you can see it's workable, you can construct stable map spaces from Hilbert schemes and log stable map spaces from log Hilbert schemes. So there's So there's this kind of rich theory of log stable maps and it's done many things and this is like trying to some there's somehow parallel in that it's doing it for like modulized coherent sheaves instead of instead of well this very special case this projections of coherent sheaves instead of simple. So what is what would you like? Uh that you that this is not like a horrendous space which you can never study. Huh? The log thing. Yeah, Hill blog. Yeah. Sorry. Okay, so now I'm going to finally start to answer the question. And before telling you a geometric answer to the question, I'm just going to wave a log wand, and then I will unpack that log wand in terms of actual geometry that you want to see in Kerala. Geometry that you want to see and care about. But I started by telling you about the Hilbert scheme. I said it was a moduli space, so I should give you a nice functor of points. And what I started with is I started with the closed immersion. So Z was a closed immersion into X times S. But closed is the same as proper. And closed immersions, so monomorphism is categorical language for injection. So I could have, instead of saying closed immersion, So I could have, instead of saying closed immersion, I could have said proper monomorphism in the category of schemes. And when I do the log version, I can look in the category of log schemes, I can say the same words, and I can see what happens. And then I need to do some stuff which I am sweeping up at the run to make sure everything is fine. Okay, these are just words. There's no good geometry there. So when you say integral, that means you're only when you're parametrizing useful things? No, integral is like the log. Integral is like the log. It's like a flatness thing. Okay, it's not super important. No, no, no, no, nothing's like that. It's like a part of flatness. Sorry, but yeah. I won't say more. Okay. I guess that's a train. Yeah, so tropomonomorphisms. I want to turn this into geometry that you actually care about. And so these tropomonomorphisms, they come in two parts. They come in two parts. The first part is combinatorial, the tropical, or for experts, a log modification. And the second part is a closed sub-scheme, so an ordinary log scheme. So I can rewrite, so my proper monomorphism I'm going to factor into two bits. This guy here is a closed immersion. Is a closed immersion. And this guy here is something I can understand with tropical geometry, something combinatorial. So I'll just take a log modification for experts. What does X cross S sub gamma mean? What is gamma? Um that that so that's just my notation for this. So it's um if you have a torrent variety, um I could subdivide its span. I could subdivide its fan. And a subdivision I would be calling M. It's just a sub it's just like a target. If S was target and X was target, it would exactly be a target. Target subdivision. Was the version strict? Yes, strict. So the combinatorial part is a subdivision of trupex. What does trupx mean? Let's think about xatorx for X mean? Let's think about X hotoric variety, where trop X is just the fan of X. So in black there, I've drawn the fan of P2. And then what I've done is I've done a subdivision of the fan of P2. And this records the combinatorial data. So this records this second bit, this combinatorial piece of data. And now what I need to do is tell you how I get a closed subscheme. So whenever I draw a picture like this on the left, A picture like this on the left, there is some dictionary which turns it into an expansion, so a geometric object. So what I can see on the right is kind of a sketch of this geometric object. And what's happened is whenever I have a dot on the left, I have an irreducible component on the right. You can see that this dot here matches up with that irreducible component, and so on. And so I get this black thing on the right. This black thing on the right, and in red, I've drawn a closed sub-scheme. So, this is what the Long-Kilbert scheme is a modulized case of. Closed sub-schemes inside these expansions, so these gadgets built out of tropical geometry. And these, of course, these have a map to my original variety, so P2 in this case, which is just kind of collapsing all the other components down. Down. And one of the key observations to make the link with tropical geometry is that when you look at this thing on the right, some of the irreducible components are a little bit silly. So if I look at this irreducible component here, there's not actually anything in it. It's not something which is somehow important. And so to make the And so, to make the length of tropical geometry, what you need to do is need to identify the silly components. And I've now drawn the corresponding bits of my tropical picture in yellow, and you just throw them out. So, I've just thrown out all the yellow bits, and I've got a picture like this. I've got like three or four minutes. Cool. Okay. Um okay, and so I get this tropical picture. Um and then I want to I want to give you an analogy. So a space which I guess it's a curves conference, so I have to mention curves somehow. So you can think about the moduli space of logs moved curves, Mgn. And this has a And this has an associated tropical guy, which is MGM Trop, which is like the moduli space of pictures which look like this, and they have some edge lengths. And this is a combinatorial gadget which you associate with the moduli space of log-smooth curves, and it kind of helps us understand it. If I think about the log-Hilbert scheme instead, The log-Hilbert scheme instead, I'm going to have another modular space. So, when you say log-smooth curves, you're thinking of the pair of MgN inside MgN-bar? Sorry, M, sorry, I meant MgN-bar. But when you associate MgN drop to that, you're somehow looking at the pair. You're looking at MgN-bar with a distinguished boundary divisor. Yeah, but if you thought about the modulois spacing from log-smooth curves on the log scheme, that would pick out that boundary divisor. Log scheme that would pick out that boundary device for you. But yeah, I agree. So, yes, it is kind of the pair. How does LogSmooth pick out the boundary divisor? So maybe you ask me after is the right answer to that. We push forward the singular logos of the universal curve. So if you push forward a constant shift and on the singular level. And on the single okay, I agree that the boundaries, the singular curves. Okay, okay, all right. Okay. So the right tropical object to associate to this guy is a moduli space of these pictures. So in this picture, I have three lengths which are important. L1 is kind of a disk. L1 is kind of the distance between these two. L2 is here, and L3 is there. And in this way, I can build up a moduli space. So this guy here is a moduli space of those pictures. And I have a couple more minutes. So I will say kind of the punchline of the connection. Of the connection. So the point is that in order to actually study this log-Hilbert scheme, in order to prove theorems about it, in order to understand its structure better, what you need to do is understand. So this is a purely combinatorial object. This is a modulation. Combinatorial object. This is a moduli space. So this is very much like NGN trot. And the A star is some log geometry magic to make that map actually make some sense. And the guy on the, and then the point is that the fibers of this map are ordinary Hilbert schemes. Are ordinary Hilbert schemes. So they're algebraic, they're very nice, they're something we completely understand. Well, in as much as Hilbert schemes are hard, but they're no harder than ordinary Hilbert schemes. We're schemes of the generations of your original X? Yeah, yeah, so the picture I drew before of that thing where I had the expansions, the Hillman scheme of that. Exactly that. Yeah. Sorry, the fibers like. Yeah. Sorry, the fibers like fibers seems not proper things. No, that's proper. Are you saying that map is proper? That map is not proper. No, sorry. Yeah, the map is not proper. These are open subsets of Hilbert scheme? And locally closed subsets of Hilbert scheme is correct, yeah. Ah, okay. And this this map is this guy here is proper. This map is not proper. So the fibers are are So the fibers are are subsets are subsets of Hilbert states. Yeah, that's right. Okay. Sorry, I didn't mean to say Hilbert Steve. They're locally kind of subsets of Hilbert's teams. Yes. Okay. I think I've used my time. Questions for the speaker? One minute, and then we'll just set up very nice time. Very intimidating. Is there any privilege relation on your closed? Yes. So if you remember, I said there were some silly things. So I said that in this picture, there were some components. I was like, why are they bad? Well, you could add some more components, and you'd still be like, why are they bad? And so the equivalence relation is like, you know, I can add an extra thing here. And look, Add an extra thing here. And look, that's added all new components. So they shouldn't be there. So the equivalence relation just identifies if I do that kind of pullback. And if you're worried about defent issues, it's okay. Wonderful to hear. So, like, because the logger tile topology is like, it's not sub-canonical, it's like horrible. You might worry that if I If I start inverting stuff, if I start inverting log modifications, you then don't know what's going on. But it's okay because you've got log flatness everywhere, so you're not actually self-developing the bits, you need to sell device things. And let's actually save any future questions for after the other talk, so let's think let's keep here. And why not we can mean in just Hopefully it's being interested.
