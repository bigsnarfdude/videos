Okay, so thank you for the introduction. First of all, I would like to thank the organizer for giving me this opportunity. Claudio Gila Plecha, it is a pleasure. The first time I could make it to Bank, so I'm very happy to be here. Okay, everyone, the topic I think is one of my favorite ones, which is CAP problem. Okay, I'm Okay, we have an excellent talk about the water wave, free boundary issues, and fluid mechanics. So I'm going to be fast a little bit into presenting you the problem, but what I want you to take into account is just that we have here fantastic wave because of the Ocean, but I don't want to talk today about this this kind of wave. I'm going to talk about this wave that you see over here. Wave that you see over here. Okay, this line in which we have here a moist sun and dry sun. So this is the kind of wave and interesting, this is the Muscat project. So the result is this one, which is a joint work with Hon Jidong in Brown and Hui Kuan Lingu Jane in Verda, University of Melana. Okay, the questions. Please stop me at any time if I'm going fast or if I'm going, if you have any question. I'm going to consider a fluid in a pulled medium. So as in the picture, thinning water inside sun, okay? Filtering sun. So I'm going to consider incompressible condition. I'm going to pick two dimensions. Two dimensions. It's going to be easy for us to draw the wave we want to understand. Basic equation, which is the conservation of mass. Now that we have the incompressibility, this is the conservation of mass equation. We draw the density of the fluid. And then in order to close the system, what we have is the basic and fundamental Dasis law, which is the one that is. Is the one that describes how a fluid moves in a foolish medium. Okay, in a full medium. So, this, if you want to understand this very easily, essentially is telling you that forces is equal to momentum instead of forces equal to acceleration. Okay this mu is the viscosity of the fluid. is the viscosity of the fluid, u is the velocity, v is the pressure, and this is gravity force. So that is why we have here density. And I'm removing some constant to make this presentation more clear, like constant like gravity or permeability. Okay? Okay, good. What is the Muscat problem? It's just to consider Is to consider different fluids. Okay, so I'm going to have this interface and I'm going to have here one fluid here and another fluid here. Okay? And we'll tell you that we have different fluid is because we have a jump between the viscosity and a jump between the densities of the fluid. Okay? Very good. Very good. I wanted to show you the interface equation. I think I don't have time to deduce it, but we also have talks about layer potential, double layer potential, and things like that. So, and also the related to Newman map. So, if we consider, let's say, the double Let's say the double layer or single layer potential theory, the layer potential theory in a periodic setting. So we're going to have this interface is going to be f of xx, f of xt, okay, this interface. And we are going to consider a periodic setting, okay, to simplify things. Then, if we use the formula for the double layer potential or the 3-letter layer, Double layer potential of the D-leftonima map operator, the periodic setting, this is our equation. The volition of F is given by the double layer potential, where the double layer potential is given by this thing over here and with the with theta is a Is an unknown which is given implicitly by this equation. So maybe this is a mess of equations, non-local, non-linear, etc. Let me simplify things to make this less linearize and in order to have an idea of what's going on. Okay? So So one G is given small G I mean what you have is G, the double layer potential of a profile F applied to F. But I'm telling you here what is G of F applied to any G. But I have to replace to to get my equation I have to replace Ah the G is not here. I no no no, sorry. I is here, yeah. I is here, yeah. Okay, if here was not just a little bit. So, just linearizing. So, this is a quadratic term I'm going to remove because I'm linearizing. So, what I'm telling is that zero is given by the derivative of g and here. G and here is just the derivative of f okay and I plug in here the derivative of f and simplifying this, this is quadratic, this guy disappeared, I have sine, this is of order minus two, what I have somehow is a Hilbert transform because I have order one here, I have order two here downstairs. Order 2 here downstairs. So I have order minus 1, then I have Hilbert transform of one derivative of G, which is F, Hilbert transform of one derivative of F. This is what we have at the linear level. The Hilbert transform of one derivative of F, which at the end of the day, if we go to the Fourier side, is an absolute value derivative. Value derivative, okay? If you wish, given by the square root of the La Pasha. Where is this saying? Okay, we can solve. We go to the Fourier size and it's very easy to find this solution. So what we get is the you wish when this quantity is positive, when rho 2 over mu 2 is positive, what we have is, we are just doing the Poisson extension or something, the Poisson. Extension or solving the Poisson with the Poisson kernel. So, what we have is a heat equation, but with one derivative. And when this quantity is negative, we have a disaster because we have an exponential growth, and then this doesn't make sense even for a super smooth initial delta. So, what we have is a stable case when the fluid is below, and an unstable case when the fluid is below. And an unstable case when the fluid is on top. Okay? And considering the one fluid case. Very good. So now that we have more or less an idea of what's going on, at least at the linear level, let me introduce you the problem. The problem is a kind of superclassical problem in free mechanics because if from the 34 muscle From the 34 Muscat, try to understand this thing, trying to see how to get oil. And okay, Sam and Taylor did some experiment because mathematically this the evolution of a fluid in a poultice media is analogous to the evolution of a fluid in a helica cell. This is a helica cell in which Sai Chausen, in which you put two flat plates together, close enough so that essentially your fluid moves in one direction. So the two-dimensional Buska problem is equivalent to the evolution of an interface in a Hilly Shausa. Okay, so some references, if you wish, I can give you some. which I can give you some classical result. Classical result for me before 2000. Here you have recent results with a lot of people. So I don't want to go one by one because then I don't have time to show you anything. Okay, let me just to average, you have here more than 60 authors. This is last This is last two year results, which are also a lab. So, in order to try to summarize everything and be fast, what I'm gonna do is to show you how we understand the dynamics comparing with a two-fluid equation. So I'm going to have I'm gonna have two situations. And where I have two situations. The one that they start to talk about, which is the 1D fluid, when we have here fluid, one fluid. Okay. And then one fluid, two fluids. And now you're going to have one fluid here, another. Have one fluid here and another fluid here. Okay? And this is the answer. And please believe that this is the equation for the two fluid case. If we linearize here, we linearize, we have here downstair order two, upstairs order one. So this is again a Hilbert transform of one derivative at the linear level. They are similar, what changes the physical. Change is the physical situation somehow, but okay. So, one of the reasons why there is a lot of now presently a lot of people going on is just that from the fluid mechanic point of view, we find a very interesting dynamics with this with this model. So this is my way of summarizing everything. Way of summarizing the risk. Okay, so for example, it is possible I'm talking all the time in the stable case, because otherwise this is a disaster. So we have in the one flip case, what you have is one fluid downstairs, or if you wish, in the two-flip case, what you have is the denser fluid below, okay? To be in to be in a stable situation. Situation. So we can prove local existence in subcritical spaces, local existence and uniqueness. Okay, this workpose. When we have small data, what we find is that the nonlinear problem is more or less similar to the linear one. So we have this square of the lamp. So we have this square root of the La Prajan and then we have global assistance. Okay? One interesting thing here is just that it is possible to prove singularities. So when we have, for this model, so when we have lashed data, our system is not, let's say, parabolic anymore, and we don't see this parabolic behavior anymore because we can find singularities. This is very interesting in the fluid mechanical. Mechanical through mechanical community. Okay? So we could prove that it is possible to find splash singularities in the case of the one fruit case. What is a splash singularity? Splash singularity is when we see two particles moving, okay, getting these two particles in finite time collide. In finite time, collide. Okay? There is a collision of these two particles in finite time, but the regularity of the interface remain. Okay? This is important because our fluid is incompressible, so we violate the incompressibility condition. So in finite time, we have a collision. And once we have the collision, And once we have the collision, we cannot continue with the evolution of the model. We have to understand the physical situation in a different manner. So in the case of one fluid, it's possible to have a splash, but in the case of the two fluid, we can remove this singularity. So the one fluid case is particularly singular. There is no square singularity, square singularity when we have. It's quite similarity when we have the collision, more wide collision along a segment, let's say. Instead of a particle, we have a segment of particles that collide. So it is not possible to have this square singularity in both scenarios. Uh in the one fluid case, if we start as with as a graph, we remain a graph all the time. We remain a graph all the time. There is a maximum principle. But in the two-free case, it is possible to have wave breaking. We call it turning because it's not a real singularity, because of the parabolicity of the problem, even though if you start with a graph and in finite time you turn, because you are analytic, your your interface survives sometimes. Sometimes when you are in an unstable situation, but later there is finite time singularities. In the two-fluid case, there is no global system for large data. This is the situation that I told you, in which we start with a large graph, interface term. interface term and then we have singularities because it's in the in the in a stable regime once the free turn and then it is possible to to prove finite singularities okay and okay recently this it was possible to prove uh local existing in critical there there are results proving local existing in critical spaces. Okay, not not subcritical in critical spaces. I forgot to tell you, but because we have a parabolic regime, we have scaling, and then we can talk about critical syncritical. Essentially, to have an idea what is critical, a critical norm with respect to the scaling is legit. So one derivative scale infinity is critical. Is critical. Okay? Very good. So, what I'm going to talk about in the remaining table is I'm going to solve these two questions. In the one fluid case, I'm going to be able to show you that there is global assistance. There is a global system for large data. If we consider this graph a scenario, so there is no blow-up in a critical setting. Okay, so this is the result. So you give me an initial leap curve, so I can draw. Curve, so I can draw something like that in the case of one fluid. And then we have we find a global solution in this setting, this Lebesgue setting, which is kind of classical in the sense that we can satisfy the control equation in L2, and this solution is unique. Okay? The solutions that we find are unique. Okay? So, for example, in this setting, in this problem in which we discover a lot of different types of singularities, this is the first time that it is possible to construct unique global solutions for this problem in which you consider any size, any arbitrary size. Any size, any arbitrary size. Remember that somehow if the slope is small, at the end what remains is this parabolic behavior when the slope is big, so while thing can happen. And in this case, we could prove that there is no white thing happen, and we have a solution for all type. Okay? Up to minutes, and in this remaining thing. And in this remaining ten minutes, I'm gonna try to show you difficulties and then some ingredients. Okay? Okay, so why this is difficult to get? Okay, remember that we have low regularity. The result that we want to do is low regular for low regularity, critical For low regularity, critical result. Well, when we have a high regularity, it is not difficult to get a maximum principle for the equation. Okay, so if we initially are leaches, then we are leaching for all time. If we have smooth solutions. Also, it is easy to satisfy the counter equation because everything in The counter equation because everything is regular. It is not difficult to get uniqueness because you subtract two equations, you check how the evolution goes, and then you can get uniqueness. But this is an open problem, it is very difficult to propagate regularity. You put more than Liche, let's say double F H 30, it is not known how to propagate regularity because of its strongly non-linear non-linearity. Because of this strongly non-linear, non-local system. Okay? The thing that you can do is local, local system. What we know. Okay? But if we consider low regularity, what happens with low regularity? It's difficult to get the maximum principle because now how do you understand the equation? How do you, okay? It is difficult to satisfy the counter equation. Equation, okay, because you are at the minimum regularity to have it. And also, it is difficult to be a unionist because if you subtract two solutions, then you cannot consider the volution because the volution is not well defined. And then you subtract, and then you lose derivative everywhere. And then even though somehow we have these three difficult things, we are able to prove global reality. And this is what I'm gonna try to do. I'm gonna try to show you in five minutes or so. Okay, so okay, this is just to first thing to prove is the system. So somehow we have to combine the explicit equation that I showed you with the explicit kernel, but also this implicit. this this implicit implicit way just to to to formulate the direct to Newman map okay so what I'm gonna do is what we did is to to use the the potential okay to write the the velocity the velocity is divergent free and satisfy the Darcy's law okay but Darcy's law is telling you that in the bulk when you have a fluid your velocity Fluid, your velocity has to be rotational because it's equal to a gradient and then gravity, which is also the agrane or something. So your velocity is rotational. So you can find your velocity in the fluid given by a potential. And because you have a potential, you can integrate Darcy's law. This is just integrating Darcy's law. Because we are irrotational and diversion-free, at the end of the day, our potential, phi, is harmonic. Excellent. We can use theory of harmonic functions. And here is where came the did it led to New Man Map, right? Because Laplace. Because Laplace and is equal to zero. This is a video problem, but at the end, what gives us the volition is the velocity, which is the normal velocity, the normal derivative of the potential. And then here is where the electronic map appeared. Very good. So now we can. We can use hof lemma and find an order. Okay? Because if we have two boundaries which are leaches, some regularities at the point, and we have an order, the whole lemma, and okay, let's say that we have the same value at a point, then we get an order with the divide to NUMA map. With the DD-letter Newman map. This is just the homework. Okay? Which is telling us this order. This order is telling us that we have a smooth solution, we have an order. If initially we have an order for the profile, this has to remain with the dynamic. Okay? This is for regular. It is very easy if you go to the equation and you find a control. To the equation, and you find a contradiction if you assume that there is a point in which f1 is greater than f2. Okay? Very good. Now that we have this order, we can treat y as a parameter, and then this is measuring the leach condition, okay, for f. So we also have a maximum principle for the for the leaching norm, which is very important for us. Which is very important for us. Very good. Then what? We want to regularize and pass to the limit. Okay, so let's try how can we regularize? So a usual thing is to put a Laplacian with a small viscosity, a small parameter epsilon, and then take epsilon to zero. And then you regularize the initial data, and then you want to take the limit. Okay. Okay, so the point that now here we need to find global regularity of this system because we want global in time depending on the maximum principle that we have. And remember that here G is, let's say, implicit thinking in the Derek Lexigree Max map and somehow explicit, more explicit thinking in the double lager potential theory. Layer potential theory. But for example, the only thing, you remember that the equation was explicit in terms of a theta function. The only thing that we know for theta, using the theory of the double layer potential, is that it is bounded in L2. Which is essentially what is telling you this, what is telling this inequality over here. Okay? So for the parameter ferrum here, I have to handle Handle control setup, the only thing that they have is L2. Okay, and L2 bottom. So finding global system for this thing is kind of tricky. We have to use several tricks, but at the end we could make it. And now we want to take limit. We want to take the destiny of epsilon is going to zero. Of silo is going to zero. And then we have to deal with the nonlinearity. The nonlinearity of the system because we want to satisfy the control equation. Well, the nonlinear terms are given by this thing, so we can integrate properly, and because of this integration, we can pass to the limit. Still, there are some tricks, because here we find kind of the integral of a Hilbert transform, but we can pass to the limit. We can pass to the limit, and for this theta, we only have weak convergence. So we are going to have kind of weak because we can integrate, we are going to have a strong here, okay? And then later we can take again the limit. So we can pass to the limit. Very good. So now we have a system. If you believe all the things that I'm telling you, we have a system. What about uniqueness? Well, looking at the difference between two solutions is a mess, but the point is just that because we did an approximation adding the Laplacian to our contour equation, the solution that we get, this is something that we have to prove, are viscosity solutions. If you are not familiar with the viscosity, Viscosity pollution, I have to be done soon, one minute. The thing in general theory, like Randall-Leon theory for Hamilton, Jacobi equations. So what we have is a different notion of viscosity solution or quick solution with a test function having inequalities from above and from below, depending on if you are a subsolution or a super solution. So at the end, we are able So at the end, we are able to prove that the solution that we find is a viscosity solution. And with this viscosity solution, with this viscosity solution notion, using the trick of viscosity solution, regularizing in an appropriate way, we are able to prove that the order that we found for regular solution is also true for this. Also, true for these weak or not that regular solutions. So, on the way, we have to prove, like, to have this argument, we have to prove, like, one inequality for harmonic extension for harmonic function with Leap Gregularity and having just one point of more regularity, we have to prove an inequality using Have a proof of inequality using Nasmos eliteration and different tools. But at the end, we have this comparison principle that give us uniqueness. Okay? What about 3D? I think I don't have time to do our 3D, but 3D give more difficulties. We are working on that. Thank you very much for your attention. Questions? You don't have any difficulty from the scaling criticalness of your space? Any difficulty with the scaling? So you're working in the space which is scaling criticalness. Yeah. So you don't have any difficulty from the counter and you concentration in finite time or something? Anytime or something? Concentration? No, no, I mean, but what do you mean exactly if you want to rescale or something? Yeah, you simply remain in a pre-door space, it can happen in general. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, but we we didn't rescale. No, no, without rescaling the evolution, then the main force does. They forced a solution to concentrate, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean, we are able to prove, let's say, a system for all time, okay, and we have this particular weak or strong solution, depending on your definition, this solution that you satisfy, the counter equation and everything. But we don't know what happened for log, I mean, during this evolution, we don't know. What we know is. Know of what we know is just that the solution that we find exists and is unique. The only thing that we know because of a recent result of Sidan, Nil and Sidu, so Agragual, Patel, and Wu. The only thing that we know is just that if you are leaching. That if you are leaches and then you try to see how is the corner, I mean, if you start with a corner, a big corner with a wide angle, then this corner remains for short time. But apart from that, we don't know about the global dynamic anymore. We don't know what's going on. What's going on? We can say that norms which are less than ditches, so let's say C alpha, decay exponentially. Also not. But apart from that, no idea what's wrong. Correct. Focal real life instead of the periodic computer. So in the real life, it's a matter of decay, but But not regularity. The reason why we work in the periodic setting is because very easily we have this, okay? But in the real line, we don't know if this is bounded. It's a matter of decay. No, it's not a matter of regularity. We suspect that this is true, but at this point we don't know if this is true. And this is essential to have the bound for this implicit therapy function. But as I tell you, it's a matter of decay. No, it's not a matter of decay. I saw that at some point you considered in some sense kind of because it would be by the definition, yeah, it would use both. Okay, so my question is that I have heard But I have heard people expert in a lacarelli and they can even consider for instance the heat equation and solve the heat equation in the backward time. That in your proof this is very interesting too to to solve this We send backward in time to understand the what going backward in time for us is like having the unstable situation. So maybe this is a very good point, like try to understand the unstable situation where you have this exponential with this notion going backward in time. Yeah. And they can even go globally backward in time. Globally backward. Or the heat equation. Yes. I see. As far as I know, but I'm not an expert, but I still remember. True, true. I'm not an expert, but this is a very interesting point, and maybe we can take a look at. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. The difficulties coming in the 3D case are coming from because the interface is as hard as technical problems? The difficulties somehow are technical, and I think we can solve it. We are still working, but I think we can. For example, to have this inequality, we use a small cell iteration and so on. But now, because we are in a higher dimension, our inequalities are less effective somehow. And for example, when we try to get limits, it turns out that in 3D, It turns out that in 3D, all the kernels are not explicit. So in 2D, you have a complex variable, and then your double layer potential kernel is, but in 3D, not. So, and another difficulty is that when we regularize, we need to, with regularize, this works because then we maintain the maximum principle. But the Laplacian does not regularize as well. You know, the equation. You know the equation for the graph is going to be 2D, no? It's going to be a surface, and then this regularizes less. So everything became more. But at this point, I think we can make it. But we should start with it. You should start right away.
