from McMaster University and I'm my time before so I still even in Germany it's still 29th of October. Okay so what is the context of the talk I will give? So it's about validity and non-validity of amplitude equations for water wave problem or for water wave related problems. This is what I did now for almost 30 years and there's a long list here of results and so there are some recent results. And so, there are some recent results where I worked together with Marx Hess about the derivatives non-Linear Schrödinger approximation. And there were two papers which have been published recently. And I think that in the near future, I think that these methods which you developed somehow can be transferred to the water wave problem. And the Derrida-fon-Linear-Schrödinger equation can be proven to make correct predictions about the water wave problem. And so, today I would like to talk about this paper, which was. This paper, which was with James Onik, Dmitry Pelinowski, which you can find in the archive if you're looking for. Okay, so what is this about? So if you look at long radially symmetric waves in a two-dimensional nonlinear, so you're looking at non-linear radially symmetric waves and for this system, or for these waves, you can derive so-called cylindrical code vector Greece equation. So this was the first derived by perturbation theory. First, derived by perturbation theory by Junson in the 1980s. And what I will tell you today is part of his work with Dmitry Pilinovsky and James Ornik. It's about some approximation result for regularized Business equation where we proved error estimates. The cylindrical KDV equation makes correct predictions for this regularized Business equation. Okay, so what's the cylindrical KDV equation? So we are looking. KDB equation. So we are looking at this regularized Business equation here. That's a 2D equation with a Laplacian. Laplacian here is x in R2 and we have the time. And the sigma is a parameter which I will later on. So it can be plus one or minus one. It's ill posed or well posed. And what persons did is, so this Pussenet's equation somehow stands as a model for a water wave problem. And so we would like to approximate. So, and so we would like to approximate the dynamics of this Business system by this cylindrical KDB equation. What you do is you introduce radial variable R and when the Laplacian somehow becomes this expression and wherever you had this Laplacian, you had this thing here, and you're looking for radially symmetric solutions. And the initial value, the initial value, your evolutionary variable is now this R here. Variable is now with R here. And the space variable is with T here. And so what you assume is that for some at the ratios R equals R0, you have U0 and you have a time derivative of the R derivative of U0. And you need this information for all T in R. And then you interested somehow how do the waves evolve up to infinity. So somehow you interchange the role of time and radius and maybe it sounds a little bit. And maybe it sounds a little bit strange, but persons did this in the literature. And so the question was: is this a good approximation? And so you can do what you can do, you make the cylindrical KDV approximation. It's the same thing like the usual, sorry, the usual thing, like the same thing as the usual KDV equations, with epsilon, small perturbation parameter. You plug this in into this Wissenesk equation here, and by making X and Making an epsilon expansion here, you get this following this cylindrical KDV equation. It's called cylindrical KDV equation because it's just this extra term here. And this rho here is a rescaled radius, which is now our evolutionary variable. So somehow it's this time. And time is now space. And so this is this variable here. And so this cylindrical K db equation are the terms which are of order epsilon to the power five. Of order epsilon to the power five, a is scaled with epsilon squared, and rho is scaled with epsilon to the power three. So, if you compute this thing, this is epsilon to the power five, this is epsilon to the power five, tau is scaled with epsilon, we have three, tau derivative is also epsilon to the power five. So, you can derive the cylindrical K d V equation. And the question is, is this approximation which you get for U are resolutions of the original system which are close to this approximation which you gain via this? Which you gain via this cylindrical KDB equation. And the result is as follows. The answer is partially yes. So if you assume that we have initial conditions for the cylindrical KDB equations, this lives on this interval rho here. And the solutions are in some Sobolev space Hs. And we assume that the That somehow we have some vanishing mean value in some sense, that dτ to the minus one of A is also in some Sobolev space. Then we are solutions of the original system, which can be approximated by this lingerie KDV equation here. And these are the solutions of the original system. Of the original system, and the error which you do by this upper approximation is border epsilon to the power seven over two. And this result holds on the scale epsilon to the minus three. So it's a non-trivial result in the sense that the amplitude is of order epsilon squared and that when time is of order epsilon to minus three. And so therefore, the answer is that the regular, this cylindrical KDB equations makes correct. With KDB equations, it makes correct predictions about this Business model and some remarks. So, proof goes along the lines of the associated proof of the validity of the KDB approximation. So, you do some energy estimates and what you have to handle additionally are this, so it's more or less exactly the same as we had before, but we have to handle this term extra. So, this is not completed tool. Things are a little bit more complicated. And this is due to this vanishing mean value assumption, which plays a role, which you need. Which you need to control things. And for a cylindrical KDB equation, this vanishing mean value condition somehow is preserved. But in the original system, this thing is not preserved. And you first have to find suitable coordinates where you can prove this approximation result. If you do it directly for this radial Boussinesq equation, so it's complicated and we fail somehow. And so you make a non-linear change of variables in order to get a system where you can use the A system where you can use the usual strategy, so it's additional estimates a little bit more complicated. So, the important thing, however, is that for all systems we were looking at, so we need that the spatial dynamics formulation is well posed. And for all systems we were looking at, is that the spatial dynamics formulation is only well-posed if a temporal dynamics formulation is ill-posed or vice versa. So, therefore, you can put. Therefore, you can prove an approximation result that the cylindrical KDB equation makes correct predictions under a number of assumptions, but the associated temporal dynamics formulation of the problem somehow is ill-posed for these systems. And so this is somehow a drawback. And so I think this also holds for a water wave problem if you do it like that. Okay, that's all I wanted to say. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you for the talk, Dito. Are there questions? Maybe I'll ask a quick question. So is there any sort of normal form analysis involved in the transition between these two problems? So I don't know exactly what you mean with normal form analysis, but I would, in the sense that I usually understand normal form. In the sense that I usually understand normal form transformations, there's no normal form transformation here. One more question, we have time. Thanks, Kilo. So when you introduce this tau, it's like you're sort of in a traveling frame, right? You're setting up T minus R. Is there a reason why it's T minus R and not T minus C times R? So usually it's T minus. So usually it's T minus C R, but C turns out to be one in this case. So therefore, I already put C equals one in this. So usually the answers which you do is you introduce here some C and you also have to make an explonic. So you get a condition for C at epsilon to power three and C will be one in this case or minus one, will be plus one in this case. Yes. Okay, thank you. Right. So let's thank the speaker again.
