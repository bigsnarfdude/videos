Everything I'm going to say, or actually most thing I'm going to say, are joint work with Gavin Ball. The main result I want to advertise was posted on the archive just a couple days ago. It's also a pleasure, by the way, to see so many familiar faces. If you're not a familiar face, you should become one. We should talk and have these conversations. Yeah, let me just set some terminology before we start to talk proper. So if I have a So, if I have a round d-bar operator, a Cauchy-Riemann operator, whatever that means, we're going to refer to these equations as the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and a solution will be called holomorphic. These equations make sense in different contexts. f can be a function or a map or a section of a bundle, but regardless, we call the equations the Cauchy-Riemann equations and we call the solution holomorphic. In the same way, there Same way. There is a class of operators known as Dirac operators, and these make sense in various contexts. I'll clarify what these contexts are later. And the solution could be a function, it could be a map, it could be a section of a bundle, but whatever that object is, we're going to refer to it as monogenic. Maybe the word you're most familiar with is harmonic, but sometimes eta is not a section, so I have to call it something, and harmonic sounds confusing because it sounds like it's in the kernel of both plus. Because it sounds like it's in the kernel of the Laplacian. That's not what I mean. Finally, if we have a seven-manifold with a G2 structure, for me a G2 structure is a free form that's non-degenerate in the sense that you all know. We'll say that an oriented three-dimensional sub-manifold, sigma, is associative if it's calibrated, semi-calibrated by feed. So, in other words, feed restricts to sigma to be the volume form. This definition makes sense regardless of whether feed is closed, co-closed. Of whether Phi is closed, co-closed, it doesn't matter. Associative sub-manifolds are still, this is still a PDE you can write down. So, this is a talk about three PDE systems. This is a talk about three different first-order PDE systems, Gauchy-Riemann equations, the Dirac equation, and the associate equation. And I'd like to argue three things. First, I'd like to argue that holomorphic methods, that's to say, methods concerning That's to say, methods concerning the Cauchy-Virman equations. I'd like to argue that those are useful in studying special classes of associatives. And I'll give you some examples to back up this claim. However, the Cauchy-Virman equations are probably not suitable for studying the generic associative. Probably need a strong Rick Medi for that. And I want to point out that the Dirac equation is a generalization of the Cauchy-Groumon equations that, in fact, has various connections that I want to review. Various connections that I want to review with associative geometry. So I'm going to state this claim very carefully. I just want to say that monogenic objects may prove useful in associative geometry. How exactly they will be useful is, of course, not clear. Finally, I want to point out that holomorphic ideas often have counterparts in the monogenic setting. And that will be the third part of this talk in which I clarify what I meant on the previous slide in saying that there are different kinds. On the previous slide, in saying that there are different contexts for the Cauchy-Riemann and the Dragon equations. So, when you say holy, this doesn't have to be integrable complex structuring. This could be pseudo-holical thing, but sure, yeah, I'm being very generous right now with definitions, and we'll restrict more later, but right now we're being very broad. And what do you mean by monogenic objects? A harmonic spinner. Well, like a harmonic spinner, but the spinner might not be a spinner. It's a solution of the drop equation. Anything in the kernel of a drop. Of the Drock equation. Anything in the kernel of a Drock operator, I'm going to refer to as monogenic. That's not my term. Don't shoot. Let me say here. I didn't come up with that. But that's the accepted terminology. By Clifford analysts. By Clifford analysts. And why? Why do they call it monogenic? I mean, because they don't want to confuse it with the kernel of the Dirac operator, a kernel of the Laplacian. If you're in the kernel of the Laplacian, then you're harmonic rare. And so maybe you don't want to conflict. Yeah, like this is not. Yeah, I didn't bother. Can we shape it? Can we shape it, right? We can, but then harmonic. Yeah, I have no problem with that, but you know, the word harmonic now means two things, right? And so yeah. You gave a reason not to call it harmonic, but that's quite a leap to then call it monogenic. I'm calling it that's what people have been calling it. Not me, but that's what people have been calling it. But does it carry mean? I'm sorry? Does it carry some meat? I don't know why they come up with monogenic, and the same reason I don't know why they came up with. And the same reason I don't know why they came up with the word holomorphic. Oh, it means global shapes. Okay. I don't know. Yeah. So this talk has three parts corresponding to the three branches of the three sides of this triangle. Okay. So there you go. So first I want to tell you about how holomorphic methods can be used in solving some problems in associative geometry. Then there'll be an interlude about Hof differentials. Then we'll talk about our main result, which connects the Dirac operator to associative geometry and ideas. To associative geometry in yet another way. And then finally, I'll talk about contexts for monogenicity. I'll keep saying that word. It's no good scare. Again, not my word. Not my term. You're saying if you're good. Is it the first time hearing this word, by the way? So, a question you might have is why it's even reasonable to think that holomorphic methods would be successful at all in associative geometry. After all, G2 manifolds are odd-dimensional. After all, G2 manifolds are odd-dimensional. But let me remind you that there are many well-known analogies between Calabio manifolds of real dimension 6 on the one hand and G2 manifolds of dimension 7. I think probably all know this. Calabiao manifold, you have a 2-form, G2 manifold, you have a 3-form. You can raise an index and get a one-fold vector cross-product, also known as normal complex structure. You can do the same thing with phi. There are distinguished classes. There are distinguished classes of submanifolds in both settings. In the Claviao setting, these are called holomorphic curves. For example, they're preserved under J or equivalently calibrated by omega. In the G2 setting, they're closed under the cross product calibrated by phi. There's also a natural class of maps. In the Claudiao setting, these are well studied. These are called J-holomorphic maps. These are maps which preserve the complex structure. The complex structure on a Riemann surface can be viewed as a Hodge star operator. As a HodgeStar operator. And there's a version in the G2 setting known as associative Smith maps, which are newer. But that analogy is maybe not good enough for me to argue that polymorphic methods are useful, so let me give you a more concrete example. Do you have time for the previous? Who wants to see the table? The image of an associative need not be associative. When it's an immersion of what? Associated Smith. When it's an immersion ability. When it's an immersion ability, but it could have rank zero. The rank of an associated Smith map will either be three or zero at every point. Okay, okay. The size of the locus on which it has rank zero is unclear. So constant maps are associated. Yeah, so right, examples that maybe I think most, maybe many of you know. So suppose you have a Calabiao threefold, real dimension six, called Z. Threefold, real dimension six, called Z. You take the product with S1, you get a torsion-free G2 structure in this familiar way. And the point is that if you have a surface two-dimensional in Z, then when you cross it with a circle, you get an associative if and only if the surface you started with is a holomorphic curve. So this is one way that the Cauchy-Fremont equations are a dimensional reduction of the associative equation. Variation on this theme: suppose Z is strict nearly Kaler. If you know what that means, that's good. Taylor. If you know what that means, that's good. If not, don't worry about it. The point is that this is a six-manifold whose cone has a torsion-free G2 structure in this way. You can take that as a definition if you want. And again, if you have a surface in this strict nearly Kaler six manifold, then that surface is a holomorphic curve if and only if the cone is associative. So these holomorphic curves and nearly Kaler six manifolds, these are the links of associative cones, right? These are models for associative singularities. These are models for associative singularities, conical singularities. And I should point out that both n times S1 and comma of n, these are both ruled by special classes of curves, right? N times S1 is ruled by circles, C of n is ruled by rays. And so the sort of general philosophy, this is vague, this is not a theorem, but the vague philosophy is that associatives that are ruled by special curves often reduce to holomorphic curves in some space. Okay, so you've seen two examples. Okay, so you've seen two examples. Let me, I want to show you now a couple of other instances in which this occurs. And the examples I want to provide for you occur in the nearly parallel setting. So we'll say a three-form, or a G2 structure rather, is nearly parallel if its exterior derivative is a non-zero multiple of star V. Okay, clearly nearly parallel G2 structures are co-closed, just take D of both sides. Less obvious is the fact that the induced metric is Einstein of positive scalar curvature. And historically, in fact, many Einstein maps. And historically, in fact, many Einstein manifolds in dimension seven that were discovered were later, you know, it was later realized kind of after the fact that those metrics are induced by nearly parallel G2 structures, which I think points to their centrality. A metric will be called nearly parallel if it's induced by some nearly parallel G2 structure. We're often not careful about this distinction, but this distinction, if you're not careful, will cause a significant headache, as I learned the hard way. But a big reason. But a big reason to care about these things, in addition to what I've just said, is the relationship with spin 7 geometry. It's been known for a while now that a cone has holonomy contained in spin 7 if and only if the metric on the link is nearly parallel. So these things are models for spin 7 holonomy cones. And moreover, if you have an associative in the link, or a three-dimensional sub-manifold of the link, its associative precisely if its cone is Kali. So these are models for Kali. So, these are models for Cayley cones. You may notice that I only required that the holonomy of the metric on the cone be contained in spin 7. When it's equal to spin 7, we'll say that the metric G on the link is properly nearly parallel. So, right away, we see that there is a sort of hierarchy of nearly parallel structures according to this hierarchy, according to these inclusions of Lie groups. SB2 is contained in SU4, which is in turn contained in SP24. In SU4, which is in turn contained in spin 7. So you can say, these are definitions if you like, that a metric is nearly parallel if its co-metric has holonomy contained in spin 7. A stronger condition would be Sasaki-Einstein, and a stronger condition still would be 3-Sasakian. Okay, so one more time, 3-Sasakian implies Sasaki-Einstein, which in turn implies near the parallel. So what are some examples of these? Until 1995, the only known 1995, the only known compact, simply connected, proper nearly parallel seven manifolds were these. This is an infinite family and two sporadic exceptions, if you like. So the sporadic exceptions being the squash seven sphere, thought of like that. The Berger space, SO5 mod SO3. Here, SO3 is not the standard embedding into SO5, but rather it's maximal embedding. So we're thinking of SO3 as acting on R5, where we're thinking of R5 as the Where we're thinking of R5 as the traceless three by three matrices, the bunch of three by three matrices. And NKL, these are known as the Eloch-Wallock manifolds. I think there'll be a talk about that later in the conference. So Friedrich, Kat, Morgano, and Semmelman pointed out that if N is homogeneous, compact, simply connected, proper, nearly parallel, then M is one of the above. This raises the question of how you can get inhomogeneous examples, and they answer that as well, drawing on work of. Answered that as well, drawing on work of Boyer Galicki and Mann. Boyer Galicki and Mann constructed just a wealth of examples, a wealth of three Sasaki and seven manifolds compact simplicity. And among these are infinitely many inhomogeneous examples that are not homotopy equivalent. And what these folks observed, Richard Kathmoyano, and settlement is that you can take a three-Sasakian set of manifold and squash it by a factor of one over root five, and you can get a proper nearly power. And you can get a proper nearly parallel seven manifold that way. By squashing, I won't be precise here, but these three Sasakian seven manifolds, it turns out they're foliated more or less by SO3s or RP3s, sometimes S3s, and you can dilate those fibers or those leaves by one over root five, and that's what I mean by squash. The face is a weighted projective space with those. I think so, I don't remember. I won't I won't meet these, but that sounds great. I'll take I'll take it with it. I'll take it before. Conversely, when you have a nearly parallel structure, is the induced metric Sasaki on sign as well as? Well, if it's proper, then it won't be Sasaki on sign. Yeah. If it's proper, then it won't be. And there's examples of proper narrative ones that don't come through this quashing. Like the original space up there doesn't neuralizes. So thanks for that, actually. So it would be nice to have associatives in these spaces. That would be a good thing to have. That would be a good thing to have. So, Gavin and I thought about this a couple of years ago. And we observed that the Berger space, for example, has a distinguished family of geodesics called C curves. I won't explain what this is, this is not the focus of the talk. But what you can try to do is study those associatives that are ruled or foliated by these C curves. And it turns out that modulos and technicalities that I don't want to explain, the ruled associatives in the Briget space are in correspondence with J holomorphic curves. Are in correspondence with J holomorphic curves in this 8 manifold. J is a non-integrable, almost complex structure. So, yes, I am allowing non-integrable, almost complex structures here. And so this is another example of this type of correspondence that I mentioned. I should point out that this is not the first result of this type. Daniel Fox did something similar, his PhD thesis. Jason has done further work on that, for example, in the context of S7. You might wonder whether this is good for anything. Of course, this is only useful in constructing examples if you can. In constructing examples, if you can construct J-holomorphic curves on the right-hand side. And in fact, using Robert Bryan's theorem on superminimal surfaces in S4, you can find compact J-holomorphic curves of every genus in that 8-manifold over there. And consequently, you can get an associative diffeomorphic to an S1 bundle over a genus G surface for any gene that you like in the Perge space. Can you say a word of why this just Why does the graphs manual of positive barriers in TS1 do with? That's the parameter space for the rulings. So it's just the set of these C curves is naturally parameterized like that. So you expect that a surface in there is going to correspond to a three-manifold. Yeah, and just the PDS going side. So, you know, that was fun. Let's do that again. So, for a different space. So, anyway, why not ready? So, I mean, why not, right? So, you know, the Berget space was one example. Let's look at now squash three Sasaki and seven manifolds. You take a three Sasakian seven manifold and you squash it by some factor. It doesn't matter what. T is just some positive number. One over root five if you like, but it doesn't have to be. It could be one. Three Sasakian seven manifolds have a natural S1 action that's locally free. And we'll let Z be the twister space with its nearly Kaler structure. And then once again, there's a correspondence. And once again, there's a correspondence between associatives and M that are ruled by sort of hot circles, if you like. On the one hand, with J holomark curves and Z cross S2. Here, J is the product, almost complex structure, using the nearly error one on Z and the standard one on S. So these are ruled. Ruled by the S1s. Yeah, but by the S1 orbits. So, you know, three Sasakians are Sasakians, so they have sort of a, there's a two-shears worth of choices, and the point is that. Worth of choices, and the point is that we can vary those. That's right. And so, again, you get examples provided. You can construct J holomorphic curves in Z crossed S2, and in general, that's not so easy. But sometimes you can do it. So, when M is N11, then you can find compact J-holomorphic curves of every genus in Z cross S2. And for that matter, yeah, if M is S7 or one of the squashings, you can do that as well. 7 or one of the squashings, you can do that as well. So the result is that we get, here I have to say that we're non-trivial, we get non-trivial associatives. Once again, diffeomorphic to circle bundles over a GSG surface for any G that you like, for any squashing that you like. Okay. So there's two things, fiber, CD2, and screw. So we yes. Pretty much, yes. Yeah, you have to do a little bit of work because of this uh the phrase modular technicalities meant we have to worry about immerrying issues, but yeah. Worry about in-morgan issues, but yeah. That's right. Yeah, for the M1 case, there's a couple of fabrications left to CP2. So you just have to make sure to pick the right one. So good, we now have examples of compact associatives in these homogeneous, nearly parallel segment manifolds. It remains to construct examples in the NKL when KL is not 1,1. That's my contribution to the problem session. Yeah, it's not clear how to do this, I think. It's not clear how to do this, I think. You can try the same method, but this metric is more complicated. Well, it's not as squashing as in this case. Yeah. Yeah. We still have an S1, but potion I consider Z. I don't know. Is there an S1? Yes, because it projects over the F2, the manifold of full flights in C3. Yeah, okay. Just take the other U1 inside the C3. So, yeah, so here are some examples, very selective examples of how the sort of Cauchy-Niumann equations show up for special classes of associatives. So, is there an example of an associative in a manipulative which does not carry the physical structure? An associative in a seven apple that doesn't carry a three Sasaki? The Bruges space? Yeah, I guess the Brigitte space. Right, okay. And this is the only example that we know. Well, the pre-image of a holomorphic curve in a link or some hypersurface CLAT. Yeah, I think that, yeah, there must be others. There must be others I'm blanking. Well, I mean, if the G2 structure isn't nearly parallel, then other people have done lots of work on that. Other people don't want to work on that. Right, for charging free case, just in planning. Oh, in the proper near the parallel. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think do you hear my word non-trivial meant to exclude pre-images of those sorts of things? But that's what I mean by non-trivial. I mean, I mean, I don't count that. But yeah. Sorry? Special over. Yeah, but those may not either, I guess. But I think even in all the other product spaces are because you can they also have a projection specific to by taking SU3 modules module two yeah and those SO3s will be yeah that's what I meant by attributes yeah yeah yeah those will be three people associated but yeah sorry I mean yeah well okay so we're inspired by this to continue our quest of using holomorphic methods and associative geometry so let's let's see how far we can push this right can we continue Let's see how far we can push this, right? Can we continue to successfully use holomorphic ideas in associative geometry? Let's see. So let me review this concept from minimal surface theory. That's quite nice. So classically, suppose you have a surface, an immersed surface in R3 called N. Its extrinsic geometry is governed by the second fundamental form. That's a quadratic form, so you can split it into trace-free and trace parts. The trace part is the mean curvature. Part is the mean curvature. Then you can take your trace-free part and complexify it, and you'll get a smooth section of that bundle. And Hopf pointed out that this section is a holomorphic section if and only if the mean curvature is constant. And that leads to Hopf's theorem, which is very beautiful. It says that if you have a compact immersed surface in R3 of genus zero, so it's diffeomorphic to the two-sphere, and it has constant mean curvature, then that n is the round sphere. And the proof is two lines. And the proof is two lines. Suppose it ends in the theorem. By the observation, this object, rule numeral 2 sub 0 c, that's called the Hop differential. That thing is a holomorphic section of the canonical bundle tensor itself. But if n is cb1, then that bundle has no holomorphic sections other than zero. So your hop differential is zero, but that means n is totally umbilic, so you have a round scale. So it feels like you get something for nothing. It feels like you just get something for free. So it would be nice to. Something for free. So it would be nice to have hop differentials in other settings. And in fact, Hop differentials have been found in other settings. There's a large body of work on this. I can't possibly review that here. But for instance, there is a Hauf differential for polymorphic curves in S6. Robert Bryan pointed out that there's this object. It's basically the second fundamental form, complexified again, and it's at its zero precisely when you're holomorphic. It's zero precisely when your holomorphic curve is the equatorial S2. So you might hope to get some sort of rigidity out of this. You might hope to squeeze a rigidity theorem out somehow. And you can, if you consider the cone over a holomorphic curve, just for instance, remember that associative cones in R7 are in correspondence with holomorphic curves in S6. And let's suppose for now that the link N is compact and connected. Compact and connected, and suppose you have a hyperplane, a six-plane pi, then it turns out that if your associative cone is invariant under reflection in pi, and if your cone intersects the plane transversely, you do need that, then it turns out you can show without too much work that phi is zero and therefore your associated cone is a three-plane. Why is this a narrow? What's the differential here? Phi. It's a hop differential in the sense that it's the second fundamental form and it's holomorphic. form and it's holomorphic. I mean it's roughly it's essentially the second fundamental form. I didn't tell you what it is. What is the hop differential like could you go back a slide and remind us? It's oh yeah it's it's this it's this thing. It's this this is the hoff differential. Okay. It's the trace-free second fundamental form and then I complexify it. Okay. But on S6 you have no dead bowl. You do. I mean because you have holomorphic bundles over this. No, not on S6 you don't, but on the surface you do. The Riemann surface is a holomorphic bundle. The Riemann surface is a holomorphic curve is a Riemann surface. So it has a complex structure, and I can have bundles over that. But the T10S6 must be using the structure induced. Yeah, these are bundles over N. And N has an integrable complex structure. Yeah, S6 doesn't, but N does. When you pull back T10 S6, so you are doing something. Yeah, yeah, right. So the proof follows. So, the proof follows the hop differential argument used by Fraser and Chain in a related context. Yeah, I didn't have to work quite as hard because I was lucky that this phi is just nicer to work with. It was just kind of fortunate. Okay, so that's great. We have this hop differential for associative cones. Can we have some sort of hop differential normal associatives in general? That would be nice. So, suppose sigma 3 is an associative. So, suppose sigma 3 is an associative, and consider once again it's complexified, traceless, second Pharma form. Can we view this as a Huff differential? And what I mean is: is this a holomorphic section? I mean, no. Sigma is a three-manifold, so it's not a complex manifold. So holomorphic bundles over sigma don't make sense. What a ridiculous question. Writing this is meaningless, so much for that. But what would be great is if it satisfied not the quotient-neuron equation. That satisfied not the Cauchy-Nuan equations, but some cousin of the Cauchy-Nuan equations, some sort of cousin that we have in dimension three, that would be great. What would that be? So terminology. So let sigma be an oriented Riemann manifold. A Clifford module bundle or a Clifford bundle is a bundle of C L T star sigma modules. So more concretely, it's a vector bundle together with this bundle map called C L, and it satisfies that equation. And we need And we need more structure to define a Dirac operator. You have a Clifford module bundle, then there always exists by a partition of unity argument a Dirac structure, and by that I mean a pair consisting of a Hermitian bundle metric, Hermitian if your bundle is complex, and a connection such that these three pieces of data are pairwise compatible. So Novela is compatible with H, Novel is compatible with CL, and H is compatible with CL in the way that you would hope. If that's what the DROC bundle is, this is the setting in which you can find Dirk operators. Dirac operators. Okay. So the Dirac operator you define is like this. It's you take the novel, you take the covariant derivative, and then you project onto sort of the E components again using the Clipper direction. Okay, so for example, if sigma is an oriented Riemannian manifold with a spin structure S, you can write down the complex spinner bundle slash S and spinner bundle slash s and pick your favorite permission vector bundle with a compatible connection then you can form uh this so-called twisted spinner bundle it's just the spinner bundle um s of t sigma just means s that's redundant uh you can form s tensor e that's that has a natural dirac structure and therefore has a dirac operator and i guess what i want to point out is that this dirac operator depends on many pieces of data certainly depends on the metric the spin structure the bundle metric the connection and The bundle metric, the connection, and I guess I should have also put the Clifford module structure as well. Okay, so this is sort of a lot of data flying around here. So examples of these sorts of things you've seen is before in your life. For instance, if sigma is R2 and you take the trivial C2 bundle over it, then the sort of standard Dirac operator is standard Dirac operator. But with the standard choices, this is the Dirac operator, and you can see right there the Cauchy operator appearing. Appearing. But maybe our example that we like for this talk is this one when sigma is R3. You would take the trivial H bundle, H is the quaternions. This is an R4 bundle, and then the rock operator is that right there? Okay, with I, J, and K being the unit quaternions. Okay, so is this helpful for anything in G2 geometry? Is this helpful for G2 geometry? And the answer is yes. There are many ways in which Dirac operators show up in G2 geometry. Dirac operators show up in G2 geometry. I'm going to focus on how they show up in associative geometry specifically. So, Dirac operator, Dirac operators appear naturally in various contexts. For instance, if you view R7 as R3 plus R4, and you think of R3 as the imaginary quaternions, and R4 as the quaternions, take a function from R3 to R4 and look at its graph. Okay, the graph will be associated if and only if it satisfies that PDE. Satisfies that PDE, and you'll notice that the left-hand side is the Dirac operator two slides ago applied to F. So, this is already some indication that Dirac operators will be important in some way in associative geometry. Related, but maybe slightly deeper, is MacLean's theorem, which says that suppose you have an associative in a seven-manifold with a G2 structure. Pick a spin structure on your three-manifold, let S be the complex spinner bundle. Let S be the complex spinner bundle. Suppose for McLean that sigma is compact without boundary and that phi is closed. Then it turns out that the complexified normal bundle is isomorphic as a Hermitian vector bundle to a twisted spinner bundle. So you can view kind of complexified normal vectors as twisted spinners. And under this isomorphism, moreover, infinitesimal deformations of your associative correspond to Of your associative correspond to monogenic spinners. So harmonic twisted spinners. Just why are you flexifying here? Because I'm taking complex bubbles. But isn't it, are the nearby submanifolds going to be just real sections of the manual bundle? Sure. I find this easier. I guess you don't have to, but then you have to say what the right-hand side is. Yeah. Then you have to use real fun. Yeah, then you have to use real bundles on the right-hand side, and that causes. I don't want a tensor over H, is what I don't want to do. Yeah. Why'd you need it closed? Right. Because that's how McLean originally stated it. But many people have removed those assumptions. Many people have worked very hard to have generalizations of this kind of thing. So this has inspired a lot of work. Okay. Okay, and McLean in the same paper, his PhD thesis, also wrote down a second variation of volume formula in the torsion-free case. He pointed out that if you take a one-parameter family of associatives, so you have an associative, and what I should say is you have a compactly supported variation by a normal vector field. Then the second derivative of the volume at time key equals zero is that integral over there. And there's another Dirac operator for you. There's another Drak operator for you. I think his formulas might have been off by a factor of two or something like that. This was clarified and corrected by Liam Van Zura, who also put these formulas, cleaned this for various calibrated geometries. They put this in a broader context. And there's also a version, a generalization to the nearly parallel case by Qatar Pawai. Okay, so hopefully these examples convince you that drop operators show up when studying the geometry of associatives. And so back to the So, back to the question I asked earlier. Suppose I have a seven manifold with a G2 structure, suppose I have an associative, I choose a spin structure on our associative. We look at the trace-free second fundamental form and we complexify it. And the question is, is this a Hopf differential? What do I even mean? First of all, the result I want to advertise is that this bundle where the Hop differential lives is in fact a twisted spinner bundle. The twisted spinner bundle. Okay, so there's some Hermitian vector bundle E, not McLean's E, a different E for rank reasons, such that this bundle of normal-valued trace-free quadratic forms complexified is a twisted spinner bundle. So yeah, this object is a twisted spinner. And moreover, in sort of constant curvature cases, when M is R7, T7, or S7 with its sort of standard G2 structure, then in fact, Structure, then in fact, this section is harmonic. An analogous result holds in the Cayley case if you replace the spinner bundle with the positive spinner bundle. There's a bunch of ways to look at this result, but I'll mention a corollary and let me answer the question maybe some of you are wondering about, which is: is this true in the co-associative case? The answer is sort of with modifications. Oh, yeah. A question before you go the inverse way. You start with a line point of the magic structure and therefore you have a parallel spinner in the classical sense coming for free. You have your submanifold sigma 3 and so you can restrict your parallel spinner to the submanifold. You have of course to relate the spin bundles, that's non-trivial, but feasible. And then you will get an Um, and then you will get an equation for the restriction, right? Like in co-dimension one, if you do that, you start with upstairs, then you will get a sub-manifold description, right, in terms of the operator. So my question is, is that equation philosophically exactly what you get when you do that? I don't think so. That's a good question. I don't think so. I'm not checked. Do you know this method of describing codimension one? What manifolds are restricting the spinner? I mean, it would be interesting to see whether it's similar or different and what it is because the whole idea or the whole benefit of doing surface one by using the spinner description is that you can replace it without the Can replace the Monari equations by a linear Dirac equation. So, in principle, reducing to a Dirac equation is clever because it's a good elliptic system. And I mean, at the end, it comes all down to the Weiler-Twas representation of minimal surfaces. And your surfaces are CMC, right? And this could mention one picture again is exactly coming from restricting the spin. So philosophically, there must be a link. Philosophically there must be a link. Not in the sense that it makes it trigger, but that it adds some nice additional picture. I think it must be worth investigating, I think. Yeah, I think there should be a link. Yeah, because the second part of the format has some symmetries, which are going to be to do with this ambient spinner. Absolutely. And then, also, yeah, you'll get equations that must be satisfied by the correct derivative that will cut the pieces. Yeah. Another question. Why do you use associative in this too? Everywhere. Everywhere. I mean, we need. I mean, E is, I mean, E needs it. I mean, yeah, this bundle in general is not a workflow. Anyway, yes, and this is basically the Codatsi. In the co-associative case, the situation is more complicated. This bundle is not a twisted spinner bundle in that case, but a sub-bundle. Case, but a sub-bundle of it is a half-test spinner bundle. Okay, but is the second fundamental form traceless complexified in there? No, but sometimes if V is forgiven free, then it is, and if M is flat, then it's harmonic again. So more complicated in the co-associative case, but there's still sort of good result. So an amusing consequence of this, in particular, is that if you have an associative in R7, T7, or S7, In R7, T7, or S7, and it's not totally geodesic, then that three-manifold does have a non-vanishing E-twisted harmonic spinner. You know, there it is. It's the Hoff differential, or what I'm calling the Hoff differential, for every spin structure. This is somewhat remarkable because sort of generically, twisted harmonic spinners tend not to exist for various reasons. There are various theorems bearing that out. So, for instance, one reason is that the Drock operation. The Drock operator is an elliptic operator, it has index zero. So, generically, from some sorry smell argument, that generically the co-kernel is zero, so generically, there are harmonics whose spinners have dimension zero. A similar but maybe related, you know, a result in a similar spirit is by independently by Angel and Meyer, who pointed out that you have a compact-oriented Riemannian III manifold. You pick your favorite Hermitian vector bundle E, you look at the space. You look at the space of compatible connections, and then it turns out that for an open dense set of connections, the Dirac operator, again, has zero kernel. So, I mean, the moral here is that we're in a very non-generic situation. I mean, I mean, so many things are non-generic. I mean, the G2 structure is not exactly generic. The metrics you get on an associative, I mean, most metrics on a three-manifold don't come from being embedded into R7 as an associative. And we picked a particular connection, so we're in a very non- Particular connection, so we're in a very non-generic situation here. Great. Questions before I think back to the previous slide? So you just said, because Robert has this theorem that any associative can be embedded in a G2 manifold. In some of them. Yeah. The point is that these have constant curvature, that's why you can't I see. Yeah, right, exactly. The point is that there's something to, but if you fix it in advance, then you don't expect to be able to do that. Yeah, it's a matter of what data you prescribe. Yeah, it's a matter of what data you prescribe for that problem. So I've been very vague in the beginning of the talk about the context for the Dirac equations or even what I meant by a Cauchy-Riemann operator. So let me just, I'd like to say a few words about this if you'll indulge me. When you first learned, or when I first learned at least Cauchy-Riemann equations, I learned about them for functions, from the complex plane to itself. That's originally what I thought holomorphic meant. Originally, what I thought holomorphic meant, and then it turns out that more generally, you can look at functions from a Riemann surface to see and generalize the quotient-Riemann equations like that. But you can just keep going, right? You can generalize this to maps between Riemann surfaces, and you can say what it means for a map to be holomorphic, or you can generalize this in a different way. You could instead have a section of a holomorphic vector bundle that's a different general. Holomorphic vector bundle, that's a different generalization of two, and you can require that section to be holomorphic. So, kind of in summary, you have this picture here about the various, sort of summarizing the various contexts in which holomorphicity appears. And I think sort of there's a universal understanding that, you know, when we refer to holomorphicity, sort of there's internet and relationships between all these different settings. We understand that sort of in sort of setting one, you're doing complex. Of in sort of setting one, you're doing complex analysis. Maybe in the other higher settings, you're doing complex geometry. But I think it's understood that complex analysis and complex geometry are sort of related, maybe two sides of the same point, if you like. So I therefore find it a little striking that we haven't, I think, yet adopted a similar perspective on the Dirac equation, and maybe there's good reasons why we shouldn't, but I don't really know of one just yet. Really, I know of one just yet, but it seems to me that the Drac equation also can be put in various contexts, and it certainly has been studied in various contexts. But maybe one thing that makes this all very confusing is that we seem to use various names for all of the different instantiations of the Dirac equation. So down in sort of number one, the folks who study functions from the imaginary quaternions to the quaternions, I'll show you examples of that in a minute, they refer to these functions as monogenic. They refer to these functions as monogenic. Maybe you'll come up with a better word. The folks who study sort of 3B, you know, these are called harmonic twisted spinners, and maybe they're thinking about spin geometry, maybe they're thinking about deformations, you know, G2 structures, all sorts of things. People study the Dirac equation in setting four, and then they're called sweater sections, and they're relevant to gauge theory and hyperkalic floor theory. And in setting 3A, they're, you know, when the dimension of the domain is four. When the dimension of the domain is four, these things are called triholomorphic maps or quaternionic maps. I've heard many names, and these are of interest to the community that studies harmonic maps. So my point is that it seems that maybe there's a lot of contact between these various subjects and a lot of people are doing very similar things, and it would be nice to see maybe more interaction between these fields. That's all I'm sort of trying to promote here. And if we're more ambitious, we might suggest. Suggest sort of a very naive program as follows. If you feel as I do, that the Dirac operator is some sort of generalization, careful way, of the Cauchy-Miuman equation, then you feel that maybe Clifford analysis provides some sort of generalization of complex analysis. And by the same token, you might want sort of a geometric analog of this. You might want to say that spin geometry is, we have to be careful here, but some sort of analog. Be careful here, but some sort of analog of complex geometry. So, the naive program would be this: you take a theorem in complex analysis, you find an analog in the Clifford analytic settings. You take a theorem in complex geometry, you establish a spin geometric analog. This is something you could try to do. Report A, this has been done. There's a huge body of literature on this. It's the whole subject of Clifford analysis, which I'll show you in a bit. I'm not an expert on this, I should say. I just think it's very interesting and possibly relevant. And for B, I think there's been a lot. And for B, I think there's been a lot less work with this in this spirit. Obviously, there's been a ton of work on spin geometry proper, but in the spirit that I'm describing, there was progress by David Calderbank in his 1995 PhD thesis on the pitching. But I am not sure how much further that's been pushed. But I think I maybe need to justify this claim A for you because maybe Clifford analysis is not well known. And I feel like I'd like to say just something. And I feel like I'd like to say just something in the next five minutes about this. So, very briefly, here for me, I'm going from R3 to R4. There's vast generalizations of this, from like Rn to some Clifford representation as your spin representation as your target. Let me just stick to R3 and R4. Okay, we'll say that F is monogenic if it satisfies that PDE. And this particular PDE has been studied for a very long time since the 1980s. Time since the 1950s, in fact, by Moisel and Tiodorescu, who pointed out that it's equivalent to this sort of very classical looking system. Here, F0 is the real part, F tilde is the imaginary part of F. Okay, and you can move this formula, and so components are harmonic. That reminds us of complex analysis. And you might want some examples. Well, there's linear ones for sure. They form an eight-dimensional family. That eight-dimensional family is an SO4 representation, it turns out, with highest weight. It turns out, with highest weight, 1,3. And these functions can have singularities for sure. This function here, this is sort of the fundamental solution, if you like. This function is monogenic on punctured R3. We'll come back to this function in a minute. Okay, so I say it's like complex analysis, but like, is it really? Well, for one thing, there's this formula that is often called the Cauchy integral formula. This is for monogenic functions. There's even a generalization of this slightly. Slightly. But okay, so that's one sort of similarity with complex analysis. Are there any other theorems you can prove? Yeah, there's a mean value formula, maximum principle, the Evolve theorem, Maria theorem, Feierstrass theorem, Bunge, Metagla theorem, you can residue theorems. All of these have been proven, not by me, by plenty of other people, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, maybe, for functions from R3 to R4. So there's a lot of similarities. It's just all I want to advertise. Of course, there are differences, and as far as I can tell, there are a bunch of sort of obvious differences. First of all, you can't compose functions from R3 to R4, but then if you have functions of several complex variables, you can't compose those either. You're thinking in the realm of sort of several complex variables. Products are the main difference. This is the big thing that you lose. I think, as we've seen already, when you work with quaternions, you know, quaternionic multiplication is not commutative. The turnionic multiplication is not commutative, so that's a serious loss. There is a sort of product rule, and one hopes to maybe do something with that. But this is a significant difference, and in particular, products really, really don't work the way you want. If both G and F G are monogenic, then either F is constant or G is zero. That follows from that formula with a couple of points. And then the third big difference is also very serious. Zero sets and Zero sets and singular sets can be codimension two. I guess that is like the complex analysis setting as well, but of course, codimension two, real codimension two in the complex planes, you have a bunch of points here. Codimension two and a three manifold, that's my recent curves. So already here you have a linear function and its zero set is a line. So this causes complications. There is nevertheless a residue theory and all that. But anyway, references for what I'm talking about are here. You'll notice the dates. Here, you'll notice the dates. These are not recent. You know, this has been a while ago, but to advertise the potential for maybe more work in this direction to sort of unify various studies of harmonic spinners with maps, with sections, with functions. I think it would be great to see sort of more collaboration in this direction, and especially with the hopes that maybe that all of this will help us understand G2 geometry and associators as well. So, thanks for listening to that. Thanks for listening to that.
