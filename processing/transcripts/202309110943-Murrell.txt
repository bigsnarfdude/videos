Already, uh that's the keyboard. Oh, sorry, this is it right now. Oh, cool. Okay, so thank uh thank you for having me. Um it's a pleasure to be here in this amazing location and to see, of course, all these great people, some of which I haven't seen for a few years now. So in my lab, we're very interested in understanding what the kind of energetic rules are that govern expenditures on non-equilibrium systems. And we spend a lot of time trying to understand. Spend a lot of time trying to understand things like dissipation and variational principles and stochastic systems. But we also do a bit of that at a continuum level. And so here we're going to be exploring what types of energetic constraints are going to govern things like growth or motion, except using really simplified models of interfacial mechanics. And in fact, a lot of the things that we see are going to specifically come from soft systems. Soft systems, thick systems where we have energies that are invested in adhesion or in surface tension, which are actually comparable to bulk deformation energies. And specifically in that regime, we're going to be able to get some kind of rules out. So of course, we all understand that these biological systems are driven far from thermodynamic equilibrium. They consume chemical energy, and that's invested into mechanical work, and that work can Work, and that work can arise as the establishment of complex spatial temporal patterns, polarization and shape change, and of course motion, both at the single cell level, like the cell migrating through its extracellular matrix, as well as in collective motion. And we'll explore kind of properties of each. Just to be able to set the stage, how much energy is actually being consumed in these different processes as we go. In these different processes. As we go through, I'll kind of compare the values that we get to this. Using an example of cell migration, and in this case, keratocyte motion, the motion is principally driven by protrusion of the lamellopodia, which is this actin-based structure. So it's going to assemble the actin and actuate it at this rate, moving at about 0.2 microns per second. And so to do that, the cell has to assemble, has to polymerize the actin. Has to polymerize the actin. Now, the steps of assembly, of polymerization, the addition of each monomer to the polymer is going to consume a molecule of ATP. So there are many monomers inside of a polymer, and clearly there's many polymers inside of the cell. And so, altogether, if we were to try and estimate how much ATP is consumed in this mechanical process for motion, it would be a lot. It would be about 10 to the 6th ATP. It would be about 10 to the 6 ATP per second, which actually in the end is a very small fraction of the total amount consumed in various metabolic processes. And so if we were to put that, for example, in units of TBT, it would be something on the order of 10 to the 9 in total. And so we can think of that as the amount of energy then that would say take a system from being dead to one that is being alive or active. We can think of each, the amount that's Of each amount that's invested specifically in motion is kind of like an energetic cost for motion. But now, in these non-equilibrium systems, the typical rules that apply for equilibrium systems are unclear. While we need to balance our fluxes of energy, like what comes into our system and what goes out of our system, other things, for example, like the second law for this open system, doesn't necessarily apply. And so the question is, what kind of rules do apply? What kind of rules do you apply? Are there any types of energetic constraints that can be placed on non-equilibrium processes like row-test plates? Could you be more precise on how you calculate this consumption? Just say whenever the lactine monomer finds, it has an ATP and this one is always hydrolyzed. Yes, exactly. So it's beyond that, but then there are kind of mechanical dissipation. So this would be considered the change in the internal energy for that system. Energy for that system, so this is going to be the amount consumed, which at a steady state should be equivalent to what's dissipated. Yeah, so this is a really nice article from Rob Phillips' group where they try and estimate kind of what's involved in mechanical processes versus coral. So, how do you get the 10 to the 7 integration? So, I think they said this was about 1% or so, and then you've got about 2%. Yes, that's right. Okay, so what we'll do here is we'll use What we'll do here is we'll use kind of a model system to try and estimate the energies involved in mechanical processes, things like growth and tissues, and then things like motion. And in doing so, kind of look for either conserved or variational principles. So there'll be kind of three quick parts, but all of them are going to have to do with interfacial mechanics, how we think about how cells that are soft are going to interface with. To interface with materials which have an equivalent rigidity. So I'll begin by deriving a very simple analogy. We know that by the molecular theory of gases, that molecules can bombard a surface, they can transfer the momentum. In sum, that large transfer of momentum is going to create a pressure, and that pressure can be related to other things, for example, like the volume and the temperature of the system. That gives That gives us an equation of state which defines our system in equilibrium. If we have an extensible container, then we know that we can connect that pressure also to things like a surface tension. But in this case, that surface tension is an intensive quantity. We can always measure a mechanical energy as we're kind of deforming a material, but only at equilibrium can we connect that to thermodynamic properties. And so, what happens then in a non-equilibrium system where we can again measure these things mechanically, can we actually? These things mechanically, can we actually relate them to some type of energetic principle? We understand that living systems can be thought of like these bubbles, except they have all of these active processes. Again, they're going to consume the chemical energy and they're going to use it to do things like assemble this mechanical machinery, which can contract through ion channels. They can establish gradients in these molecules, which can give us pressures. Give us pressures, and all of that contributes to the active behavior of the cell, for example, in this case, like its migration. But unlike the equilibrium system, in which we know that the pressure-volume work is bounded, in this case, we don't really know what that is. So our model system is a very simplified, the most simplified model of a tissue. Here we have a ball of cancer cells. They have been engineered such that they have strong. Such that they have strong cell-cell contact, but do not produce extracellular matrix. So they're just a ball of cells. We want a system that doesn't kind of age over time, which is why we choose one that doesn't produce ECM. Now, these spheroids or aggregates of cells are going to behave very much like liquids. You could already see that they're round and so that they're minimizing their surface area. They're also going to be able to fuse and spread out like liquid. To fuse and spread out like liquid droplets. So, in order to define kind of the mechanical properties of this tissue, for example, like its surface tension, we apply simple mechanical models. In this case, we perform micropipette. With micropipette, we apply a pressure across this little needle. It's going to suck in the aggregate. So, we apply the step change in pressure. The aggregate is going to get pulled in. Initially, it gets pulled in very quickly. Initially, it gets pulled in very quickly, but then proceeds more slowly. Then that stress is removed and it relaxes. So we have an experimental time scale here that's on the order of about an hour, but we see that the system changes from moving in quickly, indicative of more elastic life behavior, to moving in more slowly. And so there's a difference in time scales where we can compare the kind of experimental time scale, again, which is like 60 minutes, to something like a viscoelastic time scale, which is. Something like a viscoelastic time scale, which is on the order of a couple of minutes. Yes, please. What controls, what sets the size of the aggregates? Experimental, so we make them by suspension spinning. So we place cells in solution and a shaker, and over time they all get together and make these spheroids. So in that case, it's time. Or just less time. So it's basically the time. Yeah, so it's basically the time that we have them shaking and the frequency at which we do it. Yeah, we don't wait for them to grow. We use things of different sizes because otherwise it would take forever. So we can measure the surface tension of these systems and what we see is that for these spheroids they have a surface tension that's quite high on the order of millenn per meter. But interestingly, we see that it varies with the initial size of the atoms. So for an initial radius R0, An initial radius are not that small, we see that it has a high surface tension, but that that surface tension decreases as it gets. Yes, please. So then, I mean, interpreting that as a surface tension, does that like you have to like assume kind of mechanical response of the inside? Like, you know, you don't have a significant bending elasticity at the edge or that's right. So we assume that we don't have that because we say that the We say that the viscoelastic time scale is much smaller than the experimental time scale, so it's behaving just like a fluid. So we're not worrying about any elasticity. Surface elasticity. It's behaving like a liquid. And then I mean, like, is that, like, how do you know that that's like a correct assumption? So if something's going to relax on the order of a couple minutes while the experiment is, say, taking hours, then the comparison of those time scales should be. Then the comparison of those time scales should indicate it's behaving like a fluid. So, how long are you perturbing it compared to its internal time scales of relaxation? That'll determine whether it's a solid or a liquid. Yes, but doesn't the surface tension change with time? What is the same when you came for? Because Beauchamp had experimented and she saw that there was an increase in the shivering, the contractile activity. So we don't actually. So, we don't actually image it long enough to see it growing. So, these experiments are short. Essentially, the radius is constant. Yes. So, we don't actually image them over long periods of time in which growth would be a consideration. Yes, please. Worry about cell death on the inside of the spheroid. It's not that big, you have to worry about heterogeneity in general cells in. DNA cells able to do that. Yeah, you're thinking about like the spheroids where you have like a necrotic core as they as they get larger? I mean, yes, but they also are certainly devoted from size for sales. I mean, if they're not so big. Yeah, so the measurements for surface tension actually really come from Laplace, which is just the force balance across the outside. So we don't consider what's happening in the middle. We do assume that they're not dead because we also characterize it by bulk. Because we also characterize it by bulk parameters like a viscosity. And we have one viscosity, but no, not for the surface tension measurements. We don't worry about it. Yes, please. Okay. Cells are these, and what's the cell adhesion between them, and won't the cell distinction depend on the stat cell adhesion? Yes, that's right. So they're sarcoma cells and they've been engineered to have a very specific and fixed amount of ECAD heroin. Fixed amount of e-cad here in based cell cell adhesion. So they all have that kind of thing. They all have the same level. Okay, so that's in this case not variable. It's not varying. Yeah, that's right. Best jump. Can you see internal dynamics that could maybe prove that it's acting like a fluid on your time scale? Because it looks, I mean, when I look at it like this, it looks solid. But I don't see any cells moving on the inside, but it's hard to see it. So the we do. That's actually kind of the next part. That's actually kind of the next part. We, in order to establish that it's basically behaving like a fluid here, used an argument based on time scales. We later show with different experimental models that it also behaves like a solid, but in this case, we derive that conclusion based on the separation of time scales. So if we inhibit myosin activity, we can immerse these in levostatin. Immerse these in bloodostatin, what happens is that the surface tension drops. It's still actually quite high, still in the order of milli-Newtons per meter, but we no longer see the size dependence. Essentially, it's flat. So this in this case behaves more like the passive fluid, which should have an intensive surface tension. So we presume that the size dependence comes from that myosin activity. So when we inhibit this When we inhibit this activity, we see mechanical changes. So, what we did here was develop a pressure-volume relationship. So, we can observe the volume through the imaging of the aggregates in the micropipette, and we can measure the pressure by the law of Laplace. And again, by construction, we end up getting this scenario where small aggregates, which have a small volume, have a high pressure, which then decreases as the aggregates get larger. Now, again, when we inhibit. Now, again, when we inhibit myosin, what happens is that we see that the aggregates will inflate. So the volume will actually get larger over time. So is this the volume of the whole aggregate? The volume of the whole aggregate. So there could be variations in cell volume across the aggregate, right? There could. But so do you account for that? So we look at the, we just report the whole volume here. Yeah, so we're not really worried about. Have you seen a cell that Worried about. Have you seen a cell that's sitting in the inside move in the outside and vice versa? I mean, which would happen in the liquid, right? It would maybe. Not in this experiment because we haven't really looked for it, but in other experiments, yes. So we have other experiments where we look at the wedding and we indeed see that cells can move from anywhere in the aggregate towards the surface. And so in that case, it definitely behaves like a liquid, and that's on the order of hours as well. So, with the inflation of these aggregates, we have. The inflation of these aggregates, we asked, well, then, how is the density of cells, the number density of cells, changing? And so, what we did then was identify the nuclei inside these spheroids. The cells are mononucleated. Here you see an inverse fluorescence of spheroids of two different sizes where the red dots are spot-tracked nuclei. Now, qualitatively, we can see that the density of them is actually different. Is actually different. If we were to quantify that, we would see a similar relationship. That for small spheroids, the density is actually quite high, and that the larger the spheroids are, the lower the cell density. Lower cell density means that the cells are increasing their volume. So again, we're not really looking at variations inside, we're looking at the overall number density of cells within the cell aggregates. Within the cell aggregates. Now, if we were to compare the scaling relationship between the pressure based on size and the density based on size, we would actually see that they're quite similar. And if we compared one to the other, we would get something that looks like a straight line. And so this is really surprising because for a strongly interacting system, we've got something that looks like a non-interacting system or weakly interacting system. system or weakly interacting system. Small aggregates have a high density and high pressure. These things are measured independently. But as you get larger, the density goes down as does the pressure. And so that is very reminiscent then of having this equilibrium equation of state, but except one in which now this energy is kind of constant. So what is the equivalent of this energy in this case? Equivalent of this energy. In this case, it would be something like an energy for adding a cell to an aggregate. You can think of that as like the work to grow, to add a cell as remaining constant. But there is still a strong deviation from this because, of course, in this equilibrium equation of state, the reason why this is constant is because our pressure is constant and our density is constant. In this case, however, the pressure is not constant, but varies with size. With size. The density is not constant, it varies with size, but they do so equivalently. They have the same degree of non-intensivity, which in the end still leads to a constant energy. Cell division and standard, or do you watch the aggregate time shorter than cell division and standard? Yeah, we only look over the experimental time scales of a couple of hours, and so we don't see a whole lot of cell division or cell death at that level. Division or cell death at that level. Presumably, there's some, but we don't know. Don't know. Good question. Haven't looked. So you can have mechanical parameters that can violate equilibrium descriptions, but they seem to be coupled. And when they're coupled, you end up getting something that looks like an equilibrium constraint. And when it looks Constraint. And when it looks like an equilibrium constraint, that then suggests that it behaves something like a temperature. And so you could have a temperature describing something like your distance from equilibrium. And so, for example, if we were to vary the amount of activity in the system again by changing the myosin behavior through blevastatin, you would get these linear relationships, but they would be of different slopes, meaning that they would be different. Meaning that they would be different energies associated, what those work values are, and different temperatures. If we were to estimate what those temperatures are, they're actually somewhat comparable to what people typically see for granular systems. Okay, so from this first part, we see that we can violate equilibrium descriptions for some of these variables, but they do so in kind of a reciprocal fashion, such that you end up with something that resembles an equilibrium equation. An equilibrium equation of state. Of course, this only matters for small systems in which we say surface tension matters like these capillary influences that you have when surface tensions are comparable to bulk energies on cellulose scales. So I describe a scenario here where surface tension really matters, and because it really mattered, we were able to get this kind of energetic constraint. If it also really matters, then we actually ask the question whether. Matters, then we actually ask the question whether gradients in those surface tensions really matter. And so you might be very familiar with this effect called the Marangoni effect, in which you can generate strong surface tension gradients, which can lead to fast flows. Here is a Petri dish with water in which I think pepper is added to the top. You add a little drop of detergent and everything gets pulled to the side. So we ask whether or not we can have maringone flows that can drive fast and rapid motions inside of tissues. Motions inside of tissues. So we take the same systems, these spheroids, and instead of adding detergent, what we do is we use a high-powered laser to kill one or a small number of cells at the surface. So all of these cells are tensed. They're minimizing their surface area by the surface tension. They give you this very round aggregate, the spheroid. And right at the front here, we're going to kill a few cells and observe. Kill a few cells and observe the dynamics that result. And so, what you might be able to see by this image here, by this kind of slowed-down one with these velocity vectors on top, is that immediately upon ablation, you get this peeling back of the cells on the side. You see these vectors pointing outwards. What you should also see is the vectors that are in the bulk pointing forwards immediately. Over some period of time, you'll see that those vectors reverse. You'll see that those vectors reverse, that the sides will come forwards and the bulk part will move backwards. So, again, upon ablation, peel back, move forwards, peel forwards, move back. So, if we were to freeze frame this at different times, it would look something like this. So, upon initial ablation, we're killing off cells that were once holding this thing in place, that were We're once holding this thing in place, that we're tensing it at the front. We have a rebalance of everything here, and you have this kind of toroidal motion. Just a few seconds later, we see that this entire motion reverses. Now, so you have correlated motions in this case over hundreds of microns and over just seconds, both the relaxation of stresses as well as the reaccumulation. And all of this happens. And all of this happens on the order of about 30 or 40 seconds. So, if we were to look at the entire time course all the way through, we see that initially it recoils very quickly, and then it kind of recovers in these two separate phases. If we were to integrate this, we would see that you actually return pretty much back to your original position over time. And so you have these strong correlated vortices, not just the initial relaxation, but an active movement to restore the original configuration. The original configuration. So, the types of the scale of the motion that we get is again indicative of these elastocapillary interactions because the scale of the motion is roughly equivalent to what we measured from the surface tension as well as from the bulk elasticity. So again, a case in which these strong surface tensions matter. If we inhibit myosin activity, we get no flows. We get neither the retraction nor do we get the restored motion. Nor do we get the restored motion. Interestingly, as previously measured, the surface tension still remained high. It was on the order of a milli Newton per meter. The spheroids still remain round, but there are no measurable flows. And so all of this depends, again, on the activity. Now, I mentioned before and made a significant point to say that our time scales of relaxation, the viscoelasticity of the aggregates, was Of the aggregates was on the order of a couple of minutes, while the experiment in that case was on the order of a couple of hours. And so, before from the micropipette, we said that this was behaving like a viscous fluid. In this case now, we're looking at motions in which we have three different time scales of motion, all of which are significantly shorter than the viscoelastic time scale. And so, now in this case, we might be suggesting then that the aggregate is. Suggesting then that the aggregate is no longer behaving like a viscous fluid, but is behaving like an elastic solid. But again, we measure the surface tension, which we typically associate with an isotropic fluid. I'm going to try and move a little bit more quickly. We can estimate what the surface stresses are by applying both an elastic or a viscous constitutive equation, integrating around to see which comes closest to zero. We find that an elastic constitutive equation behaves significantly better than. Behaves significantly better than does a viscous one and gives a more realistic range of stresses, indeed showing that it's behaving like an elastic solid. Now, if we were to look at these rates of motion, we get something that we saw with micropipette. We found that small aggregates retract faster, larger ones retract slower, which means that our delta gamma, our change in our surface stress, actually varies again with size, just like we had with the micropipette. That. If we can compare this delta gamma, our stress, with our strain, if we look at the shape of the nuclei, we see that they're going to vary in their deformation. If we compare this to a sphere, we can try and estimate something like a strain. And looking at the outer part only, but for aggregates of different sizes, again, we see that smaller aggregates have a larger cell strain. Have a larger cell strain. The cells on the outer part of the aggregate are more deformed. Now, if we were to compare that strain, which is measured on the shape of the nucleus, to our delta gamma that we measured independently through retraction, they actually also lie on a line, which means that you have another conserved value, which is your energy density or your modulus. And so we have kind of like a surface modulus, which is comparable to other soft materials. Other soft materials. So, again, we have a case in which we have these kind of reciprocal kind of violations of what we would expect, at least by thermodynamic principle, that again seem to counterbalance, giving us an equilibrium value. And in both cases, if you never looked for size dependence, you wouldn't find it. If you measured a modulus, you would always measure the same thing. However, you would find that you would have these reciprocal size dependences. Now, we actually feel that this is really important for biology because Important for biology because we see the number of different cases we can have really rapid motions. Not typically on average, but many very singular rapid motions can be really high. And if we look at some of those, like zebrafish epibole, again, more like the maximum levels or various things in gastrulation, they're faster than what we typically associate with single-cell migration or even collective cell migration. So we think that things like solid-like surface tensions can actually drive really rapidly. Can actually drive really rapid motions in biology. So I'll move more quickly just to be able to finish this essential point. Here we see, again, like the earlier part, indeed we have Marangoni-like flows, but those are for fluids. We see that actually you can have them in solids. And again, it gives you a kind of equilibrium-like constant by balancing two types of reciprocal activity. And so, in the very quick final thing, I'll show an older work. Final thing: I'll show an older work where again we looked at the behavior of cells as fluids. We looked at wound healing. So, here you see an epithelial monolayer which has experienced a wound, and the healing of that wound very much resembles the migration, the wetting of a liquid film. So, what we do in this case is again we use laser ablation, we create this wound, and over time it's going to heal the wound. We do that on top of a We do that on top of attraction force substrate where we can measure the forces of closure. So, cells around the wound can close via two different methods of migration. There is your more traditional mesenchymal migration, which again, you polymerize that actin up against the membrane and you push forwards. Or you can create this thing called a purstring wound closure. There's cells everywhere, but you can only see one at a time. They'll generate this strong active. They'll generate this strong actomyosin bundle, which will contract and pull cells forward. So, around the wound, you can do either. You can have these tight bundles, or you could have these floppy lamellopodia, and these two things will coordinate to determine the rate of motion of the wound, of the rate of healing. Now, they have different rates. If we look at wounds that are predominantly lamellopodial, we see that they move very quickly, whereas Move very quickly, whereas ones that are predominantly purstring with that bundle proceed much more slowly. And of course, you can have a mixture between the two. And so we asked, well, what governs the choice of these architectures? And are they all, again, related to some type of energetic principle? And so we were particularly interested in this and in terms of what the system might be optimized for. We typically have a mixture between the two, but you can see that lamellipodial motion is much faster. So we ask, why does Faster. So we ask why does it choose something that's not the fastest? And later, as I'll show, the per string is typically stronger, but yet that's also not the one that is most common. So again, we measure the traction stresses during wound closure. So we ablate, the cells are going to migrate in order to close the wound, and we measure some mechanical parameters. So in particular, what we're going to measure is the strain energy, which we're going to call Is the strain energy, which we're going to call the work, and the rate at which that strain energy changes at the periphery, which we're going to call the power. So that's going to be an energy per unit time. So we can compare situations in which you have something that's primarily lamellopodial, in which you have mesenchymal motion, to something that's primarily purstring. Now, as I indicated, for example, the lamellopodia typically closes faster. Typically closes faster and the purse string is slower. Whereas the purse string generates a much lower power, a much lower work, while the purse string generates something that's much higher. And those are very significantly different. Interestingly, however, what that means then is that if we take something like an energy per unit time, like the power, we never see any difference. We always see that that seems to remain constant. And so while you can change your architecture to alter Can change your architecture to alter speed or alter work, the power never changes. And so we seem to have a somewhat conserved value. Again, it depends on what your sampling is, but for all of the end that we've been able to accumulate, we don't see a difference. And even when we perturb the system with drugs, again, we don't see a difference. And so with growth, we saw this kind of constant work, and with motion, we see constant work per unit time. But again, there's two different levels of activity. There's two different levels of activity which seem to balance out to give you something that you might expect just for the wetting of a liquid film. And so, overall, we showed that both with growth and with this kind of mechanics of conductive motion, we call it, we see that there are non-intensivities which kind of balance out to give an equilibrium-like constraint. That the work to add a cell to the aggregate, to grow, remains constant despite the fact mechanical parameters vary with size. Parameters vary with size, which they don't do in equilibrium. Tensional pressure can because of curvature, but in this case, pressure varies because of a size-dependent surface tension. We saw kind of the same thing where we used motion to identify mechanics, like a modulus. We also find that that was constant and size-independent, even though the mechanical properties weren't. And even for this kind of collective motion, the motion outside of the tissue, or you know, this moving film, we found that we had these two different. We found that we had these two different types of activity, which again kind of combined together to give us this constant value. And so we look at this and suggest then that there are these various forms of activity which have kind of a reciprocal relationship, which in the end give us something that we would expect for a more passive system, which means that our mechanical properties can actually be connected to energetic ones, which can do easily in equilibrium, and maybe in rare cases can do out of equilibrium. So, I think with that, I would just like to thank the awesome people I've worked with, our funding, and your attention. Thank you very much. I might have a misunderstanding for your last part. You were saying the voting mode is faster, but then and the working done is also over. Yes. But then would that make a more advantageous? More advantageous for the cell. Since they not consume much energy, but it can get work that faster. So then the connection here is that why don't we choose that mode as compared to the pure? I guess it implies that speed is not an objective function. So this is indeed part of our interest. If it wanted to heal the fastest, it would use lamellopodia, but it doesn't. So is there a. So is there any other realized? Is there any advantages to keep the bomb open? I don't know. Yeah, I really don't know what the advantages or the extent to which biological systems consider advantages in this case. When I think of a constant power, I think more of like a machine in which perhaps you can generate only so much energy, you can only dissipate so quickly. You can only dissipate so quickly, and the result of that is that you have, you know, this kind of constant machine collection of inputs and outputs. In terms of objectives, it's far less clear to me. Yes, please. In that lamellopodial versus pursering model, is it known, does one of them burn more ATP than the other? Don't know. So the likelihood is that the situation is not. The likelihood is that the situation is not ETP limited. So, I added, I forgot to mention, but I added some of the estimates of what the expenditures were like compared to that first estimate of how much is consumed. In that latter case, there's a thousand-fold difference between what's consumed and what's put out as mechanical work. So the likelihood is, is that it's not ATP limited, but it could be dissipation limited. I think about, like, we're generating these stresses with these materials. Perhaps our ability to disassemble and reassemble is a limiting factor. Assemble and reassemble is a limiting factor. And in that case, you're going to get, especially if we assume this to be a steady state, we're doing this constantly, that would be the dissipation rate. So the power would be a dissipation rate, and maybe the limiting thing is how you dissipate it. Next, please. Yeah, I like your story about active elastic cells. That is an extreme case with show muscles. For muscles are equationary states. We use them and try to describe Use them and try to describe the cell as a spawn muscle, for instance. There's this Hill equation of state, which I forgot. Yeah, I haven't. We haven't drawn such an analogy, but it looks like a more definitely lower reference state than the ideal gas code. Okay, interesting. Yeah, I'll take a look at that. So if I understood right, the leaped closure is a combination of lamellopodium and first branch? Every time it's a mixture, you know. You know, so we isolate them into which one is more one versus more of the other, but we can also look underneath each individual cell. And is the fraction that's one or the other constant with time as the wound closes, or does it switch? Oh, it does actually change a little bit. So when it gets to very small wounds, like towards the very end, it almost always switches entirely to per-string. Like when you're basically like one cell diameter or so, then the lamellopodia resets and then everything. Resets, and then everything is a purse string. So it can't be too large because then it's almost always lamellopodia, and then you can't be too small because then it's almost all pur string. But even in those cases, then still the power is the same. Connecting the last and middle parts, I know with the spirit, you can only see it from the side. Do you think that the same thing is occurring, that it's a first string on the cell? On the cell of the periphery that are coming in. Yeah, I think it could be. We've tried to image for that and haven't really seen anything. That must be really hard, and it's easier. Yeah, we've done the actin staining of that too, but haven't seen anything as clear as a purse string. Have you done staining for E-CAD hering too to see how that is changing as well, like during this? We have. And so do you see differences? 'Cause it it seems like, you know, there's always like that model they showed where you have like reduce stress, circumferential stress on the outside, radio inside. Stress on the outside, radio on the inside. And so, I guess what you're seeing is like a passive process first, right? So, you break that, you get the stretching back of the periphery and the side pitches, and then it seems like it's an active process. I just wonder, is it changing you can hear an expression, or is that being driven? I don't think it's changing on those time scales. We also haven't written great images of that. Francoise actually has. I think she has a movie up where you can see, I think where you can see differences, but either way, she can visualize that all. Differences, but either way, she can visualize that a lot better than we have. So, with the cell aggregates, so clearly it's driven by you need the mice next to me there. Do you think there's any effect of the realogical properties of the cells, like themselves, realms? Like if you were to remove my builder and redo it, something a lot softer, a lot sticker. So, in the absence of the myosin, we do we have surface tensions which are We have surface tensions which are still about a third of what it's like with myosin. So there's definitely a lot of other activities that yield a pretty comparable mechanical response. So it's not myosin dependent, you get rid of myosin activity, you kind of disassemble your actin too. And so maybe a bunch of that could be these other elements. I've always been assuming it's actually mostly due to ion channel activity because myosin actually do. you know, myosin actually due to mostly you know Ming's work and stuff like that isn't isn't really strong enough to generate these kind of these kind of pressures, but ion channel stuff stuff is. I'm wondering, if you've got control of these cells, right, with the expression level of these peak appearances, could you express which would be maybe slightly weaker with still expression? Yes, Francoise has done this, yeah. So she has ones where she, where there's So she has ones where there's different levels of E-Cadherent, and the bulk surface and bulk properties change in accordance, what you would expect from that. Yeah, yeah. I mean, part of our point here is that all of these relationships actually only happen when elastocapillary lengths are about cell scales. So, you know, the surface tension is actually really strong compared to the bulk properties on cellular length scales. That's the only time in which these relationships hold. For bigger aggregates, which are So for bigger aggregates, which are no longer really round, it doesn't happen anymore. If it's surface tension, it doesn't really matter, so on and so forth. So it's really only for when you can compare those two quantities. So maybe for those levels, it doesn't matter. And then you're saying it doesn't really matter for what the quantities of the cells themselves is more well than the length scale. Yeah, I mean it's a comparison of two quantities that gives a length scale, but only when that length scale is kind of comparable to the size of the cell. Is kind of comparable to the size of the system. I think does any of this matter? Quick question. So you said the bundles versus the lamellophoria have a different species. But then they weren't purely bundle or lamellophoria, they were mixtures also. The wound is a mixture. So there'll be, say, you know, 10 to 15 cells around the periphery, and then some will do the perstring and some will do the lamellipodia, and it's kind of stochastic. Okay, and so the Okay, and so the speeds are different no matter whatever the fraction of buckles versus the mental is. Like the speed of a lamellopodial kind of thing. So we looked at like when it was mostly one versus mostly another. I was wondering what happened in these intermediate cases, the ones where you take. Yeah, so actually overall, yes, the rates are roughly the same, no matter what combination, but the combination actually depends on other parameters like the stiffness. Parameters like the stiffness. So, for any particular combination for a given stiffness, I believe the rate of closure is essentially the same. It may actually also be the same across stiffnesses, but I can't remember right now. The talk to go in here is the bell round. We can take this to coffee, which happens now. We'll come back at 10:40
