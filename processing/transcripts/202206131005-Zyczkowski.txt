To be with you in Mexico, and my great, great pleasure to join you remotely from Krakow, Poland. And first, let me mention my collaborators. It is an Indian-Polish team. So there's Aru Lakshminarian and his former student, Sua Ilatter from Chennai, so Madras Institute of Technology, and my former students, Adam Burhardt, Bojek Bruzda, and Zzegoschleichen Miejoch. And Zegosh Reichen Miejoch. I will tell you about the famous problem of Euler, about 36 in fact officers, and we will show you what happens if they are allowed to be entangled. First, a general remark. We discuss quantum physics, theoretical physics. Well, what are the key issues we are going to discuss? In principle, we would like to know what is the correct theory to describe the world around us, which is the correct theory to describe the world at the end. Theory to describe the world at the micro scale. Of course, we know, we laugh, we work in quantum theory. So we'd like to know whether the quantum theory is really the good theory to describe everything at the micro scale. If not, do we need any generalized quantum theory, how such a theory might look like? If no, we would like to extract as much as possible from the standard quantum theory. So some time ago, I worked on generalist quantum theory. Generalize quantum theory, and I even saw that there was a Lucian Hardy among us in the audience. So I tried to somehow work along the paths he initiated many, many years ago. But today, I will not discuss those generalized quantum theory. I will go back to the standard quantum theory and I will tell you about a search for extremal quantum states in the standard quantum framework. What do I mean by extreme quantum? What do I mean by extremal states? Let me first tell you: if we have a finite-dimensional Hilbert space Hn, complex Hilbert space, let's say n is equal to 2, we know, of course, very well all quantum states of, we call them qubit, of such two-dimensional Hilbert space corresponds to the point on the Bloch sphere. And of course, the sphere is isotropic. So all points are exactly the same. There's no points as distinguished. All points is distinguished, it is the same if you consider arbitrary n, then all points, all states live in a complex projective space with two n minus two real dimensions, but all states are equal. So, of course, there are no extremal states, as all of them are, in a sense, the same, because all of them can be obtained from one state to another by a continuous unitary rotation. Well, the situation changes if the Changes if there is some structure imposed to the system. Then all quantum states are equal as before, but some are even more equal than others. For instance, if I have a compost system, by the way, can you see my two pants? If I show that I have a system, but I can distinguish something yellow, something orange. Yes, can you see me? Yes. So, of course, then it's easy to show that then we use a compost. Use a composed, composite Hilbert space, we can define separable so-product states. Of course, they are in some sense distinguished with respect to the splitting of the physical system into two parts, or with respect to a given division of the Hilbert space. And of course, maximally entangled Bell states are also somehow distinguished. They are, as I'm joking, more equal than all other states. So, again, in such a case, if the general symmetry is The general symmetry is broken. I distinguish two, three, or more subsystems. Then we can look for some extremal states, for instance, those which are as entangled as they can be. And for two subsystems, the situation is simple. Bell states or generalized Bell states are the most entangled because they display quantum correlations, perfect quantum correlations, and they are useful for many, many different applications in quantum technologies. I will now make a short break and tell you something more about combinatorial problems and combinatorial designs. I'm pretty sure that you heard about Latin squares and magic squares, which are also known even for non-specialists as a recreational mathematics. So here's a Greco-Latin square. In this case, we have nine Latin letters, nine Greek, but in fact, there are three copies of each. And as you see, in each row, each column, we have a different letter. Each row, each column we have a different letter, Greek letter, and Latin letter. They are also called sometimes orthogonal, Latin square, orthogonal in the sense that no pairs of Greek and Latin symbols repeat here. And then there is a very nice transition. If you define the following create a matrix, so basically alpha b goes from here zero to two in this case, and we put some real numbers, then we get such a magic square. You see what is magic here, that sum in each column, each row is That sum in each column, each row is constant, in this case, 15. So, if you divide it by 15, you have a so-called B-stochastic, W-stochastic matrix. So, all non-negative numbers which sum to unity column-wise and row-wise. And then, such designs are not only subject of recreational mathematics, but also are related to many different issues in mathematics, in statistics, and also, of course, in physics. So, for me, in short, combinatorial design is just a constellation of Is just a constellation of elements of a finite set arranged with certain symmetry and balance. And well, those objects exist for other dimensions. Let me use a card example. If I take 16 cards, four aces, four kings, four queens, four jacks, it's very easy to design such a configuration that you see in each column, each row, there is only one card of a given suit and a given figure. And they are called in mathematics. Given figure. And they are called in mathematics two mutually orthogonal lattice squares of size four. Now, this example is simple. So as you see, they exist for size three, size four, size five. In fact, they do not exist for size two. Why? Well, because it's easy to see. If I put two aces, there's no chance to put two kings, because basically, then there will be a conflict that there is a rule that there are no. That there is a rule that there are no two figures of the same shoot in a given row or column. So they do not exist for size two, exist for three, four, and five. And then comes number six. And this number six is exactly related to the famous problem of Euler. So formally, we now say that the problem had kind of military applications. There were 36 Russian officers. He was then working in St. Petersburg of six different ranks from six different units. Ranks from six different units, and they were coming for a military parade in St. Petersburg. The task of Euler was to arrange them in such a square that in each column, each row, all uniforms are different. So basically, different ranks and different units. And then it happens that, as you have seen, for size three and four, it was not difficult to find a solution. However, for size six, it was not possible to find a solution to put those 36 officers in such a square. Even Euler himself, the greatest Even Euler himself, the greatest mathematician of these ages, was not able to prove it. Only 121 years later, Gaston Tari, it was a French man, even not a mathematician, he could prove it and publish in 1900 results. So mathematically, his result was, wow, very, very magnificent because he managed somehow to reduce many million of different combinations to a few thousand, and then he checked all those thousands of combinations. Check all those thousands of combinations hand one by one to show that strictly show in a rigorous way that such a solution does not exist. So, let me now use not cards, but chess, show you relation to other famous problems. If you have six rooks, it's easy to put them in such a way that they do not attack each other. So, basically, each column, each row, there is only one such rock. Now, let's put takes different pieces. You see. Different pieces, you see chess pieces in an analogous way. For instance, if you put consider only kings and assuming that all other figures do not exist, you see that they obey those rules. So, of course, in each row, each column, there is only one king. So, this entire configuration, it is just a good example of Latin square of order six. This is simple. And now, we are trying to make the next step. So, we'll color them into six colors. So we'll color them into six colors. There are six colors. Can you see six colors? Yes. Can you see them? Yes, we can. Good, good. So what happened? I only painted those, in fact, 32 figures into six colors in such a way that you see in each column, each row, there are no colors repeat. But there are four question marks here because they are. Question marks here because they are for we know exactly what figures should be put here, but now if I want to really color them, you easily see there is a conflict, there is a contradiction, I cannot do it. Basically, it's not possible to put those and color those fixed figures in such a way that all those rules of Euler are satisfied. And this is just a simple example, and it shows that this theorem of Euler and Tarry works. You can ask why it is. Works. You can ask why it is so. Well, simple answer is: okay, there is no go theorem because d is 6, which is 2 times 3. It's a non-trivial but simple fact. It's a product of two different numbers, so it's neither a prime nor a product of prime, and this plays an important role. So the strict result of Carrie was that this solution, classical solution, does not exist. And now I will show you something which is strange. You can buy such a nice game. Can buy such a nice game, it's called 36 Cube by Niedermann. And now, look, it is basically the problem of Euler. You see, here are different colors, and here are different ranks. You see here the one, two, three ranks of officers. So, here it looks like apparent solution exists. So, you might be somehow, by the way, very nice game. I own it, so I can play with it. And now, this is kinds of a strange statement because it looks like Euler was wrong. And now, as you can guess, this is nice visualization. And now, as you can guess, this is a nice visualization of the difference between mathematics and physics. Of course, Olier was correct. Mathematically, the solution does not exist. So, who has any idea? Who knows this game? Why the solution here is apparent solution here? Because as you easily see in each row and column, there are different colors. So, any ideas? How do we know the wrongs? Exactly. The rungs exactly. So here it looks like you have ranks one, two, three, four, five, six, and this gray object is just specially produced in such a way to somehow influence the lungs. But of course, here is a catch. So to tell you, there are four figures here who look like they were of size five, but they are in fact of size four. So there is a kind of cheating, but in a nicer word, I can say it's a physical imperfection. And because of this physical imperfection, four pieces are no well prepared. Perfection, four pieces are not well prepared. Of course, there are two ranks which are the same, and of course, this is not a solution of the Euler problem. So, everything is fine. But I suggest if you ever see such a game, it's really amazing that there is such a game for kids which is related to really nice mathematics. And now I will refer to the paper by Saunel. In fact, it was a thesis written in German in last millennium. Look, Vienna, 1999. So good. So good figure eine nicht kumutatiben design theory. Some of my colleagues were joking it's the last important thesis or paper written in German. Now it's translated into English. A very nice paper. I worked with this thesis for many, many years. And as a rule of thumb, I will only mention any good classical concept can be somehow quantized. So we know what are combinatorial designs. And now following Sauner, we'll introduce quantum combinatorial designs. Definition is simple. Metal designs. Definition is simple. It is a constellation, but not of numbers, but of quantum states, for instance, belonging to the Hilbert space of given size D, which are arranged with a certain symmetry and balance. So everything is the same, but instead of putting, let's say, numbers like here, 1, 2, 3, 4, we put quantum states. And examples I can give, I well know in quantum theory, like those six semantic information complete generalized or Nicholas Regen bias basis and many others. Mutual and bias bases and many others. And here I will mention a very simple game you might know. So, sudoku. But standard sudoku is usually nine times nine boards. Here, to make it simpler, I use four times four. So, you know the rules. Each column, each row, and each block have different objects. So, here, important are numbers, not yet colors. So, the quantum slope will be the same. Basically, instead of numbers, I put states. And here, more formally, I could request that in each row, column, or block. That in each row column of block, four states form orthogonal basis. It means classically they are distinguishable. So let's say quantum sudo. Without a formal definition, this is a good example. But this is trivial. I only put those numbers and put them into cats. But here, I will show you something different. This is another quantum pseudoku. But here we have four different elements, states, which play the role. Basically, I performed a rotation in subspace one, two. A rotation in subspace one, two, and you see it's equivalent, so it's kind of quantum sundoku. But by a rotation, single orthogonal rotation, I can bring it to the classical solution. While here, this is already different design. We call it genuinely quantum pseudoku because they are all 16 elements are different. You can check it, and you can have in each row, each column, each block, you find orthogonal bases. So, in fact, we have four times four. We have four times four plus four, so 12 different bases. So it's a very special configuration which produces for us 12 measurement, orthogonal measurements of von Neumann and Ludelus. The idea of quantum sudoku goes back to a paper by Neshita, and in our follow-up paper, we produce this example. Wow, but this is in fact a particular. But this is, in fact, a particular case of a construction by Vikari and Musto from 2016. And they introduce a simpler, in a sense, object. So having Latin squares, they decide to quantize it and to work with quantum Latin squares. So QLS. So you see the definition is very simple. We take now these square states, we order them into a square in such a way that each row, each column, there is orthogonal basis. So here is such an example with one, two, three, four, eight different states where those psi plus minus and chi are just entangled. So they are superposition states. And in this case, we have here different bases. It's easy to check that they are orthogonal. So now look, in standard combinatorics, we work with discrete set of symbols and we work with permutation group. Here in quantum combinatorics, we use a continuous family of states. Continuous family of states, pure states in Hd, and a unitary group U of D, and of course, permutation group is embedded inside this much larger unitary group. So in fact, quantization here means a transition from discrete objects and permutation group to continuous family of pure states and unitary group which acts on it. So, well, now we go back to the problem of Euler. Euler considered orthogonal. Only are considered orthogonal Latin squares, for instance of say six, and we will quantize them. So, in the classical case, we take d square pairs of d symbols such that all of them are different and there are no repetitions in a row and column. So, to quantize it, we take now d square bipartite states. So, look, they are of size d square, so they belong to Hilbert space HA times HD, such that all of them are mutually orthogonal. They are mutually orthogonal, so they form a basis, which corresponds to the fact that all of them are different. And now, look, other conditions are a little bit more tricky, but no repetitions means that in each column, each row, you have a flat distribution because all colors are different, so they average out. So, quantum analog is that a partial trace of such an operator is proportional to identity for rows and columns. And of course, if you take a star. And of course, if you take a standard orthogonal Latin square, it's very simple to quantize it. We just put a bracket and we consider, for instance, king of claps as a tensor product kings times claps. So of course, it is in a sense quantum orthogonal Latin square, but similar to classical. And to have a genuine quantum object, we can introduce entanglement. Here we had only product states. Here we had all new product states. And then a third statement is there is no quantum orthogonal acting squares of order two. So there's a consequence of an important paper of Higo-Chi and Sudbury from 2001, which basically said that there is no, it's not possible to find such a constellation of four qubits such that they are maximally entangled for all three different partitions. So here is just a simple consideration. If you take, for instance, in Consideration: if you take, for instance, in chess language, pounds and locks, and you take different signs, basically, you can examine all those cases to get the results following the paper of Higuchi and Sarbury that such a construction is not possible, neither classically nor quantum mechanically. Well, so now I go back to quantum physics to compose systems and pangoled states. So we know what are separable pure states in the bipolar system. Pure states in the bipartite system. So, entangled are all of those which are not of this form. For instance, for two-qubit systems, we know very well our famous Bell states in our, let's say, bridge notation, it's Ace of Spades plus King of clubs. And they find several applications in quantum technology. It's easy to check that they are so because we can just use a product basis, take this matrix of coefficient, find the singular values and singular values of this matrix. And singular values of this matrix, its entropy is equal to the entanglement entropy of the state. If it's maximal log of D, then the state is maximally entangled. This is simple for bipartite systems, even of larger dimension, then we have those generalized Bell states of two cutines, and the formula is very simple. And this is simple for bipartite system. However, this is possible to generalize. Possible to generalize this notion for multiple tech systems. And then there is a nice notion of absolutely maximally entangled states, which definition is simple. We have, let's say, for simplicity, the even number of n q dates, and the state is called absolutely maximally entangled, written A M E. If for any choice of subsystems, the partial phase is maximally mixed. So, for instance, if I take four objects here. Here we say that such a state of four objects is maximally absolutely maximally entangled. If I choose any two and for such a splitting, the state is maximally entangled. So if I perform partial trace, this state will be maximally mixed. And if I swap and perform partial trace over those subsystems, this state will be also maximally mixed. And we know that for two subsystems, of course, Bell states exist. Base states exist for four qubits. There's no such state because of the result of Higuchin Sudbury. They exist for four q3s, for six qquarts. And then you can ask a question whether such states exist for n equal four subsystems with D levels each. Well, here I will show you a table by Felix Huber, Nikolai Viderka. So you see here N and D, this is number of parties, and D is dimension. Is number of parties and this dimensionality local dimension? Green means states, armor states do exist, red do not exist. So this red means this was the result of Higuchi, this is of felix, seven qubits do not exist. White is do not, we do not know yet. So this is the case in the center, exactly four parties of size six. The result was not known, let's say, two years ago. It was open also for us. We worked on this problem for many, many years. So, okay, why do we care about those answers? It's okay. Why do we care about those R mistakes? Because they are important for various practical protocols like quantum codes, teleportation. They are related to holographic codes, to perfect tensors, and so on. I will be brief here. I will only mention quantum codes. If you have this Greek or Latin square of size three, so this is bridge notation. This is the information notation. So look, we can write this state. So from such a pattern, you can immediately. A pattern, you can immediately write your state in the following way. You put two first black digits as address, so here 0, 0, and the red is the contents of this box. So you have first state 0, 0, 0, 0. Now you go to the box number 0, 1, this one. You wrote here is 1, 2. So you put such a state. Now you go to the address 0, 2. You look 2, 1. So it's such a state. Second row gives you this state, and third row gives you this state. So you see now that such. This state. So you see now that such a configuration, classical configuration of nine cars, so orthogonal Latin squares of size three, allows us immediately to write down such a state. It's easy to show that it's really absolutely maximally intangible. Why? Only because of this condition, there's no repetition of colors and curves in row and column. So now I will ask you a question. Is this construction clear to you? This is the key construction of my work. Having such an orthogonal. Having such an orthogonal Latin square, I can immediately construct such a state. Is it clear for you? Well, nobody understood nothing. Are there any questions? Is somebody there? Can you hear me? Hello, are you there? Please let me know. Are you already fallen? Sorry, I cannot hear you. Are you there? Can you hear me now? Can you hear me? I'm sorry. Can you hear me? Can you hear me now? Yes, yes, yes. But can you hear me? Yes, we can. We had a problem with the microphone here. Okay, okay. But the point was, I was asking whether you can understand this construction here. Yes, yes. Very well, very well. So you see, there were two first credits in this case were taken for the address, and two others were let out of this pattern, Gricolatti square. And then you can immediately get quantum curve. And then you can immediately get quantum code. So, zero you encode into this state, which is obtained from the first line, which starts with zero. One goes into logical one, which is represented by the second line, and two by the third blue line. So, in a sense, this gray collatin square encodes entire corresponding quantum error correction code. Very fine. So, okay, now there is the relation about those absolutely maximally entangled state and two unitarian. Maximally entangled state and two unitary matrices. So, in fact, we can write such a state as a tensor with four indices. And we can say that such a tensor, if we combine two indices, is a matrix. And the definition is simple. Such a matrix is called two unitary if it remains unitary for any choice of two indices out of four. So, if I take mu nu from ijlm is unitary and for this choice of indices for this choice, it's called two unitary because I have two indices out of. Because I have two indexes out of four. And the corresponding tensor is called perfect. It was first discussed in the paper by Pastofsky and others 2015. And we had a paper with, well, by the way, all other people are Hispano Ablantes. Goshenece Alsina Lato Vieira 2015. So those R and gamma denote partial transpose and reshuffling, which corresponds to reordering the matrix by changing. Reordering the matrix by changing the indices here. So, in short, the matrix is too uniform if it's unitary. Sorry, too unitary. And also, after partial transpose and reshuffling, it's unitary. And the first observation, which is simple, is the following. If there exists a quantum orthogonality square of size d, its existence is equivalent to the existence of absolutely maximally entangled states of four. Entangled states of four systems with delivers each, and the proof of this is simple. So, if you solve one problem, you will solve another. So, practically, it means in such a four-party state, there is a maximal entangled for all three possible partitions. So, AB is maximally entangled with respect to CD, AC with BD, and AD with BC. So, well, okay, I have to skip now some ideas concerning how we looked for this. This is a picture from Kakao, and now. This is a picture from Kakao. And now the key message is the following: there are no classical orthogonal Latin square of size six, the conjecture by Euler, proved by Tally. But, and this is the key point, a quantum solution exists. So look, classically, it means there was only a single chess piece on a single box. And now this is the solution. I put not a single object by a superposition of three. By a superposition of three, sometimes two, sometimes not more than four pieces. So I claim this is a good solution, but you can say, well, it is not the case because I claim that all those states should be orthogonal. And now look at the field C2, it's equal to A5. Here we have this field, a pawn and the knight, and here the same field. Well, the solution is not full yet. In fact, to have a full solution, To have a full solution, I have to add phases. There's a superposition with different phases, and strangely enough, those phases are relational. They are multiples of root of identity of order 20. So here, the number in black is just K number. So for instance, in this case, C2, this field here, has phases 0 and 10. 10 means minus 1. So this state is just minus pound. Minus pound and this state is plus pound. So now you see that those states are indeed orthogonal as they should. Moreover, sizes of the figures correspond to amplitudes and the phases are encoded in those numbers. So my claim is that all the solution we found is encoded in this picture. And then first we have to check that all states are orthogonal. This is simple and can be done. Moreover, those partial phase conditions here, you can only see that they grew. Here you can only see the degree of color is the same amount of all colors in each row, each column. And basically, this is behind this requirement concerning power side phases. Also, same amount, let's say, of a number of rocks or smaller rocks or big rocks around each row and each column. Well, so in a sense, this is one way of representing the solution. This is another way, like first state in the chest solution looks like this, but this is more standard solution. But this is a more standard solution where those numbers c, a, and b are known and they're very nice. For instance, here we have this famous Pitagoran theorem: c squared is one half. And here we can call the state golden because the ratio between numbers A and B is just famous golden mean known in the Greek times. So of course, A and B, because of those two equations, are known analytically. And now, having knowing those numbers and phases, we can easily check that this colorful solution. Can easily check that this colorful solution really does the job. And it is really a first found solution of generalization or solution to the generalized quantum version of the problem of Euler. And then I can only mention that it's possible to distinguish four subsystems, and there are four maximally entangled Bell states living in those. Bell states living in those four subsystems. So, in a sense, we could split 36 Phoenix into nine groups of four soldiers, four officers, which are entangled together. So, we have a non-obvious splitting of 36-dimensional space into nine subspaces of size four. Now, I think I will skip. Okay, so you could ask how we found this state. We found it by such a, okay, By such a okay, numerical search. So we basically took a state and unitary matrix, then we took it's the shuffling, it's not unitary anymore. And then we by it is called polar decomposition found another unitary perform partial phase and continued. But if you start with any random state, you will not reach to the gay. Here is the unitary matrix. Here is the unitary matrix, which corresponds to the maximal possible entangling power, which corresponds to the solution. And the point was to find the good seed, good starting point. You take any other seed, you will not find much. So this is like a projection of more than one 36 square dimensional complex space of unitary made subsidies 36 into a plane. And basically, we want to find here the extremal case. And this could be done provided seed was correct. Then we found such a Correct, then we found such a numerical solution. We had to clean it by local unitary rotations. We found such a matrix after this cleaning procedure, then we could bring it after permutation to such a form. Here you see the structure nine times four. We have to require this is unitary. So it's easy to require unitarity in each block. And then we could solve this unitarity in each block condition to get an LTP, those numbers A, B, and C. And this golden ratio is related to the. Ratio is related to the pentagon structure, and it explains why omega is just root of 20 of identity because 4 times 5 is 20. So basically, this number, root of 20, is not an accident. So I think I should, okay, this is another realization in terms of bridged cards. I will first mention that if you put four dices, I have four QKs. My system consists of four parties with six levels each. I can represent them with four different. I can represent them with four different distinguishable dices, and then if those dices are in such a golden armor state, then if I choose any two of those dices and register the outcome, I can predict the outcome of two other dices. And this is special for this very state. And therefore, this property can be used in, for instance, quantum teleportation. So, this paper, okay, the key statement is that those states. Key statement is that those states, they are extremal states, they do exist, those army states, extremal states for subsystems with six levels each. The paper was first published this year in PLL. And then the existence implies first solution of a quantum analog of the 36 officers of Euler, optimal bipartite unitary gate with maximized entangling power, a perfect tensor with four indices, each run. With four indices, each running from one to six, which can be applied for tensor networks and bulk boundary correspondence, and a non-adhive quantum error correction codes, which allows you to encode one single Q hex in three other Q hexes. And last but not least, we wrote another paper recently, which was published this year in April. And then discussing the problem of thirty-six entangled officers of Euler, we added the following note. Added the following note. It is sad to note that these Russian officers recently left the parade ground in St. Petersburg, where they belong, and went a thousand miles south. However, exhibited analytical results described in this work strongly suggest that the officers might eventually suffer a transition into a highly entangled state. Thank you very much. Questions? Hi, Carol. This is Ugnian Ureshko from Brussels. Oh, hello, hello, Gogniam. Nice to see you, or to at least listen to you. Thank you. Yes, I'm in person here. So, I was maybe the answer to this question was implied somehow in your talk, but I missed it. So, what I was wondering is: does this non-existence of a classical solution of the Euler problem could somehow be linked to some sort of no-go theorem for the types of states that you found, like maybe related to contextuality or non-locality or something like that? As there is yes, okay, we believe so, but the first no-go theorem was established by Higuchi and Sadbelli. Was established by Higuchi and Sudberry, and they proved that there are no absolutely maximally entangled states of four qubits, and they do exist for Qts, Q quads. Why? Because the space, the constraints are more or less the same, and the space is larger. And now our solution shows that those states, quantum version, exist for size 6. And look, since the classical solutions exist for any other higher dimension, also what's important, 10 and 14, all suppose is not the case. Suppose is not the case. So we know that for all other numbers larger than two, such quantum absolutely maximally entangled states of four qubits do exist. So in this case, there's no further no-go statement beyond D equal to. Okay, thanks. Any other question? Okay. Lucien. I had my hand raised. I was going to ask the same question Onion asked if well more j more generally if there's any foundational significance to this in the sense of no-theorems or whatever relating to contextuality Bell's theorem or anything else. I think you answered that question. Well, okay, in fact, I have not. So basically, look, we were. Look, we were thinking like in the case d equal two for d equal six, we will not find those the solution. We were working four years about it and we almost started to write a paper that such states do not exist. We found a very nice approximation, but not exact. And then this, fortunately, this young colleague from India was not reading our notes and he found first numerical solution. So then we could proceed and find analytical one. But perhaps there is a better relation and direct link to numerical. And directly link to not contextuality. However, in this case, I will repeat: for all dimensions larger than two, such a quantum solution does exist. So, well, whether we'll find some good applications to non-contextuality, well, perhaps it's an open question. But I don't have a ready answer to it. Then, the other question is: do you have an intuition as to sort of because he had to do a search? As to sort of, because you had to do a search to find these solutions. Do you have an intuition as to why this is possible? Or I mean, you must have had something like this going in because you wouldn't have done such a big search if you hadn't thought it might work. Yes, yes. Okay, okay. Look, so of course we change our intuition for many, many times. So personally, believe we will find it quickly, but we did not. But look, in a sense, you know very well that quantum states, basically the dimension somehow the space we look for, the solution is the same, but Solution is the same, but let's say unitary group is much larger than permutation, so you can basically visit larger spaces of possibilities. And it was, of course, not clear that in the case of D equals six, those states do exist. But later, not only it occurred that they do exist, but the structure is extremely simple. You take into account the fact that all those analytical numbers are almost as simple as possible, and everything can be written analytically. And here, of course, many people. And here, of course, many people ask me why exactly 20, why exactly this ratio, golden mean? Of course, this golden mean and 20 is related here to this. Sorry. Okay. And here we do not have any answer to this question. For instance, another one, just a second. Here, we have managed to bring this magnitude of size 36 into nine groups of size 4. Again, why 9 times 4? Well, of course, there is no other option. Well, of course, there is no other option if you consider 36, but somehow it was not clear to us that such a structure will exist. So, there are many, many, many still questions open concerning the structure of the solution. And we believe it's a nice example, and we will try to analyze it further. So, now some colleagues of us claim that it could be used as a benchmark for quantum computing because this state is pretty extreme. It shows as strong correlation between parties as possible, which do not. As possible, which do not exist classically, but exist only quantum mechanically. So they ask us to produce a scheme of gates which could allow us to realize such a state in quantum computers. So we are working on it. Well, thank you. Very interesting. Thank you very much, Lucien. Nice to see you here. Yeah, good to see you today. Yeah, yeah. Next question is by John Martin. Hello, John. It's John from Belgium. Hello, hello. June. I might have missed the information, but so you showed a solution, but did you show that it is unique? No, okay, of course, we don't know. So this is too difficult. And numerically, you can find other solutions, but we believe they are equivalent. Up till now, we found only equivalent up to local unitaries. So basically, unitaries, sorry, I will not look for it. You can imagine you can rotate locally, but. Can rotate locally, but now will there exist different solutions? Basically, this is an open question we don't know. Okay, thank you. Yes, okay, so in short, we found the solution such states which satisfy those conditions, and we do not know whether other solutions for this size exist. And now we know that those solutions exist for any D larger than 2. Any more questions? Okay, then let's thank our speaker, Carol. Thank you very much.
