My talk title is Augmented Two-Step Estimation Equations with Using the Functional and Complex Survey Data. This is a joint work with my post-work by the Professor Bu Tampa from the University of Waterloo. The main contents of this the main goal of this study is to give it Is to develop an efficient two-step estimation efficiency with using expansion and complex survey data. This is two-step using estimate is involved. The main context of this talk includes four parts. They are introduction, a new project. They are introducing a new approach, many results, and simulation studies. I first give a brief introduction about the survey population and samples. A survey population consists of a set of index one to capital N and where U is treated as fixed associated with each unit I in capital U. In capital U, we can define a set of survey variables which are also non-random. The survey sample is a set of sample units, units selected for the probability sampling design, such as the single-stage PPS sampling. Stratification sampling and cluster sampling. The sample size is a realized sample size, which could also be a random number and certain sampling designs. Or we also define the first and second inclusion probabilities as pi i and pi i g. Here the pi i is all is always used as the always used as used for estimating develop the survey visitor as survey the estimation equations the pi IG is often used for the variance estimation thus it is for inference the design based inference is about the frequent interpretation with respect to the probability sampling design for the given population. We are interested in making statistical inference on a p-dimensional parameter of interest, which is the true for the true value is uniquely determined by the system customization equations in which usage function is also involved. For general way, For general, we assume that the estimation equations is over-identified, that is, the dimension of the estimated function is larger than the dimension of the parameter interest. We also assume that the estimation equations is non-smooth in both the parameter of interest and the nuisance functionals. There exists many methods for. Exists many methods for handling the estimation equation inference and different situations, such as the smooth estimation equation inference with and without nuisance parameters. Also, the non-smooth estimation equations inference with and without nuisance parameter. However, which is the nuisance parameter should be estimated at a rotor end rate. That that is That that is the nuisance parameter is is is of the palate uh dimension. Recently, we developed a design-based two two-step semi-parametric GE inference in which we assumed that the convergence rate for the first step plug-in estimator are slower than rotor M. That is the nuisance parameter. That is the nuisance parameter R infinite dimensional and R estimate of non parametrically. Here I will give a brief introduction of our developed two-step EI inference which published our previous paper. Assume that we have at hand a suitable estimator for the user's function. For the listener function as then using the using the survey weighted estimation equations, we can develop the two-step EL usual functions by using the classical MQL approach developed by Owen and Professor Owen and Professor Qingjin. Consequently, the two-step maximum year Two-step maximum ER uses estimator for the perimeter of interest can be defined can be defined easily. However, there are some issues with the design-based two-step EL approach, such as for complex survey data. The weak survey works done with the two-step EL approach, even the simple random. And simple random simply. That is out in EL usual statistics landstand classical distribution. A post-trap calibration procedure could be employed to compute the lead distribution of the likelihood user statistic, but the method is computationally intensive and the theoretical justification are loaded. Justification are not available for geological survey designs. Inference-based and two-step EL approach do not use information and the main parameter and the nuisance function simultaneously, and they are therefore a lot efficient. In this study, we wish to propose a new A new two-step estimation equations using the complex submit data in which the VX server can be restored. We assume that, to this end, we assume that the survey population, the two-step survey estimation equations have esometrical expansion like the equation one. And here the organization is the One. And here the augmentation term has finite force population moments, and the sum of the survey rate augmented term is asymmetrically normally distributed with mean zero, and the various common matrix is of a specific order. Then our purpose the augmented survey. purpose the augmented weighted estimate uh weighted GEE function can be defined by adding the augmented term to the original estimation equations. With the given valid population, it's easy to say that the the without change the augmented uh population estimation functions um also has uh uh unique route as uh Unique root as the true values of the parameter of interest and the using functional. Given the set of the sample units and the set of surveys, we can define the augmented survey estimation equations. We can show that the asymmetrical distribution The asymmetrical distribution of the sub-valid estimation equations is invariant to the estimation of the nuisance function. That is, the estimation of the nuisance function has no impact estimatically and the estimation of the main parameter increased. Now, we define zoo as a concrete function of scale. A concave function of the scalar of the scalar. Then we can define the recent generalized MPRIC likelihood objective function. The G GE objective function includes the MP collection for the ET and the COE and the GMM. Given the first step for the nuisance function, a class of augmented G lamb is the two-step GI estimator for the parameter of interest can be defined as a solution to the side of point of problem. That is, the estimator of the parameter of interest can be defined as the minimal point of the G eta objective objective. Objective function objective function. Lex, we will show why the purpose new approach can help restore the weak server in the two-step GEL approach. Here, besides certain regulatory assumptions and probability sampling design and estimating equations, we further equations, we further require some high-level conditions for especially the consistence and the efficiency of the proposed estimate. These high-level conditions can be easily verified and their pre-liminary condition can also be easily constructed, such as the dance conditions. Conditions and GC conditions. Our first use art shows that the purpose the asymmetrically distribution of the purposed two-step estimator is invariant to the fastest step estimator for the nuisance function. In other words, the nuisance, the estimation of the user. The estimation of the using the function has no asymptotic impact on the estimation of the parameter of interest. Especially, we show that under some commonly used assembly designs, the focused approach can achieve the semi-parametric efficiency. We will also consider the construction of the confidence region and hypothesis testing for the parameter of interest using the proposed augmented survey-related estimation equations. We can show that the result in the GL usual statistics converges to Converges to a linear conversation of the independent classable distribution. This user is developed on general sampling designs. Likely, we also show that under some commonly used sampling designs such as the single-state PPS sampling, with placement of single-state PPS sampling. single stage PPS sampling without replacement with magnitude sampling fractions and the the the purpose GLI user statistic is the esmetrologic follows a standard cascader distribution like we finally we reported some use simulation results to investigate the We investigate the valid sample performance of the proposed approach. We consider the valid population quantile shear with some fixed levels. The valid population is generated from linear regression model with size 20,000 and the back size. The x i and the epsilon eye, it follows some known distributions. Repeated simulations sample of size 300 are selected from the population by four sampling methods, such as the single-state PBS sampling without replacement with small sampling fractions and with And with large sampling corrections, and also the stratified PPS sampling, and the two-stage cluster sampling and the self-waiting design. In our similarity studies, we consider four seasonals for the quantile levels. For each selected sample, we use six different methods to construct the like five percent. like 5% competence intervals for the four quantity shear. This method includes the GL usual calculus interval using the standard cache square distribution, limiting distribution for each of the ET, ELLA, the continuous update estimator and the GA memo. The normal approximation Approximation confidence intervals using the estimating equations based on pointer estimate and a boost trap estimator of the standard clear the post-travel method uses the multiple level strap method. The multiple level strap personality intervals with the estimation based on the point estimate. In all simulations, we also compare the purpose of the method such as augmented survey-rated estimation equation approach is compatible with the method of the conventional survey-rated estimation equation inference. The conventional survey-butted estimation equations is divided with the basic and without And without the augmented term. But we assume that the conversion self-regular estimation equations without limit like equal to usual statistics of the standard class score limit distribution. The table reports the result for the survey design A. We can see that using the purpose of the augmented survey-based estimation equations, all the GGL approaches such as the ELIET CEU have been silent. CU have excellent performance in terms of the coverage probability, and of course, values are very close to the luminar level. But without using without using the conventional, without using the augmented survey-which estimation equation, such as the conventional survey-wide estimation equation, inference has a battery. Has a bad performance in all consider situations. That is the coverage probability is completely offers a target low-minute target nominal value. That's all. Thank you.
