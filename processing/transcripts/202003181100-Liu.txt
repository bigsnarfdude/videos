So, our online conference is really fun. I didn't expect it will be so nice, but it works nicely. And today's third day and third talk of this meeting will be This will be delivered by Chung Hung Liu about clustered coloring and immersion. And we have a shared screen again. And I just invite Chung Hong to start with his presentation. Please. Okay, so thanks, Lo Yang. So I would like to thank the organizer for doing this. So it's quite a different experience for doing this online. Experience for doing this online. Okay, so I will talk about something about clustered coloring and the immersions. And there is a big part of the background about this talk that has already been talked about this week by other speakers. So for that part, I just quickly go through that. Yes, yes. Okay. All right. So let me start. So in this talk, when we So in this talk, when we talk about coloring, which also means we color the ferrices, but with no other condition. But when we restrict the adjacent ferrises using different colors, we will call it proper color. So it's easy to see that if the graph is probably T-colorable, then we cannot have a KT plus 1 subgraph. But the converse is not true. So even though we forbid the KT plus 1 subgraph, We forbid the KT plus 1 subgraph, we cannot ensure that the graph is properly T-colorable. So people try to ask the question: How about if we forbid the KT plus 1 as a more general structure? Can we get a T-colability result? So there are a couple of conjectures in this line. So one is the hardware conjecture saying that if we forbid the KT plus Y minor, then we can get a T cartability result. Can get the T-culturality results. So, we only see this conjecture many times this week. So, these are pretty difficult conjectures. And even the test t equals 4 implies the four-color theorem. And now it's known to be true for t at the most five. And in general, it's the t times polylogy upper bound. And there's another conjecture along this line. There's Hayush conjecture. There's Hayush conjecture, saying if we forbid the kt plus 1 as a topological minor, then we can get the t-colability result. So Hayus conjecture is stronger than hardware conjecture, but it's too strong to be true in general. So it's easy to show this true when t is at the most 3, but it's false for every t at least 6. And actually it's very false in the sense that this actually is a superlinear lower bound for the number of Linear lower bounds for the number of colors we need, and on the other hand, we get the quadratic upper bound for the number of colors. Okay, so now we have two conjectures. So either of them says if you forbid a KT process some general structure, then we want to get something about coloring. But either of these is super hot or super false. So let's try something. So let's try something weaker. So I would like to relax the notion of the proper coloring. So to do that, first let me redefine what the proper coloring is. So we know if a graph is probably k-colorable, it also means that we can color the forecast by using k-colors such that every monochromatic component contains exactly one vertex. So, how about So, how about now if I allow the monopoly component has more vertices, but still have boundary size? And then we get the color of the color. So, as the Vida said before, but I would like to use a slightly different language about it. So, I would like to say a class of graphs is clustered K-colorable. If I can find a constant n such that for every graph in this class, I can color the vertices by using K-colorable. Varices are using K-colors such that every monochromatic component contains at the most n veraces. So, when we talk about clustered coloring, then we need to go by graph class. Because if we only have one graph, then we just take n to be the number of vertices of this graph. And then you just need one color and get the bounded monochromatic component size. Okay, so all right, so now the question is that. So now the question is that how can I know whether a class of graphs is clustered decorable or not? So that's one way we can do. So let's consider another class of graphs that we call the FKN. So it is a set of graphs such that every k coloring will lead to a monochromatic component among the embarrasses. So it's easy to see that if a class of graphs is classed k color, then it is disjoint from Let it disjoint from FkN for all sufficiently large n. So, if you want to know whether f is clustered k-colored or not, we only need to completely understand what is fkn. So, the easiest question is that what is f1? So, f1n is easy. It's just the set of graphs that contains a component or more than embarrasses. Because if we just use one color, that's equivalent to say we don't use any color. Say we don't use any colour. But the question about what is F2N is much harder. So we don't really know the answer. But there's a way to generate some graphs in F2n. And actually, there's a more general way to generate graphs in Fk plus 1n if we know a graph in Fkn. So such construction is called a standard construction. So the construction is that if we take a graph H. If we take a graph H in FKN, then we make n disjoint copy of this guy and then add one extra vertex adjacent to all other vertices. Then this new graph will be in Fk plus Yn. It's easy to check. So because we completely understand what is F1, so we can generate some graph in F2N, but you cannot generate all graphs in F2N. So for example, if you remember So, for example, if you remember Peta's talk, so the dual of the hex graph is a graph in F to N, but you cannot generate it by using a standard construction. So, even asking whether a class of graph is clustered too colorable or not, it's already hard. Okay, anyway, so now we have clustered coloring. So, let's try to work on this one with respect to the conjectures we mentioned before. So, let's do the Before. So let's do the cluster the color inversion for hardware conjecture. So given integer t, we want to know what is the minimum f of t, such that the class of kt plus 1 minus free graph is clustered f of t color. So first, you will ask whether we still need t colors as the original hardware conjecture. And the answer is yes. So if you take a star, it is a graphing FYN. It is a graph in F1n, and it has no K3 minor. If you do standard construction on this guy, then you get a graph that is in F2n, but it has no K4 minor. So just repeatingly doing this, eventually you show F of T at least the T. But how about the upper bound for F of T? So it's a much harder question. So eventually, people try to work on it a lot. It's a long history about improving the upper bound. Proving the upper bound. And eventually, the Brosjak and Noring can prove it. F of T is really equal to T. So now we know the cluster color inversion of Hadio conjecture is true. So I would like to mention that in a joint work with David Wood earlier, so we can show that if you allow one more color, then we can prove the result for a more general class of graphs. So we can show that if you just property the KT plus one as a topological Forbid the KT plus 1 as a topological minor, and forbid any graph H as a minor, then T plus 1 colors are enough. So it somehow means that if you consider crafted coloring for such kind of question, it seems like the number of colors is more relevant with the topological minor than the graph with for B d as a minor. All right, so how do you conjecture that's okay? That's okay. But how about Hayuch conjecture? So, we want to know what is the minimum f of t such that the class of kt plus one topological minor free graph is clustered f of t color. So, again, we need to list the t colors because the highest conjecture is stronger than Hardier conjecture. And we also get the linear upper bound for this one. So, this linear upper bound is somehow interesting because it says that. because it says that if you consider clustered coloring for Haij conjecture, this behaves really different from the original one. Because for the original one, there's a super linear lower bound for the number of colors we need. If you allow clustered coloring, then you get a linear upper bound. So you really see the difference between them. But such behavior doesn't really appear for the hardware conjecture, unless hardware conjecture. Conjecture. Unless hardware conjecture is also very false. So it's just something that we cannot expect before. Okay, anyway, so now so far we consider cluster coloring and some conjectures about forbidding Kd plus 1 as a more general structure. But there's another one. There's another such conjecture that's in the literature. So there's another general structure called the immersion. So we want to consider forbidden immersion. So we want to consider forbidden immersion and do the coloring. But to define the immersion, I would like to redefine the topological minor. So you give the good motivation about it. So another way to define the topological minor is to consider the embedding. So it can be easily seen that if G contains H as a topological minor, then we can embed H into G homeomorphically, meaning you can Meaning, you can map the pharices of H into the pharices of G injectively, and you can map each edge of H to a path in G, preserving the end. But if you get a loop, then you should map the loop into a cycle. And the most important thing is that if we have two different edges, then you should map two different edges to internally disjoint paths or cycles. So that's the traditional. So that's the traditional homeomorphic embeddings to define the topological minor. And the immersion is defined in a similar way. So we say a graph G contains another graph H is an immersion. If we can also embed H in a way like the homeomorphic embedding, but now we don't require different edges are mapped to internally disjoint paths. Now we only require different edges are mapped to edge disturbance. edges are mapped to H-disjoint subgraphs, meaning H-disjoint paths or H-disjoint cycles. So it's easy to see that if G count as H as a topological minor, then G count as H as an immersion. So it just follows from the definition. But if G count as H as an immersion, you cannot guarantee that G counts H as a minor. Because planar graphs can contain any graph as an immersion, but it cannot contain any. Immersion, but it cannot count any non-planar graph as a minor. Also, conversely, if G countens H as a minor, it cannot guarantee that G condensed H as an immersion, because subcubic graphs can contain any graph as a minor, but it cannot contain any non-subcubic graph as an immersion. So it just follows from the definition. You just don't have enough vertices to be mapped from the vertices to edge. So here's the H. So it's the obvious degree condition, but we can also make this slightly more general. So we can say that if G conducts H as an immersion, then for every integer k, the number of variations in G with degree at least k should be at the least the number of veraces in H with degree at least k. So it's the very obvious degree condition. And let me call it the obvious necessary. Let me call it the obvious necessary degree condition. But actually, it plays an important rule when we study immersion. And you will see it soon again. All right, so now we know what immersion is. And there's also a conjecture about forbidding immersion and do the coloring. So it's a conjecture proposed by Lescu and Emmanuel, and independently by Afu-Shang and Denston, saying that every KT Proton immersion. Every KT plus one immersion free graph is properly T-colorable. So this conjecture also receives attention. So far, we know the conjecture is true when T is at the most 6, and it's open for every T at least 7. And in general, we know there's a linear upper bound, and the currently the best upper bound is 3.54 T. So it somehow says that this conjecture thinks more tricky. This conjecture seems more tractable than the hardware conjecture. Alright, so now we have a new conjecture. So let's consider the clustered color inversion about it. So I want to know what is the minimum f of t, such that the class of kt plus 1 immersion free graph is clustered f of t colorable. So now again you ask the same question. What's the lower bound and what's the upper bound for f of t? So let's try the lower bound first. So here there was the lower bound T for the hardware conjecture. But the argument is follows from the standard construction. But if you do the standard construction from the star or anything you like, you get a graph that contains any graph as an immersion. So the lower bound for the hardware conjecture doesn't work here. But we can still get a lower bound by using the obvious degree condition. So let me say. So let me say g is the minimum number such that the class of graphs with maxima degree at the most d is clustered g of d colorable. So because we know every graph with maxima degree less than t has no kt plus 1 immersion. So it shows that f of t is at the least the g of t minus 1. And you can make the question more general. So we can say just fix any graph h. What is the Any graph H, what is the minimum F of H such that the class of H immersion free graph is clustered F of H colorable? And you can use the same argument. You can show that F of H is at the least G of the maximum degree of H minus 1, just by just using the obvious degree condition. But for some graph H, we can improve the lower bound a little bit. So if we take a graph L, which has maximized graph L which has maximum degree at the most maximum degree of H minus 2 and we do standard construction from this graph then we will get a graph that has exactly one vertex that has degree at the least the maximum degree of H so if H has at least the two vertices attaining the maximum degree then this graph cannot contain H as an immersion so it shows that we can get the newer lower bound which says that F of H is Which says that f of h is at least three of the maximal degree of h minus two and plus one, when h has at least two varieties attending a maxima degree. So this lower bounds is really slightly better than the previous one, because if we get a graph with maxima degree x, you can delete the stable set to reduce the maximum degree. So it shows that g of x is at the most g of x minus 1. The g of x minus 1 and then plus 1. So the second lower bound is slightly better than the previous one. Alright, so now we have two trivial lower bounds. But how about upper bound? And the main theorem in this talk is that actually this two trivial lower bound is very close to the optimal answer. So we can prove the upper bound that is just one away from the lower bound. The lower bound, as long as h has mixed some degree at least the eighth. So I would like to mention that even though it seems that the upper bound and lower bound has a gap, which is at the most one, but actually they are tight for infinitely many integers d because we know g of d is between d over 4 and d over 3. So it means that So it means that there are infinitely many different integers d, such that g of d minus 1 and g of d minus 2 are the same. So it makes the second statement height. And there are also infinitely many different integers d that make g of d minus 1 and g of d minus 2 different. And it makes the first statement height. So either statement is tied for infinitely many different cases for d. Different cases for D, but they cannot be tied at the same time. Alright, so I would like to briefly say how can we prove this theorem. So the main tool is a new structure theorem about forbidding a fixed graph as an immersion. So roughly, the structure theorem says that if a graph has no edge immersion, then we can construct Then we can construct this graph by starting from some small graph by using some operations. And each small graph here has the property that we can delete a bounding number of edges to make it violate the obvious necessary degree conditions. So let me just do this slowly. So, first, let me mention what the operation we will use in the construction. So, we will use So, we will use the notion called the edge sum. So, we want to define the edge sum of two graphs, or let me just define a k edge sum, where k is an integer. So, now we take two graphs, and then for each of them, we pick a spatial vertex. So, they are the blue vertex in the picture, and assume each spatial vertex is incident with k edges, and then we just get the arbitrary labeling. Just get the arbitrary labeling for the k edges incident with each spatial vertex. And then we delete the spatial vertex from each graph. So now we consider the k edges incident with the spatial vertex becomes half edges with labels y through k. And then we just grow the half edges in these two graphs into a new one. Then that's the resulting graph of the kh sum of two graphs. Graphs. So in this picture, I show the three-h sum of two graphs. So it's like this. All right, so now I can state what the theorem is. So the theorem says that if we fix the integers d and h, then I can find some constants only depending on d and h. Then for every h, that is not very trivial. Here I call the non-exceptional. Here, I call the non-exceptional, and I will define what it is soon. So, if I get the non-exceptional graph H with H varices with maximum degree at the most D, and for any graph G that has no H immersion and has no H cut of size exactly 3, then I can construct a graph G by using H sounds from the small graphs, where for each step, the H sound I use only involves with function number. only involved with bounding number of edges. And for each small graph, it has the property that I can delete the boundary number of edges to make it violate the obvious degree condition. So it just means that I can find an integer, say di, such that if I delete the boundary number of edges from the small graph, then the number of vertices in the smaller graph with degree at least the d. With degree at least di is less than the number of variations in H with degree at least di. So it just shows that Gi minus Ci cannot count as H as an immersion. But just see the obvious linear 30 degree condition. All right, so now I have to say something I didn't say before. So what's the exceptional condition for H is? So we just say a graph. So we just say a graph H is exceptional. It has exactly one vertex of degree at least 2, and every sorry, it has a vertex of degree at least 2, and this unique vertex is incident with a loop. So it's a very trivial condition, but we have some difficulty to prove the case when edge is very trivial, like this. But usually it will not create any trouble because if Create any trouble because if you have an exceptional graph, then you just subdefine any edge, then you get a non-exceptional graph. Then you just work on the new graph, then you'll be fine. And there is another assumption in this structure theorem. So we need to assume that g has no edge cut of size exactly 3. So it is necessary if you want the screen structure theorem. Because if you don't forbid the edge cut. Because if you don't forbid the edge cut of size 3, then possibly you get the subcubic graphs for G and H. And then if you want to forbid the subcubic graph as an immersion in a subcubic graph, then it's equivalent to forbidden as a minor. But then you have to consider fortices and the surface. So the complicated, the near embedding notion in the Robertson-Simon structure theorem for excluding minor should be considered. So if you just want to focus on So, if you just want to focus on the degree condition, then we have to forbid the edge cut of size 3. Okay, so that's the structure theorem we have. So it somehow just means that when you get an edge immersion for graphs, possibly for edge connected maybe, then you can just reduce the problem on it by using a structure theorem to reduce the problem to graphs that almost cannot contain edge immersion simply because the Immersion simply because the degree condition. And that's the main tool we prove the coloring result mentioned before. Of course, we need more work to prove the theorem, starting from the structure theorem. But that's a very important step. All right, so now let me finish my talk by mentioning some open questions. So the main theorem today, I reduced the, so somehow I determined the clustered community number for each. Clustered chromatic number for H immersion free graphs, but the answer is in terms of G of D, meaning the clustered chromatic number for class of boundary maximal degree. But we don't really know what is this number. So far we only know these numbers between D over 4 and D over 3. But we don't even know what's the isotopic behavior of G of D over D. So that's the one obvious question we need to answer. We need to answer. And another obvious question is about strong immersion. So we say a graph G contains another graph H as a strong immersion. If we get a function that defines the H immersion, and then we have one extra property that if you just take the arbitrary vertex in H and arbitrary edge in H, if we know this vertex is not incident with this H, then the image of this vertex should be disjointed from. This vertex should be disjointed from the image of this edge. So, strong immersion is between topological minor and the immersion. And you can ask the same question: what's the minimum k such that the class of H strong immersion free graphs is clustered K color? We don't know the answer, but so far I know that for some graph H, the answer should be different from the one with the immersion. It only works for some graph H, but the and the lower bound I get is slightly different from the one for the immersion, but it's not much difference. But I know nothing about the upper bound for this one. So I think I'll stop here. Thank you. Okay, thank you for the talk and the new results which look quite interesting. Which look quite interesting. Do we have so I will count again for one, two, three to unmute and get an applaud. One, two, three. Now I invite the audience with questions or remarks. Yeah, hi Chunhun. Do you know what happens for list coloring? For immersion? Yeah. So the argument in my proof doesn't work for immersion at all because somehow I have to reduce the problem to somehow I have to I mean, somehow I have to identify furies and make the graph has only maximized. But the identified fereses cannot work for least the color. So I know nothing about that. But would you conjecture that the answer is roughly the same or you know? So first, so far we don't know the answer for listed coloring of anti-mesematic graphs. Possibly the answer equals Possibly the answer equals d plus one, like just because of the degeneracy argument. So I don't know. Thank you. More questions? So, if there are no further questions, we are closing today's session. I would like to give a warm applause to all the speakers today. One, two, three.
