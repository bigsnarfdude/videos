Era of big data, biobanks, computational biology. How does genetic epidemiology fit in? And this is a bit of my personal story in embracing the fact that I am a genetic epidemiologist and I shouldn't be persuaded to try to take on any of these other titles. Because I had, to be honest, when I was finishing my PhD and embarking on my postdoc, there was. Working on my postdoc, there were all these people doing what they called, you know, they were calling themselves data scientists, computational biologists. And I thought, oh, that all sounds really cool. And where does my epidemiology training and my genetic epidemiology training fit in? And it was really as I started my own lab and my own research as a PI that I realized that genetic epidemiology was fundamental to how I was approaching the questions and working with these data sets. And working with these data sets. And so I hope that flavor will come through in what I present to you today. Now, since this is a smallish group, and I know I haven't really been able to meet you all, so I am going to take a first slide to give you a little bit more about myself and my trajectory in getting to where I am. If I can advance my slides. There we go. So I'm a Canadian. I have an undergraduate degree from the University of Guelph, which is in Ontario. Of Guelph, which is in Ontario. I have a master's degree in epidemiology from the University of Ottawa. And at this point, I didn't have any children, I just had a dog. So you can see I would dress up my dog for Halloween as the frog prince. He had a little doggy girlfriend who was the princess. I have a PhD in epidemiology from the University of Toronto, and I had my first child during my PhD postdoctoral fellowship at Vanderbilt University. And I'm going to talk about a lot of the work that I did at Vanderbilt during that postdoc. Built during that postdoc over the next 30 minutes or so. And my second child was born while I was doing my postdocs. That's my daughter. And then after I started my PI position here in Vancouver, I actually had twins. So as somebody with a genetic background, having twins is just a really cool experience to see how nature and nurture plays out in front of you. They are fraternal twins, but just relating them and who they are to what we know about twins from a genetics perspective is really. About twins from a genetics perspective is really cool. And I will say that I'm happy to talk to anybody about anything I present to you all today. So, if you would like to talk to me about anything, any science or, you know, career-wise, I know there's some trainees in the audience, please, please reach out afterwards. Oh, and I would also just add that I did take some breaks between my training, working with different public health agency or, you know, big health data sets. Health data set-facing organizations. And I think that that will also come through in my talk today. So, by way of outline, I'm going to talk to you about some of the objectives and study designs used in genetic epidemiology studies. And forgive me if some of this is sort of well known to everybody in the room. I'm not quite sure what training expertise everybody has. It sounds like it's a bit of a broad background. So, just to get us all on the same page, I'm going to talk about. Same page. I'm going to talk about just basic genetic epidemiology study designs, and then I'm going to spend some time talking about post-GWAS analysis options, specifically some polygenic scores, as well as functional interpretation of GWAS findings. So, perhaps a silver lining of the pandemic is that epidemiology became much more of a household name. I know when I would tell people that I was an epidemiologist before. Tell people that I was an epidemiologist before the pandemic. I would often get confused as somebody who'd studied skin because of the similarity with the word epidermis. And then during the pandemic, we had this perception that epidemiologists were the ones that, and in fact, they were the ones who were telling us to social distance. And in actual fact, what epidemiologists do is a lot of data analysis, sitting at a desk and crunching numbers. More formally, epidemiology. More formally, epidemiology is the study of how often disease occurs in different groups of people and why. And importantly, it's not restricted to infectious disease. Now, genetic epidemiology, I should say, so I did my formal training in epidemiology, but increasingly did was part of training programs in genetic epidemiology in particular. So, genetic epidemiology is the bread and butter of what I do. It's the study of how genetic factors. It's the study of how genetic factors influence human traits and diseases in families and in populations. It's built on a tradition of rare single-gene diseases in family-based studies, which let me see, just move some screens around. So here on the right-hand side, you can see the single gene where we started in genetic epidemiology, looking at single gene diseases where. diseases where there's disease like sickle cell anemia, a single genetic variant driving the variability of risk in that trait. Much of what we study now in complex in genetic epidemiology is complex or multifactorial diseases and conditions and traits in population-based studies. For example, coronary artery disease, which is not determined by a single genetic variant, but rather polygen, it's a polygenic trait with multiple genetic variants contributing. Genetic trait with multiple genetic variants contributing to the risk across the genome. And major advances in genetic epidemiology have been driven by an explosion of biomedical data captured in biobanks over the last 15 years. And I know biobanks mean different things to different people. So I will say more formally for me, a biobank is a repository of biospecimens like blood from which you can develop genotype. Blood from which you can develop genotype data linked to phenotypic data, for example, data from questionnaires or electronic health records. And again, I know when I talk biobanks to different people, most people can be proud of a biobank that has a couple hundred people recruited because they're Huntington's disease patients, for example. And it's not to downplay the value of those kinds of biobanks. The types of biobanks that I'm interested in, though, are population level. In though, are population-level biobanks that are really that ascertain participants agnostic to disease status. So, really population-level, lots of different diseases and conditions. And I love these kinds of biobanks because they enable a data-driven approach to quantifying, characterizing, and understanding the relationships between biospecimens and the phenome. Biobanks that you might have heard of, the kinds of biobanks that I'm interested in, are the UK Biobank, for example. Biobank, for example, the 23andMe data set, which is genotype data linked to questionnaire phenotype data on millions of participants, as well as the PsychEMERGE Consortium, which you may not have heard of, but it is a network of clinical sites, mostly based in the US, that are using genetic data linked to electronic health records to try to advance precision psychiatry. And I'm going to describe some work that I've done with 23andMe and PsychEmerge over the course of this talk. Over the course of this talk, so a lot of what we do as genetic epidemiologists is starting with and building off of genome-wide association studies. And forgive me if this is old hat to you all, but just to have everybody on the same page. In a GWAS, what we do is we start with data collection in a group of people, genotype. There's an element of quality control. Most often, Of quality control, most often related to genetic ancestry. You do genotype imputation, and then a test association between genetic variants and a phenotype of interest. Because we're so worried about false positives, we do meta-analysis and replication. And as you may be well familiar with a figure like this, GWAS have identified thousands of associations over. Thousands of associations over the last 15 years. So, this is an animation of associations discovered by GWAS, where each vertical bar is a chromosome, each dot that's exploding there is an association between a different phenotype and a SNP on a chromosome. And you can see this is not terribly up to date, but even by 2019, we've got this explosion of associations between SNP genotype and phenotype. And phenotype. And it's probably too small to see, but the color dots, each of the different colors are representing a different phenotype group. And I think one of the amazing things about GWAS is that you can do a GWAS of just about anything. And next, I'm going to tell you a story about a GWAS that I did of loneliness. And when this project was first pitched to me, I was surprised actually, because I didn't think that loneliness would have a genetic component. I hadn't actually thought about it. Genetic component. I hadn't actually thought about it, but spoiler, it does. And let me tell you first a little bit about loneliness. So, loneliness is a feeling of discontent with social connections. It's distinct from objectively measured social isolation. So, loneliness is a subjective feeling. 22% of adults are chronically lonely, and there are unclear sex differences. And loneliness, it actually is a big risk factor for. A big risk factor for future health problems. It is associated with a 38% increased risk of early mortality. And I mean, we are all much more aware of loneliness as a result of the pandemic, but even before the pandemic, public health agencies were aware of how problematic this was, the UK even going as far as appointing a minister for loneliness. I want to contrast loneliness with major depressive disorder or feelings of depression, which Or feelings of depression, which is a discontent with life in general, has a 17% lifetime prevalence. There is a clear sex difference, it's twice as common in women versus men. And depression is associated, or major depressive disorder is associated with a 71% increased risk of early mortality. Loneliness can lead to depression, but they are distinct traits. They're only co-occurring about 40% of the time. Percent of the time. So we worked with data from the UK Biobank and 23andMe to conduct one of the first GWAS of loneliness in just over 500,000 people. And we discovered 16 independent and significant loci. So this is a lot of what we do, these kinds of GWAS, but this is just the start. A panel that I hadn't shown when I first showed you this pipeline was this panel H. Pipeline was this panel H. This panel H is where I think a lot of the real fun begins. Once you've discovered your, once you have your GWAS results in hand, now what? What do you do next? And this is also where I think biobanks really shine. So moving on to section two, we're going to talk now about those post-GWAS analysis options. So, looking at our results from the GWAS, we were asking ourselves: why are those feelings of loneliness associated with a 38% increased risk of early mortality? And could we use these GWAS findings to try to answer that question? For example, could we answer whether this was due to genetic pleiotropy or was this just comorbidity? Was it just comorbidity between feeling lonely and conventional, you know, some health behaviors that increased your risk? Health behaviors that increased your risk for early mortality writ large. And so, for this follow-up work, we used data in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Biobank. So this is work that I did while I was a postdoc at Vanderbilt. And working with this biobank was just a dream for an epidemiologist and especially a genetic epidemiologist because we had this rich clinical data, which you can see in that left-hand side there. See in that left-hand side there. Clinic notes, medication data, lab reports, demographic data, registry data, vital statistics, billing codes, and any outpatient encounters were fed into this research data warehouse that contained 2.8 million patient EHRs or electronic health records that covered 10 years on average. And about 10% of those were linked to a DNA sample. So, what we did to follow up this loneliness GWAS result was first to compute polygenic scores in our Vanderbilt biobank. Polygenic scores, in case you're not familiar with them, they're allelic sums weighted by effect estimates from a GWAS. So, we took our results from our GWAS on the left-hand side there, where each line is a SNP in the GWAS, and the effect estimate relating the SNP to Relating the SNP to risk of feeling lonely. And then for each patient in the biobank or each participant in the biobank, we computed their polygenic score for loneliness by taking the effect estimate for SNP1 times the number of copies of SNP1 for that particular participant, and then adding on the effect estimate for SNP2 times the number of copies of SNP2, and so on. And there's different ways of building a polygenic score. A lot of them differ in how you. A lot of them differ in how you select the different genetic variants into the score. And I won't go into that right now. I'll just keep it very high level and say that polygenic scores quantify an individual's polygenic risk for a trait, and they can be calculated on anyone with genotype data. So just to be clear, we didn't have any estimates of loneliness on participants in the Vanderbilt Biobank. We were just computing their polygenic susceptibility or their genetic susceptibility to feeling lonely. To feeling lonely. Now, from that polygenic score, we computed, we did a phenome-wide association study, or a FEWAS for short. And just to relate a FEWAS to a GWAS. So in a GWAS on the left-hand side, as you all now by now know from what I've said, a GWAS examines associations between specific phenotypes and genetic variants across the genome. And a FEWAS, And a FIWAS on the right-hand side is the inverse of that. So you've flipped the GWAS on its head. A FEWAS examines the associations between specific genetic variants or a polygenic score, that's what we did, and a large number of different phenotypes or the phenome. And the FUAS is really powerful because it can help distinguish comorbidity from genetic pleiotropy. So, this was the FUAS of our polygenic score. Of our polygenic score for loneliness in the Vanderbilt Biobank. This VIWAS included 18,000, just over 18,000 individuals, 897 fee codes. So these are just different phenotypes captured in the electronic health record. And our FIWAS was adjusted for age, sex, ancestry, principal components, genotyping batch. And I should say that this was an analysis we just did in Europeans because at that time we didn't have the genetic data QC'd for the African Americans in Vancouver. For the African Americans in Vanderbilt. So, from the PWAS, you can see some results that you would expect. A polygenic susceptibility to loneliness was associated with different mental health disorders here on the left-hand or left in pink. But we also saw this equally high signal for associations with different circulatory system conditions like ischemic heart disease, coronary atherosclerosis, heart failure. Heart failure. And we wondered if this could explain the increased mortality associated with loneliness. Specifically, we were wondering whether this association with the polygenic score was due to genetic pleiotropy, or could it be due to comorbidity with non-genetic risk factors shared between loneliness and coronary artery disease, like smoking? So, to try to answer those questions, we looked at We looked at whether controlling for conventional heart disease risk factors, whether it killed the signal or attenuated the association between the polygenic score for loneliness and coronary artery disease. We had defined coronary artery disease using a machine learning algorithm in the EHR. So, in this forest plot, you're going to see a series of points appear. And just to orient you, so this is the odds ratio for coronary artery disease associated. For coronary artery disease associated with the polygenic score in our minimally adjusted model. And we controlled for things that we knew to be associated with heart disease, like depressive symptoms, BMI, hypertension, smoking, highest level of education, type 2 diabetes, a polygenic score for coronary artery disease, HDL cholesterol levels, LDL cholesterol levels, and triglycerides. And adding each of these covariates. And adding each of these covariates to a multivariable model didn't attenuate this association between the polygenic score and risk of coronary artery disease. So from that, we were able to say this is probably not due to comorbidity, or at least not that we can detect. This is not due to comorbidity, and perhaps this is actually evidence of genetic piiotropy. We next wanted to see whether this was something specific about. Whether this was something specific about loneliness, or is this just depression writ large? Because we know that depression and loneliness are co-occurring, and we know that there is a genetic correlation between depression and loneliness. So, what we did next is we accounted for genetic risk factors that were shared between major depressive disorder and loneliness using a specific statistical tool. And so, here, this is a similar sort of plot as you saw on the previous page, a similar forest plot. And these are associations between a poly. And these are associations between a polygenic score for depression, in this case, polygenic score for major depressive disorder, once we removed the correlation between genetic risk factors for depression and genetic risk factors for loneliness. And when we removed that correlation, there was no association for polygenic score for depression. Conversely, when we look specifically at the genetic risk factors for loneliness that were distinct from the genetic risk factors for depression, Genetic risk factors for depression, we still saw this association, and in fact, we saw a stronger effect in females than we did in males. So, this was telling us that genetic factors that were unique to loneliness increased coronary artery disease risk, while those unique to major depressive disorder did not. And I mean, we could, we did in our discussion about this paper, we talked a lot about the brain-heart connection and dying of a broken heart. And it was really neat to see some of those age. See some of those age-old adages play out in the data in front of us. And I said at the beginning that I was a bit surprised that loneliness had a genetic component, but if you think about it from an evolutionary perspective, it makes a lot of sense. Humans are among many social species who have evolved to depend on each other, and loneliness serves as a painful alert that one is on the social perimeter. And loneliness has a lot of known physiological effects, such as triggering depressive symptoms, disrupting sleep, raising blood pressure, and activating the HPA axis. So given these things, I think that together what we found in the biobank makes a lot of sense in terms of the increased risk of coronary artery disease being driven by some of these genetic risk factors for loneliness. Now, any discussion of a polygenic score wouldn't be complete without acknowledging this poor transferability across ancestries. And I'm really happy that the speaker following me is going to talk about some data coming out of some countries that are poorly represented in existing GWASs. And I have a student in my lab who may be known to some of you. I think she said she knew some of the people on the program who is tackling this issue of poor transferability across ancestries using different. Across ancestries using different data sets in our lab. And then, of course, I was able to touch a little bit upon the difference between the biological sexes in the work that I've just presented, but this is again something that across all of science, we need to do a better job of addressing. And so, finally, the last part of my talk, I want to talk about functional, how do we functionally interpret GWAS findings? And unfortunately, we didn't go to Findings. Unfortunately, we didn't go to that next step with the loneliness GWAS. So I'm going to depart a little bit from talking about loneliness and talk about some more recent work that we've been doing in the lab to do functional interpretation of GWAS findings. And I suspect many of you are well aware that a minority of the genome is protein coding. The majority is involved in gene regulation. And therefore, it shouldn't be that surprising that most GWAS associations are actually found outside. Associations are actually found outside of protein-coding regions. Therefore, when we have the results of our GWAS, one of our big challenges is interpretation. How do we know the function of the loci that we identify in GWAS? How do we know how they function in specific cell types, tissues, developmental stages, and environments? To say that same thing more visually, what we do in a GWAS is we look at that. What we do in a GWAS is we look at that gray arrow. We look at the association between the genome, genotype, and the phenome. But there are so many different ways that genotype can affect phenotype, as we know from all these different omic technologies, the epigenome, the transcriptome, the proteome, the metabolome. And the challenge to working with these different kinds of data sets is that they are specific to cell types, tissues, developmental stages, and environments. So, one of the projects that I started in my lab after I became a PI was to look at a tissue that had really been poorly represented in large-scale ohmic efforts to date. And this is the placenta. Now, I think the placenta is super cool, not just because I have delivered four different placentas over the course of my journey as a parent. I just think it's a fascinating tissue that is so often over. Fascinating tissue that is so often overlooked. It's discarded, routinely discarded at birth, even though we have epidemiological and genetic evidence that healthy life trajectories start at conception. A lot of the GWAS signals that are identified, for example, in psychiatric traits, I work a lot with psychiatric traits, a lot of those GWAS signals are actually for SNPs that regulate genes that are active prenatally. So we know this is a time of particular susceptibility. And the placenta is an accessible tissue. And the placenta is an accessible tissue that we know very little about. So I have a PhD student in my lab, Will, who studied MQTL in the placenta. So he looked at the relationship between SNPs, genetic variants, and methylation in both sexes combined, as well as in males and females separately. And once he had identified those MQTLs, he combined those MQTLs with results from different GWAS of childhood. Results from different GWAS of childhood traits, 19 traits to be specific. You can see those different traits here along the x-axis. So we grouped them in terms of neuropsychiatric traits, immune-related traits, and growth-related traits. So these are all different GWASes that we were able to pull data on. And he used LD score regression, for those of you who are familiar with these kinds of tools, to quantify enrichment of the placental MQTLs in these different genes. QTLs in these different GWAPs results where values above one quantify enrichment, so more overlaps than you would expect by chance. And this plot has a lot going on because it's got both cross-sex values and male and female-specific MQTL results. So I'll first draw your attention here to the one on the meta-analysis results where we combined across the different traits. And we were hoping to see an enrichment for neuropsychiatric traits because that is primarily what Traits because that is primarily what my lab studies. But in fact, what we saw was a lot of enrichment in immune-related traits and growth-related traits. So, this was telling us, oops, sorry, that the genetic variants that controlled DNA methylation in the placenta were some of them were the same genetic variants that conferred risk for immune-related traits and growth-related traits in childhood. And these would be things like type 1 diabetes. And these would be things like type 1 diabetes, childhood asthma, and hay fever. So these would be different kinds of allergies. And then you can read the growth traits here. And here we've got preeclampsia, which is a placentally mediated condition. Unfortunately, this GWAS was just not very well powered for us to find an association. So once we had these enrichment results, we also did a colloquialization analysis. So this was using Bayesian statistical methods to determine if Statistical methods to determine if the same genetic variants underlie both the GWAS and the MQTL signals. So, this is the result of, this is to give you a flavor of how we do that overlay. You can see an example here on the left-hand side where on the top panel here are the results from the child onset asthma GWAS, where the y-axis is the p-value for association between a SNP and risk of child onset asthma. And risk of child homset asthma. And then the panels underneath are the results for the different MQTLs, either cross-sex, female-stratified, or male-stratified. Again, the y-axis is the p-value for how strongly a SNP is an MQTL. And color-coded here are posterior probability of the same SNP being responsible for both the MQTL association and the GWAS association in this particular SNP. In this particular SNP, in all sexes combined, females and males was explaining the GWAS association as well as an MQTL at that locus. When we looked across all of our results and summed all the collocalization events together, this is what is shown here on the right-hand side. And you can see that even though we didn't get an enrichment writ large, for example, for neuropsychiatric traits. Psychiatric traits, we do see that there are some co-localized CPG sites. So these are CPG sites that have an MQTL that is also associated with schizophrenia, for example, in a GWAS or child-onset asthma in a GWAS. And all of these CPG sites would be worthy of further follow-up to try to tease apart what exactly is going on at that locus. So, in sum, big data. So in sum, big data, biobanks, and high throughput omic technologies make it a great time to be a genetic epidemiologist. So I'm now quite proud to say that I am a genetic epidemiologist. And if you didn't take away much more than that, if you don't take away much more, I do want this point number two to come across is that these differences across race, ethnicity, and ancestry and between biological sexes are an important next frontier across all of science. And the real fun and challenges begin after GWAS results are collected. And finally, I'd just like to thank my team here at UBC and some of my collaborators at UBC, as well as the team of collaborators I worked with at Vanderbilt University and just beyond as part of the Loneliness Project and the PsychEMERGE Consortium. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Jessica. I'm not sure how much of the hop losses are heard there, but yeah, you could see them at least. Go into questions now. Questions for Jessica here. Robert, gentleman, here will ask you a question. Hi, great talk. Talk. One of the challenges, I think, around PRSs is that they basically get built from a GWAS, right? And so the PRS for, say, type 2 diabetes that's been adjusted for BMI looks really different than one that hasn't. And so you sort of have this potential challenge around your PRS scores that you're bringing in may or may not have been adjusted for things, and depending on. Been adjusted for things, and depending on where you get them from, they may or may not tell you what the model was, right? And then you still want to think about whether you should adjust for those subsequently, right? So if you, for example, had a PRS for your loneliness that had been already adjusted or a piece had been adjusted for BMI, then adjusting for it afterwards seems like it's going to be problematic. And I just wonder if you've thought about those challenges. Those challenges, how you deal with them? Yeah, yeah, no, for sure. I mean, most often the GWAS are just done with, the GWAS themselves are done with minimal covariate adjustment, which then means that, but I guess I should say that is not, it's not to say that the participants in the underlying GWAS might be enriched. Might be enriched for different co-occurring conditions. So, for example, when you do the GWAS of BMI, you're going to, just because BMI and type 2 diabetes are co-occurring, you're going to be capturing some genetic variants that are also associated with type 2 diabetes. And I have a mentor who likes to refer to this as phenotypic hitchhiking. And I don't think we have a good sense of how this phenotypic hitchhiking could be affecting associations or what we can do about it. Associations, or what we can do about it, as well as how different cohorts that contribute to the GWAS over time might be changing associations. So, again, coming back to coronary artery disease, an example, a GWAS that was run on a cohort before the widespread use of statins would be capturing very different associations than a GWAS that's run now, where statin use is so widespread. And that, those sort of cohort effects and phenotypic hedgehoging, I think. Some phenotypic hedgehoging. I think these are all artifacts that you need genetic epidemiologists to put in a plug to try to tease apart. One of the tools that we do like to use is SEM-based-based approaches to try to pull apart some of that genetic correlation. So, the example that I provided with loneliness and depression, we were able to condition the loneliness GWAS results on the GWAS of depression. Of depression. So we can kind of get at it that way. But I agree that it's messy and it's less than ideal that the polygenic scores explain so little of the phenotypic variability despite so much effort over the last 15 years to develop these polygenic scores and GWAS. Perfect. Thank you. Any other questions from here? Yeah, there's another question here from Andrew. Yeah, there's another question here from Andrew. Hi, fascinating talk. I was wondering if you could talk, describe a little bit more about the sampling frame for the Vanderbilt. Like, were these patients that were hospitalized or were they, yeah, where did these patients come from? Yeah, so Vanderbilt for a number of years, probably for the, so the biobank now is probably about 25 years old. It's probably one of the most. It's probably one of the most one of the original hospital-based biobanks that adopted this kind of design. And I think for the first 15 plus years, had a default opt-in sampling strategy. So when you used the hospital, if you had blood drawn by default, you were opted into the biobank. And if there was blood left over from that routine blood draw, the blood that was drawn as part of your routine clinical care. Drawn as part of your routine clinical care, then the blood would, the DNA would have been extracted and banked. Seven to 10 years ago, the NIH changed its strategy. NIH changed its protocols and ethics strategies, and it had to be a default opt-out. You had to actively opt into the Vanderbilt Biobank. And they actually didn't see a big drop-off in participants when participants had to actively. Participants had to actively opt in, and they made it super easy. I was a patient at Vanderbilt at that time, I used their healthcare system, and it was just such an easy, seamless process. So the sampling frame was really anybody who used the hospital and had blood drawn as part of routine clinical care. Those are the people who are in the biobank. In terms of prioritizing those for genotyping, because only a subset of those people in the biobank actually have genotype data generated, right? Genotype data generated right now. There was a big push, the biggest push for genotyping was based on richness of the EHR. So people who had, I think, like three or more engagements with the healthcare system over five years was the bare minimum to be included. They were prioritized also based on non-European, I think it was so non-white race ethnicity, because at that point we didn't have genetic data. Because at that point, we didn't have genetic data. So it's a bit of a hodgepodge sampling frame. But hopefully, that answers your question. Yeah, I guess to follow up, I mean, the other mechanism I could see as far as how heart disease would be associated with loneliness is like you've got congestive heart failure, you're hospitalized, and you lose contact with your social circle. And I guess, I mean, it seems like the like adjustments you get at maybe partially would get at that, but is there another model you considered that would? At that, but is there another model you considered that would more explicitly try to rule out this other mechanism? Yeah, I mean, at one point, we tried to think about whether we could pull data on whether people were married or not, their marriage status. I would like to say, though, that feelings of loneliness are distinct from social isolation. So, and I forget the stats off the top of my head, but you can. Stats off the top of my head, but you can feel lonely. And there's a good chunk of people who feel lonely, even when they are well connected socially. So I think it's more of this, the trait that we analyzed, there's perhaps more of a biological rationale why it would have a genetic component as opposed to social isolation could be co-occurring with lots of other genetically determined traits. And that gets into some complex behavioral genetics. And that gets into some complex behavioral genetics that maybe is beyond what you're asking right now. Thanks. Thank you very much, Jessica. That was an amazing talk. Very interesting. And yeah, thank you for joining. Thanks. Thank you. Okay, and now I'm
