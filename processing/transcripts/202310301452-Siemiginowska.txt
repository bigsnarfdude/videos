I was going to talk about astro statistics with small data. Thank you, thank you. And yes, I have a lot of images, so this is why I made the room dark. And hopefully you will enjoy this next 25 minutes, 30 minutes. I have a lot of slides, so maybe I go quickly through some of them. And Pauline, thank you. Pauline asked me to talk about Nin asked me to talk about astrostatistics with small data. And this is the image, X-ray image from Chandra, and you can see that purple is basically zero, and little blue squares are the points where we detect one count, two counts, or many counts. So this is the example of low counts X-ray universe. But what is small data? Small data. It depends on what you think, right? Some people think that you focus on one astronomical source and that will be your small data because you're looking at one source. But this one source could be very complex and you may have very complicated situations and the big data like radio observations, etc. So there could be a lot of data and optical spectroscopy, JWSD, Spectroscopy, JWSD, contains a lot of data. So, even in one cell, you may have a very complex problem. And even X-ray signal could be complicated. Then you ask if it's small number of observations or small size of sample means small data, maybe. And it depends on your problem. So I will cut. So, I will talk about counts data because for me this is my X-ray and gamma-ray era when I worked, and this is where I look at small data, small number of counts. In some situations, we get maybe 6,000 counts in the whole data set, which is small. That's water. That's large, okay. 6,000 is large, yes, because. 6,000 is large, yes, because my sources, as you see, can have three counts. But I start with this example where we ask why X-rays and what is X-rays. This is for our statistics here in the audience. So in visible light, you see stars and you see some sludges of the molecular gas, warm temperature gas. In the non-visible X-ray light, you have complex structures. You have complex structures. So, in this supernova ring dance observed with Chandra, you actually have very complex emission and colors highlight different elements. You put this together to actually go back and understand what type of explosion resulted in this emission, and understand the physics of the emission. Of the emission at the stages, etc. And the X-ray universe is very rich. So we have plenty of sources which emit X-rays. Even solar systems result in X-ray emission. You have emission from Jupiter, which comes from the poles of Ju Jupiter. But you can also go through quasars, high-nature quasars, and you see this X-ray radiation which is extending. Which is extending from the point source, which is here. So quasar is unresolved, but then you have this relativistic gels which I need X-rays. In this case, and here you have very complex structures which are huge, but they are megaparsecs in scale. And this is all X-ray gas. X-ray emission comes from hot gas, so something has to heat up this gas, and you can heat up to this. And uh you can heat them to these medium degrees or you can accelerate particles to emit X-rays in magnetic fields and you have to have these very energetic physical processes to actually go back and generate this image. So for us astronomers, the question is what process, what physics is behind this structure? What type of physical events we observe? Physical events we observe. But these are nice press-release images. They are highly processed and the real data doesn't look like that. Maybe this is real actually. This is the observation of CC273. And this is also real observation, very deep exposure of Miss Chandra of this X-ray cluster, person A cluster. So X-ray data. So, X-ray data, yeah, this is nice, but this is the real data. So, we collect photons and we count every single photon. So, in optical, Pauline was talking about detecting light. Here we detect each photon. And every photon has the location on the sky from which it arrived, has time of arrival and energy associated with it. So, we have this information. So we have this information, but some observations have to take a long, long time. So in this Chandra image, very deep image of the part of the sky, in the north and part of the sky, the faintest source has one X-ray photon arriving in four days. So this is very small data, and you have to wait four days to get one source, one count from One comes from the faintest source in the image. And of course, these are the most interesting sources because they emit faint, actually, these are all sources which are far away in the universe at high redshifts. And we wait four days or 16 days or a month to have the information which can tell us about the physics of those sources. So X-ray data analysis. So, X-ray data analysis. Okay. We know for some counts, we know we have event files which collect all the information from the detectors. And then we modify this data to generate the images and spectra of selected regions in the sky. Usually, till now, actually, we lose the information and we project into one or two dimensions. Or two dimensions. So spectra is, you know, you send region in the sky and you bend the event in energy to generate the spectrum. The same is the image. You collect the currents in particular part of the sky and see how the source looks. What's important here is what Vines said during the introduction is the calibration data which comes to play are very important because we To play are very important because we're looking at the same sources. So, this is repeating what I just said: how do we get the images, spectrum, and light curves. So, this is the, again, Casay, supernova remnant. This is the energy spectrum of the entire image of the supernova remnant. And this is split in the colours. So, if I select the It in the colour. So, if I select the red energy band here, I will get this image of the supernova. If I looked at the blue, I will get this image. So, you see that the images which are selected and pinned look differently and they also highlight different emission processes. So, we can find this. So, the energy spectrum is for selected region. For selected region, then I take the red region and I look at this structure there, and this is my energy spectrum. Light curve will be the time series, which I don't have the example here, but you will look at the small time bands and look at the arrival time of each photons at given energy at that time. Or you collapse the energy and say in this red part of the spectrum, you know. Part of the spectrum, you know, how often I see the propensity I think. So, this is the energy spectra. Case was very nice tectonic, a lot of counts. This is what we see typically. This is the channel where you detect the counts, and you can see that it's one or two counts in every channel of the In every channel of the detector, and then there is this magic we have so-called redistribution matrix where you convert the photon channel into the energy. So there is a probability of given photon and given energy arriving in a given channel. So we get the spectrum in the physical units, because that's what the source M is. What the source emits. It emits in energy space, not in channel space. And then this is the sort of photon numbers per different energy. So in analysis, what we have is this model fitting, which is forward folding fitting, where we assume the astrophysical model have LMF and ALF design calculation. Decide the calculation data and then go back to the count space when we calculate our statistics. And you have to use the appropriate fit statistic estimator in order to fit the data. And historically, there have been, you know, of course, X-square statistics which is using optical data. And historically, this is what X-ray astronomers used. Was used, but it was found that you're using incorrect statistics of Poisson data, when you get into this low-carbon image, you get biases. So people modify the statistics and the formulation of Poisson likelihoods by cache, C-STAT, and W-STAT was actually used a lot recently. There is still a work which is being done by. A work which is being done by Jang here, Jang Chen and Max Bonamente, on the statistical side of CSTAT, which is very interesting. And I don't know if Jang probably won't talk about this at her talk, but you can talk to Jang and find out maybe. Because that's actually an interesting part for statisticians, not for astronomers, because astronomers just want to have an estimate. Have an estimator and fit statistics and just get the astrophysics numbers out. So I think I will focus more on images because that's more exciting. Spectra gives you a lot of information about physics. That's when you look at the images, this is where the exciting thinking is happening. So X-ray images are not great. Great. I can tell you that the highest resolution X-ray image is obtained by Chandra, and Chandra has been observing the X-ray sky for the last 22 years. It's getting old, and there is no replacement. So the archives which we have are the archives which you can work with, and this is where the problems are. In the future, maybe we will have a new X-ray satellite, but it won't be at the same result. It won't be at the same resolution, so there will be problems of maybe understanding what's behind unresolved image. But this is the Tantra point spread function. So in the center you have perfect point spread function, so the source is very small. If you go off center, so this is 10 arcseconds for astronomers, this is 5 arcminutes, 10 arc minutes, 15 arcminutes off-center, you can Minutes of center, you can see that the pound spread function is growing and it's getting worse and it also elongates. So, for the images which are large and you want to analyze large image, you have to understand the shape of the PSF across the detector. There are these issues which I listed here in detecting and identifying low-surface brightness structures, resolved sources. Resolve sources, included fields, finding source boundaries, and certainties. I probably get to it in a little more detail. But what do we want to get in the images? And I put this as an example also what type of analysis astronomers want to do with this data. So this is an example from Helen Russell's paper in 2022, where he was looking at this cluster. He was looking at this cluster, that's one of these mega panseg ocular pansexic scale structures in X-ray, and looked at unsharped masks to determine where the interesting changes in the intensity of this cluster are, because they highlight the change in the properties of the medium, the shocks which are hitting the medium and evolution of that structure. Evolution of that structure. And then what she does is to divide the image, this is raw image, this is color, this is raw, divide into the sectors and then calculate the distribution of photons along the sectors. Look for this change. You know, I was supposed to use this, right? But I don't know how. Maybe it's showing you. Oh, there it is. Oh, there it is. So, this is the distribution of these counts along these structures. And what's interesting is this transition from this shape into this shape, because it tells you something about this physics which happens to the medium. So, the problem with analysis is related to the fact that you combine multiple observations when you do this analysis. So, it's not one, it's like many. It's like many for many days in different chunks. You have different background levels, and you have to select the regions, which is kind of arbitrary. You're looking for these interesting structures already. You do the model fitting to this shape. And the question, I mean, we know that Pan screen function impacts our measurements. The question here is: do we, can we ignore the PSF effects when we're looking at PSF effects when we're looking at that structure change. Maybe we can. It depends on the interesting questions which we asked. But sometimes you want to be able to look at this exact transition. If you, let's say, compare this data to the radial data where you have a higher resolution and you want to match on detail on the acceleration properties of the source. Of the source. So this one. There is more. I mean, these are just the images, different types of images, where you're looking at the large-scale structure, you have chandral data, you smooth the data, because if you have low counts, you don't necessarily see what's interesting. So you smooth the data, the same here, and you use unsharp mask. So it's kind of fixed look at the data. But this is. But this is what it is. This is small data, right? That's my source artwork and the simulated point source images, assuming point split function model for a point source with 100 counts. And this was the source on axis. One of the squares is my source. Can you tell me which one? So, you know, the question is like, is this count on this second? Are this significant compared to others? Because this is my source and I'm looking for this extension in my source, right? So I don't know. So five of them are sampled for the PSF. Yeah, these are the PSF samples and this is the data. But you also have multiple, like every event has some energy related to that. That's right. Yes, so the PSF reflects that. So when you do the simulation, So, when you do the simulation, you assume the spectral distribution for energy of your information. That's right. That's right. There is a little bit more because of course. Yeah, no, you do, because yes, even in real data, you have different response in the soft energy process, high energy, different PSF. So, yes, you can do this three-dimensional analysis here. Analysis here. But this is what, you know, when you propose to observation, you're like, oh, you know, I will get a lot of counts, and this is what you get. And then what do you do, right? Actually, I should say that this is the source at Redshift 6.2. It's one of the highest redshift quasars we observed in X-rays. There is no data now, because this was 30 kiloseconds, now there is another Is another 60 on this source. So there is maybe something here. Still question, right? Yeah, I'm just looking at the time. So small structures on this PSF scales, right? How do we understand whether there is something there or not? And I say for some. And I say for some countries, many pixels, many empty pixels, we want to know if there is diffuse emission in this case. So this is the example again of the quasar with some extension here. There is no counts and we have the simulated image here. So there are questions, but we do have to look at this PSF and some So we did this one of the algorithms which took a long time to actually develop. This is multi-scale image reconstruction called Lira and the example of hierarchical Bayesian model where we look at the We look at the input, which is just an assumption of a point source with the baseline model here. So it's point source in the background. This is our data and there is point squared function image. And we have this LCMC draws from the posterior, this multi-scalar image. And you can see that some of the pixels stay in the same place. The main point source. The main point source, this baseline multi source removed. So you're trying to understand whether there is this, oh, sorry, it's complicated, whether this is significant. So that's the mean of this realization. Posterior mean is here. So there is some structure there. I'll just go quickly. So you want to understand whether this structure is significant. Structure is significant, and we know from radio that this there is a radio jet, so we can actually determine whether or not the feature which we observed in X-rays is significant or not. And we define the test statistics and do a lot of simulations, assuming null and the observed test statistics is plotted here. And for a given threshold, we could say whether or not. We could say whether or not the source has been detected in this case. Alright, and then the next step was understanding whether there is any source boundary. Without knowing that there is a radial jet, can we determine the optimal boundary of the source? And again, this is starting with posterior mean from ER and posterior cross. There is the next. There is the next step looking at Ising prior and trying to see whether we can determine the boundary of the source and find the optimal boundary, which is plotted there at the end. So if anybody is interested in details, we can discuss. But what I wanted to show is the next generation. The next generation algorithm, which is being right now developed and finalized by Axel Darnard, is called the Jolly Decarn joint likelihood, the convolution. And this is sort of the first look at the ML method, maybe, machine learning method, because what Axel did, he starts with forward model. This is the illustration of the model, where we have the flux model. The flux model, PSF, flux times PSF, and exposure time. And this is the image. And then we compare the image to counts. And this is adding Poisson Laws. So what's assumed is that we have the patch prior, which is the example plotted, illustrated here, which is the Gaussian mixture model of these little patches, eight patches. And you retrain those patches on the images and get a combination of those. And in this example patch, the combination of these three is the best representation of that patch. And in application to Chandra data, this is very nice because we're looking at the supernova 1E0102, which is plotted here. Just plot it here, and when this is the count image of the supernova, and this is the convolved image, and you know, in the top is the zone counts, the entire susound filaments, and the ventral points, which is here. So, this is coming. I think Axel will be ready to finalize the paper in a couple of weeks. Alright, I don't have time to go through all these other things. There is more, so we can talk about it later, but I wanted to highlight these astrostatistics organizations and student paper competition. When is the student paper competition, Casey? Is it a question for you or? When is it? When is the dead time? Because it should be that hasn't been determined yet, but it will be in early December and announced. Early December and announced quite soon. So, students pay attention to the deadline. And then, this is astrostatistics news. This is our October news, and you can subscribe by going, actually going to this page, to this link. Subscribe there. Let's see, there was the I thought I had the line. Oh, there it is. Some uh some draw uh what I was talking about. What I was talking about briefly. So we have low counts, X-ray spectra in X-rays and sparse images. I didn't say anything about the light curves, which is a different challenge altogether. And then we started to look at this full multi-domain analysis where encountered fields you can use the full information. Information to separate sources and even look for the changes in the images, so for flaring sources. And what's happening is that, as you can see, there is more of you here than 20 years ago. We had meetings twenty years ago at high energy division meetings, and there were ten people maybe in the room. The rule. Now it's more, so it's good that it's growing. And of course, this application of national engineering and AI medals is happening and will be big, which is nice. I think for me, I said at lunch to George, I guess, that when we were 20 years ago, when David published Bayesian method for, or Bayesian model for analysis of X-ray spectra, people were asking. Of X-ray spectra, people were asking why. Why do you have to do this very complicated modeling of this central data? And of course, 20 years later, Bayesian and MCMC is what you do. So 20 years from now, everybody will look at ML and AI. So there you go. This is what you will do. Thank you. Time for a couple of quick questions before the break. Your number from the deep field was really astonishing to me. How can you possibly differentiate one X-ray photon in four days from the background? Yeah, no, it is possible actually when you look at the images for solar and background you have to accumulate enough information and then you know this is Formation, and then you know, this is very long exposure. So, at the end, you have more photons at that location than the background coming there. And also the energy. So, I don't know how many exact photons arrived because the steep images were a few megaseconds. So, it's not, I mean, if you had four counts, that wouldn't be enough. And did you know this, like Did you know the source position and spectrum of the priority? Or let's just? No, no, no, because so you know, before Tanga, the sky look, X-ray sky looked very different because the resolution wasn't there. So Einstein, HRI in the well early eighties had similar resolutions, maybe, yeah, when you look at the old images. When you look at the old images, you will see the supernova and that puts similar resolution, but it didn't have enough collecting area. So you didn't have very good daytime and also a very narrow energy range. And we didn't know. I mean, if you go to the 90s and look at Rossad-Askar observations, there's not much of, I mean. Oh, I mean people didn't know what we were fighting when uh channel was launched. So it's really also uh it's like you know, a lot of physics was learned from channel. Just to give a sense, if you remember the numbers, it was one count every four days. Yeah. And it was about 28 days? Yeah, something. So you're talking about on orders seven or uh eight counts? I can probably miss case. Counts? Nine, probably, in this case, yeah. Yeah, that's probably on top of the actual background. Yeah. So, uh, I ACES Essence or ACES. So it's probably 15, probably like 15 background counts. And that's what's tracking region. 28 days. Yeah, 28 days. It's very. No, no background for point sources. If you want to get a structure, extend the structure, then Structure, extend the structure, then it's a different story. But on sources, because of the PSF, Chandra PSF, if they are on access, they are within two pixels, they say, which is very low for the difficulty. It's something like a count every megacond for some of them. And so it is very, very small. So you're looking for that small excess on top. You don't know a priori which of the, let's say, your net photons are. Let's say your net photons were 25, and you don't know which of those 25 were the background in which worked, although you could then do some causability based on that, based on the special stuff that I just picked at. I think if there's further questions, we can ask them during the break. But thank you again, Anita. I know. The question is what are you doing?
