Thank you, Junior, Robert, and Terry for the invitation. And yeah, I decided I will try to explain what I mean, I wanted to give a complete overview what we know about non-semi-simple vertex tensor categories, but of course that is too much for two hours. But so I'm a little bit selective. Little bit selective, but I hope you'll get a good feeling. So, I started here with already preparing the slide a little bit. So, in general, if we have a VOA, we of course will ask a few questions and what do we want to understand? We would like to understand representation theory of the VOA. So, this means we, in the very first place, we would like to restrict to modules of a Would like to restrict to modules of a certain type and ask ourselves: can we classify them? Can we find a complete list of simple modules of this type? Can we understand all possible extensions, etc. And once we understand what modules we have, we next would like to understand whether we can give these modules some structure, like a vertex tensor category, and then whether this is even, for example, a rigid category. A rigid category can we determine the fusion rules? Can we understand more? And finally, it turns out, in particular, then the non-semi-sample categories over the last year have appeared very prominently in, I would say, higher dimensional physics and higher dimensional quantum field theory. And this means also in higher dimensional topological field theories. So I would probably only if you ask me questions, I will say. Only if you ask me questions, I will say much more to this. And so I decided to split this talk into a few sections. First, I will recall what is known about the best type of VOAs. So they will then lead to finite tensor categories. Then I will tell you how I view the moduli space of VOAs, what type of VOAs can possibly be. VOAs, what type of UAs can possibly do we know? Once I've told you that, I will go to SL2, right? And I think it's simpler than SL2 to illustrate how complicated already SL2 is. And then I will say a little bit more what kind of categories exist and how well are we able to establish vertex tensor category structure. So I would like to say that I learned an enormous amount of Enormous amount of this by working with Jinwei, Shashank, and Robert. And in particular, on the last point, over the last years, we had at least in a bunch of examples and also a little bit structural, we made, I think, quite a bit of progress. Okay, this is a picture I come later to. I just drew it because it would take me a long time to draw it otherwise. Otherwise, I mean, okay, let's start with what I call nice VOAs. So we start with a VOA and we would like it to be conical. So this just means it's a usual one. It has lower bounded and it has a one-dimensional top level. It has a vacuum. And then, as usual, we denote the fields. As usual, we denote the fields by y of V and Z for y element in the VYA. So this is a formal power series and these are our operators on V. And why do I introduce this now? Because if we want to classify modules and we want to understand vertex tensor category, we somehow need to understand nice, intrinsic, finite. Nice intrinsic finiteness conditions of the VOAs. And these finiteness conditions are concerned with certain subspaces of the VOA and its modules. So for example, the C2 subspace is the linear span of elements of this form. And more general for ML V module. M V module. The C2 subspace of M is the linear span of the image of all minus two modes on M and two is not that I mean you can replace the two by n if you like and then you would get a C N subspace and it turns out And subspace. And it turns out for vertex tensor categories at least for vertex tensor categories, the C2 and C1 subspace is quite important. So in particular, one says M, a module is C2 co-finite if it has if the C2 subspace has finite co-dimension in M. And C2 cofiniteness leads to nice properties. For example, it guarantees that close one-point functions obey nice modular differential equations. So this means they belong to a finite vector-valued modular form. Finite vector-valued modular form. And from the tensor category point of view, the following statement is important. So it's due to Yigi, Wank, and Miyamoto. V is as above and C2 co-finite. And let's also assume that it's its own contract reading dual. So the CS means the contract reading code dual. Reading to code tool. Then the following two hold. The category of V modules is a vertex tensor category. And vertex tensor category means in particular it is a graded tensor cadery. And this has been proven by Wang. It has been published in 209. So you see already this statement. So you see, already this statement is relatively recent. And moreover, this category has only finitely many inequivalent symbols. And this is what we mean with nice. Somehow, you always say a category is nice. It has only finitely many simple objects. That's already a very nice property. It makes everything finite, right? Right. And moreover, another finiteness property is that every object is of finite length. There's a finite composition series. So finite Jordan Hilda length. Okay, yeah, please. If anybody has questions, ask. Can I interrupt it? You ask a question. How about the number of isomorphism classes of non-simple objects? Say if I look at objects of length two, like do or length like if I fix the length of an object, does that is that still a finite number or no? Is that still a finite number or not? In general, no. It's yeah, very good question. So, um, already in this, so the already the simplest example that would be the symplectic fermions, which only have uh, if you think about it's even sub-elgebo but has only two inequivalent simple objects, but um, it has an extension, so any composable of uh with two composable. Composable of two composition factors, and this one actually comes in a complete continuous family. So, good diversion. Yeah. And this is, of course, something that is challenging to understand and quite interesting. Yeah, good question. Akim. So now, yeah. Yeah, so this is the first thing. So I would call a VA nice or relatively nice if it is C2 cofinite because it has because then this theorem holds, namely that we know that we have a tensor category on its module categories. And moreover, this category has an additional nice property, this finite length property. And moreover, modules and they're also satisfied. Also, satisfy a nice finiteness condition. So, let me also recall this. So, if M is a module in the category of B modules of a C2 finite BOA, then we can decompose it into conformal weight spaces. So, this is the conformal weight grading. And then these conformal weight spaces are always. are always finite dimensional. And moreover, if I fix an n, then the subspace mn plus n for sufficiently large, for n sufficiently large vanishes. So it's a, so that's if you go too much up with the conformal weight, it will always vanish. And we should think about this as a module in a set C2 cofinite VOA satisfies From VOA satisfies nice finiteness conditions. Shouldn't it be conformal weights that are too far down? Should I have written minus? I think it should be n minus n. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah. Okay, and now you know if you. You know, if you had listened or had looked at VOAs 10-15 years ago, then one would probably exclusively have talked about rational VOAs. So the rational VOAs are the case where, in addition, every object is completely reducible. So, this is maybe what you should call very nice. Then we say B is rational, or let's maybe call it strongly irrational. And in this case, the category of V module. The category of V modules is a finite category, finitely many simples, and every simple object is completely irreducible. And in addition, the category is also rigid and the braiding is non-degenerate. So this means in that case, the category of V modules is a modular tensor category, a semi-simple modular tensor category. So this is something that EG So this uh something that EG proved when you say the modular tensor category as a vertex tensor category, I think this is not yeah yeah no no no no no this is a very different so a modular tensor category there by now people mean Now, people mean a little bit different things by it. So, historically, what you mean is a braided tensor category that is rigid and where the braiding is non-degenerate. So, that means you have no transparent objects. And a vertex tensor category is a braided tensor category structure on the category of V modules. It does not need to satisfy any. To satisfy any finiteness conditions a priori, it does not need to be semi-simple, it does not need to be rigid. So, okay, it's just a braided vertex tensor category, it's just a braided tensor category. It's just a braided tensor category coming from the PZ tensor product of V modules of a UA. But I also should say that if you look at the modern physics literature, so these applications. Literature, so these applications of VOAs to three manifolds and four manifolds, then it always says these three manifolds, they should be described by a modular tensor category coming from a VOA. But there it is meant a non-semi-simple. I mean, it's meant a finite non-degenerate tensor category, but it could be non-semi-simple. So one has to be a little bit nowadays. So, one has to be a little bit nowadays careful with the word modular tensor category, depending on in which community you are. Anyway, what I also wanted to say is that there's a nice associative algebra that classifies modules of a VOA. There's a juice algebra. Okay. So this means in the nice setting, that means if a VOA is at least C2 co-finite, then every module is lower bounded. You only have finitely many of those. And you have some associative algebra that helps you to classify at least the simple modules. With the extensions, you of course have a different problem. You, of course, have a different problem. Okay, and now the applications are, of course, first of all, the historical ones. This means in the first place, the strongly rational ones, the rational voice. They appeared already in the 80s as the chiral algebras, the symmetry algebras of today. The symmetry algebras of two-dimensional conformal field theory. So CFT stands for conformal field theory. And this was at that time quite important. It's maybe still quite important because these conformal field theories in turn are Are the worksheet theories of a string? In the 80s in particular, 80s, 90s, maybe early 2000s, people were very much focused, I mean, physicists very much focused on understanding quantum theory via strings. And if you have a string that propagates in space-time, it describes a two-dimensional world. Describes a two-dimensional world sheet on which you have some quantum field theory, and it needs to be a conformal field theory. But the conformal field theory is governed by the representation theory of a strongly rational VOA. So this was good news for VOAs and maybe CFTs as well, because there's a very nice connection now between mathematics, the mathematics of VOAs and physics. And then maybe other things. Other things one understood then that was the work of Moore and Zyburg first, and then Turarev and others, and that modular tensor categories lead to topological field theories. For example, John-Simon theories, and then one can use them to describe NOT and link and three-manifold invariance. And that has been quite an And that has been quite an interesting right. We know Von Jones was a very important figure in this respect. Now, for the CT C2 finite VOAs, they first appeared, I think, in the early 1990s already, when Horst Kausch studied the symplectic fermions. So they are the prime example, the first example of C2co finite mu A's. Example of C2 cofinite VOAs. And at that time, people were interested in those types of VOAs because they didn't describe logarithmic conformal field theory. So see, let me write this first down. Prime or first examples of logarithmic conformity theories. Theories. So the word logarithmic refers to that there are logarithmic singularities and correlation functions which are extreme immediately which are tied to a non-semi-simple action of the VR00 mode. So this means the logarithmic singularities in a CFT can only appear if the corresponding VOA is of the non-semi-simple type. Anyway, logarithmic CFTs, they have some condensed matter applications. But I would say at the moment one is much more interested in these non-semi-simple VOAs because they appear as very, very meaningful invariants of higher dimensional TFTs. For example, Tudor Dimen Moft, Nathan Geh and Nick Ghana, and I, for the last years, we have joined forces and we are joining. We have joint forces and we are trying to understand how the connection between line operators, certain operators and three-dimensional QFTs and non-semi-simple VOA categories. And it seems to be extremely rich because it turns out that these line operators are not only described by the categories of VOAs, but actually by module categories for the VOAs. And there's a quite rich. And there's a quite rich picture emerging, so which is quite interesting. And Nathan Gia will give the very last talk of this conference tomorrow, and he will explain a little bit about these types of categories. So let me just say that. They also appear in TFTs, but in a much, I would say, richer way than the original rational V-rays. And then there are also more applications to physics, but let me maybe go on with the talk now. So I started the I started the talk by reviewing a little bit about C2co finite VOAs. And now the next question is: is a C2co finite VOA a generic VOA? And the answer is very much no. So let's see what do we know about VOAs. Let's maybe start by recalling what kind of constructions do we know. of constructions do we know? So what I do know is that if we have a if g is a what do I do now is that VOA constructions, at least at present, are completely Lie theoretic. This means we have to start with a Lie algebra and it turns out you could equally well start with a Lie super algebra. In addition you need some pairing on the Lie super algebra. This means you need to have an invariant supersymmetric Supersymmetric bilinear form. Preferably, you take this bilinear form to be non-degenerate. If it's degenerate, you will get a VOA that is not simple. So then to this data, you can always associate the affine super VOA. And when I write VOAA, And when I write VOA, I mean for me, a super VOA is also a VOA. I don't want to include the word super all the time. It's a very mild generalization. So this is very well known that to a least super algebra and an invariant bilinear form, then you take the vacuum Wormer module at the corresponding level. I mean, the bilinear form specifies a level. The bilinear form specifies a level, and this carries the structure of an affine vertex algebra. And of course, you can also take its simple quotient. It doesn't need not to be simple. And I will denote it by an L Okay, the point is that basically every VOA that we know we can construct from an affine one via iterated standard. We are iterated standard constructions. So let me recall those. The main one I would say is if I take now an element f which is in the even sub-algebra of G and it is nilpotent, then you can associate a certain complex to the affine VOA and this nilpotent element and then the cohomology of this complex is a VOA again and it's called the WA. And it's called the W algebra associated to F and G. So, for example, if you take G to be SL2, then you only have one type of nilpotent element and the W algebra is just the Virasoro algebra. Or for example, if you take SLN and you take F to be a principal nilpotent element, then the W algebra is the usual Wn algebra that people are most familiar with. But you have a huge A zoo of possibilities in general. And this construction is often also denoted by quantum Hamiltonian reduction. Okay, and now if you have an affine VOA or a W algebra, you can apply a series of standard operations. So the simplest one is if you have The simplest one is if you have two VOAs, then just the tensor product of these VOAs is also a VOA. So this means, yeah, and if you have a sub-VOA of a given VOA, then this also defines you another VOA called the coset of WNV, which is the sub-algebra. The sub-algebra of V that commutes with the action of W. You can also think about it as the set of vacuum vectors for W inside V. This is the famous coset construction. Somehow a variant of the coset construction is if you take an automorphism, I mean a subgroup of the automorphism group. Of the automorphism group of your vertex algebra, then you can look at the VOA that is invariant under this automorphism group, and this would give you the or before VOA. And then the fourth standard construction is if V is a VOA and A an object in your caddy of V modules such that it contains V as a. contains V as a as a as a sub-object and then it sometimes happens that A extends the VOA structure on structure on V. This is the VOA extension. This happens very rarely and I think quite a few of you are familiar with the categorical Familiar with the categorical statement of this one. So let me also recall this. Categorical, this means if V mod is a word extensor category, then you can have, then A corresponds to a V or A extension of V if and only if A can be given the structure of a commutative and associative algebra in VMOD. This was first. This was first realized maybe 20 years ago by Kirilov and Ostrich, and then later improved by Kirilov, Juan Lepolsky, but also Robert Macre, Shashankanal, and myself. Okay, and what I wanted to say is the following. At least me, I am not aware of any VOA that is. That is finitely generated. I should say that, because infinitely generated are no examples. And that is not obtained from an affine VOA via standard construction. It's not clear whether this is whether simply no VOAs of different type exist or this is a historical problem because VOAs, I mean, they were the first discovered, FM VOAs were the first one that were discovered one. First, one that were discovered, one then first studied the simplest type lattice VOAs and their orbifolds, and then it has further developed from this. And so, one simply has further and better and better developed the constructions associated to affine VOAs or whether this is a or whether VUA theory is actually intrinsically related to the theory of affine Lie super algebas. But we, of course, know that there are some Candidates, like the Auger group modular data, that should lead to a rational unitary VOA. And that one looks very much as it can't come from an affine VOA. But first of all, it's not clear whether it cannot come from an affine VOA. And secondly, we don't know whether such a VOOA. We don't know whether such a VOA exists at the moment. This is one of the big open questions in this direction, right? Okay. And let me also say that a related categorical question is the one whether there is a with class. Whether there is a with class that is not represented by an FNVUI. I actually don't know what the status of this is. I mean, an integral f and v over a. Okay. Okay. So, what I wanted to say with this section is the following. One thing we can do if we have a Lie algebra or more generally a Lie super algebra, we fix a bilinear form on this. It gives us the f in VRA, it gives us the simple quotient. Maybe we take now a bunch of different Lie algebras, take the tensor products, and then apply standard operations as taking cosets, orbifolds, or Or before VOA extensions. And to my knowledge, every VOA that we know can be traced back to an iteration of these standard constructions from an affine VOA. So this means if we want to understand a representation theory of non-semi-simple VOAs, we look at our zoo of affine BOAs and see what we can do. And see what we can do and then go on. And now, unfortunately, it turns out that SL2 already is quite difficult. So this means I will now tell you what we do know and what we don't know about SL2. So then it will firstly illustrate to you that already SL2 is for generic, I mean, for most choices of invariant bilinear form of level. Invariant bilinear form of level very, very far away from being a finite tensor category. And I would also say it should be convincing that it is quite an interesting one. Are there any questions? Okay, let me just do the setup. So now our Lie algebra is SL2. I choose the standard basis and give them their usual names E, F. Give them their usual names E, F, and H. And I normalize in the way that E has eigenvalue 2 in the action of H, F minus 2, and commutator of E and F gives me H. And the bilinear form, I normalize on this. I normalize in this way. And now we can construct the affine vertex algebra. The underlying Lie algebra is the affine Lie algebra of SL2. And now I want to understand what type of possible modules can exist. So what do I do? I first study modules of the finite dimensional d algebra SL2. SL2 and so what can I do? We start with the simplest thing. So we start with finite dimensional modules of SL2. Let me denote them by LR. And this R will actually refer to the dimensions. And you can know, and I picture them by a lot of dots. Each dot represents a weight space. Each dot represents a weight space of this finite-dimensional simple module. So each dot represents a one-dimensional weight space, and then the action of E increases the weight by two, and the action of F decreases it by two. And so here, this would be my picture for the five-dimensional irreducible representation of SL2. Of SL2. Okay, we of course know that of every dinner dimension, SL2 has exactly one integrable irreducible representation. And so let's quickly return to more interesting modules for our purpose, namely modules that are not finite dimensional. And here we have three cases, namely the first case, it at least has a highest weight vector. Weight vector. And the way we picture it is here: we have the highest weight vector. And then, so this means, and but then but in to negative weight, it does not terminate. And these modules we denote by modules we denote by d plus plus indicating highest weight lambda and lambda is then the highest rate and so with my normalization it means if i take um for example lambda not to be a and not to be an integer positive integer then i can still have highest rate representations but they will never be the simple highest rate representation will never be The simple highest rate representation will never be finite-dimensional, they will not have a lowest rate vector. Similarly, I can reverse direction, so that means I can start with a lowest weight vector. But now the action of E will never terminate, and this will then give me a Will then give me a lowest weight module, infinite dimensional. The superscript minus indicates that it's lowest weight, and the label is the lowest weight label. And now, why should we restrict it to being finite, infinite only in one direction? So, we can also take a module that is usually called relaxed highest weight. Let me just remove the word highest because there is no highest weight. Because there is no highest weight. That would be then a module that has many, many weight spaces, but it doesn't terminate at all. And we would call this modulus E lambda comma delta. So this means, and what is here, lambda and delta. So lambda. So lambda means the H eig values on this relaxed highest weight module are in the coset of lambda. So that means a lambda plus the root letters of SL2, which is with my normalization to two times the integers. And now if you think about it, if you have a highest weight vector, then the highest weight vector gives you a condition. Highest weight vector gives you a condition on how the Casimir acts on your module. The same thing happens if you have a lowest weight vector. It uniquely specifies the high Casimir eigenvalue on your module. But if you have a module that has a bunch of, I mean, that has infinitely many weight spaces, but it doesn't have a lowest or highest weight vector, then there's no restriction on what the possible Casimir eigenvalue can be. And so it turns out. And so it turns out this gives us a second parameter here. So this means for a fixed complex number, for fixed, we call it relaxed highest weight, you have a continuous family of corresponding relaxed highest weight modules parametrized by the Casimir eigenvalue. And now while probably Now, while probably most of you know that for the affine VRAs at positive integer level, the Western-Miner-Wittman theories, the integrable theories, only those modules appear that come from a finite dimensional form integrable SL2 modules. It turns out at all other levels, this is not the case anymore. So let me tell you which types of modules appear, and then you see how rich this is. And then you see how rich this is. So we turn to the affine VOA. So first of all, I denote by LKSL2 the simple quotient of the of the affine VUA at level k. And now I fix k to be of the form minus 2. To be of the form minus two plus a positive rational number. So here u and v are co-prime. They are both integers. v needs to be positive and u needs to be at least the dual coxeter number of SL2. And these levels are called admissible levels. Levels. And now I will tell you what type of modules the FINVUA of SL2 at admissible level has. And so the notation I use is the following by M hat. I denote the almost simple Simple module for the affine VOA. So this whose top level is M. And a module is almost simple if every proper submodule intersects the top level non-trivially. So that means if there So that means if there is a non-trivial sub-module, it already comes from the module for the finite dimensional Li algebra SL2 at the top level. Okay, and then we need to introduce a little bit of new notation. So the Casimir eigenvalues that are relevant are these expressions in R and S. These expressions in R and S, where R will go from one up to u minus one, and S will go from one up to V minus one. And we also take a shorthand notation for certain weights called lambda r, s, which are just of this form. So these precise formulas you don't have to remember for the purpose of this talk. For the purpose of this talk, what is important is that this set of labels Rs is a finite index set, maybe. Now, in a really nice work already almost 30 years ago, 20 something, Dorajan Ardamovich and Anton Milas had a nice classification result using Jus algebra. Using Jus algebra. And but the way I stated it also includes some recent progress. So let me just say Raj and Anton plus something recent. So a complete list of almost simple lower bound. Lower bounded modules for the affine simple affine vertex algebra of SL2 at admissible level is the following. First, we have the ordinary modules. So this means these are the ones that come from finite dimensional representations of SO2, and we only have a finite number of those. Finite number of those, only u minus one of those. But then we also have those that come from lowest or highest weight models of SL2 with the list here. But again, a finite list here and then. And then there are also these relaxed highest weight modules. And the Casimir eigenvalue on the top level is also restricted to only a finite number of values, but lambda can be any in principle can be any It can be any complex number, and we, of course, have to take it modulo the road letters, which in my normalization is two times the integers. And here, it turns out we have in this list we have to exclude the two values because for these two values, it turns out that this module that comes from an infinite A module that comes from an infinite dimensional SL2 representation is not completely irreducible. So then we have, and then we get two types of modules denoted by E plus minus. And And all previous modules are simple, but this one is only almost simple. It has a non-trivial submodule on the top level, and the plus-minus indicates whether this non-trivial submodule is of highest or lowest weight type. And let me Write down the decomposition of these indecomposable modules. And this decomposition had been conjectured for quite some time, but it has only been proven by Darajan and independently by David and Kazuya fairly recently. And what the For example, the decomposition for highest weight modules for the plus case looks like this. And here the next one is actually one that is of lowest weight type, but I will now write it in a very fancy way and explain this fancy way in a moment because this is important for us to understand how to go on. And in fact, this. And in fact, this simple module of highest weight type, D plus R, S, appears as a submodule of two relaxed type modules. And this sigma star indicates a certain automorphism coming from F. Automorphism coming from affine weight translation. And I decided to use this because it turns out also the lowest type modules, they are related to the highest one via this automorphism. And then one can write this somehow more uniformly. But now I owe you to explain what is the sigma. So for the moment, we are at the following point. So quite a long time, Edrajan and Long time, Edrajen and Anton, they classified simple lower bounded modules, and you see there's a whole continuum of this module, of these modules, because lambda yeah, because there's a we have a zoo of possible possibilities for the relaxed heist weight lambda. And the transportation, which is: so, how does, so if K happens. So if k happens to be a positive integer, then how does this change? Oh, right. And I for this con, I should have written here that we exclude the positive integers. And in the positive integer case, we only have case A. Yeah, thanks, Juan. Yeah, thanks for noticing. I forgot to say that we exclude the positive integer case. Good, thank you. Yeah. How different is the almost simple and the simple? Can you say it again, please? The almost simple modules and the simple, how different are they? And in this admissible case, are they these C2 cofinets? No, this is enormously far away from being C2. Enormously far away from being C2 co-finite. Because we have so and the only affine VOAs that are known to be C2co finite are the integrable ones for the different level. And for fine superview A's, the only one that are known to be C2co finite ones are the integrable ones for OSP1 to N. P1 to n. And it's, I'm not sure whether that's proven, but I probably it is that it's clear that no other affine B or A can be C2 cofinite. I think there was a paper by Katz and Goverlik on this issue, but I'm not totally sure. So yeah, an affine VOA is all so if it is the two co-finite. So, if it is C2 co-finite, it also seems to be always rational. And this happens enormously rarely, namely, only for positive potential levels. Thank you.
