My name is Shigeyuki Komura and today I will talk about anomalous diffusion in active cells. And currently I'm working at the Wenjo Institute and most of the work was done by my previous PhD student, Kentoyasuda, who is now working in Kyoto, Japan. And just let me briefly introduce myself. So I moved from Japan to China about three years ago. And Wanzhou is located here, a bit south from here. We are now here, right? Hanzhou and Wanzhou is not so far from here. And Beijing is somewhere here. And our institute, main aim of our institute is to combine basic science and Basic science and medical science. And right now I'm leading a group called Theory of Medical Soft Matter. And this is how our institute looks like. And it's a relatively new institute. So please visit if you are interested in. And my current interests are several, but one of them is active matter. And I'm particularly working. And I'm particularly working recently on microswimmer and micro swimmer in a structured fluid or complex fluid. And we try to generalize the so-called scallop serum in a viscoelastic fluid with some internal structures. And we are also interested in some fundamental physical properties of micro-machines and explain it in terms of odd elasticity. Of elasticity, which is a characterization of non-reciprocality, and we are looking at this kind of problem from the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. And some years ago, we also worked on the pattern formation of human skin cancers. And so, this is the melanoma. And we see sometimes this kind of globular or stripe patterns of cancer on the skin. Patterns of cancer on the skin. And we try to reproduce this kind of pattern by using a simple model. But the essential ingredients are phase separation, but here we included chemical reaction. Chemical reaction means just the transition from a health C cell to cancer cells, but also in the presence of hydrodynamic effects. And here you see that the black major components are majority, but still therefore. Are majority, but still they are forming islands, okay, which is not typical phase separation. And we think this is due to the hydrodynamic effect. So today, I will going to talk about two subjects. The first one is dynamics of a membrane interacting with an active wall. And the second part is about anomalous diffusion in viscoelastic media with active force dipoles. Active force dipoles. And I'm sorry that I'm not completely updated in this direction recently. So please let me know if you know more recent information. And so this is just a picture of biological cell. I just want to mention that inside the cell has a very complex structure with a lot of structures and it's not just a simple liquid and it's a viscoelastic. And it's a viscoelastic fluid, but it has some also internal structures. The other thing I want to mention is that the whole cell is enveloped by lipid bilayer membrane, plasma membrane. And this is important, but also inside the cell, there are many structures like Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic reticula, which has this kind of folded membrane structure. Membrane structure. So there are membranes everywhere also inside the cell. And what I want to talk is fluctuation of the membranes. Okay, this is the first topic. And the other thing is the diffusion of 3D diffusion in such a complex system or complex fluid. And first about the fluctuation membrane, and we know that biomembranes are essentially composed of lipid bilayers, and of course, there can be. Bilayers, and of course, there can be some membrane proteins in it. And it's also beneath the lipid bilayer, there is a structure called cytoskeleton made of a spectrum network, and they are attached to each other and they are interacting. And people have observed the shape of the fluctuation of these membranes both in artificial and in the red blood cells. And this is for the fluctuation of the vesicle. The fluctuation of the vesicle and under the microscope, and you see this essentially the thermal fluctuation. And people can analyze it and they can, for example, obtain the bending elasticity of this vesicle by measuring this fluctuation spectrum. And also, people have looked at this kind of fluctuation for red blood cells, and this is called flickering phenomena for red blood cells. Red blood cells, and people can really quantify this fluctuation. So, this is the, I think, real oxidation. And this is the you subtract the average height so that you only pick out the net fluctuation. And you see this fluctuation both in space and in time. And they have analyzed this kind of quantity in detail. And one interesting observation is that when they look at Is that when they look at the fluctuations and they are different whether you have ATP or if you deplete ATP? So, for example, this is the fluctuation of healthy cells and this is for red plus cell, but ATP depleted. And if you look at the, this is the fluctuation amplitude, and then I wrote it active for healthy cell in the presence of ATP. And if you compare with the And if you compare with the ATP depleted case, these cases, then the fluctuation actually is suppressed and becomes lower. And similar things were also observed by other experimental groups. So they looked at the how spectrum density of this fluctuation. So it's essentially the Fourier transform of this quantity. And as a function of frequency here, and for example, this black line is the normal one here with the ATP. And if you deplete ATP, the green one, the fluctuation becomes smaller. And the reason why the fluctuation is more enhanced for active case or in the presence of ATP is that there's some chemical reaction going in, such as phosphorylation. Such as phosphorylation. And this phosphorylation is happening on the proteins, which is on this spectrum network. And basically, what I understand is that there is some continuous kick from the cytoskeleton to the membrane so that you see more enhanced fluctuation of the lipid bilayers. But without the ATP, this kind of continuous kick is suppressed so that you have less suppressed thermal fluctuation. And later, there are more sophisticated experiments on measuring the fluctuation of the membrane. And this is essentially the microrheology technique. And these people looked at the micro-rheology, or I would say membrane micro-rheology for red blood cell. What they did. What they did is that, so here's the red blood cell, and they hold this red blood cell by these three colloid particles, which is fixed in space. And there's a fourth particle here, colloid particle. And with this particle, you can do both active and passive measurement. Passive measurement is that it means that you just trace the displacement of this force particle attached to the membrane so that you can get the So, so that you can get the fluctuation or power spectrum density as before. And the other method is the active method measurement, which means that you apply a frequency-dependent force on this forced particle, and you measure the velocity or position so that you can obtain the response function as a function of frequency. So, they can do both active and passive measurements and. Measurements. And if the system is in thermal equilibrium, we know that these two measurements should coincide to each other because of the fluctuation dissipation theorem, which should hold in equilibrium system. So the left-hand side is the power spectrum density multiplied by frequency. So this you can obtain from the passive measurement. And the right-hand side is the response function, which you can measure from the active measurement. And this should Measurement. And this should hold in equilibrium. And what they measured is that, observed, is that for that red blood cell, then the left-hand side and right-hand side, I think the white circles are the left-hand side and the black circles are the right-hand side. They coincide each other for all the frequency. So this means that the fluctuation dissipation theorem is satisfied and the system is in equilibrium situation. Situation. But for a fresh, what they call fresh or active red plus cell, there's a deviation between the power spectrum density, which is here and the response function here. And the fluctuation dissipation theorem is violated in the low frequency region. And this is the quantification of how far the system is out of the equilibrium. And motivated by Uh, and motivated by these works, uh, so this is uh the model that we studied. So, we looked at the fluctuation of the membrane, which is interacting with wall. And here by wall, we are modeling for the kind of spectral network, which can also induce some active velocity here. Okay, so once again, we have here a lipid barrier which can deform and fluctuate. Which can deform and fluctuate. And this lipid bilayer is also interacting with the wall with a potential. So it's a confined membrane. And on top of that, this wall can be either passive or active. If the wall is just passive, it's just a static wall. But if it's active, then it can give some kicks by these random velocities, both in X and Y directions. In x and y directions, okay, and uh, and in between, we have a fluid of viscosity ether here and ether. And basically, we look at this h, the fluctuation, uh, as a function of time. And this we call as a mean square displacement of the height. And we considered three cases, just three cases, static wall, so without any these red arrows, without any kicks. Red arrows without any kicks, thermal fluctuations of the membrane, and active wall producing some random velocities, and active wall with some intrinsic time scale. And just a little bit more detail about the model. So for the membrane deformation, we just use the Helfris bending energy first term. This is kappa is the bending rigidity. This is the curvature square term. And it's also confined by this. And it's also confined by this static harmonic potential. I just wrote it ψ to the minus 4, so that this ψ has a dimension of length, but this is basically the potential. And then the static correlation function can be just obtained from this, like this, okay? And we have also a hydrodynamic equation for the surrounding solvent, just a Stokes equation with the incompressibility. Incompressibility, and of course, at the membrane, the velocity of the fluid and the membrane should coincide. And also, the force due to the deformation of the membrane should balance with the stress tensor of the fluid, etc. And also, at this boundary, the velocity fluid and the active velocity should coincide. So, these are the boundary conditions, and we have solved this problem. And then what we end up is actually the equation for this height variable h. So I just want to remind h is essentially this, sorry, h is this fluctuation, right, in a vertical direction. And then, okay, sorry. So this is the Langevin equation, essentially. So, and so this is the decay term, and the main part of the calculation. term and and the main part of the calculation is calculate this this gamma okay this is the decay term hydrodynamic decay term and these two terms involves capital Vx and capital VZ which are due to the active velocities at the wall okay and zeta is just a thermal noise which satisfies this fluctuation dissipation relation so this strength is related to this decay rate and then the quantity And then the quantity that we looked at is called membrane mean square displacement. So basically, you consider a patch of membrane and you measure this height. And then you see how this quantity increases as a function of time. And that is called membrane MSD. And it has actually three contributions. So the first contribution comes from just summar noise with this term and then two terms. And then two terms from random velocities in X and Z directions. And then I want to come to the result. So first for the static case, so this is just a summar equilibrium so that you have a static wall and then you have a fluctuating membrane on top of it. And of course, these active velocities don't exist here. And what you observe for this membrane MST is that in a short MSD is that in a short time scale, this membrane MSD increases as T to the two-thirds, two-thirds. And you might think that this is an abnormal diffusion, but it's actually not because this is a normal diffusion for membrane patch, okay, and which was already found by Zillman and Granek a long time ago. And so, in the short time, because you don't So, in the short time, because you don't feel the membrane doesn't feel any potential, so it just undergoes normal diffusion, which is two-thirds. But because of the presence of the confinement, so there's another scaling regime, which is which increases to the one to the third, one-third power. So, you have a crossover to two-thirds, to one-third, and zero. So, this is for the static summer equilibrium case. So, what happens? Sorry, what happens if you have a random If you have a random kick at the wall, okay, random velocity. And for the noise property, we assumed just this kind of delta correlated noise with some amplitude s of x, okay, delta correlated in space and also delta correlated in time. And then we calculated this MST, sorry, MST, MST, this quantity. This quantity, this quantity, and coming from the X contribution and Z contributions, okay. And this is the result. So, and the main thing here is that because of this active kick at the wall, you see actually T linear regime in the short time scale, the initial stage, both in the X and Z direction. And this is abnormal or anomalous diffusion. Or anomalous diffusion for membrane, okay, because it's different from two-thirds. And then, because of the confinement, you have this flat region, and in between, you can have either one-third or two-thirds exponent, depending on the direction of the active velocities. So you see this T-linear regime, okay. And the third case is the active wall with some intrinsic time scale. So, this I mean. So this I mean by intrinsic time scale, we just replace this delta correlation here, the delta function by this exponential decay function with a typical relaxation time tau A. And if you increase this tau A with respect to this time scale, then basically this T linear regime will just increase because it just remembers this at. It just remembers this active kick over a longer time. And then you see this T linear regime for a wide range of time. And basically, these are both anomalous diffusion due to the activity at the wall. And I just want to briefly compare this result with the experiment found by these people. And so they measured this power spectrum density, as I mentioned before. Density as I mentioned before, and this quantity is power spectrum times actually omega frequency. And for example, if you have a T linear regime, which is anomalous, and T to the two-third regime, basically, in order to map to this power spectrum density, you do the Fourier transform. And just by doing the power counting, so the T linear regime should correspond to omega. correspond to omega minus omega to the minus one which maybe corresponds to this region in a high frequency regime and this t two third should correspond t omega to the minus two third which is somewhere here and then there's some saturation and uh i i i'm not i i i i'm not saying that i have explained this uh violation of f dt but this kind of uh anomalous diffusion could be a measurement in such kind of fluctuation measurement. In such kind of fluctuation measurements. Okay, and then I will come to the next topic, which is anomalous diffusion in viscoelastic media with active force dipoles. And so this work was motivated by these people, by David Weiss group already 10 years ago. And what they looked at is the Brownian motion inside a single cell. So this is a really A single cell. So, this is a really passive, this is a micro rheology experiment. And this is again A7 melanoma cell, cancer cell. So, this is inside the cell. And please look at this wild type and ATP depleted case. And for untreated wild type, you see that particles are undergoing a very active Brownian motion here. While here, you see Brownian motion, but Here you see Brownian motion, but the motion is very limited. The Brownian motion is quite suppressed here. And so basically, this system is out of equilibrium. This is equilibrium. And they have, of course, measured, quantified this MSD of this particle. And this is MSD times the particle size. And then what they found is. And then what they found is for untreated case, this one, this wild case, so the MSD first doesn't increase, but after some time it starts to increase with exponent one, okay? But for the ATP depleted case, sorry, this one, this case, right, then so the MSE times So the MSE times distance is like this. So it doesn't really increase so much. It's a quite anomalous diffusion here. And basically, we wanted to understand this kind of behavior by doing some simple modeling. And by the way, this ATP diffusion inside the cell has been also observed in other systems like this plasmid. Okay. And let me see. Yeah. Let me see. Yeah. So we clearly see here anomalous diffusion. Okay. And we think here at least there are two reasons that we see this anomalous diffusion. So the first reason is that the environment is obviously viscoelastic. And the second reason is that for a wide cell for for a white cell uh the environment is is is uh in active and there should be uh some non-thermal active force on top of on top of thermal fluctuations okay so so this this this kind of understanding is very similar to to to the this morning's uh professor penger stong's uh actually uh story okay and uh so and for each of these uh research uh how can i say uh mechanism This, how can I say, mechanism, we introduced two models. So, to describe this viscoelasticity of the medium, we used this two-fluid model for a gel, okay? And to describe this non-thermal active forces due to these proteins or enzymes, we used active force type also. And basically, we looked at the MST, but what we looked at is. But what we looked at is what is called two-point microrheology, which means that you look at the correlated motion between the two points separated by a certain distance. And actually, this distance between two points corresponds to basically the particle size in the experiment. And this is the interesting part of the micro-rheology. But we can calculate this kind of things easier, at least theoretically. Theoretically, so let's go for the first part: this aviscoelastic medium, and we consider two fluid models. So, this is maybe the very simplest model for polymer gel. And the polymer gel consists of elastic network and a viscous fluid. Okay, and you have two equations for elastic part and viscous part. This part is the equation for elastic. The equation for elastic network. So u is the displacement and μ are the Lame coefficients. Okay. And this is the Stokes equation. V is the velocity and U and V are coupled to each other through this mutual friction. So gamma is a friction coefficient between the network and the fluid. And so this is the important. And this is an important quantity. And the ratio between eta and gamma gives you some length scale. And this can be understood as a kind of mesh size of this polymer system. So we have a, so this is a viscoelastic, a model for viscoelastic fluid, but it has some internal characteristic length. So this is the important part here. Important part here. And I'm sorry. And using this two-fluid model, you can calculate the Green function or the response function, meaning that suppose you give a force at some point, then you can calculate the velocity at some other point. And this is connected by this Green function. And this Green function has been calculated by these people. And because we know this. And because we know this greed function, and if the system is in equilibrium, we can use fluctuation dissipation theorem. And this is a two-point MST. So it's a correlation or this correlated displacement, correlated motion between particle one and particle two is related to the mobility. And this mobility is essentially the same as this Green function. So essentially, you can calculate once you know this Green function. Once you know this green function, you can calculate this two-point correlation function, and then you can calculate the mean square displacement. And then this is what we do. And so, okay, the system is still in thermal equilibrium. But the environment is viscoelastic with some internal structure. And so, as I said, so L is the mesh size, typical structure, and D is the distance between the two. And D is the distance between the two points. So the two points. Okay. And please look at maybe this green line. D over L is relatively large. So then, so this is MSD, two point MSD. So in the beginning, it increases linearly with T because the particle feels only the fluid environment and it doesn't feel the elastic network. But after this But after this time t here, so this can be called viscoelastic time, then the particles start to feel the elastic environment. Then the MST start to saturate. But in the long time, this two-fluid model behaves as a fluid, actually. So therefore, you have a normal diffusion. So one, zero, one, and you see this kind of crossover depending on the competition. Depending on the competition between the particle size and the mesh size. And I just want to say longitudinal means that motion in this direction. And transverse means in this direction. But please just look at this longitudinal result. Okay, so this is for the equilibrium case with the viscos elasticity. And I want to introduce some active elements in the fluid. And in the And in the cell, maybe there are this kind of proteins or cell which are undergoing cyclic shape deformation like this. And we can model it as an oscillating force dipole, K. And so two oppositing force in this direction separated by this distance A. And the magnitude of this force dipole can be written by the distance times this force, K. Times this fork, okay. And we assume that this kind of force tripods are randomly oriented in this viscoelastic fluid. Okay, and moreover, the statistical property of this M is assumed to be like this. It's again, it has some characteristic decay time tau d. Okay, this is just assumption and with some strength S. And actually, we don't know exactly what this S is. Know exactly what this S is, okay? But we assume that there's some active contribution due to this oscillating force typo. And then, okay, so if we know the Green's function, we can calculate the velocity induced by this force dipole, and then we can calculate the velocity-velocity correlation function, and then we do the time integral, and then we can calculate the mean squared displacement due to this. mean square displacement due to this oscillating force dipoles embedded in the fluid. Okay, and this is the result of the again two point MSD as a function of time. And please look at this D over case when D over L is 100. And we said this tau D, tau D is here. So this is the memory time of this force typo. And sorry, and this is much. And and sorry, and this is much larger assumed to be much larger than this visco elastic time scale. Okay, and then, uh, and if you look at this green curve, then what we see here is that initially this MSD is proportional to the t to the square, okay. This is actually the ballistic motion, okay. And after a viscoelastic time scale here, one, then you start to see this uh key linear regime, and then you see this uh. Then you see this plateau again, and in the long time it will actually increase again. It will be proportional to T. So it's a bit complicated, but if you look at the scaling, then it's T to the square, T linear, T zero, T to the zero, and then T linear. So you have various types of anomalous diffusions here. And finally, I just want to compare with the observation. To compare with the observation by the experiment, and we simply assume that the total MST is the sum of the summer contribution and active contribution. But we don't know exactly the weight of these two contributions. So there's some unknown dimensionless number parameter, which is the ratio between the S is actually the strength of this force. Force-type correlation. And so S divided basically KBT is an unknown parameter. But if we tune it, then for C equals zero, means that the system is in equilibrium. Then the MST as a function of time is like this. And actually, I want to emphasize here, we don't rescale the time, but we try to reproduce this experimental result as much as possible. Produce this experimental result as much as possible. So, this is a real time. So, this is C equals zero is the equilibrium case, but with some viscoelastic fluid. You really see a very suppressed diffusion here. And there's some small increasement here. And we think that this curve corresponds to this ATP depleted case. But if you add some activity, then you start to see this inner curves will increase like this. Like this, and this T linear regime should be correspond to this part. And actually, this T linear part is indeed does come from the active contribution from here, T linear regime here. So that so therefore, I'm not claiming that we completely understood the result, but there's one way of explaining this kind of experimental result. Sorry. So this is a summary of my talk. This is a summary of my talk. So, I talked about the fluctuation of the membrane segment interacting with an active wall. And if there is some active kick due to the wall, and there is a regime where the membrane MST shows T-linear dependence, which is anomalous for membrane segment, and for the diffusion of the particle inside the cell, so So there can be two reasons for the anomalous diffusion. One is the viscoelasticity and one is activity. And even if the system is in equilibrium, the diffusion can be very complex because of the viscoelasticity. And you have a T linear regime, T independent regime, T linear regime. And you have this kind of crossover for active MST, T ballistic and T linear T0 and T0. So, and everything is a combination of these things. So, it's a bit complicated, but my basic message is that there can be various types of anomalous diffusion in cells due to different reasons. Thank you for attention.
