Second, I want to say that this is a continuation of a talk given by Anastasia on Monday. So she spoke about this topic in general. I want to provide you with some details. Maybe you find them enjoyable. And I want to give you a short disclaimer. I will actually not show any new results today, but I will explain how. I will explain how this technique can lead to new results pretty easily, formally without any efforts. And I hope we will present some new equations, some new analytics later. But here I want to keep things simple. So, what I'm going to do today, first, I'm going to review what was not here document on Monday just to Talking on Monday, just to keep my talk self-consistent. So, I will explain what is embedding, what's our approach to the embedding the mini-hope perspective. And then I will give you some details and I will demonstrate this technique on the problem of diffraction on a wedge. And moreover, I will consider a right angle wedge just to things to be very simple. So, almost all occ Computation will be apparent. So let us start. What is the embedding formula? What I do is consider some linear wave diffraction problem. So I have a Hilbert's equation and some scatterer visages. The most common example is a strip. So what I need to apply. They need to apply embedding as first to guess the operator, which considers to be the hardest part. And this operator should possess a number of properties. First of all, it should commute with Laplace operator, it should kill the incident wave, and it should preserve boundary conditions. Then I apply it to the field and And I again get a solution of the Gilen-Goltz equation, but now I spoil the behavior in the VCH of edges. So I've got some single behavior, and to compensate the single behavior, I need to introduce so-called over-single solutions. And then I study the combination of differentiated field and this oversingo solutions, and I find out that I can. I find out that I can express the original problem with the plane wave in terms of this additional problem for edge-green function. So basically, it is literally embedding, I embed my problem in a set of other different problems. And that was done by Christchurchan and Dubrowski almost 20 years ago. And for some reason, not many people use it, this idea is overlooked. This idea is overlooked, but this idea is very magical, in my opinion. Just to give a visual demonstration, I will consider the simplest example of the strip problem. So I have an incident field. I apply the separator. For sure, it kills the incident wave. For sure, it preserves the boundary condition and commutes with Gilgal's equation. And then when I differentiate here and here, Differentiate here and here. I got naturally some singularity on near the edges, and I can express the directivity of scatter field as a combination of directivities for edge green function. And what is remarkable about this equation is first of all, it's simple. And the second one, I decomposed the dependence on variables. So here I have a function that depends on two variables. functions that depends on two variables and here and have a combination of functions. Each one depends on one variable. So, and to put it even more simply, instead of computation of a number of curves as a solution of our problem, a diffraction pattern, a directivity, we just need to find one. And then we know everything about our problem. And the second directivity we get by symmetry. By symmetry. Now I will talk about Wienerhof perspective. So the idea that we know that almost any more or less simple diffraction problem can be formulated as a matrix linear Hopper equation. And what I basically try to say is that if we have an embedding formula, there is a matrix linear Hopper equation behind it. And in terms of the And in terms of the linear hope, the idea is quite simple. The embedding is the factorization of the operator. So, what is our procedure? Here also, we are not the first one, but we follow one of the classics, Gahaufs and Muschirschwild, somebody who developed this technique in a very general setting for the Riemann problem, for the Riemann-Gilbert problem. So, what we do? So, what we do? We solve this equation without a forcing term. We find n solutions. And then, when we found n solutions of this equation, it means that we found a factorization of a kernel. We compose a factorization of a kernel from these solutions, which are usually called normal solutions. There is some technical detail that you need to choose them in a way that To choose them in a way that the determinant of a matrix is non-zero everywhere. So, this is that sometimes it could be problematic, but generally it can be done without. And then we apply a Liu equilateral. And after that, we get a very similar expression. It's basically an embedding. If we have a polar forcing, and even a bit more complicated than polar one, we also have a decomposition. Also, have a decomposition in terms of dependence on parameters. So, here we have two parameters: z i corresponds to a pole which corresponds to the incident wave. And here we have two functions that depends only on one parameter. And here, I want to get a bit into details, get a particular example, and there is some important technical tool. Important technical tool that I'm going to be using. This tool is to code Ogrin's formula. Of course, everybody knows it, but that's how I use it. I say that a very good way to derive a linear Hopper equation is to apply a Green's formula with a plane wave. I have an algoid wave, I apply it to a half space. If, for example, I have a scatterer, and then the integral on this arc goes to zero and the distance goes to zero. To zero as the distance goes to infinity, as the radius goes to infinity. Here, hopefully, I have some good limit, and here I have Fourier transforms because I use the plane waves. This is a very simple and fast way to derive Nier-Hop equations. So, and now I want to study the problem of diffraction by a wedge. It was discussed at this conference, I think, also several times yesterday, Guidelamba. Several times. Yesterday, Guido Lambardi was talking about it. But maybe I will show a solution that not many of you know, a way to solve this problem. Like, usually, we know that we make a change of variables or apply Zommerfeld-Malusion's technique, and we get like a scalar Vigner-Hopp equation. So, now, just I will derive a matrix Vigner-Hopp equation for this problem, and this matrix Vigner-Hopper equation will naturally. Equation will naturally lead to a solution by embedding. And so I have Gilgor's equation directly about the recognition. I have this near field behavior. It's important because then I introduce edge green functions and they also have some near field behavior which is defined by Max near series in the vicinity of the vertex. And I define the detectivity of the scattered field. So what So, what I do, I use the Soimerfeld technique, but only halfway. I apply the reflection principle once, and I apply a problem on a branch surface, but with a boundary. So I don't go all the way through. And I have this two-shaded surface. And as I said, I use green sterium twice. Sure, three times. I apply green sterium in this half space, in this half space. Half space, in this half space, in this half space, and in this half space. And naturally, I have some functional relations that are basically a matrix Fingen-Hopper equation. So I have like I define a spectral variable, one here, two variables here. So two variables here and one here. So I have like six variables. So I should have three by three Vinhenhop equation. And just applying the green stereum, I get it. And I get, and I have a linear hop equation with this matrix. Well, tama is a didn't put it there, but it's a usual square root, which, yeah. It's a and I have some forcing which if Have some forcing, which, if you want, if you look with details, it's not a pole, it has some square root dependency, but turns out it's not a problem. An embedding still can be used. And a surprising thing is that for the wedge, I have an embedding with two edge-grid functions. I just know it. But here I have a three by three matrix Linear Hopper equation. So it's a bit puzzling. But if we study But if we study just the agent modes of this matrix, we can find out that this matrix have a constant eigenvector. So it can be reduced to a two by two matrix with just a constant matrix. This matrix are here, but I wanted to say, I was feeling that I was the one who invented this equation, but turned out that this year, a thesis by Munga Eytkin was published. Guy Edkin was published, and he gets a very similar equation for like the same problem, but with Neyman boundary conditions. So he done it first, which is a pity for me, but still I did it with a bit different technique and I found it nice. So we have like eventually after applying a transformation, we get a matrix. We get a two by two matrix, which we need to factorize this matrix. We need to factorize this matrix. It can be easily checked that it's a Danielle-Khrupkov matrix and can be factorized. But that's not what I'm going to do. My plan is to derive the embedding form. And for this, and this two by two problem, I can introduce edge-green function. I repeat the procedure, and now I get two homogeneous linear hop equations. And And one remark: I actually don't need the intraduit grain function. I can just say that I have two homogeneous Mirhop equations with some behavior at infinity. But it's not easy to guess which behavior I should choose. So it's like safe to start from the formulation for edge-grid functions. And then applying this technique, I get an embedding formula. Get an embedding formula, and these are just a combination of two polar terms that corresponds to reflected waves. Then I use like a very null relation that the field on the surface is connected to the directivity via an integral transform, via a Fourier transform, and I can rewrite it in a standard way. And of course, it's consistent with the emerging formula derived by Andri Shanyan and Risk. By Andriy Shanyan, Andreas Kreist, and Dubrovsky. So, this is an example. I found an embedding for the wedge problem. But and of course, if we have a wedge of the angle of a rational angle, Q over P, we apply the reflection principle P times. Reflection principle p times, and we will get a matrix linear Hopper equation of size q by q. And we can get all the embedding formulas we want for any wedge problems with rational angle. So this approach will fail if we have irrational angle. And now let me discuss the problem, the same problem again, but the standard technique, which is very known for people, where we use a change of variable, which was Which was mentioned by Guida. Also, these equations can be obtained using Green's formulas. But now I apply it a bit differently. So I decompose the domain into two, apply the embedding formula two times, and I got two functional relations, and I can use them as analytic continuation formula for this function. Formula for this function, which somehow links to, of course, to the Zomerfeld transform. And this could have been a beginning for the Zommerfeld Malujanius approach, but then I follow Cheinian or Danielle, making change variables and obtain a Winnier-Hopp equation. This is like a trivial Winner-Hopper equation because it does not have a kernel, so it just solves by. So it's just solved by power removal. But my question is: so I have a solution, and my question is: where the embedding formula is, where it hides, why I can see it here. And if I being formal, I can say that this solution is actually in the embedding formula. This is embedding. This fine, we got some term which depends on the incidence, and we got something in the denominator which corresponds to the incident wave. So, what's wrong? So, what's wrong from the standard perspective? It's not wrong, but it's a difference. We can say that this is an embedding, but this is embedding in a way non-local, because the corresponding spectral variable are connected with this change, this mapped variable alpha by some algebraical function. It means when we go back from gender activities to the Great activities to the field, we will have some integral transform. Because if we have like some integer exponent here, we will have just a differential operator. If this if this exponent is non-integer, we will have a tilde differential operator, which corresponds to some integral operator just. Integral operator just. So, what I can say is this is like non-local embedding formula. So, what do I need to do to get a local embedding formula? It's quite simple. I take this solution and just multiply it by a polynomial. And what I want is this polynomial will be polynomial both in a map variable and in the spectral. Spectral or like Fourier variable. And also, it should kill the incident wave. Of course, this operator is easy to find and it corresponds to the operator that was used classically. So it's just a Fourier transform of the separator. And I just multiply and I instantly get a solution. And this alpha and alpha square can be associated with the Or can be associated with the edge green function. So I get a standard tempedian formula. There is also a constant, a constant that does not matter because I have like a specific difference relation for the directivity. So here, like I completely mimic a procedure done by Scheinyan. A crash here, I need to guess some operator, but I just guess it in spectral domain. So, what about how we can use it further? One way is to use it to extend these results to the problem on lattices. Many people discuss this problem on this conference. They seem to be popular. And it seems that it's very simple and natural generalization. And all these equations can be just transferred for the discrete case. So, what we have? We have a discrete analog of the. We have a discrete analog of the Gini-Waltz equation. We have just the simplest five-point tension for Laplace operator. And so, and we consider a problem of scattering on some finite scatter. The main thing is that we can still use Grand's formula as a tool to derive Winnier-Hopp equation in the same way, simple and fast. We can formulate it. We can formulate it in a similar way, but we need to find a discrete analog of the derivative of a normal derivative. But it can be done and it's not a bigger problem. Then when we have it, we can easily obtain all the linear Hopper equations. And since our technique based on a linear Hopper equation, it's universal, and then all the results can be instantly transferred to the discrete case. And here, what we can say is that it's like direct analogy between continuous problem and problem on lattice. So, we have an analogy for the derivative, which is some different separator. We have an algebraic function, which was analogous to this square root gamma, which is also some square root. Of the Winnier-Hopper equation, we changed from the U. We change from the real axis to the unit cycle. We have some plane wave, which also does some combination of exponent. Instead of the Fourier transform, we get a discrete Fourier transform, and we change a topology of the dispersion surface. So if it was a sphere, in the continuous case, now it's a torus. So it means that the So it means that the topology of the dispersion equation for Elijah is torus. And it's changed the solutions. Of course, it's a factor. It's a function. And here again, we can consider, for example, a varied problem. And instantly, instead of this matrix, we get this matrix we need to factorize. And it's also of Daniele Khrapkov type. It's also of Daniele Khrupkov type, but now it's not factorized in terms of cosine and sine function, it factorized in terms of elliptic function. So, this is the main difference, but analogy goes through till the end. Of course, what also we should do? We should like find an embedding formula for any scatter as it was done by Christier Shan. But what we want to do is to go a bit further. Can we find A bit further. Can we find like non-local embayment formulas that will work for a rational angle and angles? And it's still an open question. Nobody has done it. And it's a bit of a problem. So if you have an angle like this, and P is high, it's big. So then you need to define P edge green function for each angle. Function for each angle. So the formula becomes very bulky, so it's a kind of computational problem. So we will try to solve it. And a couple of words about what we can do in 3DM. It seems that in 3D situation is completely different. We can obtain a Vinear Copper question pretty easily. For example, Easily, for example, for the like simplest 3D problem of diffraction by a quarter plane. But we don't know what to do with this equation almost at all. We don't have even a formal solution for this equation. But what we can do, we can follow the recent approach by Rafael Ashi and Andrei Shai and use this equation as analytic continuation formula. And by studying And by studying the analytic continuation of spectral functions, we can analyze the structure of the space of solution, like its topology. And as Rafael showed a couple days ago, if we consider a problem with a plane wave, we have the following trace of singularities. We can try to continue functions behind the singularities. Behind the singularities in all directions, study the whole space and just point an answer. Whether we can, so these two lines correspond to the incident wave, and we can consider like a problem for a point source. It will have just another structure of the spaces solutions. So we can try to study both spaces and then kind of guess: can we use one solution to express another in a way? But of course, it seems not. In a way, but of course, it seems not to be that simple or trivial, and we don't have like a simple expression and any expression so far. But I will give you again a simple example of this ideology on the example of the wedge problem, which seems to be like very deep. So, we can use any of the Winnier-Hopper question I showed above, and we can study them as. And we can study them as analytic continuation formulas. And it's pretty easy to find that for the spectral function, the space's solution is a branch surface, which can have only branch points of the second order. And some analysis shows that it should have just three sheets. And if we know that the solution should be meromorphic on such a surface, we can easily build the solution we need because, like, build the solution we need because like any function meromorphic on such a function, the set of functions meromorphic on such a surface, it's a field. We find some bias function for this field and express a solution as a combination of such function. And then we kind of get an embedding. So the idea is embedding turnouts to work here a bit differently. So we find some bias solution and express them. So also we have a family. Express them. So, also, we have a family, but now it's this family is if uh so it's kind of it. So, the main idea to put it shortly is that behind any matrix we have problems that is an embedded formula and we know a very formal, simple way to find it. Thanks, Zantenos.
