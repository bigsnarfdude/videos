Yeah, perfect. So, question of the science, in particular in Mathematica, would be much more, and I think it is impossible to see the topic and a inclusion. Yes. So, here one problem is one, the commercial. So, there are. So, there are salaries, there are experiences differential for general dependency with generosity scientific people. There are representation, but superconcretos if we are focused. There are different situations generated in the scientific channel, particularly in mathematical science, and that we have worked on the project and mathematical progress. Because we have general events, and here we are not only episodes in a contact. In that existing corporal contact, many more subjects that graphic communities, when the points are in this episode that involved corporate compact, but the vase is all situations that are much more divided, but the nickel, the toddlers that have existed. Cos relative to this vascular aquí in some ways probably for Madison es conversar practices fixed to the right. And I think that my particular interest and a little of what I will see the subject, this of the consequences more epistemological that has the supremacy of women in particular. Subrepresentation, in particular, el laccience. So contextualizar estro, y judo que es la unica día porque tengo de Cifras. Trojel una Cifras que son of Chile, but the verdict that our vocabulary is all countries of Latin America and not distinct. So Chile, Poquiman, so Chile, but in Latin America, things are more parallel to the country. Yes. A majority of their recent. The minister of science, a radiography, with the 2000s. So the ingredients of the women are the university, at least in Chile, this superbiendigamos between sex, and a more women. It is a good notice, but when we have a sum tomorrow, the proportions like my imagination that we have dramatic. If you pregnancy, like in the history of the doctor, here. Here's a good son, and the typical solo and this particular dimension is impacted and one of those things. If you present their problems, it is not important. Because we also women in mathematics, they are not. But But if you have different impacts, like one that is the reality because the associated general are remunerated, so there is a impact in the recognition. But the recognition, if you are going to change, but also collaboration social collaboration of work, that is my. And I think that the general career leads to the scientific and technological agenda, also validated as social media, but we can see in contraposition to the associated care with the equity. So it is a first dimension of the collections that produce this vaja representation. But other impact Other impact is for the production of all. Yes. So, here there is some idea that generations, the feminist pictures, that plant that the participants reproduced, there are products historically, for a subject of people, also that are heterosexual and proprietary. Heterosexual proprietary, etc. produces a typical decision because the scientific connection, the subjectivity of the epoch and the subject that is concerned. If you know the practice human, I will human, if you are the experimental science, this is more facilitated, and we are going to do it. Problem is also in our discipline particularly that. In our discipline particular discipline that the mathematician is a object of study in abstract is much good proposito tamienda que yamos un abordaj que que teni uteto este problemos, es the world of public as a quantitative. Buscar of a Yes, that is a problem, nothing. I think we are very listening, and that's the problem. I think because also there is something of the experience that we much like. Experiencia, that is much more sudden, of the experience of women in colonized territory, which as well as the project of gender gap in science, the experience of women is not very likely. If that is very difficult for this measure, very difficult to find, etc. So, if we are one problem and that's a psychology, the agenda is in this. Because the women have charged in their city in this context historical context and that the manager is in conversation very pivotal.  And sexual victims, in that moment, if you want to exist with sexual terms, and we have passed, because it is existing, and the number is also a lucky, etymological epistemology, which we have recognized experiences with the number to nuncia and acceptance. So, Ablando. How do we deliver complex problems and how these problems, the interdisciplinary criteria with a parameter problem? If you want to decide and generalize that this type of problem and phenomenon, I can expensad a solar discipline in particular, but that is necessitating a whole mirror that interactive in three, that converse in three para can. It is to be typical of phenomena. And I, the study of general, not an experience interdisciplinary experience. Not the psychology, when you say that, is trying to investigate the intersex. If you want more fruit. So here I have the need to distinction from sexuality. If sex opens. If sex opens as the history of ideological macros, etc. And generally, and definitely, like the cultural construction that is part of this sexual difference. If it is the purpose of this complexity, this passion is that the sixteenth and second feminist, the social scientists, and And know, as the studios of generosity, part of a study that the psychological and biological perspective of general perspectives to the production of economic production. A problem very important, very important, is the idea of economy. It is the idea that in particular, you know, but one idea extended epistemology, the critical epistemology, which planted this principle in the valuations and the historical context, socio-political context that in this product without one of what this is known in the conclusion that, because it situated, the current and In the story, and this lugar is geography, but also context, much. All that is in what we know. So, if we prism, the same question, the question of the network, it is objective, if you are designed of the historical context. So, we could parameter this idea of situated presentation, where we can look at this. In mathematics, like the menu and conversation, Cool que conversademy difficil to some part and a good question to plant all the semana how we can plant that mathematical also with citizens. But the employee will not mathematica pura y there some send. Where can we look at? But the question that is, if we know that gracias, we don't metaphora, so in the language that utilizes to some discipline, and the subjects that there are because the study of the clitoris, which is extremely new, expression of the 25 and five studies. My five sierros first anatomy cligorized with the conel and clarify significantly like a truncated and all the world so conforming with this explication. Yes, probably what is the question or the question with the scientific community as to have financially. How to have financing, et cetera, a question so that it will regard a condition, of course, that allows other members and integrates the scientific community for a part, but all that more and what clitoris is not reproductive, but not the same feminine, more than a specific. So, to cultural practice of the difficulty, a scientific question that you have to resonate on the future. That's about the product. So, the motor for us, also a thing that analyzed, that has to see what the existing narrative is the human reduction. So, here have this language. Masculine is general description. Culinary general describe as active, auto-propulsive, capacity penetrating the human being, all adjectives that have a quote from activity. A philosopher who will charge the general and president, who refer to this as different types of metaphor in this relative reproduction human being. Because the societies there are a metaphor. There is a metaphor of the military, if you have a guerrilla, and the feminine organization is associated with a metaphor like the government, if possible that has to be passive, which is attacked, penetrating, and fertilized by the files. So, this is a like language in the road and this type of concern is not. So the question is and There are a mathematical authority that has been mathematical. And the algorithms are more mathematical that have a quality in particular that are not. If in other positions are not transparent, all for the population or quality of utilization. And this more is also the authority that is considered. The authority that is considered the language that is recognized as objective and institutable objects that mathematical language is that the definition of exit algorithms is defined because finance algorithms, because programming in funding. So the subjectivity of this group of people or people of someone in a porcelain. In a por example, for their example in this way, a particular example is the algorithm that is cup or occupancy because in the judicial system of the state of Florida, the United States. So, this occupied calculate the risk of residencia of the present. And depending on this request, this factor, the risk of residency, affected. Affect the content that we are going to do. And to calculate this, enter some things in a cell. Yes, of the question of this aqueous. So that's why this question, the African-American person, and Latin America, is because you have many macrobilars with toir supersonic policy very well because their policy and the people. So it was a lot of macrobiotic. So, it was a lot more that podcast of Carcelia was in Master Large. Yes, the ranger is not great. We are going to rival how this masculine is for people, but this algorithm. Yes, diplomats of world education could be a guideline to predict that professor is also vinyl, and also injuries. There are columns of Chile that refer this. So, what is the insulin is that trend associated with a point, and that is that what can be with calculation information. If you are trying to certain types of classifications, and So there were characteristics via textual and column. For example, the subject to esconal educational and economic education, but this same characteristic is not a woman, the rest is points. This because in their way that the sexual preferred women inferior to minimal education, algorithm, as a logic algorithm, that. How logic produced and produced logic exists as the producer and produced logic. So, how do you say that plants, like, that as well, with some colleagues and one internet much, like, Android and existing in our discipline that is mathematical, which don't. Discipline that is mathematical that where we are in the world, like, but this interesting conversation of this with more colleagues, in particular, with colleges of other people and attending interdisciplinary internet, so if the colleague Alejandro is. The collega alejandra restrepo yasta connectada, no alejandra, si mi puesta dragona signal, sita ahí por la si muen la estar pora que estoy perfecto per gracias. Solejandra. Tosi porientra la les po presentar alejandra, la doctor alejandra restrepo es activista feminí. John Restrepo is feminist activist social and residual university in Turkey in Colombia. It's my doctor in the studio of Latino Medicare studies of UNAM and its investigation is oriented to the study of Medicare and Caribbean and the epistemology and method of femista. And if it is compactive, Alexandra necessitates or no. I've been going to plant as one thing for the conversation, but I think that's the question. Super fun. For this invitation and also also in our mentors, wants to enormous graphics to possibly also these entrepreneurs. I want to say, I want to initiate, but the conversation that I provide, Andrea, no se Andreas, if you have the luxury, no, you have to say that this mixture, but they are difficult to logic, but there ok, bueno. Bueno, yo, qui sira inicíar con a matela clajingento. There is no porridge in this event initiated with the question that works as social work in a mathematical mathematics. If this space is an intentional para reflection, sobre discipline that is the propositions disposion of analysis of general analysis in the formation in mathematical formation. And I think exposing the precisely. Because the studies of general feminists are profundamental interdisciplinarities, and allows these students. We rigid my intervention. But what do you miss? Or is one of soy plants? So, I planted this discussion of social and feminist Latino-American feminists, and that the intention that I think Dr. Andrea verasando has epistemological and much interest for the mathematics, but I wanted to show a provocación already feminism and generalization in the generation of general. There are more perspectives. Ah, more of a perspective as with some elements of the socio-historical process of process for the immediate porque have some special interest in the feminist as a strategy of investigation. But one, if you are, and this in that all these questions, about some elements that can be very obvious, but I think that. Obviously, but I think it is important, also have these discussions about the feminine, also in the academia, which is recorded by the general generation that terminates epistemological significance of the feminist position. Theory generated as we alluded to a construction that. But in general, it references how social references organized by one of various cadres to different structures, social structures and patriarchal organizations. In this fundamental fund, It is fundamental to the relations of puberty relations. And that is important because we also are generally handling the hand that is a relationship of public relations. That is the difference between 2000, quantifying homes and women to criticize social and cultural social paraffin que configuration of general. The general in their nation. Because the situation of women, but Mujeres. But the analysis of generosity to vinarize and consider the distinct form of generose, possible, impossible, a critical position on the category of general category because binary category, but really not the category generation, if first analysis, if you market binary, and precisely that question, but my thoughts from the Perspective, I will say much more agile or consider many possibilities of generosity that we distinctly manage. There is the clarity and that generation women, a lot. Because the feminist theory, much more general, or the category of perspective in focus, and in the perspective. In the feminist perspective, if we have good feminist studies or feminist position, the pregnant position, if they centralize the situation of women. If they consider their interest for the situation of women in plural situations, understand the situations that can work to the experiences of women. Much types of women are not a condition of general condition. A condition of generation, a imminent creature of what the women, but in the real life, share many different others for different situations, oriented by situations of life that mark a difference between ours. The perspective general feminist perspective is expanded in 50, and so perspectives like the constructive perspective, How constructive, the colonial, the point of point, the Latino Americanism, other many perspectives there that are initially that will problematize that feminine, which is problematized, we will be much chaminos, so very problematized and incorporated many elements of the rigamento feminine. If we have the principles of the feminism, if the new family and the first part for a very equalitarist perspective, a question because we have not the rights that the various things in a northern absolutely binary because it is not possible for someone. Possibilities for other identities, two, two, gender, sexual identity, a forma, a two jajitas in the world that is average that in cajo an ah, the question because it is igual in the right parajeres. But the feminine a year is principally the principle that resurges diene una characteristic. Tiene una characteristic very different. And I think the idea of these equality, where the idea of women is a subordination, when they are the cultural queue allowing install ideas for signals, of the inferiority of women and feminine contraposition, in correlating the superiority. Un correlated to the superiority of the various masculine. This feminine contemporary feminine queen pregunta por la equal, but the conditions of gender conditions and situation of women is feminine contemporary feminism. For the cultural order for the oppression, for the subordination, for the identity of general and sexual identity, because they are not demographic, that is their situation. Demographeres who are their situation, and that is not analyzed, who answered not from the scientific investigations, that the social sciences are interpreted, not questioning, the theory, and for the contemporary. Refine redefining part of relations of political action. Of the experience of the women experienced the generation surge feminist and in this academic feminine baser fundamental feminism. When the participation in women in natural exacts, how social in humanities and different management, that there is a new reference in this. The accessories of the women access to superior entons fundamental. These questions were a possible good memory because the historical feminism studied in the academic studies. And in that case, the first rebate was good in the logic, but it is yonder that are experienced. They are particularly. When you have a theory, news because recognizes that the scientific moment is not. And to the question, the formas of investigation is pregnant to the metro implicants in the discussion. Implicanto is a discussions that are theorical, of course, investigators, and methodological, and that is inevitable, and a question about how produced the concern, or some discussions of epistemological episodes. So, we know that the feminist theory and this feminist theory refer to the science critical science, feminist sales science, not only a theory, not only reflections, methodological reflections. Reflections, methodological methods, or the methods, but apistemological economy that is questioning all the forms of production of production. One of those disciplines present and some allocations, planting in what is your exposition. In that context, between the tenths and the parents, this discussions Andre. Discussions. Andrea, the mention that they are one that are Sandra Harding, what 2000 is that we are working critical work in two minutes from the years, particularly revival and sociological, and trying to identify how distinct discourse or relatives are the feminist criticism. And this interest because we will. Interesting because we will have their position in distinct areas, disciplinary areas, in distinct sciences, campus condos, inclusion in the same way with distinct perspectives between the feminist students. It is empirism that surrounds the first Marcistor, feminists, socialists, the plantars, the point of feminist views, a critic. Minista, a mirror critical science that planted that science has to transform recognition and epistemic privilege of suggestions that can exclude. And that recovered is amid the science, that science is not only that transformation, and there the epistemic privilege and put in the center, the reality that we have in the feminist investigation. When there are When there investigators decide if there are investigation, like, for example, a John Kelly, but a valista and that when the pregnant and where they are in the women, their investigation change. The feminist implies that one responded to feminists of the nujeres that are more in the campo, of the natural science and exact science, present that in the In this revision, I am demolished from the scientific method as social sciences and humanities, and that plants have the science is a important manner that allows us and that the problem is really utilization of the metro of the season, but what. But what have you connected to the application of the science? That implicates good and applicable. But surge other than the distinctions, we have many queens with influence in the philosophy, of the condos that merge the calorie, much more in the social. Much in the social networks, the feminist modern knowledge that question feminists. So the Marcistas por design, how the investigators have many influences for what we recognize as positivism that many investigations in the natural exact and there are inclusion question: the same to the structure. The structure of academic institutions, such a patriarchal formation, and that have an identity: the project modern queen, a project illustrated, and that has implications. So, recognize that we have recovery, including that in our position in the feminist of the multiplicity of women. De la multiplicidados, with situados, situades, the multiplicity of women, or the pluralism by decided someone between what is a category of women. And the situation, however, also del universalism to central with a. And for this in these perspectives, because epistemological epistemologies can have a question to objectivity scientific, to neutrality, to apparently neutralize. Apparently, we are able to universalism and others, and that is the correction of the science. It is a science and submit that, and for that transcendental perspective that answered merging systematization, these epistemological economies that are. Epistemological epistemologies that Sandra Harding and so vista planted new questions also and also more resentment the colonial perspective and the Latino Americanists feminist studies. With that, how recognizing that we have these violence and these analyses that we have generated from the feminist perspective, we have distinct position. We have distinct positions and situations between the academic lives. We understand the others in these positions do not allow us. It's how we can think about a sociological perspective by example of the ensemble of mathematical engineering, the comprehension of mathematical comprehension how many transformations. In queue investigation in Mathematics, but really these philosophy, the historical science, the critical history, feminist science, put in question many of the things that in the academia we have naturalized. Yes, the revision of science, the science of the feminism, if you think that someone will also be. The champion of mathematics about the matemática and social science is absolutely instances and not because the first pregunta is or the first question that is because many questions and identifying to the women that we were very invisible the same. Visibilizadas, the children, and that we can recognize if we utilize criteria of scientific identity that is investigation. But of two forms, a queen also archaeology to identify the women in chaos and disciplinar, also all representadas in these. In these women. Yes. Luegos pregnant is critical in visibilization in the contributions of women alongside what parental relationship or affiliation anonymous women can plant with perspective. Unto the science with perspective of general to a feminist criticism to the science, everything else, and how to produce without these relations in the general. It is the most important criterion of the system in the academy, we have science, but also that transformation. How do you say a construct fundamentally masculine and middle, 30 porous discussions of how the science is guillotiness, a suggestion that is universal, but that really is not a nombre. If it is a nombre blank racial queue, characteristic. The responses, for example, in sociology of the sociological analysis. The sociological analysis is working for the experiences of the various experiences and the masculine masculine, of a very masculine perspective, that was also the perspective and point of nures, and we are there to say the perspective and point feminist perspectives. Other questions for example because the breaches of general because Because in the science in the natural exacts, and in the same way, there are more homes that we women, because feminized students, and other masculinities, because the sexual vision of science in ultimate, because the violence pasadas in general, or violence against nuns, reproduced in the academic voice. Academic. Académic spaces are lubar, where we have the positive general more comprehension of the society, of the reality, and in that space, persistent generosity of persisten distinct forms of violence where they are who are thinking. We are thinking, and we represent what naturalism is justified, because the association of rationality with durations, natural science, and exacts with homes, and masculine homes, and emotions, comprehensive emotions, bland science, social sciences, and humanities, with the women. In Fox, very promptly in the 20th century, and a very interesting. Ado very interesting about discourse objective and acceptable, but the veg utilization metaphor that all has to replicate that language of very precise, but the vegetable metaphor for example, as the Holando parabola to serve sexual divisions of sciences. Because the access women differential segment cultural. Seguotros markets or cultural, mixture of ours, women, negroes, women, indigenous women, women, transjues, generose gender, migrants, están in this homéas in the academic spaces between many other distinct considerations. The discussion of epistemological discussions are criticas, but also generas, different respuestas, epistemological disasters. But fundamentally, it's a political criticism in when the transformation, when the same feminist project, the inclusion of feminist projects, a terrible facility that revisits all the economic economies. With the interest, promoting a justice that would more of the men. Of the women, and that is just also a woman. I think we are in a very important moment, a historical and mobilization collectives are questioning the same academic spaces to the same academia. But that parents are new, as if emergent for us. Emergent for us others that we have popular of what the sociopolitical mobilization feminist and Latin America is really the cumulative women that was inserting to academia with general male star to play in fundamental also from the students who are generating it as a critical. We are with the conscience that there are critical analyses of general analysis, in the academic ambitions, that molest. That is to restore ourselves, which can rebuild and as melodium study president in the days more. Ooh, there is a ría como mi intervention to some yes and algunas de pronto algunas preguntas. Mucha gracias, Alejandra. Mecas verdad? Yes, me. Perfecto. Mucha gracias. Perfect. Mucha gracia. My must have a peroxide that we have to be the participants. So in the salon, you have a commentary question. O por el zuntan bien. No, ya, bueno, par tú. A little coro la questiona gabriela la ansa. But in the case particular of the mathematics, all with intention because the mathematician does not arrive at the scientific method, the clear. Claro, claro. And Mathematica pura, the experiencia no esco away as if, but the mathematical mathematical pura doesn't have relations with the experience of this production of mathematical production because study is good abstract that exit the articles in Mundore, but. The world, but the question of mathematics, don't you? Okay, we can oblige the context of Mathematica because no es mi, but I did the question: when study mathémáticas. Study mathematics when we enlist what the representation of the razion is the mathematics. The mathematics is logic, the racial mathematics and pura, and historically with the capacity of razion. Yes, because there we go to many queer. Mathematician to think about studying Matemátic, but sociological questions, however general vocabulary to study Matemáticas in the niñas. Claro, si, entiendo. Claramenta y a unclu my representation. Here I'm here. Gracias alejandra, well, amime deja tú po quasi pasmada, topesguir all discurso, but entiendo el pregunta que plante Andrea plant, but all plantamento y como eso la fundamento to the question of Andrea, where we have. How we are indagar for this por este with no citrado dento la mate. But I para unpo comes, but a trash antos takar es apregunta que me para se excelente que las reflecionamos, the reflecionemos algro da semana, de eso quier understand because no me que 2 critic. When the concrete criticism, the exposiste, but no mentee, for Peter Porzavor, what is the concrete critic of the metro scientific method, from this perspective? Y the feminist criticism is the science nuestama also criticized that the social sciences the science and the metro scientific method. As historical configuration social sciences, the sciences social sciences. Social sciences, the social sciences adopt the initial method, the scientific method, the experimental method, of the medieval method, the quantifiable method, as the possibility of possibility and the scientific idea that can be in the social science. In the feminism, principles, not only principles, from one It has a question to the objectivity, scientific objectives, when plants, the situations, the subjective garden, the emotions that are excluded by centrality of the razor, which exclude everything from the possibility of scientific possibility. The neutrality values, we have recognized that. We have to recognize that we are investigamos, with intentional and investigamos, and that is possible impossible to complete the subjective subject to investigation. That is not possible not to investigate and animal. I invite many more in the logic, I can manage, in Fox Keller, Sandra, Harting, between many others, who are planting. But But also the universal issues and entrepreneurs social queue social and critical do not recover or not recognize in the experience. Or, for example, put in my terminals in my area in my area, with myself and that is that the sociology, when explications of the structure of sociology. Social structure is obviously the experience and the variations and masculine experience to explain social classes, to explain the relationships of symbolic interaction, the phenomenology, because it would be universal value. Because in our experience of women, it is changing the changing interpretation of social dynamics for. The science have one, it is interpretation, explications, and how can the point of women do not via the feminists, and one or that reclamation, but in terms of the association, of the racial masculine, and of the emotions and objectives with feminine tiene unas profound. A profound implications in the management concept, in the management that is fragmented, if you have many more mathematics today, but that is a privilege because we do not majority and because many of the less inclusion in the vocabulary of ingredients in mathematics because the socialization of genero noses that we don't buy for the mathematics. We don't know that we are much. This reproduction systematic reproduction of the values of generosity for two suggestions that the jets that ingress in the calendar. And that is going to be permanently in the mind in which we investigations, because we investigamos unas and other things to es la utility of what investigamos, when the investigations that we have, and And what is it? That can go social, but this is much more expensive in a universal origin and in their citizens, for example, the numerical. Much in the case of mathematics, but for example, in the pharmaceutical science, in the science in reproductive technologies, because there are many reproductive technologies. Antide reproductive orientad to the women and varones. That is a piece of anti-conceptive para los barones, but retire the mercado or utilizar because the baronets change more stars, which are the same as the stars that are women when we have to do it. Because many of the technology is productive, we are. Of the technology and production, all for methods and conceptions and not the fertility are pensive for men. We are very difficult, as theories, how natural because no, my champion is with us, but also there is the red town, which completely accesses. Yes, in the mathematics, we have the presence of women, and And the question of the prejudices or the existence of women in mathematics, but also there are other natural sites, and the management that also an excluded women, for example, the astronomy. In the astronomy, many of the roads and adjacents that were in women that were the observators. Las queen los planos se lestes, how villamos, y sejación por, sejoci eso porte y. Discuto que que tes corte pero estamos en el time ya ya yo companier que que to nino tro question. So forces, Alejandra, gracias, Andrea por par las pláticas. Yoma antes que presunta más veera como una sidas que me suljer una apartir de lo que presuntaro ni la manera. President and presentaron. Almost in a session of general sector, also these people who are privileged, because they are homes, because they are blank, and they are proprietary. And that was the first thing that medicine validated as not to rent, or have ingresses because a department rents. Ted many libertas and And now that I preguntaros de las people who have en mate, it is much about the practicidad of the time that studies. So, all for mathematics puras, no needs more justification to study a problem that just. And that for me, as a great privilege, because we notiene la rent pagada, that the rencia guarantees, pues do not pregnant by a. No, you can preguntar for a concept that simplemente legustara nosa, okay, like mañana. So, por ah, we can gustar y ten ota projecto. I request the propositor to intervene for the internet. Y que tal gracias alejandra ni que estidado de la mín. Gracias collo. Does it for the commentario? I wanted to say how to judge for our method with some other things that we need to know, how similar. And this is much about the abstract to discern that we are working. But I believe that we can point to everything. But there are this investigation record for example subsidios. So when we start for the subsidiary grant for a project of investigation, then there are a general Importa there is a time that they are that they are good, and what are they buenos a veces? No, and that is good, that is determined that they are good. Well, there are toddlers like a hierarchization of what we are building that others. So, I also don't other scientists, in history, and more, but I think that can be very fancy. Because there are women who are accessed in the project. Mujeres that are accessed in projects that the rest, no? Because not all of the groups, and not all the women access to the subsidies. Because if it is, it is more universal, but results that there is a genericization also. There is a point because this problem is more important than each other, and that is the problem more important. If you are concerned, or with demonstration in abstract, you have In abstract, so that in that point values in our experiences of women experiences and that is how discussed one of the things. When the women have an analysis of abstract, that implicates a rational idea, but with the stereotypes of genes. Ya criado, alga namanera, star rompiendo, y más tensar por example bueno ustedes están en tam. When a poem are students, and one or the women, the mathematics has generated or not. When a studio is coming a problem or resolving a problem, or this proponent of a project. Osta proponent project investigation is the piece that much more that the varones can all plant very well in the evaluation that appears to the same criteria for homes and for women the real situation of women that we don't have the same conditions of barones. Notemos established other cargo colleagues. And I agree, Unam, and it is also, and it is situations for them, in the restriction of the works of the cuid, and the parent when the heterosexuals have also the maternity and paternity many gradual students and the veterans are. Plaza includes the vecas on the women, not the badones. And if you have many situations at the door of the production, we know a areas that are particular, but what is that of the general analysis, which are uses that in establishment in the possibility of analysis about the objects that are studied in the interior of their form and within it, but the reader of ergencia, all nuemos. Todda via superado, all the problematic problems of generosity that implicitly para las women and para los dissidents to ergiencia include and much a rational scientific rationale. Mucha than Alejandra, many pa la questionas for the chat for the verdict that we are tiempo. We have a break, and the Carla Fardía que la video here. So So that's much more conversation for the violence that we have a time to tomorrow conversations. Muchas gracias. Muchas, gracias. Gracias. So we have a concluding minutes more for the charla de carta.
