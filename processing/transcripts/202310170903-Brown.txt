Welcome to the topic of the conference. So, what I'm talking about today is part of a joint ongoing project with David Jordan at MDF. And I want to say it's really the story about how I've come to appreciate a certain action terms to disregard in my research. Okay, so let's start with part one, which I'm going to just call table setting. What's the background that we need? Okay, so what's the background that we need? I'll start with the definition. So this is going to be fixed the reduction group G, a surface sigma. Here, my surfaces are just going to be topological surfaces, no complex structure or anything like that. We can have a boundary. It won't come up. I will come up. And this first definition I want to give is the G character stat. And this is going to be, I'm going to denote it by chi sub G plus sigma. And this is going to be the space of homomorphisms from the fundamental group into G. And what makes it a stack is I'm going to be taking the stacking quotient. So here this is stack key quotient by conjugation. And I'll say one of the reasons I'm using a stack quotient here instead of some quotient that gives me another variety is that this is going to have a lot of nice properties that the character variety doesn't have that are going to be very relevant for the story today. So it's not just to feel fancy. Let's do the first Let's do the first example. And this is where sigma is going to be just a disk. So phi1 is just 0. So the disk is contractible. And now what we're going to see is that for any reductive group, what I have here is there's only one group homomorphism. So I can just think of it as a dot. But I do have this GIT quotient. I remember stabilizers. GIT quotient, I remember stabilizers. So it's somehow a point mod G, which means I still have a G action will be relevant in the story. Okay, so that's one example. We can already see segments different character varieties. Example two is going to be sigma is going to be torus. Here the fundamental group is just two copies of Z. Two copies of Z. This is my brain fabric. And so the character variety here, what I'm going to have is commuting pairs, G pairs, up to this conjugation. So the fact that my pairs of elements in here commute, this means that if I'm taking them as matrices, I can get them into Jordan canonical form at the same time. Form at the same time. So ignoring higher Jordan blocks, I can really identify them when they're eigenvalues. And like I said, conjugation, I can actually get them into that form. So here what I'll have is T cross T. We're at the top, this capital T is going to be the carton. I'm just write that. Carton, the maximal torque. But it's not just that. I also have an action by the vile group. And I apologize in advance. I have both the vile group and vile algebra in this talk, and they're both values, very different values. Okay, so this is what we have here. Next, what I want to do, talking about these, is I want to consider the category of plasma-color cheese on this character stack. How I want to justify talking like this, so that's a coherent cheese, is first I want to make a couple of remarks here. Remember, so if I have x, just some affine scheme, then this quasi-coherent Sheaf category is looking just like auto modules. So, in that sense, it's very concrete. Another thing I want to talk about is, in general, if I'm looking at vector bundles on some surface, these are generalized to coherent sheaves on that surface, which are examples of quasi-coherent sheaves on that surface. So, I have this sort of nesting of categories, and this one here, one reason we work. And this one here, one reason we work more generality is this one has the best floature properties. So even though the definition, which I won't put up here of what a quasi-coherent sheaf is, is much longer than a vector bundle or a coherent sheaf, what we get for that is that this category is a Boolean. Meaning I can do a lot of operations with these sheaves and know that I still have quasi-coherent sheaves. Okay, let's do an example. Okay, let's do an example. Let's do example one again. So now what I want to look at is quasicolar and sheaths on just a point with a g action. So over the point, what I'm going to have for my sheaf is just that one fiber, so it's v, some vector space. And I have this action, g, which I'm remembering, and so I get this action. I'm remembering, and so I get this action on this vector space 2. And so, from there, what I see is any positive coherent sheaf here is going to be just a representation of g. So, this looks like red g. Okay. So I have this. I'll say for more general surfaces. I'm not going to give a characterization, but I want to use the idea of locality. So, somehow, one, I think, property that I love about surfaces, it's very fundamental, is that they always look like disks locally, right? Away from the boundary. And what I want to do is somehow get a categorical version of that. And so, this inclusion is going to do something in the other direction between the Between the character stats. And this is just because we're looking at maps out of the fundamental group, so we switch. And this is going to get us repositorant sheaves over, I'll just say over d2 over sigma. And this, I just argued, looks like ref G. So this again looks like graph G. So the idea that we get from here is that somehow in the same way and through the same mechanism that our surfaces always look like disks locally, this category of quasi-coherent sheaf is somehow locally looking like REPG. Are there questions on this? So So, this is maybe hand-maybe. There's a sense in which it's made formal, which is a theorem by Binsby, Francis, and Madler from 2010. And it's that this category of quasi-coherent sheaves on this character stack is isomorphic to, I'll just write it here, explain what it is, this thing called factorization homology. This thing called factorization homology, which is really a homology theory that lets us take some surface and assign everywhere G and get a new category. Right, so here's this. I want to say it's called the homology theory, not just for fun. Theory, not just for fun, it also has some nice excision properties over this. If you plug in a disk, you get disrupted back, stuff like this. So, this is a oil-paid thing. So, why would we bother going through all of this? Very fancy description of some cheese. So, one major benefit is that now we have some. Is that now we have some idea for quantization, which is in the title of this conference. So that's very nice. And this idea is that I can take in this above formulation, this category rep G and replace it with rep G, which is just another way of writing. That's another way of writing representations of u, q, g would be like this. And why would this, besides the fact that I've written a small q, why would you call this quantization? One reason is that they're both monoidal categories. This thing is a symmetric monoidal category, and this one's graded. So that is the way in which we have some product that we're performing. Are there questions on this? On this. Okay, so this is nice. We have some idea that maybe if I wrote Q here, I'm justified in saying whatever category I get here is a quantized version of the quasi-power cheese. Is that the theorem? No, without the Q is not the theorem. If you write Q, then this would be co-definition. Yeah. Question. Other questions? I wonder if there's one, the second one's more likely. Okay. So one thing that we may want is sort of a more concrete way of dealing with this. And for me, what this means is a topological victory. And how I want to do this is by talking about skein categories. Okay. And when I say a topological picture, what I mean is I want to build a diagrammatic model for refugee. So, how does this model business go? This is as follows. So, I'm going to say let A be a ribbon category. So, urban category being a category. Ribbon category, being a category that somehow acts like ribbon grass, meaning it has a braiding, has duality, it acts some way framed. I'll give an example. Here's one example. Here's another simpler example. So the thing I want to define is the category rib sub A of ribbon grass. So A Grass. So A colored ribbon grass. And this is going to be objects. What I do is I'm going to look at a disk. And I can have points in this disk. And these points are going to have objects of A here. My points are going to be oriented, which for a point just means. Going to be oriented, which for a point just means they have some sign associated with them. So that's nice, but the real juice of this category is in morphisms, which are, I guess, spanned by a job feature. And say the load cap for what it is. So if I have some points that So, if I have some points down here, some points up here, like this, what I'm going to be spanned by is ribbon grass. Just to mean grass embedded in my thickened disc. Their vertices can have morphisms on here. Here would be a morphism from V conserved W to U, like this. So, it's going to be spanned by such things. So, I could have one of these plus another one. I think of these as going up. I think of these as going up. So they're going to be spammed like this. And then the composition is vertical stacking. Yeah, linear span. Other questions? So here's the fact is that this rib A is also a rib of categories. I think this is somehow the sanest way to think of the axioms of the ribbon category is I need to have some grading. Here, this is my grading, so V and W. So V and W, they switch around. I need to have some evaluation map, which goes from V dual, so nothing, to the base field. And this will look like this. I need to have some code valuation, which is going to look the other way. Dual and V. I need to have some other stuff. These are the main players. And they need to sort of, there's a bunch of axioms for how they interact. And in this setting, they're They interact, and in the setting, they're gonna all the axioms are gonna be sort of look like Reidmeister moves and stuff like this. Your graphs are not ribbon. I'm just not drawing the framing. Yeah, yeah. It's a long-standing tradition. So this word ribbon means that these are framed, but I think it's traditional not to do this during talks. So this category. So, this category, it's certainly very topological, right? It has a lot of drawings. But what I wanted was some model for my actual ribbon category, which in my example is Rept. So how do I get actually ReptuG here? What I'm going to do is make a functor. I do is define my functor. So So it's going to be called the Russia T and Dry functor. And this is going to be a category functor from rib A to A, R T A. And how it's going to be defined is through those following things. I'll try to do them all in orange so they're all organized. So if I have some points here, this needs to get sent to the cancer pile. This needs to get sent to the tensor product alone. So these, say if this one's positive, if I have one that's negative, that's the corresponding going to the dual. There's this. There is, if I have some one of these vertices, a coupon, this has to get sent to that morphism, which is sort of a same requirement. So there's this. I have my grading has to get sent to whatever the grading of my category is. The grading of my category is coevaluation, or evaluation has to be said to evaluation of my category, and this has to be sent to co-evaluation. So a sort of a theorem by these two when they were first defining this is that once I've demanded all of these things, I get a unique functor here. Are there questions about this? So I have this functor in place. I want to use it to build this topological description. And what I'm going to do is sort of build some category instead of rep with A, such that this function is giving me a category full of verticals. So in writing how this is going to go is the skiing category of first I'll just do a disk. It's going to be just to write it, the most compact way I can write it would be rib A mod middle of RT A. I've unpacked that sum. I found back that sum that I have objects is the same as root A. And now morphisms are also up to stain relations. Or sort of a big deal in this field. And what this means is if I have two Two of these tangles, these graphs going from one set of points to another, then I'm going to say that they're equivalent to that. So, if and only if Rt of one equals RT of the other. Okay, so that's how I'm going to make this. And now a theorem, I actually don't know who wrote it down first, but it follows, maybe it was Reshitik and Trivayo already, is that this O-Call scheme category of the disk is now isomorphic. So now I've managed to take my ribbon category and make a very fancy description of it. Very fansome description of it. Other questions? So I've done it for a disk. For general surfaces, I'll just say what the difference is, is now I'll have my objects can be points anywhere to my surface. And my morphisms Morphisms are going to be these embedded graphs. Now, in my thicking surface, this goes behind. Here like this. So this is a, it's going to be spanned by such graphs. And now my skein relations, how are they going to work? Is they're going to be applied over any cylinder that I have a metal. So this is looking like... So this is looking at V cross 0, 1, embedding into the sigma cross 0, 1. And where I've done that, I can make sense of what the rest you can derive function gives me, and I can apply spin relations both for it. So I have this, which I worked out. For the story's. Worked out. But the story started with wanting to talk about quasi-coherent sheets. And you could say, one of the things that I used to argue about quasi-coherent sheets being nice is that they look like modules with some algebra. You could ask, is there some module algebra thing going on here? And the answer is yes. We still are acting working with modules and some algebra. And what does that look like exactly? And what does that look like exactly? I'll at least have this. What that looks like is the following. Theorem by G.A.S. in their paper on proving Witten's finiteness conjecture. They find that the Skein category of sigma is in fact isomorphic to some category of modules, for something called the Skein algebra. Of modules, for something called the Skein algebra. Modules, but they have a bunch of decoration here. So this is not the normal Skein algebra, which I'll talk about in a second, but the internal SCAN algebra, meaning it's an algebra, not a vector space with extra structure, but an element of our rooting category with extra structure. So it's like this, and this happens. I have to do some frequent completion, and here I have to. And here I have to restrict to some nice subset strongly equivariant. So they have a lot of decoration, and here, I just forget, I think maybe the frequencies too. So there's a lot of extra decoration in red, but somehow we still have morphisms for some algebra. And what you'd expect. I want to say, no, if you've seen the just the scan. Just the skein algebra of a surface before. How this shows up in this picture is if I look at endomorphisms in the skein category of just the image. And this is going to be something I'm focusing on for a big part of the talk now. So I'll say it looks like. So now I have these ribbon graphs embedded, but here there are no points, and here there are no points. No points, and here there are no points. So, what's embedded just has to be some sort of loop like this, which really looks like. So the elements in the scanning algebra just look like embedded loops, and the product structure is the same as this composition here. The product structure is going to look like just stacking. So I can put one on top of the little together. So, this is the sort of the famous Skina algebra, which, say, Adam is an expert on. It could be embedded in graphs, not just in the game. Yeah, yeah. You could, I mean, any endomorphism of any algebra would be, or of any object would be an algebra structure as well. Yeah, oh, yeah, no, sorry. I misheard the comment. Yeah, it could be that. For SLT. That. For SL2, you end up not needing vertices here, but for higher, for different categories to do. Question? Okay. So this is a bunch of background. What I want to talk about is sort of two actions which are famous that show up in this skein picture and sort of what Uh and sort of what they are and how they're related. So a bunch of stuff. Yeah, one of the sort of the arts of this game algebra stuff is that if you don't have some really heavy machinery like this, you have to really understand these ribbon categories well to know what actually is embedded here and what the relations should be. So, we really need not trigger that. So, part two is a tale of two actions. And the first action I'm going to call topological, which is that if I'm looking at my scan algebra of the boundary of some Of the boundary of some three-manifold, this actually acts on something I haven't defined called the scan module of that same three-manifold. So we can picture the scan module. It's very much the same rules here of embedded graphs inside my p-manifold, but now I don't have an algebra structure. There's no obvious stacking. So this is a nice action. And then the other And then the other action is the one that shows up in the AJ conjecture. And this is the action of two different operators on a space of functions that includes the color of Jones holiday male. And one reason that, and so, One reason that, and so the colored gems polynomial I'll describe in a moment, but it is built from skein relations. And there's this idea going back decades, the earliest I find it in work by Delta and Froman in like the late 2000s, is that in some sense these are the same action. These are the same action. So let's talk about what this means and how these are different, and maybe a little bit why you would think this is the same action. I will also say, I think my understanding is the fact that these two actions are My understanding is the fact that these two actions are the same as sort of the standard, the set of ideas is what motivated the AJ conjecture, or sort of what came into people declining this conjecture. Okay. So first let's talk about the algebraic action. And I said this has to do with something called the colored Jones polynomial, which is defined by, I take this Rashi-Tugen tribe functor. I want to evaluate it on, say, On, say, a knot. And the one knot I can draw. And what I do is, I'm going to color it. This will be repQ SL2. I'm going to color it with a unique n-dimensional irreducible representation. And this thing, after some normalization, gives me a large polynomial. It depends on n. Depends on it, instead. So I did this. I said it's an action, so I need the action to be done by something. And it's going to be done by the q file algebra, which I'll denote by luck won't be w. And so this I'm going to take as L and M has two generators called L and M and they Q cumulate. And they q-cummit. So you can really think of this as sort of a q-difference version of this beloved vial algebra, differential operators. And how is it going to act on such a thing? So it acts on the set of functions from z to with c drawing q. And this action is going to. And this action is going to be, if I take L f of n, this is going to be shift plus 1, and then m is going to be multiplication. And we can check that this is indeed compatible with this relation. Okay, so this is one of the actions I want to talk about. The one that we want to compare it to is this topological. And the setting that this logical action is going to come in is going to be m is S3 minus some not, the same not in fact. And so its boundary is going to be the torus. So what we've seen already is that if I look at the G character variety of T, this looks like T cross T not W. T cross T mod W, other W. This is, I had it written here. I don't know if that John's thing is right. So I have this. It's still true if I take functions on them. But here, because I have this quotient, such a quotient that I can understand this is t plus t for w invariant functions. Okay, so here the setting is Here, the setting is: I'm looking at rep q SL2. So g equals SL2. What are we going to get? T, this maximal torus looks like just C star. So here what we have is this is going to look like weird polynomials and two variables, mod and action of z2, the vowel algebra of decimal two. algebra, decimal 2.2. And in particular, the action here, what it's doing is it's sending something in here to its inverse. And this is really just the fact that I don't want to differentiate between these two points in my final course. Okay, so I have this. Let me leave myself space. I want to ask how does this act? How does the associated skein algebra act? Two cell two. Q C L 2 is towards act. And in particular, I kind of want to simplify my life. I want to ask: how does it act just on a parallel copy of this dot? So first thing I'll say is that here, this is a quantization of this. And I'll ask you to take, if you have my word, when this is the quantization, that replaces this algebra with W. With W not the same C2 action. Meaning now I just, instead of these things commuting, they Q commute. So I have two parts of this action. So say this is a strand of my knot that's close to the boundary. What happens when I include this L, which I think of as the longitude of my knot, what happens is that it looks like I've just done some tabling. Tabling. Included a parallel copy. And then similarly, if I include this meridian, what happens is I sort of include this, and then I can use my scan relations to see that this is q, q inverse times the original thing. Okay, so these are our two actions. One is this stuff here. Is this stuff here, and the other one is this stuff here. So, what are the pictures? Oh, this thing? Oh, yeah. So, this is like I have my really schematic. So, say this is like S3 minus 0, and this is like this force boundary. I have some action. I have some action which is including another copy of the boundary on there. And what I'm saying is sort of this line here is I'm including a copy of a meridian. And this one here is the longitude. And the white thing that's already there, which I guess I'll change colour and make it orange. This thing is just going to be. This thing is just going to be sort of a parallel copy along here. And the way I'm the reason I'm restricting to that is I somehow hear I'm acting just on some copy of the knot. And what we can see is this cabling is somehow shifting what's going on. So this is a shift, and then this meridian is really this multiplication. And I've cheated a little bit. And I've cheated a little bit. Here I'm coloring everything with the fundamental representation, which is why I'm not getting ends or anything. Good question. So let me see how much time. Oh, plenty of time. So here the idea I'd like to put forth is that the difference, so kind of one key thing you can see is that here I have q plus q inverse, and here, if it was f of 1, I would just select q. Here, if it was f of 1, I would just deselect Q. So there's some discrepancy. So discrepancy is because one is actually the action of still a skein algebra, still of a tortoise. Film of a tortoise, but here the crucial difference is it's rep QT. So somehow I'm just looking at representations colored by this carton instead. Okay, so that's the big difference. I'll say a little bit, one key word that kind of comes into this is parabolic. comes into this is parabolic induction. And we somehow restricted to this carton. And just also to orient ourselves a little bit, in this SL2 case, we get these famous skein relations like this. Or maybe is it the other? I forget which way it is. Is it this way? Usually it's the opposite. Usually it's the opposite way, but that's okay. Alright. Then probably this one will also be the opposite way. And here, if you have T, the skein relations will look more like this. So I'm going to have more of just a Q commuting situation. So that's the difference. Alright, so let's talk about one reason we would expect this to be true. So, one early hint that something like this would be going on is that if I let's look at what this is quantizing, right? So idea, if I look at the T, just the T representation variety of the torus, right? This is pairs of commuting matrices that are diagonal, that already commute. So this is actually just all it's just pairs of things in this maximal force, it's already committed. And so its function. Function like this is going to look just like Lorent polynomials. And crucially, a difference between this and what's happening way over here with all of SL2 is I'm missing this VQ action, which kind of is coming from the discrepancy. So I want to stop and say, I think this is very beautiful. Say, I think this is very beautiful because up until I started thinking about this, this was an action I always swept under the rug in my taps. I told the oil it's there, and everyone hated it. And now I've come to appreciate what it means. So what it means is we need to use this Reptice game theory. Sort of the question is how do we go between Go between rep QG and rep Q D. And I'll say there's an obvious famous group that's sitting between them, which is the Borel. So, in one way, it includes into G, and then maybe you're used to. And then maybe you're used to thinking of the maximal torus and fitting into the Borel. But I want some symmetry going on. So actually, I'm going to think of it, Borel as projecting onto T. And this is, I can think of T as the organization, my BREL. So this is what we need to get the category theory to all work out. Okay. All right. All right. Are there questions while I raise the board a little? So now what I want to talk about is my current work with David, where we're figuring out how would we take this scan category definitions and really allow us to go have regions with different theories in them. Maybe I have one question, but I'd like to start. Maybe I have one question, but I don't have to throw them up. When you had a theorem about internal scain algebra, was it working on surface or surface or puncture? So you need to puncture the surface in order for the internal scan algebra to make sense. I wrote this little, like I wrote very tiny this SRT. There's like you can restrict to a subcategory and get back the unpunctuated surface. You're right, it is much simpler without, yeah, with that boundary. So, part three is going to be defects. So, I'll start by giving a topological picture of what's going on. And the big difference is now we have to do a little bit of a picture Now we have stratified spaces. So before we were sort of working with green manifolds and surfaces that were just all the same, and now we want some embedded sub-manifolds. So maybe an example of how this could be is I'll have, I have again my My NOT complement has the torus boundary. Here, what it could say is: I went down here for it to be G region, I went up here for it to be T region, and in between them, in the sense of it, I have some surface which is associated with B of a rel. And I want a local model. Over surfaces, what this looks like, and sort of my again, a surface in this world typically looks like a disk. Now I can have g disks and t disks, and the new thing is between them, I want to have a disk with a V defect in it. And when I thicken that in order to do my skein theory, that defect becomes a surface. That defect becomes a surface. And as before, with the first definition of skin category, I want embedded graphs, right? But here, my embedded graphs will also, we have to think, are also stratified. So they can be something like this that can pass through. So a big difference is now we have stratified Stratified ribbon grass. Sure, maybe you always think of grass as stratified spaces, surfaces, spaces. And a crucial thing is I want them up to stratified isotopy. So what stratified isotopy means is that I have sort of some So, there's some skein that comes and it passes through this defect, so looking down right now, this is not the same thing as the same skein that avoids that defect. So these are not the same. They're not stratified isotopic. And one reason I may want that is because the whole reason I was setting this up is I wanted somehow to move between these regions. I wanted somehow to move between these regions, right? To have somehow a skein algebra here acting on a skein module here. And so I want to be able to move between them as an algebraic operation, right? It's not just a topological operation. It needs to involve this data somehow. And the way we impose algebraic relations in this game theory is through this recipe and trial function here. I'm a little bit confused. I mean, usually you have webs or graphs in three-dimensional spaces, but when you do this. Species, but when you drew this picture with me, it sounds like you are in the group three. Where are you then? We're here. Yes. Yeah, okay, so it's my coupons. Let's say this one is B, yeah. Yeah, so here there are G coupons. Oh, what card did I use? Here there are G coupons. And here, what I need is some coupon. It's going to be a morphism in REPQT. So I have a mixture of different. So, I have a mixture of different morphisms and objects. When you drew this rectangle labeled by B, what do you mean by that? Yeah, yeah. So, this is like a surface. So, whatever I associate B in a surface, it will be a curve. And then in a three-manifold, there will be a surface. But B sounds like bored? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So in the G side, these strands are colored with representations of. Strands are colored with representations of G. And on the T side, the strands are colored with representations of G. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And so somehow we need to make sense of how to move between them. You look like you have 18. I don't know what it means to label as square by B. So it means, so one way you could think of this is, why don't we talk afterwards? Because I think it's a little nitty and it was very fun to figure out. Was very fun to figure out, so it'll be fun to talk about. Okay, yeah, so moving between them is going to be this algebraic operation, and I'll say off the bat, you need some data to make sense of how to move it, some algebraic data. And so before this algebraic input was just this rep qt. Now what I need is that. I need rep q qt. Qt and I need a functor to rep qb, but not just rep qd. I need it to the drinfeld center of rep qb. And this is debraded opposite. So I have this. And I'll say, if you haven't seen the Drenfeld center before, the difference between a functor from these two to this, these two and the Drenfeld center is I have a half grading. I have a half grading. So the extra data is a half grading. Meaning, if I have something from here, I know how to break it past anything in here. But if I just had two objects in here, I can't break them past each other. Okay, so that's part of the data. The other data is I need some way of making sense of graphs that are just exactly in my surface. So this is going to be something from the category. So this is going to be something from the category I'm not defining now. Planar diagrams over B to rep QB. So this is some sort of lower dimensional version of the Russian-Taria functor. You can think of it as I need to be able to draw curves with coupons and stuff just in a surface, not a thickened surface, and make sense of them as morphisms in B. This is the data I'll need. And how are we going to do this? As I'll say definition, Rib B is now going to be the category of stratified ribbon grass that Adam and I are going to talk about at length after this. And then the And then the thing is the functor from Rub B takes graphs like this. And I want to get something in rep QB, the bra. Well, so I'll just call it RTB. And it's constructed as follows. So it's in a series of steps. Step one is: I'm going to project. is I'm going to project tangles onto the defect. So this purple thing is what I'm calling the defect. What I'm going to do is just pick any projection and project down onto there, right? Which is, if you're wondering to say this is well defined, this means I have to check the randomized or moves in some mixed version. So I'm doing that. So I'm doing that, but if I project down, I could end up having a crossing on a surface, which doesn't make sense. Crossings can't happen in surfaces. So what I need to do is replace crossings with the ha grading coupon. So here I've used the fact that I have some functor. I've used the fact that I have some functor, right? I have some morphism here. I can make sense of it as a morphism in route B. I have objects, I know how to make sense of them in B. And this replacing crossings is why I can't just go to route QB. I need to go to the general center. So I need to be able to make sense of these crossings. Okay. And then the third thing I have to do is evaluate, as in this planar graph. So I'm going to evaluate it like this. Okay. So that's it. There's a theorem between me and Jordan. It's not published because it's part of the LinkedIn project, but it's been worked out. So it's that this RTB is well defined. Is well defined and it's unique in a way analogous to this RT, to just some marketing category. So this theorem is saying is one, we were allowed to do this, it makes sense, and then two, it And then two, it's kind of reasonable to call it rush to contribute functor because it has a lot of the same uniqueness properties. All right. So now I've done all this setup. What I want to do is my last five minutes explain how to use this for the stain category. So now We can have the scan category of here. We want to write something perhaps crazy big. So we have B, we have G, and T interpolating between it. And here I have a surface, but now my surface can have different regions, right? So in my triple chuck, I could sort of have it be the V T on one side and G on the other side like that. Like that. I want to say that this is again as objects as before, but now I can have my points living anywhere in the surface. And sort of here it would be representations of T, here it would be V, here would be objects I grab T, so we don't call that C. This. So we don't call that C, like this. That, and morphisms are now going to be the stratified moving graphs with stratified isotopy plus skin relations. depending on the region. Meaning, if I'm just over here somewhere in the T region, I'm going to use the Reschtick-Kinteri functor for FQT. So in the B region, one for FQB. And then here I'll use this new functor to get my scaling relations. Okay, so there's. Okay, so there's that. I want to say one, and this works, but one note is that we no longer have some theorem where this looks like some scan algebra that's very decorated modules somewhere like this. We no longer have this. Have this sort of statement for sort of some category theory reasons, but a cool thing is that once we restrict to a cluster chart, in a way I'm not making precise, you do get a sort of a statement like this. So you need to fix a triangulation, make sure those edges are invertible, and then you do get such a statement. And you get flips. So that's, yeah, that was figured out pretty good. Okay. Okay, that is what I wanted to talk about. I'll just say to sell this a little more, so in some ways this is much worse to work with. But some nice things is first, we sort of get cluster coordinates showing up. I guess I'm just telling this blog right now. And the reason you may think they'll show up is that this fixing this burrel is really fixing the flag over some point. So you would expect clusters to show up. Shows up. And because of this, dealing with this discrepancy, this is also a good setting to quantize the A polynomial, which also has Purl reduction. And also because of this cluster realization, you would expect if there's a stainy description of Q-non-relimization of the quantum trace map, it would be in this setting. Okay. That was my, that's what I wanted to say. Are there more questions? So, from this understanding, do you see Riemann Gerbot correspondence with the Demonzo? I have no idea. If someone here has any idea how that would go, I'd be interested to hear it. I do have a one-site description, very precise. Yeah, you are. Yeah, then you already have a U cube over G, then D mode 0 over G mode B is probably not really a P over there. Yeah, I think the place I would start to know if the defect part of the story would be useful is to see if there's any parabolic reduction. Right, right. Then Jolen uses that kind of thing in his other paper. Ah, okay. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't think this will solve every problem in math. Borel by carbonic or T by D V. I think so. I think so. So the only input that you need is these this thing. What are you computing with this five? What are you computing with this functor on the right? Meaning, what is the image that you are assigning to the empty set? Oh, to the empty set? So, to the empty set and to a not between the empty set and the empty set, as happens with the recent thinking derived factor. For the recent thinking derived factor, when you have a knot seen as a partition between the empty set and the empty set, for g equal to SL2, you get the Jones polynomial. Right, so you've got something similar here? You, I would expect, I haven't worked it out, but so if your knot was just on one side of the defect and not playing around with it, I would expect you to get, you do rashific and drive first and you end up here, and then you do this and you end up here. And this dysfunctor is really induced by, I had it written here, by just the inclusion of the borel into G file. Into G. One thing that's sort of surprising is just if you have a little T region anywhere, it really simplifies things. Because you have this little commutative region and sort of you... Where's my purple, my defect? So you can picture, if I have some crossing that happens on one side of the defect, and this defect, I think, it was out of the plane or out of the chopper. Plane, or out of the chalkboard, I could just move it to happen above. Oh, should it be the other way? Yeah, like that. I don't know why that was so hard to draw. You can see I can do my crossings if at some point I cross under, you can cross. So there can be a big kind of unraveling difference. Yeah, yeah. So here, the tricky thing is I have here, like, this is a crucial point, like, two points here. And sort of what you could think of is these points are being moved around each other inside the defect. So if I have some coupon in the defect, I can't take it in or out of the defect, but I can move it inside the defect however I want. And if I do the same thing with a coupon, If I drew the same thing with a coupon instead of a crossing, then it wouldn't be true. But this crossing is really just two strands, this makes it true. That's a good question, because that was confusing. And did this resolve this question about this AJ vector and the reaction to AJ? It does not solve the AJ conjecture. That would be very nice, though. It does. We do have, so actually this whole project of defining this started off with trying to quantize the A polynomial in a way that makes, would put it like, it would make sense that it acts on skeins. And these definitions kind of, we stumbled upon them while we were trying to do that. So it does, because, yeah, it does give you a very like. Because, yeah, it does give you a very computational way of doing that. Like, using this technology, you could expect to be able to make a SAGE program that spat out quantized A polynomials if you're a very patient person.
