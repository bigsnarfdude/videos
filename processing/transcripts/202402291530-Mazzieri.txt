This talk will be for for large part a sort of prequel of the previous talk, right? Because there was this very nice related result presented by Jose. So we try to make a step back to see how this secret. This secret of idea may be applied in a very, maybe in the simplest situation, I would guess. So we start from the very beginning. We are in a planar domain for simplicity, even though, I mean, one can generalize this result also to higher dimension. But in 2D is where you get the most clean presentation. So you start with a 2D. So, you start with a 2D boundary, okay, smooth boundary, smooth domain, at least of class C2, satisfying this Diricle boundary value problem, so La plus U equal minus two, U equal to zero, and the boundary. And let me also justify this problem. It's very natural from several point of view. First, because it's very simple, also because it has a very nice fluid dynamical interpretation. For example, if you like, that was this fluid dynamic. That was this fluid dynamic interpretation, was already mentioned in the original paper by Serin. And in a sense, you can think of you as the velocity of a steady linear flow which is homogeneous, incompressible. So the simplest possible scenario that flows through a cylindrical pipe with cross-section omega. So, okay, the domain omega. Okay, the domain omega would be the cross-section of the tube, and inside this tube, inside this pipe, you have your flow, and u is just the velocity of the flow. So the condition u equal to zero, the boundary, mean a no-sleep condition. So in a sense, the velocity at the boundary, at the boundary of the tube is zero, it says that your flow is not sleeping around the boundary around the tube. The two and du, also the length of the gradient, or which is the same, the normal derivative of u, as the physical interpretation of a wall street stress, somehow is the pressure that your liquid is exhausted by the liquid toward the wall of the tube, right? So that would be nice because we can try to give also the interpretation. The interpretation of our result in the flavor of fluid dynamics. So I go a little bit, I speed up a little bit here because Jose did a very nice introduction also to the historical part of the problem. But I have to mention at least the very, how to say, the very beginning of the story. The beginning of the story. So it's this famous Sarian theorem from 1971, in which he considers the problem that we saw. And in addition, he imposes the overdetermining condition that we all know and love. So the gradient of U constant on the boundary of omega. Under this condition, okay, you can characterize the domain, the only domain that supports such a Domain. The only domain that supports such a solution is the ball. So, in particular, the solution is rotationally symmetric. Okay, oh, sorry. Okay, so it's a picture. So, is the unitary ball. So, the profile is the one of a parabola. Okay, and it is radially symmetric, rotationally symmetric, with just one maximum point at the center of the ball. At the center of the ball. So, the fluid dynamic interpretation is that if the Walsh stress is the same, that you can measure at the boundary of the tube is the same at all points, then the cross-section of the pipe must be round, essentially. Yeah, it's also important to notice that here you don't have a geometric assumption on your boundary in the sense that a priori could be disconnected, but the Be disconnected, but the fact that Walsh stressed that the gradient of U is constant with the same value on all the boundary components forces the boundary to be connected and to be round. Okay, not only to be round, but also to be connected. So the connectedness is somehow a consequence of your very strong assumption or very strong overdetermining assumption. On the other hand, we want to somehow To somehow weak a little bit this assumption because we want to consider a solution with disconnected boundary. For us, a solution is not just u, is a couple omega u. So the domain and the function are the unknown in this program. So first of all, I will recall that the rotation is symmetric solution. The rotation is metric solution with two boundary components because they act as a model solution. So, here this is a workshop on comparison geometry. Actually, these are the model solutions we want to compare with. So, as Jose was mentioning, actually, they're made of two parts. One is the serine solution, the other is minus the green function, which is the logarithm of mod X. Okay, and the parameter that we Okay, and the parameter that we choose here to describe our family of solutions is a capital R, which is the radius where the maximum points. So the maximum is achieved at the circle of radius capital R, the green ones. And of course, so the boundary in the solution, the exterior boundary, the blue one, is the ball of radius one, the maximum is achieved. Radius one, the maximum is achieved at the ball of radius capital R. And then the inner boundary component, the red one, is a function that can be made explicit. We call this Ri of R, okay, is the interior radius, okay, which is determined completely once you decide the value of capital R. So here you have an entire family of solutions when R varies between zero and one. So when R capital 0 and 1. So when capital R is 0, okay, you have just one maximum point at the origin, you have the serine solution. And as R increases, you start experiencing two boundary components. So the inner one and the exterior one, the outer one. Of course, you have more than this because you may also, as we've seen in the following, this problem is also a natural scaling invariance. You can translate or dilate the solution, you get somehow. You get somehow other solutions, but essentially they can be reduced up to a normalization to solution belonging to this family, right? So we want to parameterize essentially the rotation symmetry solution with the one that I described explicitly here in that diagram. So an important role will be played by max of UR, okay, the set of point of The set of maximum point, which in this case can be described as, as I said, the circle of radius capital R. And another important thing is the maximum value, which can be easily deduced with that formula. So one minus r squared over two plus r square log r. Okay? Okay, so the question is, even though, okay, we already know the answer. though okay we already know the answer somehow uh are there sering type theorem for are the are there serine type theorem for domain with this connector boundary in other words can we characterize uh rotationally symmetric solution uh to the problem that we are interested in okay uh and we started from the case of ring shape the domain so domain with with two with two boundary components okay so here's the setting just to fix the The setting just to fix the notation. So we have omega, we have the boundary of omega that splits into two components: gamma outer, gamma inner. The blue one will be exterior, the red one is the interior one. So we have the solution. And by the off-flemma, just a simple remark, by the off-flemman, we have the normal derivative of the boundary is negative because, okay, the solution is positive inside. Okay, so we look for statements like. We look for statements like star plus some set of over-determined conditions that allows us to conclude that then the solution that we are dealing with is up to a scaling isometric to omega R U R. Okay, so the dream statement at the beginning would be the most natural replacement for the surreal condition. So we impose two Uh, yeah, two that the Neumann boundary data are constant with two different constants because we already saw that if you impose the same constant, that the only possibility is to have a round connected boundary. So we impose a C outer, C inner, on gamma outer and gamma inner. Both them then must be negative, right? Because of the off-lem, as already mentioned. So the duration will be that one. We already know that. Already know that it's not going to be true, but nevertheless, here is the statement of the art. So there is this theorem by Arichen and Sirkov that gives you some information about the possibility of classifying a solution to that problem, but not quite to the problem that we are interested in because they are considering a solution. With the boundary data, which is zero in the outer component and a positive constant in the inner component. So the over-determining condition that they consider is still a constant Neumann data, but with the constant achieved in the interior, which is non-negative, which is not the one that we want to consider. Not the one that we want to consider, at least as in the model that we are interested in. Under this condition, they may conclude, they are able to conclude using essentially the moving plane method that the domain is an annulus and U is rotationally symmetric, also monotonically decreasing in R. And yeah, so if you think of the model solution, essentially they are considering this part. This part of the solution, right? So, from the outer domain up to here, but they cannot go farther because they want this condition to be achieved. So, the normal derivative, which goes in this direction, the stereo normal derivative must be positive at the inner boundary, right? And this, unfortunately, these two requirements are really Are not avoidable if you want to use the moving plane method. So, what if Ca is negative, as in our case? So, unfortunately, the moving plane method does not apply. This is the first answer. So, the machinery that we have at 10 doesn't work. But it's even worse because not only your method doesn't work, but you can also construct Also, construct a counter-example to the theorem. This is the case because Kamburov and Sharafia managed to construct a non-rotational symmetric solution bifurcating from the rotation symmetric one with Neumann boundary data, which are constant, but constant bigger than zero. Bigger than zero. This is different from what we get. So it is not a countersample to our dream statement, but almost. And in fact, we managed to, our first result is that we managed to prove that this statement is indeed false, adapting essentially the idea developed by Kamburov and Sharafia, and also in our case, in which you have In which you have zero Dirichlet condition at the boundary, you may have infinitely many, actually, a family of non-rotational symmetric solutions bifurcating from the rotationally symmetric ones. So the dream statement is definitely false. If you want to prove classification, you have to add some assumption. And our idea was try to look at the maximum point, the set of maximum points. Okay, and indeed. Okay, and indeed the second theorem, that one that I want to focus on, is the following. So assume that the cardinality of the set of maximum points is not finite, and you have the over-determining condition, then up to rescaling, your solution belongs to the family that we presented before. Actually, we can do better than this in the sense. Can do better than this in the sense that we can just fit one of the two over the terminating condition. So we don't really need to have constant boundary data on both connected components, but it's sufficient that either on the exterior or either gamma outer or on gamma inner, you have constant norm and data and then you classify. Okay, we actually have a dichotomy. Okay, so. Okay, so coming back to the fluid dynamical interpretation, the two theorem combines saying that actually you have a dichotomy, which says that either you have infinitely many maximum points, and then you are rotationally symmetric, or you have finitely many maximum points, and you have a counterexample. Okay, so there's no room in between. So please. Please global maximum, global maximum, yeah. So, so in other words, uh, the velocity of the incompressible homogeneous fluid, et cetera, blah, blah, blah, I think its maximum value only at finitely many points unless your pipe is cylindrical with a cylindrical inner pipe. Okay, so your Okay, so your tube has two walls, which are two concentric side leaders, right? Okay, it is a dichotomy. So, as we mentioned before, there is no room in between. So, either this or that. So, let me before mentioning the main idea of the proof, let me make a little tour in the In the realm of analytic function, real analytic function. Okay, because actually there is this Loya Sievich theorem. So we are interested somehow in the set of maximum points. So in particular, they are critical point. Critical point of real analytic functions have a very nice structure that has been described for the first time in the late 60, let's say, by Loyal Tzedic. Actually, and he has this very nice classification theorem that all this in all dimensions, and saying that the set of critical point is a stratified set. So, you pick a connected component, let's say, of the set of critical points of a real analytic function. Doesn't have to satisfy any equation, just to be a real, just to be a real analytic function, but the set of critical points has this very nice. Critical point has this very nice stratified structure. So it has a zero stratum, one stratum up to n minus one. Okay, and so just to have a picture in mind, you can figure out that your code component could be like that. So you have, for example, here is in 3D. So you may have a zero component, so points, essentially. Then you have sigma one, which is the yellow curve. The yellow curve, and then you have the sigma 2, which is made of several components, which is that are portion of a surface, right? And we refer to the top stratum, the green part here is the top stratum, so the n-one-dimensional thing, okay? Okay, so you may, so you consider eight-shaped curves, and you 48 by 8, you consider you obtain this object. You obtain this object. In principle, they have this structure. But what we managed to prove together with Stefano and Piot Cluschell, for some reason that I will mention at the end of the talk, is that the top stratum, so if you consider not a generical critical set, a generic component in the critical set, but really the maximum point, you may have some extra. Extra structure. So you can simplify somehow this picture saying that if sigma is the top stratum of max of u and the action of your function doesn't vanish in, which is in the case for us because we have Laplace of U equal minus two, so the action cannot be identically zero, then the closure of sigma is sigma itself. So this is another way to say that it's a closed surface, right? Closed surface, right? It's a closed re-analytical surface, which so back to our problem. So, from this theorem, this lemma, actually, we can show that we are just allowed to have the maximum of you may be composed of a finite number of curves, closed curve, and a finite number of points. A priori is like that, but actually, the curve. The curve are not allowed to be so. So, the first two drawings are, of course, wrong, because if you're in a situation like that, then here you have a domain on the boundary of the domain, u is equal to u max, the maximum value. So, for the maximum principle, it must be constant there. But since it's real analytic, it should be constant everywhere, which is a contradiction. Everywhere, which is a contradiction. So, so you have this non-Eyeland lemma, which is very an easy consequence of the maximum principle. So, the only possibility is that sigma, so, so, so, so, the first part is just you just have one closed curve plus eventually some points. So, so the situation simplifies in our scenario like this. So, you have a so maximum of view, if not empty, actually, is made. So, if the top stratum is not empty, So, if the top stratum is non-empty, okay, it is given by a simple closed curve that encompasses the inner boundary and divides actually your domain into two regions, the inner one and the exterior one, and the outer one, plus eventually some isolated points. Okay, and this is very important because so from now on, if the set of maximum is as a As the cardinality is plus infinity, then the top circle is non-empty, and it is given by this very nice green curve, which is dividing our domain into two regions, the outer region, omega outer, the inner region, omega-inner, and plus sigma. Okay, so we can already start half of the proof of the theorem. Half of the proof of the theorem because the exterior, somehow the exterior region is already contained in the result by Kambulov, no, by Sirakov and Reichel that I mentioned before, because the Xero region is okay for the moving plane, okay? And actually, the fact that we can consider sigma as the interior boundary gives another naturally overdetermined condition. A naturally overdetermined condition because on the set of maximum point the Neumann data is zero, right? Because on the maximum point, the gradient is zero. So, so, particularly, the zero normal derivative is zero. And so, we can, using Reichel theorem, Reichel and Sirakov theorem, we can easily conclude, okay, and yeah, as a remark, we can mention that we are using the extrema case, right? Remember that for them, CA must be greater than or equal than zero. So the Or equal than zero. So the normal derivative at the interior boundary should be greater than or equal than zero that prevent us from using them on the whole domain that we want to consider, right? So using the extremal case, the last possibility that they offer to us, we can conclude half of the proof of our theorem. Now we have to deal with the other part. So, what if we now assume that the The normal derivative is constant only at the interior only at the interior boundary, right? So our goal is to introduce a comparison algorithm that this might maybe the method here, I guess, it's more important even than the final result, because it allows us to introduce a comparison algorithm with the model solution. Rhythm okay with the model solution and to produce sharp and rigid a priori bounds of analytic and dramatic nature. Eventually, this scheme, this method, will led to not only to solve our problem, but also to have a different application. A wonderful one was presented by Jose Ministok, and another one maybe will be mentioned at the end. So, of course, if you want to. So, of course, if you want to introduce a comparison algorithm to solve the other half of the problem, you have to take care of something that I already mentioned. So, the fact that our problem has a natural invariance. So, if you translate everything or use scale everything, you get a solution. So, somehow you want to select one of them, a special representative, in order to compare with. So, one has to, so this is the. One has to so this is the solution, uh, the invariance by translation and rescaling. And so, we want to somehow choose so after translate and rescaling, we can reduce the standard family of solution to the one that I mentioned, so in which we somehow fix the exterior radius to be one. Okay, the only parameter is the is capital R, so the radius where the rotation is symmetric solution is achieving the maximum. Is achieving the maximum. So the basic situation is this one, okay? And we have, okay, we already described. So the main problem in running this argument is to find the good R. What does it mean? So we start from a solution. Okay. We start from a solution. We now may focus just on the omega I. So we are just focusing. So, we are just focusing on the interior region. From this, we try to guess a value of the parameter. And then we want to compare our solution to the solution with parameter R. To do that, it is sufficient to rescale our solution in order to have the same value of the maximum. So, in principle, maybe your solution, the maximum of your solution is. The maximum of your solution is, I don't know, 20, okay, 18, I don't know, a number. But then your algorithm tells you that R is seven, so you scale between in order to get the same solution as yours, but with maximum equal to seven. And then you compare their scaled version of omega i u with omega with the rotation is symmetric ones. Okay, to do To do that, we want to obtain the key point, by far the most important point, is to establish gradient estimates. So, to do that, we introduce the pseudo-radial function, but let me be a little bit quick on that point because Jose already presented this. Essentially, you want to, this is just a tool that allows you to compare the level set of your solution with the level set of the model one. The model one. Okay. So CR is a function such that u of x is the value of u of x is equal to the value of u r computed at cr of x. So it's a pseudoradial function because in the case of if perhaps your solution is already the rotational symmetric one, ci of x is just mod x. Okay, so it's something that plays the role of the radius. Okay. Okay, and the first remark is that the above estimate is sharp and rigid in the sense that if the maximum, if the equality is achieved at some point, then it is achieved at all points. And if it is achieved everywhere, then we have the vanishing of this symmetric two tensor involving the addition of you, gradu, etc., etc. And then with some standard metal, you conclude that you must be rotational. You conclude that you must be rotation isymmetric. Okay. May look fancy at first sight, but there is also another way of rephrasing this thing. But once you have the vanishing of these two tensor, basically you have that your action is proportional to the metric, or more or less like this, and you conclude. Okay. So the Bob estimate is. So, the Bob Smith is sharper rigid. Okay. And as I mentioned, so we start from the problem, we want to show the remaining half of our problem, but actually what we realize is that the gradient estimate holds in a fairly great generality, in particularly doesn't use, doesn't make use of the determining condition. So, it's something that can be used also for more general purposes. Okay, and the sketch of the Okay, and the sketch of the proof is like that. So essentially, you consider, you work, you craft a special quantity, okay, which is just the difference of the gradients multiplied by suitable factors that allows you to have this elliptic differential inequality. And then you apply the maximum principle. You have to take some care because you want to control. Care because you want to control your boundary data, but essentially, the normalization that I mentioned before, the normalization gives you that the gradient of your solution is dominated by the gradient of the model one at the boundary. And there are also some other problems because when you approach, so your domain, okay, the value of u on your domain is zero, zero at the interior. zero at the interior and then grows up up to capital R right and so you you may have problem when when you approach capital R because because this denominator is vanishing right because when you compute this this quantity at some point x if x is approaching the the maximum of u then c r of x is approaching r so so the the the the denominator is vanishing okay however you you can we You can manage to prove a reverse Loyesevich inequality, telling us that this doesn't create any problem to us. And also, this quantity actually becomes zero also when the point is approaching the set of maximum point. So it's perfect because f of r is then less than or equal to zero at the boundary of the interior component, which is made by gamma. Component which is made by gamma i and max of u. Okay, and we conclude by the maximum principle that f of r must be non-negative everywhere. So that's the main technical ingredient. So here is the levers of issue, but I don't let me skip on that. So once you have gradient estimate, you can prove sharp and rigid area bound. Okay, now I mentioned the area bound and then I proved the model. And then I proved the most relevant one because it's very simple. But so these are the kind of estimates, so area bound because actually these are length bound. But since, okay, yeah, this also in greater generality, okay, this is okay. This is a length bound. It's a bound on the length of sigma, for example. Okay, so using gradient estimates, you can say that. You can say that the length of sigma is always greater than or equal to the length of sigma in the model solution. Remember that in the model solution, sigma is just the circle of radius capital R. So the length is 2 pi r. So essentially, the length of the curve, of the green curve, is greater than or equal to the length of the green circle when you are on a model solution. Are on a model solution. The second one, and the second estimate can be deduced if the over-determining condition is in force and is telling you that the same kind of control happen also at the interior boundary. And this time, the length of the interior boundary is less than or equal than the length of the interior boundary in the model solution, which is 2π ri of r. And finally, And finally, using still a perusal of the Kerty Testimony tells you that you can compare the length of sigma over R by the length of sigma over Ri. And if you have these three tools, and just the last one comes from the Voteli Mini condition, you can also complete the proof of theorem B because, okay, now it's you that the third inequality That the third inequality tells you that the two, the second inequality tells you that you can compare. So, the first one comes from now, sorry, it was the first one. Okay, I think I yeah, then we had wrong number. I choose the wrong number. So, so the first, the first inequality is this is one, this is not three. So, two, one, and you conclude because. Because they must all be equal. But if they're equal, you have the equality also in the gradient estimate, and so you have rigidity, right? So these are bound are saturated once you impose the overdetermining condition in the interior, okay? And you can play the same game also in the exterior, okay? But in this case, the second estimate, they wanted. The second estimate, the one that allows you to relate the a priori bound on the outer boundary and the a priori bound on the maximum point, okay, the intermediate estimate goes in the wrong way. So we cannot use that, but who cares? Because in this case, we already conclude, right? So somehow the two methods are complementary. The two methods are complementary to each other, right? We use the moving plane for this theory, we use our method for the interior, okay? But yeah, so the theorem B is it's over, okay? So this theorem with theorem gives you a complete dichotomy, as we already mentioned. So the problem is somehow, okay, there's nothing to add. But something interesting. But something interesting is that, as I mentioned, the credit estimate actually holds in more generality. In particular, we don't use, we didn't make use of the boundary condition, the over-determining boundary condition. So the two bounds on the length of sigma, they hold in great generality. In particularly, we can use both of them at the same time. We can use both of them at the same time to see that the length of sigma, the length of the red curve, is bounded from above by the length of the curve, okay, that you can guess from outside and the length of the curve that you can guess from inside, right? So, because when you remember the general strategy, you have omega interior or omega outer, and then Outer. And then from this, you have to guess the right number R, and then to compare your solution with the solution corresponding to the parameter R. I didn't tell you yet how to do that, and that's the final part of the talk, yes. But so essentially, starting from what you get in the outer region from what you get The outer region from what you get in the inner region, you make two gases that, in principle, are different, right? And the two gases controls the length of the green curve in the model solution, right? So, so this is very much in the spirit of the comparison. So, in particular, we have that if a solution that if a solution has a infinitely many has infinitely many boundary maximum point this is necessary because we want to to divide our solution in an outer and inner region then the the radii the expected radii that you can guess from inside and from outside are the one so the red one is is is less than the blue one and they are equal if and only if the And they are equal if and only if the solution is rotationally symmetric. Okay, there is this assumption here on the Walsh stress. So, tau of omega outer must be less than two. So, this is mysterious, but will be clear in a few slides. Okay. First, so you also have to assume that the washi stress. So, remember that here we are not assuming the over-determining condition anymore, right? Condition anymore, right? So just the Dirichlet problem, okay, without any over-determining boundary condition. And so this assumption is kind of technical, but it turns out to be also natural under some respect, as I will try to convince you in a few slides. And it is needed just to justify the guess that you make from the stereo region. So if you want to have. from the serial region so if you want to have a uh yeah if you want to to to guess what the the the the value of r is from from the point of view of the serial region of the outer region you have to assume that the gradient the normalized was stress is not too large okay and here is a sketch of the proof that shows you how to pass from from the gradient estimate to the to the area bound or To the area bound or length bound, if you like. So essentially, these are you have just to expand since everything is analytic in this setting, you just have to compute the expansion of your quantity around sigma. So you pick a point here, you are on the set of maximum points, you are on sigma, okay, and you expand with respect to R, which is R is essentially the uh are essentially the signet distance from from sigma okay also on one side you go toward the the exterior toward the omega outer uh if where the r is negative you go in the interior okay so so you have these two expansions okay but you know that du is controlled by du r so the gradient of the solution is controlled by the gradient of the model solution and so it's a simple So, it's a simple algebraic because the first two terms cancel, and then you are left to terms that involve the curvature, kappa of p is the curvature at the point p, and and r. Okay, so if you once the determined two over three r comes with the minus sign, the other one comes with the plus sign. And so, with the simple algebraic passages, you you algebraic passages you you you arrive to say to see that the the curvature is is greater than one over uh blue r smaller than the the one over the of the red r right we okay so you simply integrate this one use gauss bonnet and you conclude right because uh the since sigma is a closed curve if you integrate Since sigma is a closed curve, if you integrate the curvature, you just get 2π because it's a simple closed curve. On the other end, when you integrate over sigma, you get the length of sigma over because r of omega is a constant, so you easily get the error bound. So it's okay, from from Okay, from the first inequality, you get sigma smaller than 2π rho omega 0, and you get the other one from the other side. Okay, so this proves the inequality because R of omega i is less than r of omega outer. And then if the two coincide, then Then you have rigidity, and it's nice to observe that actually the rigidity can be deduced by using Koshinko-Valeska theorem, because if the two values coincide, then k must be constant. The curvature is constant equal to one over R, which is now the common value of the blue R. Of the blue R and the red R. And so from here, if the curvature is constant, then the green curve must be a circle. But if the green curve is a circle, then you can look at your equation as an initial value problem, okay, in because you have an initial data which is u equal to u r, and then you have also an initial velocity, which is du. Is du by dr, which is the normal derivative of u equal to zero, because you are at the maximum point, right? And the surface is non-characteristic simply because the equation is elliptic. So this is a straightforward. So if the equation is elliptic, the surface is non-characteristic. And then you have uniqueness in the Kushikovaleska theorem. So generally, you cannot hope. So it's a bad idea to try to solve an elliptic equation using the Using the initial value formulation, but it's very good to use if you want to prove uniqueness. We don't want to prove existence, we need just the uniqueness part. So we characterize the point of maximum, and then since our solution coincides with the standard one on the point of maximum, this information can be extended to the whole domain, right? So the only possibility. So, the only possibility is to have a completely rotationally symmetric solution. Okay, so for the last part, how much time? 70 minutes. All right. So, in the last part, I will so there is a black box in all the what I told you so far, which is how to find a good R. How to so there is this. So, there is this guess that you need to make, which is fundamental because otherwise, okay, you don't compare with the right quantity. So, you want to compare the gradient of U with the gradient of UR, and then to deduce all the nice consequences that we saw. And so, how to find a good R? So, first of all, we need to focus on a scaling invariant quantity, which is the wash stress here posing. Worship stress here for simplicity. I just use the square of the quantity that we consider. So the Worship stress should be gradu over the square root of the maximum, but who cares? Here, just to have the notation simpler, I take the square of this, but it is still a scaling variant quantity, as you can check. So the quantity we want to focus on is the gradient. Is the gradient on the interior boundary and the gradient on the exterior boundary. And from this, we want to guess the expected core radius from inside and from outside. So in the case of over the terminal condition, these two are constant. Okay, this is a stupid observation. So this is a normalized watch stress. Uh, normalize what she stress normalize means that we divide it by U max in order to have a scaling invariant themes, right? So, here's the scheme that allows us to guess the right parameter in the comparison. So, here we consider the model solution. For the model solution, you can You can draw this graph, essentially, in which you represent the toe i and toe all in terms of r. So if you give me an r, I tell you what's the value of the gradient of the interior boundary, and that's the red part of the graph. And the blue part of the graph is the opposite. So you give me R, I tell you, compute the value of grad U divided by U max. U divided by u max at the outer boundary. So in the model situation, everything is clear. In the generic situation, we want to use this picture the other way around. So we compute the Walsh stress here, which is the maximum of the gradient, which is a constant in the case of over-determining condition. So we start from here. So we start from here, we go back and we guess what the blue R is, and then eventually we start from there and we guess what the red R could be, right? So that's the picture. So essentially, you compute the washing stress at the inner boundary, at the outer boundary, and then you use them together with the graph of the model solution. Of the model solution to decide which will be your guess. Okay? So, of course, there are some questions. So, this in principle is reasonable, but there are something to take care of. So, for example, who ensures that the tau of omega e is bigger than zero, bigger than two? Okay, you have a threshold. Okay, you have a threshold value which is two and who guarantees that tau of omega r is smaller than two? Who guarantees that both are greater than one? Because if you, for example, you have a solution, you measure the length of the grain at the boundary, and you get, I don't know, one alpha, and then you cannot run this scheme, of course, right? Because you cannot go back. Okay, so another. Okay, so I'm not going to tell you nothing about the first two, unless that in the case where you have locally constant things, so if the gradient of U is locally constant, then this condition is automatically satisfied. But in general, the condition, the red one is also automatically satisfied. The blue one Satisfied, the blue one is the one that needs to be assumed, right? That's why we assumed in the theorem that tau of omega outer is less than two, okay? So for the red, so in general, if the gradient is constant, then there's no problem. If the gradient is not constant, okay, for there's no problem for the red one, there is a problem for the blue one, so that's why we in the theorem we assume tau of omega outer smaller than two. Omega out here smaller than two. And who guarantees that both are greater than one? And this is a theorem, okay? And telling you that as soon as the watch stress is smaller than one, then you have a certain solution. So essentially, from the fluid dynamical point of view, certain solutions have the least possible normalized washi stress. So if you have a cognitive component of So, if you have a cognitive component of your so you divide your domain cognetic component using the green the green line in between, if you somehow you measure your your waste stress at some point and you get a number which is smaller than one, then the only possibility is that the whole solution the whole solution is the selling one. Okay? Okay. Okay so so the the bottom line is that it the the the the is that the algorithm that uh that that allows you to guess the expected corradius is completely well defined and you can really use it to obtain gradient estimate, a rebound and so on. Okay, and the last 10 minutes, maybe, okay, I guess. Minutes maybe, okay. I guess 10 minutes. Okay, I tell you another application of this method to the problem that was mentioned already in this morning talk. So the problem of classifying static metric or finding new solution to the static metric system. Okay. But this morning we saw a solution, we saw static metrics in the case of Static matter in the case of zero cosmological constants. So we saw that. So in this case, you can expect for there is this very famous black hole uniqueness theorem that dates back to Israel and several other authors that managed to refine this very nice result up to Bunting and Masudura Lamb. Banding in Masudura Lamb that manages also to exclude the existence of several black holes at equilibrium in the asymptotic LFET situation. On the other hand, we also saw this morning that if you drop the asymptotic LFET assumption, you may also construct this krototic nicoli solution, mys-crototic nicoli solution, in which you may experience infinitely many. Infinitely many black holes at equilibrium. Okay, so in a static situation. Here, we are considering another, in my opinion, very natural problem, which is the same problem, so classifying static metric. In the case, you assume the cosmological constant is positive, right? So in this case, the model solutions are different, we describe in a minute. That we described in a minute, and the system of equations that you have to deal with is the following one. So, instead of having a harmonic Lapse function, u in this setting is the Lapse function, but instead of being harmonic when lambda is bigger than zero, it satisfies this eigenvalue problem. So, Laplace U equals minus three U. U is zero, the lapse function is zero at the boundary, and u and g satisfy this. U and G satisfy this system, the first line, so U R G equals H of U plus 3 U G. Okay. And the model solution are described here. Okay. They also depend, they have two boundary components, okay, like in the previous problem, and they also parameterize by the mass. So this time, the parameter. Okay, so this time the parameter that describes the whole family is m, which is the mass of this function. Okay, so okay, you have the metric and the Lapse function, which is square root of one minus R square minus two m over R. In some sense, they are very similar, at least formally, to the one that we consider because if you square it, If you square it, if you consider the square of um, you saw the parabola, one minus r square, minus a green function. Here, the dimension is three, so the green function is one over r. So basically, they're really close to the one that we consider. Actually, this turns out to be the case also in the analysis that led us to prove a theorem, which is very much in the spirit. Which is very much in the spirit of the one that I described today. So, here is the description of the model solution. The model solution here. So, you start with the zero mass model solution, the Cita solution, which is the space-like part of the Decita solution, which is an hemisphere. And the green spot is the maximum of the lapse function. And this corresponds very much to the settings. Correspond very much to the setting solution, right? In the toy problem case, let's say, about the toy band. Okay, and the decitus fat, then you have the family when the mass is positive and goes up to the threshold. And in the middle, you have the decitus false solution, which is a solution with two boundaries. So the blue one is called the cosmological horizon, and the red one is the right, the black hole horizon. So it's a solution that starts as the sparrow. So it's a solution that starts as the sphere shield and instead of becoming asymptotically flat, it becomes closer and closer to an upper sphere, an upper alpha sphere, right? Lower alpha sphere, sorry, in the drawing. And then as the mass becomes larger and larger, the red horizon becomes bigger and bigger, and the blue one becomes smaller and smaller up to the threshold value. Okay, here the Okay, here the threshold comes from a normalization, of course, as we saw in the selling problem. Also, in this problem, there are some invariance, but after normalizing thing, you have this threshold value, and when you reach it, the size of the black hole horizon is equal to the size of the cosmological horizon, and you have the geometry of a cylinder. And I also keep tracking the drawing of the Keep tracking the drawing of the maximum of the Lapse function here, which is the red spot in the Deceitter case, and a sphere. Okay, here the drawing are so the cross-section are two-dimensional. And here we play the same game. So instead of guessing, so if the maximum point divides your Maximum point divides your solution into two regions. Okay, you may consider one of them, you call it genetically NUG, and you guess what the mass of that region is, right? And so you can somehow run the same comparison algorithm. And actually, the technical step are the same, even though, of course, the analysis is different, but the technical step are the same. You construct a gradient estimate, and then from the A gradient estimate, and then from the gradient estimate, you go to area bound, and so on, and so on. Okay, but if you remember, at the beginning, you have to have a well-posed, well-defined comparison algorithm. And for doing that, you need to ensure that, in that case, we needed to ensure that the toe was bigger than one. The corresponding theorem in this picture is telling. This picture is telling you that the mass parameter that you guess must be bigger than a zero, larger than zero. So it's sort of positive mass in this case. Actually, you also have rigidity. So if the mass that you guess is zero, then you are the Deciter solution. Like before, if toe was equal to one, then you were on the serine. And here's the same. So if the mass is zero, then you are on the decider solution. Then you are on the decider solution. If you have that, then you have the same kind of statement, right? So, so you have a you have to assume, so you have to assume that the maximum of you divides your manifold into two regions, okay? But once you have that, you have that the mass of the outer region is always greater than or equal than the mass of the inner region, okay, the one close to the black hole horizon, and both if the mass coincides. If the mass coincide, then the solution as fashion is theta one. Okay? And also, I finished. The last thing is that if sigma does not divide your manifold into part, very recently there are people in Cambridge that found numerical evidence of the existence of exotic solutions. Of exotic solution. So, Gary Gibbons and collaborator they managed to prove to give a numerical evidence, let's say, of the existence of a solution that violates the fact that sigma is dividing. So, the solution they get essentially is like this. You have a cosmological horizon, okay? And inside, you have two tiny black holes, okay. Black holes, okay. So the type the cosmological horizon is a two-sphere, right? Okay, and the set of maximum point is an S1 here, is an S1 there. So essentially, you may have solution like this, okay? That of course, they're complementary to our results. So if sigma is dividing essentially the black hole region. the the the black core region from the from the outer region then you may classify but uh well if you if you if you if if the the surface sigma uh as in this case is one dimensional so it doesn't divide anything it doesn't separate the interior region from the outer one then you you may construct exotic solutions at least numerically but very likely they're very much in Very likely, they're very much in the spirit of crock and equalized solution. Okay, so I think that's what I want to say. Thank you.
