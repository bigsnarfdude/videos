Today, I will talk to you about environment-stored memory in active systems. The idea is active particles that can store memory in their environment, and you will see how these systems have qualitatively different behavior compared to standard active systems, and also how it relates to extracellular matrix remodeling. So, this is a joint work with Jean-François Johnny, and you can find more. Jean-François Jawni, and you can find more details in our recent publication in PRL. So, what do I mean by environment-stored memory, and why do I care about it? So, the motivation comes from cell migration. And the idea is that in VIPO, when the cells migrate, they constantly interact with their environment, namely their surrounding extracellular matrix. And this is sometimes referred to by biologists as dynamic reciprocity or mechanoreciprocity. As part of this interaction, the ECM undergoes changes that can either be reversible, for example, elastic deformations due to mechanical interactions, but it can also be irreversible. And this will be the focus of my talk today. So the idea is that as the cells are moving, they drive irreversible changes in the environment. And this is what I call environment stored memory. And we care about it because it gives rise to things that are. Because it gives rise to things that are measurable, to real changes in physical fields, and namely, they just modify and alter further migration of the cells. I will give you two examples, both of which are on fibroblast, but this applies to different cell types and many cancer cells. So the first example is of cellular secreted trails. I will show you here two videos from the group of Guillaume Montagnac in Sorbonne. First, here to the left, you see a fiberblack. Left, you see a fibroblast. The scale here is about 10 microns, and the duration of the video will be about 10 hours. So, as the fibroblast is moving, it deposits a sort of slime behind it. This slime is made mostly out of membrane and also integrines that allow the slime to adhere to the underlying substrate. And now, to the right, we look on different cell types. These are invasive breast cancer cells in this case, and you see that as they move. And you see that as they move with the same length scale and more or less 10 hours as before, they follow the trails that were deposited by the fibroblasts. So let me show you again. So here you see this trail influorescent microscopy, and this is the cancer cell. So here the environment stored memory is clearly visible. It's these trails. And the main point of this paper was that Of this paper was that as part of metastasis, cancer-associated fibroblasts are able to steer cancer cells and help them navigate in the body. Now I'll move on to another example, in which case the memory is not cellular trails, but rather aligned collagen fibers. So what you see here are beautiful images of fibroblasts in ECM from the group of Eric Sahai at the Francisc Creek. At the Francisc Crigg. In this red-orange color, these are the collagen fibers, and in blue, these are the nuclei of the fibroblasts. And I hope you can appreciate on the screen that the ECM pattern to the left is more isotropic, while the one to the right is aligned in the diagonal direction. And one of the points of emphasis of that paper was to show that the existence of alignment and the patterns. Alignment and the patterns are very much related to the interaction between the fibroblast and the fibers. Because the idea is that the fibroblasts themselves are the ones that deposit and remodel the fibers, and the fibers guide the fibroblasts in their motion. And this feedback is important in understanding how the system can transition from an isotropic configuration, like you can see here to the left, to an aligned one, like you can see to the right. And again, To the right. And again, while both these examples are on fibroblasts, this is a more general trait which is epic to many different cell types. Now, I will focus on the example to the right and on the transition between isotropic and aligned systems. And my approach will be to model this multicellular system as an active system. So, just for completeness, I want to say a few words about active matter. I'm sure that most of the audience is well familiar with this subject. Audience is well familiar with the subject, but just to be on the safe side. So, the idea in active matter is that each one of the constituents, cells in this case, is able to consume energy and convert it into a propulsion force. And the main difference compared to simple external driving is that the driving in this case is coupled to the internal degrees of freedom of the particles. So, this can be the concentration field or the orientation field. Or the orientation field. And the same kind of ideas in physical modeling apply to physical systems and especially biophysical systems across different length scales. So you see here beautiful examples from the review by Marchetti and co-workers from 2013. So here to the left, you see beautiful images of microtubules coated with kinesin motors in the subcellular scale. In the multicellular scales, you see here the cells that are plated on a substrate, and here to the right. substrate and here to the right you see in the level of in the scale of groups of organisms you see a school of sardines now the hallmarks of these systems or the main one first of all is the fact that you have steady state currents that you don't find in equilibrium systems and these currents are very much coupled to an orientational order parameter so even if you look at these pictures you can see the order of these for example these asterisks Of these, for example, these aster shapes of the microtubules. You can see alignment of the cells as you go around the center in the multicellular scale, and you can see a flock, basically a flocking behavior of the school of sardines. And the two basic order parameters are polar and nematic. So polar, as you see here to the left, is the case where the particles have an average direction, which defines a polarization vector p. A polarization vector p. In another, in a pneumatic or up-order case, there's a well-defined axis rather than a well-defined direction, in which case the order parameter is a tensor, the nematic tensor denoted here by Q. It's given by the dead of the direction of the particles made traceless by subtracting this identity. And in this talk, I will focus on the multicellular scale and on nematic order. And more precisely, on the transition between isotropic and The transition between isotropic and nematic. Now, this transition has been well studied in active systems, but in the idealized setting of a one-component active system. So, as a simple model, you can think about particles that have self-propulsion and have mutual nematic alignment, as you see here in this sketch. And the phase diagram that you can derive for the systems has this qualitative behavior. So, the axes here are rho. So the axes here are rho, the density of the particles, and t, the effective temperature. Here, by effective temperature, you can think about like one over the strength of the alignment interaction. And you can see here three phases for low densities and high temperature anisotropic gas, for high densities and low temperature anematic liquid, and in between there is a coexistence region delimited by the binoda lines in blue. Binodal lines in blue, in which there is a region of linear instability limited by these pinodal lines in dashed red. So it has this sort of liquid gas phase diagram. You can find more details in the review by Hoop Châté. The important thing here is what drives order. And it's rather standard. The idea is that you need a strong enough aligning field. And this is obtained by a combination of. And this is obtained by a combination of strong enough two-body interactions, which is like low temperature, and sufficient number of neighbors, which is like a high density. So this is well understood in this idealized one-component case, but now I want you to reconsider these beautiful images, in which case a one-component idealization is far from relevant. And the main thing which happens here, and which I will focus on, is the feedback between the ECM and the cell. The feedback between the ECM and the cells, the fact that the cells can remodel the fibers and the fibers can guide their cells in the motion. So, considering this extra ingredient, the fact that there is an environment that feedbacks with the cells, my question today will be, how does it affect the isotropic anematic transition? And there's a point that I would like to emphasize. So, a theme in this workshop is the mechanics and mechanical interaction between cells and their environment. But here, I would actually like to focus. But here, I would actually like to focus on the less explored notion of memory. And to motivate why this is relevant, I want you to think about a specific setup which is common in experiments. So I want you to think about a setup where fiberblasts are moving on top of a rigid substrate like glass. So as the fiberblasts move and derive a matrix, they don't have to deform fibers. They can just move by exchanging momentum of the substrate. By exchanging momentum of the substrate. So, in this setting, we can overlook the elasticity for now and focus on the memory effect. At the end of the talk, I will mention a bit more elasticity and you can ask me more in that when we get there. So, let me introduce you our model for cells and a modifiable environment. So, it's the simplest model we can think of. It's just having two components. One of self-propelling cells that have pneumatic alignment. Propelling cells that have pneumatic alignment interaction, and the second passive matrix segments, let's call them with a well-defined axis. And the main mechanism that will drive the interesting behavior today is this feedback that I keep going back to. So the cells don't just move and self-propel, they can also reorient and they can align themselves not only to other cells but also to their surrounding matrix. And at the same time, the cells are able to remote. Time the cells are able to remodel the matrix via deposition and degradation. So, here you see these dotted lines, these are fibers that have been degraded by the cell here. And here, you see these bold lines. These are segments that have been deposited by the cells. And I'm not going into the more intricate processes that underlie the building and degradation of an ECM. I'm modeling this in the simplest way possible. So, we start from more microscopic dynamics. Microscopic dynamics, stochastic dynamics. And we use some coarse-grained procedures that I will not go into to talk about the hydrodynamic fields in the continuum level that can change in space and in time. So I will consider four hydrodynamic fields, two for each component, a density fields, rho, C for the cells at M for the matrix, and pneumatic tensors, these capital Q's, C for the cells at M for the matrix. And unlike the usual. And unlike the usual convention, I will talk about an extensive nematic field, meaning that it's linear in the density of the particles. And this will be useful. So we make use of this coarse-grading procedure, and we find dynamic equations for these fields. So let's go over them briefly. First, for the matrix and the matrix density. So the matrix density rho m undergoes basically a reaction. Undergoes basically a reaction equation. So there's a typical deposition rate K plus per cell and a degradation rate K minus times rho M per cell. So the idea is that the matrix is enslaved to the cells. It can only change due to chemical reactions with the cells. And here, this is the simplest scenario where the deposition and degradation rates are just fixed. So in reality, there are corrections to that. And for example, Dennis Discher talked about this in his in the last This in the last conference of the soft matter conference in the US. So, if we solve the steady state of this equation, we simply find that the matrix density rho m is given by the ratio of these two rates, k plus and k minus. And the important thing to take from here is that the density of the matrix is independent of cell density. Similarly, if we look at the pneumatic order of the matrix, it's also the Matrix. It's also determined by deposition and degradation. So, in deposition, the idea is if the cells are ordered and they deposit the matrix, the matrix will also be ordered. And at the same time, because the cells can degrade the matrix and take away matrix segments, they will take away part of the extensive order of the matrix. And if we solve this equation at steady state, we find that the intensive, the true pneumatic order. The true pneumatic order parameter of the matrix is equal to that of the cells, and I denote it here as Q. So the matrix inherits the same intensive pneumatic order as the cells. Now we move over to the dynamics of the cells. Here I will not consider division. So the cellular density simply undergoes a continuity equation given by the divergence of the cellular current J. Current J. And this current J is proportional to a divergence of a stress. So you can think about it as a force balance equation which has a friction term, for example. Now this stress has two components. One is an ideal gas component, which is isotropic and it's just given by the density of the cells. And the other one is an active stress given by this zeta, and its principal axes are determined by those of the pneumatic tensor. Pneumatic tensor. At steady state, this stress tensor is simply constant. Moving over to the pneumatic tensor of the cells. Here, I'm focusing on these reaction terms that you see here. So the nematic order parameter, first of all, undergoes, this should be in bold, I'm sorry, undergoes a relaxation with a typical rate K, which is like a tumbling rate, if you want to think about run and tumble part. If you want to think about running tumble particles, and it also undergoes alignment. And I want to highlight two features of this alignment term. The first is that the nematic tensor of the cells aligns with a tensor that I denote as Qt. So this is the total pneumatic field that aligns the cells. It consists of cell-cell alignment, which has a coupling constant beta C, and cell matrix alignment. And sell matrix alignment which has this coupling constant beta n. So, this is what I refer to as Qt. You can see it here. Second, there is the magnitude of the alignment is determined by this non-linear function g. So it's given by a ratio of two Bessel functions that you get from averaging over exponent of cosines. It's not so important. The important thing is that it basically looks like a hyperbolic tangent, meaning that it saturates for large values. So this is very For large values, so this is very similar to the mean field kind of equations that you find for the Ising model. These three dots that I write here relate to high-order gradient terms, so the diffusion terms in this reaction diffusion equation. Now, if I look at homogeneous solutions to this equation at steady state, I find this transcendental equation for small q, which is the intensive pneumatic order parameter. We find that q is equal to this normal. we find that Q is equal to this non-linear function g of Q with this pre-factor that consists of cell cell and cell matrix interaction. So you don't have to remember all of these details. The important thing is that all of the nice arguments that I gave you boil down to this term that I highlight in red. So it's seemingly innocent, but it has rather dramatic consequences on the behavior of the system, and especially as we go to low cellular densities, in which case the matrix In which case, the matrix dominates and it acts basically as an external field. And let me show you what I mean by that. If we look at the phase diagram that we derive from this theory, it is qualitatively different than the one that I started this talk with. So I remind you here to the left is the standard isotropic pneumatic phase diagram for an active system without a matrix. Here, when we introduce the matrix, we have this new region. Matrix, we have this new region that I colored in gray here. And in this region, the pneumatic order is driven by memory. And I didn't emphasize this enough in the introduction. I will always talk in terms of the cells and the matrix because I have this motivation of fiberblasting ECM. And this workshop is mainly about biophysics. But the notion here is rather general. So when you have an active system that can deposit memory in its environment, you will Deposit memory in its environment, you will find this kind of phase diagram. Now, let me go back to this new region that I colored in gray. The main feature of this new region is that you see that the order persists to vanishing densities here. And the question is, how is that possible? So, there are two ways of answering this question. One is more straightforward. The idea is that the cells, even if you have a very dilute collection of cells, you let them move long enough. Collection of cells, you let them move long enough, they will deposit a finite density matrix, and then they will be aligned by this matrix rather than by other cells. This is the basic mechanism. Another way of thinking about it, if you think about the matrix as a memory, then I started this talk by telling you that alignment is achieved by enough neighbors. So another way of thinking about this is rather than having neighbors now in the present, the cells are aligned by the neighbors in the past that were recorded by the meaning. In the past, that were recorded by the matrix. So, this is the main idea at steady state. Now, another feature of this region is you see that the binodal lines and spindodal lines don't go into it. And in particular, it means that the nematic order is stable. And the question is, why? So, to answer this question, let me first explain why there is an instability in the first place. Why do we have this red spinodel lines? Red spinoda lines in the phase diagram. In my opinion, the simplest way to think about it is in terms of negative compressibility. So imagine some density profile that varies along the x direction, and we focus on the xx component of the stress. So it's written here. I remind you, there is an ideal gas component, a passive component rho C, and there is a active component. And there is an active component, zeta, that is determined by the pneumatic alignment of the cells. So it's proportional to this Q. And then instability occurs where d sigma to d rho c is positive. What does that mean? So imagine this cartoon. Okay, these green ellipse are like the cells. This pinkish background corresponds to the environment, to the ECM. And we start with this homogeneous. And we start with this homogeneous initial state. And I want you to consider a small fluctuation in the density of the cells. So in this region, the cells are denser, and then the pneumatic order in them increases. So you see that they're more ordered here. And as a result, because of this active stress component, the active stress is stronger in this middle band compared to all of the system. And now, if I sum the active stress is coming from Sum the active stresses coming from this region compared to that coming from the more dilute region, I will have a net force pushing more cells into the middle, and the density will further increase. So we started from a homogeneous state, introduced a small fluctuation, and it grew. So this is unstable. And the important crux here of the mechanism is the fact that the pneumatic order increases with the density. And now let's look how. Let's look how it really behaves for our system. So, here in black, you see the intensive pneumatic order Q as a function of the density without a matrix. And you see this familiar behavior of mean field phase transitions, where at a critical density, the order parameter increases like a square root. And in particular, the derivative really diverges here. On the other hand, when the cells are aligned by the matrix, they can be aligned. Cells are aligned by the matrix, they can be aligned even for vanishing densities, and the slope here is rather suppressed. So, the suppressed susceptibility is what allows the memory to stabilize the pneumatic order. Now, I want to take one step further and talk about the relaxation dynamics of the angles in this system and how the matrix or the memory can give rise to a rested domain parsing. So, you know, in So, you know, in simple one-component systems that have a continuous symmetry like a polar or a pneumatic order, you don't really care about the angle. It's a soft mode of the system because changing it is equivalent to just rotating the entire system. However, here we have two components. We have a cells and a matrix, and they like to align one to the other. So if there is a relative angle between the two, it will relax with a finite rate, which is independent of the. A finite rate which is independent of the system size, and we can decompose this relaxation into two components: one is how the cells relax to the matrix, and the second is how the matrix relaxes to the cells. So the cellular relaxation to the matrix, the rate of this relaxation has this form. So the basic rate scale is related to the tumbling rate, K, and it's also related to the relative alignment of the cells with the matrix compared to the cells with other cells. matrix compared to the cell with other cells. And this is given by this ratio here in red. The matrix relaxation, on the other hand, is determined solely by degradation here. So the typical relaxation rate is given by the degradation rate. Now I want you to consider a third rate that has to do with domain coercioning. So now imagine that you have two different domains with different orientations and these domains have some typical And these domains have some typical size L. So, in standard systems that don't like gradients in the order parameter, these domains will coarsen over time. So, if you like to think about liquid crystals, there's a frank elasticity or there's a penalty in the free energy that will lead to a relaxation of the angle. And if you want to estimate the rate in which this coarsening will take place, so we can estimate it by this ratio of the total translational diffusion coefficient dt. Diffusion coefficient dt divided by the domain size L squared. And the interesting case here is when the cellular relaxation is much faster than the other two. In this case, even if you have two different domains that would like to coarse in the standard system in the absence of a matrix, before they're able to do so, they will already relax back to the matrix. So they're effectively pinned, which would lead to arrested. Which would lead to arrested coarsening. So, as a simple limit, let us look at the case where the cells are dilute. Then, the relaxation rate of the cells is simply the tumbling rate. The matrix relaxation is negligible. And if we equate the coarsening rate with the cellular relaxation rate, we find a typical size of domain that we expect to survive. This length L is given by the square root of the ratio between the diffusion and the division. Root of the ratio between the diffusion and the tunneling rate, and because of the way diffusion acts in active systems, this is basically the persistence length of the cells. So the end result is rather intuitive. If the cells deposit domains, then the range of the memory or the range of domains that will survive at the end is more or less the range of persistence of cell motion. So to demonstrate this, I will show you numerical solutions to the hydrodynamic equations. Hydrodynamic equations first in the cell-dominated case, meaning in the absence of memory. So, I want you to, you will see arrows, you think about it as double-head arrows. This is like the pneumatic order, and you can disregard the color. This corresponds to small changes in the magnitude of the order parameter. Ah, okay, it started at the end. I apologize. So, the initial state that I would put here is stripes of alternating directions of the nematic field. Of the nematic field. So it will start in a few seconds, I hope. Okay, so you see it starts with alternating directions and rather quickly these stripes coarsen and all of the cells align in the y direction. And again, think about these as double-head arrows. This is just a limitation of the graphical representation here. In the matrix-dominated case, I In the matrix-dominated case, I start with the same initial condition, but because of the memory effect, these domain coarsen and don't coarsen, excuse me, and they almost freeze in time. The dynamics that you see here are mostly in the color. This has to do with small fluctuations in the magnitude of the alignment. So, starting from the same initial conditions, in the cell-dominated case, everything is homogeneous. In the matrix-dominated case, we still have these stripes of alternating directions. And there is another important And there is another important thing which underlies this mechanism, and these are topological defects. So, the arrested domain coarsening is accompanied by the freezing of topological defects. What you see here is again the steady state result from these numerical solutions. Phi C is the angle of the cells, of the active component. The different colors signify different directions. And at steady state, you see that. Steady state, you see that defects persist in the system. So, defects are these singularities that are encircled by all the colors of the rainbow. And the freezing of defects has been observed in biological systems. So, already seven years ago, in the group of Pascal Silbazan was in the audience, it was shown that defects in pneumatic monolayers of cells can arrest in their motion. And very recently, in the group of Daniela Vizhnevich, also from Niela Viznevich, also from Institut Curie, it was shown that defects in fibroblasts become frozen due to the deposition of fibronectin. So, this is what you see here. You see a plus one-half defect, you see its center here in blue, at time zero, and after 15 and a half hours, the defect persists and it stays in the same place. And this was explained by Rafael Voaturi and co-workers with the same kind of arguments as ours, meaning that. As ours, meaning that due to the memory in this case of the fibronectin, the defects don't move anymore. Finally, I want to go. Oh, okay, yeah, sorry. So, this is a very important message, especially to the experimentalists here. So, in many cases, in cell monolayers on substrates, you can go to this, you can see flows and then arrive at arrested motion. And the usual interpretation of that is jamming due to cells. That is jamming due to cell-cell interactions. And what I want to emphasize here is that there is another mechanism for rested motion, which has to do with cell-substrate interaction, which is not simple friction, but rather related to memory deposited by the cells. Now I want to go back to these experiments that I mentioned on ECM patterning by the group of Eric Sahai. So, in these experiments, they showed what happens when you increase the level of ECM. Uh, increase the level of ECM deposition by the fiberglass, among other things. And I will show you here three experimental findings that I write here in black. One is that as you increase the deposition, non-aligned matrices become aligned, the range of alignment can become shorter, and the conversion between different patterns, for example, the isotropic and aligned patterns that you see here, this conversion becomes much less pronounced. And we can understand these findings in very simple terms, making use of the theory. Simple terms, making use of the theory that I underlined to you today. Outlined to you today. So, the first finding is rather straightforward. As we increase the deposition, we increase the aligning field of the cells. The cells become aligned, and consequently, so does the matrix. These two are not as obvious, but here the idea is that as you increase the deposition, you also increase the cellular relaxation to the matrix. As this rate increases, domain, the Domain, the coarsening of domains will arrest. So the range of alignment will become shorter and there will be less conversion between different patterns. So I see that I'm running out of time. I will just briefly introduce you some further implications of memory and of these ideas that I mentioned to you today. So the first is ECM patterning, not talking just about the emergence of alignment, but really Emergence of alignment, but really trying to predict the patterns that will emerge in ECM due to remodeling by fibroblasts. What you see here in red are this is again a numerical solution to the hydrodynamic equations. And here these red lines is just a representation of the pneumatic order of the matrix. Of course, to be more precise and to really capture what happens in the biological systems, we'll have to capture the elasticity effect. So there have been many studies about the interactions of cells. Many studies about the interactions of cells with the matrix, the elastic interactions, by some of them by people in the audience. From a theoretical point of view, if you think about the model that presented to you today, the main difference will be that the matrix description, rather than just being restricted to the pneumatic order, will also include the deformations. This can be captured, for example, by a conformational tensor, like in polymers. Other implications of memory are related to spontaneous flow. Of memory are related to spontaneous flows, to band instabilities, as you see here, that are known in active nematics, and again, as I mentioned, in defects that are expected in all of these scenarios. So I'm running out of time, but please feel free to ask me about these interesting directions. So to summarize, what I've shown you today is how environment-stored memory can lead to order, even at vanishing densities, and to finite domains with new kind of dynamics. New kind of dynamics, and it can also partially explain ECM patterns patterning by fibroblast. And lastly, I want to thank you for your attention.
