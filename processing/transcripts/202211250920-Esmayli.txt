It's a pleasure to be able to join this conference, although remotely. I've been enjoying a lot of talks and I have to appreciate the great work the organizers have done by making everything available online as well. It's very fast that the recordings appear. So, yeah. So, I'm a postdoc at the University of Uvascula, currently working with Peka Koskela and Kai Rayala. And Kai Rayala. And this work will be based on joint work with Kai Rayala and his now ex-PhD student, Tony Ekonen. And the title is misleading. This is not something we have proven, but it's a question. We've only proven it in very special case. But I think I've captured everything in the title of the conference except for the word curvature. For the word curvature. Okay. So, what is a query inequality? Well, we have an equality. Let's start with that one. So, in the Euclidean classical case, if you have a Lipschitz function, then we have a curvilinear Fubini type equality, which says that to integrate the function on your domain, you can first integrate over the Integrate over the level sets of the Lipschitz function. And the correcting factor needed will be the absolute value of the derivative. This has generalizations when we have Rk here, but the Jacobian definition is a bit more involved. And that's something we don't care about. Already, this theorem in the Euclidean case is very difficult to extend to Sobolov. Very difficult to extend to Sobolov functions to replace Lipschitz functions u with Sobolov ones. And the key result came only in 2003, although the query formula itself is due to Federer from 50s or even earlier. So we have the great thing about giving talks at the ends of conferences, no one needs to define upper gradients anymore. So we have a perfect So, we have a perfect candidate for absolute value of gradient in the case of metric spaces, and that is the upper gradient. So, we can ask if we have any hope of saving this as an inequality with a universal constant C. So, is there a reasonable class of metric spaces that are n-dimensional in some way? Are n-dimensional in some sense, for which this inequality holds for all functions and their upper gradients. And why would we even conjecture it to be this way? Why not the other direction for the inequality? And that is motivated by Eilenberg's inequality, which has been called also query inequality, but I will be very I will be very conscious using these terms. So, with Eilenberg inequality, which is even broad in more generality true than what I've written here, is again due to Federer. And for our particular scenario, it says that if you have any metric space, any real number, any Lipschitz function, and any subset, then the integral of The integral of measure of the level sets is controlled by the set you start with multiplied by the Lipschitz constant, the global Lipschitz constant of U. And these are just numbers which are used in the definition of Hausdorff measure. In particular, if you do not include normalizations in the definition of Hausdorff measure, you will have no constant here. It will be one. This may seem different from the previous. May seem different from the previous one because we had a double integral, but it will be the same if you put characteristic function of the set A in place of G. So it's the same thing. But this form of the Eidenberg inequality probably is more familiar. So I wanted to have both of them, whichever you're more familiar with. If we localize, if we fragment our space, our set A. Our space, our set A say, into tiny pieces where we get a finer estimate for the local Lipschitz constant, we can actually prove this version where the little lip u is the pointwise Lipschitz constant, which we have also seen in many talks in this conference. So, this works a little bit of technical proof, but it's true. So, what is the difference between this Eilenberg inequality? Difference between this Eilenberg inequality and the query inequality that I asked about, and that was here. So we asked if we can do this with upper gradients, and now we have the local Lipschitz constant. And in some cases, they are not far from each other. In particular, by work of Cheeger, if the Hausdorff n measure is doubling and we have a one-one-point-Karenic value with the same measure. With the same measure. We don't have a separate measure in this whole thing. Then the local Lipschitz constant is actually the minimal upper gradient. So Eilenberg inequality and the square inequality just coincide. So that's one scenario. But in general, there could be a strict inequality. The upper gradient could be smaller, strictly smaller than the local lips. Strictly smaller than the local Lipschitz constant on a set of positive measures, so that the right-hand side for upper gradient is smaller. So it's more difficult to get the inequality with the upper gradient than with the local Lipschitz constant. The motivation for the query inequality actually came not from just looking at query a formula and wishing that we could do something on metric spaces, but the whole story. Metric spaces, but the whole story began with uniformization theory, which I will come back to after I state the main results on the next slide. And for this theory, it's very important then that we do not begin with stringent geometric restrictions on the metric space. So we want to avoid having to impose these. So, what did we manage? So, what did we manage to prove? If we are in the setting of spaces that are homeomorphic to R2, or the sphere, the two-sphere, or the Poincar√© disk, which are the standing assumptions in the quasi-conformal parameterization theory. So, we will assume that our metric spaces are topologically. Topologically homeomorphic to manifolds, and then the Haost of two measure is locally finite. So these are the only dimensional assumptions we want to have on our metric space, in which case we will call it a metric surface. So it's kind of a manifold, but only topologically. What we managed to prove was that on such a space, we do have the Cori inequality. We do have the Cori inequality with the upper gradients for monotone Sobolo functions. The constant in particular is independent of P. So let's read this statement more carefully. So if you have a monotone Sobolev function whose upper gradient is p integrable for some p bigger than or equal to one, then with this universal constant we have the inequality. Have the inequality. Actually, if p is bigger than or equal to 2, we don't need the 200 either, and we get 4 over pi, which is sharp and cannot be improved. For example, by considering R2 with the L infinity norm. Of course, the most important question in your mind here is what is monotone here? So, monotone here is in the sense of Lebesgue, and that will be that the function achieves its maximum minimum on the boundary. Minimum on the boundary of every open set, of every simply connected open subset of X that is compactly contained in X. So for these functions, for these double functions, we have the inequality with the universal cost. Sorry, can I ask a quick question? Absolutely. Okay, you can hear me, great. So yours, does this entail also some continuity assumption? A continuity assumption on you? Right, right, right. Yeah, yeah, I have, of course. So you, it is continuous, and this maximum principle holds. So monotone will be continuous. You begin with continuous, of course. Thanks for the question. It's very important. And then we have the maximum principle. Okay. So the So, the theorem may not look elegant because now we have one more adjective for subbola, so for monotone subolof functions, we have this, but it's unavoidable, unfortunately, because even for Lipschitz class of functions, if you drop monotonicity, you have counterexamples. And if I have time, I will draw a picture of the counterexample. So, without monotonicity, you can have. Monotonicity: You can have rather very concrete metric surfaces, an ellipsis function on them for which you have positive here and zero here. So the failure is not just because of this constant. No universal constant will make it work. So this is kind of my main results. If you have any questions, please feel free to shout out. Okay, so one important, yeah, that has to do with the counterexample. One important consequence of this, again, coming back to that great question about whether you begin with continuity or not. So let's say a weakly monotone function is one that has the maximum principle, but we don't begin with the continuity assumption. Continuity assumption. In fact, we proved the previous inequality for weakly monotone functions. And from that, we conclude a continuity result for such functions. So if x is a metric surface, previous assumptions, and u is weakly monotone, it has the maximum principle. It obtains finite, not plus, minus infinity. Not plus minus infinity, finite max and mean values on the boundary of every simply connected subset. Then if u has a p integrable upper gradient for p bigger than or equal to two, then u is in fact continuous. And this kind of is a nice result because in many contexts, the functions are The functions are do in fact satisfy maximum principle. For example, P Laplacian, solutions of P Laplacians, P harmonic functions, or in many other contexts, again, coming from quasi-conformal theory, by their very construction, some functions satisfy the maximum principle, and the knowing their continuity is a big deal. So, let me motivate further. Let me motivate further where the whole question came from and give you an example of a weakly monotone function whose continuity from this theorem has important consequences. So a very key paper of Kai Rayala from 2017 proved Proved gave sufficient conditions for a metric surface. Again, you start with X that is topologically a two-manifold and it has locally finite H2. So the theorem said that X has a quasi-conformal parameterization from a standard surface to a standard. A standard two manifold that will be just R2, the sphere, or the unit disk. If and only if, so he gave three conditions. So let me write the notation and then I will explain what these are. So modulus of one curve family times modulus of the other one is bounded from above and below by some constants. By some constants. And then there is a claim about modulus of curves passing through a single point. So the curve family gamma 1 and gamma 2 we're talking about here is if you have x and if you have any topological rectangle in there with the size c1, c2, c3, and c4, then gamma 1 will be the modulus of Gamma one will be the modulus of all the curves that join opposite sides this way within this curve, and gamma two will be the opposite sides. So in R2, this estimate is true. So if you have a quasi-conformal parametrization, it has to be true on X2. In later work with Matthew Romney, they proved that this side of the inequality is universal. Of the inequality is universally true. They proved it by proving a query inequality. And that sharp lower bound of, I think, four over pi, or pi over four, whichever, was proven by Eric Sambeek and Paul J. Corradini just recently. So here you use the modulus minimizer to define a function. Minimizer to define a function u, which is a zero, say on this side and one on that side. And by its definition, it's actually weakly monotone. And once you prove that it is continuous, that function gives you almost the quasi-conformal parameterization that you need because you get a continuous function and then you also find a conjugate function easily so that you have a Easily, so that you have a map into R2 and things follow. Is my time up? Four minutes. Four minutes? Yes. Okay, so that's great. So that was kind of the motivation. So the earliest example of the query inequality was for that particular function that I tried to draw a picture of it, function defined on the rectangle. And that's how we. And that's how we arrived at this question of does it hold in more generality and theorem is followed. So, for the counter-example, probably you start with a counter set in the plane with positive measure, say the one that you start with a unit square and then you remove cubes and then so on. But instead of removing the cubes, I want to just lift them. The cubes, I want to just lift them to a new level, to a new elevation. So this gets lifted to this one, and then so on. So my drawing today is even worse than its average. And then what happens next is I was going to remove new four squares from each of these. So I again lift them to a new height and so on. And I keep doing this at infinitum. At infinitum, the limit of these things will be the counter set C, say, waiting somewhere at height one. So this plane is not included. I'm just trying to say that it's a parallel plane to the one you started with. What you do then, these are kind of tubes that rise. So they are not filled in, it's just the walls of these tubes. So you make them really thin. So, you make them really thin, and then you add spirals. So, what happens is you keep H2 measure bounded, but then the length of these tubes add up to infinity. That means that to reach any point in C, you will have to spend infinite length. In other words, no rectifiable curve other than the constant can go to the C. Go to the C. Also, the space, it's easy to convince yourself that the space we such built is still homeomorphic to the plane because, well, we lift. If you can visualize that, it's just everything collapses back onto the plane. Therefore, if you have any function on this space, which is homeomorphic to R2, H2 of that is finite, so it's definitely a metric surface in our definition. Surface in our definition, but then the upper gradient of that will be zero on the set C, because C is not reachable with rectifiable curves. Then if you take any function, almost like any function, if you take this projection, for example, the local Lipschitz constant will be positive. Actually, it will be just one because it is a one Lipschitz. It is a one-lip shit and no better. And by Fubini, you can see that many level sets will have positive measure. And that will give us the counterexample that I had here. So for this projection, that will be just by Fubini. It will be the measure of C, will be positive, but then the upper gradient is zero along that. And this counter example shows us it's very difficult to generalize this theorem. Difficult to generalize this theorem to higher dimensions also. If you fill in that previous counterexample to make it three-dimensional, we see that even with monotone, the inequality may fade. One of the proofs we had was using quasi-conformal, new quasi-conformal results, and that is also not available in higher dimensions. So it's a very fresh question. Fresh question, you're welcome to think about. And that's it for from me today. Thank you so much. We actually have negative time for the next talk, but maybe it is a quick question that we will possibly. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Lee Chen, Lee, are you online? Yes, I'm online. Yes, can you share the screen? Okay.
