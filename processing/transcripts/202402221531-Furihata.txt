product hydroelectric, but uh it is a kind of structure preserving numerical method and uh I wanted to make some relationship or a combination of the numerical calculation and the machine learnings. So here, yeah, so this is uh figures of my talks because uh in my talk uh my uh my speech My speech jumps here another, so I prepare these figures. The target is the partial differential equations in this talk, and which has some conservation laws and have some energy structure. Energy structure means energy dissipation property or energy conservative properties. And for these partial differential equations, we want to make. We want to make some nice numerical schemes. Nice means the fridge has also some mass conservation laws in discrete meanings and also fridge has energy dissipation or energy conservation properties. So for this target, for this purpose, we already have studied about energy structures and structure preservation. Storage shares and storage share preservation sales. But for this story, I think it's difficult to make straight machine learning method. So we want to find another way to obtain the goals. So at first we struggle with order reduction, but Reduction, but it is not a work in progress. So, we adjust to the particle dynamics method. It means we transfer the partial differential equation to the particle dynamics equations. And according to this idea, we find the energy structure for this equation, but this story is also difficult to combine machine learning, so we jump. Machine learnings. So we jump to usual method for the particle dynamical method. But I want to summarize particle dynamics method should be combined machine learnings. So we avoided to use standard method for particle dynamics method. It means we use border method for the particle dynamics. Particle dynamics model. And for this, we tried some small machine lines. So, this is our story. Okay, this is the explanation of our target. As I said, the target PDEs are groups of the PDEs which has some mass conservation loss and energy. Lows and energy dissipation or energy conservation loss. But for that, in the group, for example, there are some famous equations for heat equation, heat diffusion equations, or K dig equations, or the chi-had equations. So this is a typical example for the groups. And this is a chi-had equations. Katier equations, the functions and time evolution functions equals preparation operates variational derivative of local energy, H is local energy. And in this case, in the configuration case, the variational derivative is written in here. It is minus if you're the function plus just the point. And for the And for these kind of digital, we can find some nice features. The first one is mass conservative features. It is time evolution of the mass because zero. And the second one is energy dissipation property. And the time evolution of the total energy decreases. So just in case, I wanted to show. Just in case, I wanted to show the numerical solutions behavior by the finite difference method. This is in 2D case. So, oh, I forgot to say that the Carhered equation is a kind of model equation for phase separateial calculations. So, as I said, So, as I said, we have already designed some structure-preserving numerical methods. This is one example for any dimensional cases on the borders. And I will introduce the border decomposition or some differentiation on the border later, but here I just introduce. Just introduce our studies so far. So, using our method, we can design numerical schemes like this. This is location is the index i, and n index is a time index, and this means is a time pair differences because uh a discrete repression operates discrete variation of derivatives. Discrete variation of derivatives. And this point of course, discrete reparation defined on the forwardness. And these are detailed definitions. For example, this is a polynomial plot, and this is a gradient plot, and this is a discrete integration. It term means a kind of summation on region. Summation on region. So it means this is global total energy in discrete meanings, and this is a variational derivative attained discrete senses. So for these definitions, we can see that total mass, a discrete total mass is conserved in these meanings, these meanings in the sum summations in the bonuses. In the bonuses of the function, and the time index n plus 1 equals for the time index n. And we can find another nice feature for these numerical solutions by the method. It's energy dispersion property. It means uh the I the I is the discrete total energy defined in the previous seed uh case uh less than the order. is less than the older ones. So this right so far is already done by our method. So but on this context we want to combine something to machine lab. So so but before jumping into another topic I wanted to show some numerical solutions by this Solutions by this method. Using this method, we can use any regions, not rectangle regions. So, for example, this is Cassini over region, and at first we plug it points randomly in the regions and according to the boundaries. And from these points, we can calculate border cells. Border cells, and I later the definition of border cells, but so from these locations we can calculate these meshes. But this mesh is too bad for numerical computations. So for boron series, there is a famous modification. It is called Lloyd modifications. Particular Lloyd is named. How much low is its name at all? I think. So, but after raise modifications, the shares become milder. So, on this machine, we can characterize chi-ha depreciations with nice two features, mass conservation low and energy special. So, and we get numerical solutions here. So uh we can see uh the numerical calculations is not so uh difficult. And using this uh method that time uh time uh difference time or time evolution the total energy uh decreasing so we just see in the graph and the total Graph and the total mass is conserved well. So, from here, I wanted to show some our struggle, our attempt to the combining of our story to mass lines. So, this is a story about order reduction attempt. So, at first, we want to find some. we want to find some order reduction equation for the Kalti equations because Kinhier equation is slightly difficult to obtain numerical solutions. So Arika Poss showed in 1994 he said level surfaces of solutions to the cultural equation tend to solutions of the hella shield problem. So it means this is a hella shape problem and the The dynamics of the liquid between the scene classes, and this is the figures of the liquids. And this means ratio problems is mathematically order-reduction equation of the cartridge equation. Because literary, this is 2D or 1 dynamics, but originary cartridge equations. Originary culture equations in the 3D program. So, this is mathematically. We can say that there are order reduction models for the culture equation. But numerical computation of HO program is very expensive. So, some researchers writing papers, he said he recommends numerical solutions to kind of education for the hair. For the Herschel problem. So it means the order reductions attempted to protect for the 10-year equations is failed in the numerical computation. So we jump to the main story of my talk, the particular direct model. So this is a very simple story. Ki-head equation or a KDB equation or heat diffusion equations has mass consolidation law. It means we can introduce a continuity equation like this. So the functions time evolution plus divergence u b is the air velocity equals tail equals zero. So whereas u is a target function in this context, the density of the system. Context to the density of the system and the V is the verse. And Kanye Education has a local structural energy, recall the energy J equals integral integration of the local G. And in this context, the Cahier degradation written in this formulation. And the time evolution of the function appears here and here. So we can combine these two. Can combine these two equations and obtain that ub equals minus gradient of the variational derivative of local energy. So it means b is the velocity of the particles we can consider. So it means we can transfer the Ki-Hier equation to particle dynamics equation written in here. written in here. So particles velocity equals minus one by a divided by density and gradient of variational derivative of local match. So this is a very simple story and fortunately we can find some energy structure for this from this atom. This article dynamics view. So, in this case, I want to explain it. So, but in this case, we consider the piecewise constant density function u on the small areas. So, and we can understand the kind of equation by particle equations when it comes to the e. And becomes the infinity, it means the particle dynamics equation, the velocity equals minus one divided by u squared and the size of the control area by the particle. And this merge price j is derived by the particle locations. So J is total energy. So, so but in this what is this? I want to define this is defined by u multiplies gradient of the variational derivative of the rocker energy as a point particles at the time and multiplies the rocker reaction. So literally we can vanish here. So this is an abstract form of the particle dynamics equation using the energy. So it means the energy evolution is written this distribution. It means a partial derivative of the j by x i, a much price time of the particle locations. And r is a And R is the index of the particle. And this is summation equals minus summation standard because this is substituted here. So we can obtain the this is positive one and this is here. We can find minus minus sign. So it means that the time evolution of the total energy must be negative or zero. So it means using this. Since using these equations, there is possibility that we can design some structure preserving methods. But I think it is possible, it must be possible, but slightly difficult because this means this idea has some hidden meshes, elected. Meshes, elected meshes, it means we must calculate meshes, meshes according to the particular locations. So, and particular rules, it means measurements. So, but in continuous context, there is no problem. But in discrete contexts, according to the time axis, so the moving mesh is new image is very very difficult part to make all these structure preserved in numerical lessons. So just now this is just a possibility. So this is our huge block. So we want to jump again to a particular dynamics method and And from here, I wanted to show how to compute the particle dynamics equation. So, usually, as you know, there are some standard or normal methods to calculate particle dynamics, which is famous for SPH. SPH is smoothed particle hydrodynamics, or MPS, a moving particle semi-moving. MPS, a moving particle semi-proceed, are famous ones. But as I said, I wanted to introduce ornament mesh as based on gradient or operations because in this direction I believe there is a possibility to design a structure-preserving new member method. So, from here, I want to introduce how to define a good Define the gradient for repressions based on the polar dimensions. So before that, before I detain, okay. So I wanted to show some details. Before introducing some details, I wanted to result on the particle dynamics on the border meshes. And this is a particle. And this is a particle velocity equals Morano-mesh size, and A is a weight of the particles. So it's a constant. All particles are same weight. And the gradient is defined on the border images. And the discrete uh partition order gives a low power energy. But uh this uh result is written here explicitly. Uh here is a polynomial part. Here is a polynomial part, and this is a rapression part. Rapression part is defined also in the polynomial surface. And in this case, we must use here and here this UI, but the UI is just defined, weight by design, weight by divided by the size of the edge. So I must introduce the I must introduce how to define a gradient or operation on border series. After us, I must introduce boron decomposition or a boron series. A boron decomposition is a kind of decomposition of the space or region. It's a very easy or understanding decomposition, which is defined here. It means Here, it means that this is bonus cells generated by the particle xi. So it is very easy to understand. The bonus cell omega i is defined by the points. The points are closer points than another generals, another particles. So this is very difficult, kind of easy definitions. So under this definition, So under these definitions, there are some nice features. For example, the vector from these particles to adjacent points is perpendicular to ballooners H. And of course, this distance to H and this distance to H is same ones. So many nice features in the organized composition. Features in the ordinary conversions. And just in case I want to add some knowledge about the Board 9 conversions, the cost of computation in the 2D case is not so expensive because it is known that the computation cost is order of n log n. n is a number of generators, number of points. And the mean of And the mean of number of vertices, vertices adjacent points of boron image in the 2 decays is just 6. So on this boron cells, we prepare two meshes. The first one is a called a covariant meshes. Uh is defined uh just as a bonus. Of just as a bonus. And the second one is control-oriented mesh. So it means we prepare staggered mesh. Staggered mesh in the context of organic language. So it means staggered meshes. So it means we must prepare or we must define gradient or approaches as anything on both meshes. So here. So here is a discrete differentiation like a gradient over divergence on covariant meshes, gradient divergence or rotations over aversions. So it means these variables are defined on the orders. And this is a differentiation, this will be differentiation. Differentiation discrete differentiation defined on the contravariant matrix. It means these are defined on edges. So these are defined on edges. So why we use two stackadometers? So we using these stackadimes, we can derive integration pattern. Derived integration by parts. So these are typical integration byparts, but in discrete senses. So for example, this is F merge price gradient G plus gradient F merge price G and integration in this case summation because something defined on edges, the regional edges. So using this So, using this, we can find some integration bypass and we can define some variational derivatives. So, but these equations look very complicated, but the proofs are very simple. For example, this is just a proof. This is just a proof of the second integration by parts, and using just reordering indices, we can make our proof. Okay, so let's see the numerical examples using this idea. This is one case, it's a configuration equation's numerical solutions behavior. Behavior. This is a figures. We see the purple pop, these purple particles. This is a particle which we computed. And from these locations, we can compute the blue line. And so, blue line is computed by the particular locations. And the green line is And the green line is numerical solutions completed by a normal standard finite unit spaces. So let's see the newbies. So these proper particles are calibrated by this method and from these locations we can compute the density or anything like that. So from this Anything like that. So, from this, we can see the numerical solutions rurally. So, I can say that this idea is not bad, but perhaps the accuracy is also checked. How come you don't miss the maximum, but you know, the minimum? Minimum is the Minimum is zero. Yeah, and the maximum is one. No, what I mean is that if you look at your solution, right, the blue ones, it seems that it approximates the local maximum pretty well, but the local minimum is not an approach. So, because there is no particular relation. And of course, we can calculate in two decades. So in this case, this is initial particles locations FHG are located randomly. And using this method, we can characterize movement. And this is a pot, of course, and this blue rhyme. Of course, this blue line is a border sales. This means every time we must compute border sales, so the computation cost is expensive. So, computational cost expenses. Oh, of course, one more. This is just This is just a toy because uh the initial state resembles uh character pi. And as I said, this method is very expensive for computation, so I wanted to make a combination with this. Combination with this idea and Mozilla. So, from here, I want to introduce our attempt to combine this idea and Mozilla. So, I want to make a neural network to mimic the time step of this method. So, it means if the particle is shear, perhaps. Perhaps around 42 points are sufficient to calculate the time-stepping behavior of these equations. There is not so rigorous reason, but at least we need six points to calculate repressions. And this idea includes gradient repression, it means. Gradient propression, it means so we must need second closest points. So it means we at least we need six plus twelve. So it means eighteen points as smallest points for these calculations if the points are located linearly. So just in case we use the sound processor. The third protest points, 80 points, and just again, just in case, six points, but six points meanings you can see from these figures. And locations of the folding to the protest points of the particle is input data and by neural networks, which is calculated. Which is calculated by neural networks and the output of the velocity of the particles. So we design here and the neural networks in there is in this case is all layers are dense ones and activation function is large. So this is loss functions, behavior and Loss functions, behavior, and relative errors behavior. And using these neural networks, the numerical solutions is displayed here. The first initial position is the same ones in the previous seat. And you can see movie using neural networks, the computations. Neural networks, the computation is very fast, of course, very fast. But after around the time, the behavior is weird. It is far from the numerical solutions by the original numerical solutions. So, of course, we cannot believe numerical solution is varied. So, it means numerical neural networks in this case is In this case, is locally around time to this we can behave, but after around here, the behavior of numeral resolutions by neural network is not nice. Okay, so I wanted to summarize my talk. So, we can expect the numerical solutions approximate exact ones. It means the numerical solutions. means the numerical solutions by either particle dynamics equations for the Kangeli equation and they are based on the Boronoi differential vertical gradient or regressions. And we tested, we attempted to try or try a small neural network to mimic the particle dynamics and the trying for result is Trying it for a result is nice, just a pattern. However, after wrong behavior, poor wrong behavior, the result is not the nice. And of course there are some bad points. For example, borner decomposition is computation comp for computation, the cost is high and the born decomposition doesn't look to be appropriate. doesn't look to be appropriate for parallel components. But of course there are many, many to do it means they are our future markets. Yes, thank you for listening. So any questions? I have questions. Sorry for that. Uh sorry, how did you train the rabbit to map the positions for us like you use? Uh yeah, so I wanted to uh I prepared the data from the numerical solutions by the hardcore dynamics model on the border images. So from the so data is a very many, so but the training is not so training is difficult, so it Is difficult, so it means I tried 100 times but 90 times failed. So this is very difficult to try. So I was just saying, because it seems like we have an equation for how the particle should move, depending on what the particle movement instead of trying to interpolate. Ah yes, so it worked better. We did uh calculating chloronoid dynamics. It's a new RAM networks. Answers erosity directly as you have perhaps we must consider the physical structure. For example, we must use we should use neural network to compute the size of the organoid or a local energy separatory. But in this case we tried We try to neural network to us as a veracity dimension. So it is two as luxury dynamics. Anyone else have any questions? If not, that's it. I think I
