I'm going to be talking about two extensions to the work that Rob just talked about. So this is work that I've been doing throughout my PhD with my advisors, Rob and Lorna Deep from University of Guelph, as well as Caitlin, who's out in the US now, so you can imagine there's a bit of tension over how we should be spelling behavior in our titles. Okay, so I'll start off with some background, which is really just going to be a quick recap of what Rob just talked about. Of what Rob just talked about. So, again, the overarching motivation for all this work is that we want to be able to incorporate this concept that people are changing their behaviors over time in an epidemic in response to when they perceive that their risk of infection is getting higher. So, this is the model that Ram just showed, or this is the transmission probability, or the probability of transitioning from susceptible to infectious. Ultimately infectious. And as Rob explained, the other ward, Diordan and Schmidt, incorporated an alarm function into this transmission probability such that as incidence is increasing, our alarm, our population alarm, is increasing, and the transmission probability is decreasing. So when our alarm function is equal to zero, that means that the population is behaving as they would at baseline if there were no infections in the population. No infections of the population. And then, if we ever get to an alarm value of one, that means the population is maximally alarmed and the transmission probability drops to zero. So Rob showed this alarm briefly, but I'll just go over it one more time. So this is the power alarm. This is the one I'm going to be focusing on mostly in this presentation. So we have a continuous alarm function that increases as incidence increases. And here's some examples of the type. And here's some examples of the types of epidemic curves we might see simulated from this model. So you can see that they're usually characterized by a larger initial peak followed by smaller subsequent peaks. Okay, so that brings me to the two extensions that I've been working on for this model. So extension one is to allow these alarm functions to be time varying, and this is really intended to capture. And this is really intended to capture the effect of behavioral fatigue. And we were joking at break that there's probably some parallels to be made between behavioral fatigue in the pandemic and behavioral fatigue on the last day of the conference. So I don't blame you if you're not paying that much attention by this point. But yeah, we're trying to capture this effect of behavioral fatigue, where over time, people are going to change their behaviors less and less, even in response to the same increases in incidence. And then, second extension that'll And then, the second extension that I'll just touch on is the spatial extension that Rob also mentioned at the end of his talk. So, we also considered a behavioral change model within an individual-level framework, which allows us to consider individual-level covariate information. And in particular, what we were looking at was incorporating spatial information about the population. So, to start off with our behavioral fatigue extension that I'm Fatigue extension that I'm currently in progress on working on. We wanted to extend the original VCM that Rob talked about by splitting the alarm function into two separate components. Now, so we have our alarm function, A of T, is equal to rho t, which is what I call the protective behavior function. So this describes how the population is changing their behaviors in response to changes in epidemic. Changes in epidemic metrics. And so, in the model that Rob just talked about, his AT, his alarm function, was just rho t. And then what we're introducing now is a second component, delta t, which I'm calling the appearance function. So this is going to describe how people's adherence or motivation to maintain these protective behaviors is going to change over time. And we might expect that that's changing slowly and responsibly. That's changing slowly in response to time, or it might also be in response to epidemic metrics, so how quickly incidence is change is going up, or if incidence is coming down, or a combination of the two. But I'm just going to be focusing on the solely time-dependent adherence functions today. So, there's many forms that we could consider for what the adherence function might look like, but in general, we want a function that's bounded between 0 and 1. Bounded between zero and one. And when the adherence function is at zero, that indicates that there's no adherence to these protective behaviors. So people are not going to be changing their behavior at all, regardless of what they're seeing in the news or anything like that. And then at that point, the model would reduce back down to the traditional SIR model. And then if, on the other end of things, if our adherence function is equal to one, that indicates that there's full adherence to this protective behavior adoption. Detective behavior adoption, and then our model is equivalent to the WDSCM, which is what Rob just presented. So, if we're considering a time-dependent adherence model, then we probably expect that adherence is going to decline over time, but there is also a possibility that there might be some sort of rebound. So, potentially, if people have a long enough break from these protective behaviors that they find difficult to maintain, then they will be able to. To meeting, then they will be able to re-uptake them later on. Okay, so I'm going to go over four different examples that we've been considering so far for what our adherence function might look like. The first one up here is the change point adherence function. So here people are going to have full adherence until some change point in time, and then adherence is going to drop by a constant amount alpha for the remainder of the epidemic. And I plotted down. And I plotted down here the total alarm function. So this is combined with the power protective behavior function that I showed earlier. So we essentially get two different alarm functions in the change point adherence model, where we have the top line representing what the alarm would look like before the change point, and then the bottom line representing what it would look like after the change point. And then the second one that we considered. And then the second one that we considered was a periodic adherence function. So that's just a cosine function. And the motivation behind this one was really that idea that there might be some rebound in adherence over time. So this one does allow adherence to come back up after that initial stop, and you can sort of control how quickly that happens based on the period. So this is some examples of what the epidemic curves look like under these two models. So in the bolded black line, So, in the folded black line, I've plotted the behavioral change model with no changes to adherence. So, the original one that Rob presented. And then, in the different colors, we have some examples from adherence models. So we can see with the change point one, the academic curve is going to be the same as the original behavior change model until that change point is reached, and then cases will jump up by some degree. That's dependent on alpha. On alpha. And then in the periodic adherence model, we can see that we can control how many peaks we see, as well as how high those peaks are going to be based on the period and the amplitude and the adherence function. Okay, so the final two functions that I'll talk about today are very similar. So we have the exponential adherence function and then the delayed exponential adherence function. So in the exponential, we just have a continuum. The exponential, we just have a continuously decreasing adherence over time. And similarly, in the delayed one, we just have a time delay where people will maintain full adherence until some time, tau, and then adherence will stop, start dropping. And again, here's some examples of what the epidemics under these models might look like. So we can see that depending on how quickly we let adherence drop, we can get a really big second piece there. A really big second peak there. Okay, so I'm currently working on a simulation study for these models. So I'll just go through a bit of the preliminary results here, but we simulated epidemics across 150 time points, and then we fit the model to the first 75 time points and forecasted for the remaining time. And we assume that we know infection times here, but we have to. That we know infection times here, but we have to estimate the removal times through data augmentation. And we did these computations in NIMPL. So, here's what the posterior predictive distribution for these models looks like in the simulation setting. So, we're mainly looking to see if it's possible to fit these models back to the data here. And it looks like we're doing a pretty good job. I didn't put, I guess, the comparison with if we don't include the appearance function. Limit if we don't include the adherence function and we fit them. But as you'd probably expect, if we fit the model with the adherence function back to the data that was generated by that, it far outperforms the other models. And just for this audience, I did a little data analysis on COVID-19, but I'm not an expert on COVID-19 by any means, so this is just a preliminary analysis that I've started here on the first four. Started here on the first four waves in Calgary. So we took the data from the first four waves of COVID-19 in Calgary and we fit all these models to the data. So we had the traditional SIR model with no behavioral change. Then we had the WDS BCM with behavioral change but no changes to adherence. And then we have our models with our four different adherence functions. So first So, first I compared the model fits using the WAIC. So, again, a lower value here indicates a better fit. So, I omitted some of the models for space. These were the best fitting ones. So, the exponential and delayed exponential adherence functions ended up being extremely similar to just the power alarm that had no changes in adherence. But if we included the periodic or the change point adherent, The periodic or the change point adherence functions, then we started to see some improvement in the fit. So for the first wave, we found that the power model with the change point adherence function fit the best. And then for the remaining three waves, we found that the periodic adherence function fit best. So we can look at the alarm functions that we estimated for the four waves through the various models. And obviously, the first three are pretty much identical. First, three are pretty much identical. So the exponential and the delayed exponential, we'ren't really picking up any changes in adherence or any fatigue effect, so to speak. But in the change point and the heuratic functions, you can see some changes in the alarm function compared to if we just didn't include any changes to adherence. So they seem to be picking up some of those finer changes in how alarm changed over time. And And we can also look at the fit to the data here. So, in the first column for each wave, we have the estimated R0 value over time. And in the second column, we have the fit back to the data. And so, for the first wave here, the change point was the one that fit best according to the WAIC. And we can see, or maybe you can see it's a little small, but the first peak there is being. The first peak there is being picked up by this model, and it's trying to pick up that second larger peak. And I think in this specific wave, that second peak might be due to changes in testing procedures. So at that sort of change point that it picked up in the model there, that corresponded to the date that AHS expanded testing eligibility. So I think you might be picking up that effect more so than behavioral fatigue in this instance. Instance that for the remaining three waves, the periodic one was the one that was selected to do best. And especially in waves three and four, we can see that it is doing pretty well. Okay, so next I just want to touch on the first project that I did in my PhD, which was incorporating this behavioral change effect into spatial individual level models. So, just a brief intro to individual-level models if you're not familiar with them. The framework that we were using was introduced by Rob and others in 2010, and they allow us to incorporate individual-level covariate information to be able to model every individual's probability of infection over time. So each individual can have their own specific probability of infection at any given time point. And we're looking at a spatial. And we're looking at a spatial model specifically. So we can see that if we simulate data from this kind of model and we plot individuals according to their spatial coordinates, if we initiate an infection here, that red dot, then subsequent infections are going to radiate out in space from that initial infection location. And this is what the infection probability looks like for a simple spatially. looks like for a simple spatially based ILM. So we have the probability that susceptible individual I will become infected at time t, given by this expression, where alpha is a parameter that describes an individual's susceptibility. And then beta describes the weighting of the spatial effect. And D sub ij there is the Euclidean distance between susceptible individual I and infectious individual J. So, you could really consider this model where the behavioral change could affect susceptibility or it could affect the spatial effect. And we considered both and we found similar results either way. So I'll just focus on where it affects susceptibility because I think that's a bit easier to conceptualize in this equation. So we just introduced the alarm function similarly to how it was introduced in the population average case, where we're multiplying our susceptibility. Where we're multiplying our susceptibility parameter by 1 minus our alarm function. And the alarm function is still defined as before. And we really focused on a simulation study for this project. So I won't really go into the details, but this is some examples of what our epidemic curves look like. So you can compare the epidemic curve when we have no behavioral change and we have a single large peak. So when we introduce behavioral change, So when we introduce behavioral change under a couple of different alarm functions, and if we get strong enough behavioral change, we can start to see multiple smaller peaks instead. So just to go over a couple of the more interesting conclusions, I think, from this project. Firstly, we did find that these models can provide good posterior predictive ability and forecasting ability. And also, what's interesting is Also, what's interesting is that we found that regardless of which alarm functioning we use, we're still going to be getting a better fit than if we just ignore the behavioral change altogether. So it can be hard to choose what your alarm function should look like for a given data set because it's difficult to choose a function that describes people's behavior according to rises in incidence or prevalence. But what we found indicated that it doesn't matter so much. That it doesn't matter so much that you're getting the exact form of the alarm function correct. It mainly matters that you're trying to account for it in some way rather than ignoring it altogether. Okay, and I'll just finish off with some of the future work that we are considering. So this goes back to extension one, which is the project that I'm currently working on, so the behavioral fatigue project. Project, what I'm trying to do right now is investigate the limits of what can be included in a model given the data that we have. So, currently, we're assuming we know infection times, but we have to estimate removal times. So, I'm interested in seeing if we know the removal times, so we have more information about the infection. Could we get our model to tell us more about the actual behavioral change dynamics in that case? And then I'm also interested in exploring different types of adherence functions. So, one in particular that I'm interested in is adherence functions that are driven by changes in academic metrics. So, for example, people might be more adherent to behavioral changes if they see that cases are rising very quickly, whereas they might be less adherent if they sense that cases have been going down for a while. Down for a while. And, like Rob mentioned, we're also interested in comparing these sorts of alarm functions to those that include a behavioral covariant, such as Google mobility data, for example. And then finally, I want to expand on the data analysis portion by conducting further data analyses on different cities and different diseases. So thank you to the organizers for this wonderful conference and also thank you to my funders for my paycheck and I'm happy to answer any questions.
