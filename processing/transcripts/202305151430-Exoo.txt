So we continue with the next talk, which is, I suppose, a part of the computational problems. And the speaker is somebody that I know is the right speaker for this topic. So Jeffrey, I saw the last Thank you. I'd like to thank the organizers. And Robert's taking credit for the weather. And Robert's taking credit for the weather. Yeah, all right, so these are negative results. These are negative results in the strongest sense. It's not like proving a conjecture false or proving some object it doesn't exist. This is negative in the sense I worked on the problem and didn't solve it. So that's why it's negative. I'm going to talk about. I'm going to talk about some problems that maybe you shouldn't work on, actually. So, I know a few things about this problem that I'm pretty sure aren't publishable, but they may be of interest in any case. So, let me go ahead and so they're mostly negative, and then at the very end, there's one little ray of hope. Okay, so here's some changes of. Here's some cages of odd girth. And doing some numerology, you might look at the numbers here at the lower bound and the current upper bound for these odd girth cages. And the excess, sort of, you know, jumping from 12 to 18, that may be a little big of a gem for you to believe that 272 is the right answer. Okay, so again, this is a proof in the system of the lawyers. The sense of a lawyer, but not sense of a mathematician or anything. I started counting numbers of group 11 cubic graphs. And of course, it's well known there's one, 112, that's the cage. There are two on 14, there are three of 116. After that, you might want to maybe not believe me, strictly speaking. Those three are right. The other three, the next three, I'm pretty sure, are right, but I didn't have enough patience to look. But I didn't have enough patience to let the computation run to the end. But I had more interesting things to do, I guess, or something. 124, I think, is closed. It may not be right, but that's how many I know of. 126, I'm pretty sure, isn't right. And the first, up to 122, all of these are related to the 12 cage. So the smallest one we can derive. The smallest one we can derive, we can, the smallest one that isn't there due to the 12 cage is 124. So imagine a universe in which there's no generalized hexagons, which may be impossible, but you know. But then it would look like this, where the excess is 12, then 30, then 82. That looks kind of more reasonable. So maybe it wouldn't be such a shock if. So maybe it wouldn't be such a shock if 272 was the correct answer. Okay. So that's the kind of argument you're going to get here. So anyway, I want to go over all the things that I've tried. So I'm going to kind of make a list of them. There's one thing missing here and I'll talk about that. So of course, your Cayley graphs, many people have searched all the Cayley graphs up to 272. Voltage graphs. Voltage graphs. Okay, so here's how I do some of these things. I limit it to the cases where the group is bigger than the graph, the base graph. So, I mean, any graph is a voltage graph with views, the trivial group, but it's on. And that same sort of restriction applies on a couple other versions. And there are no improvements to 272. You can find the dick. You can find the DIC272 graph as a voltage graph in a surprising number of ways. It's kind of interesting. But anyway, there's this LCF notation, which Judah Letterberg, Toxeter, and Refruit. This is a great family for doing exhaustive computer searches. You don't need to worry about isomorphism problems too much. And you can, you know, easy to program the sites. So naturally, I looked through those. So naturally, I looked through those. Just in case you haven't seen that, the idea here is you have endpoints in a circle, a cycle. So these graphs will be Hamiltonian, and then you draw chords of length C1, C2, and C2. So some famous graphs have this format, the Haywood graph and the McGee graph. And I have this modified version where a plus-minus means whatever numbers are in parentheses. Minus means whatever numbers are in parentheses, you repeat them, but negatives. Okay, I don't know. This is not a great innovation, but it just sets you all writing. All right, so here's some examples. The 313 graph is written this way, and you can find it. And the 314, the current smallest 314 is also of that form. And what I find curious is. What I find curious is that for larger girth, these guys are worthless. They're like two and three times as big as the current bound. And I wonder if there's something I'm not seeing here why, you know, maybe it's obvious that it wouldn't work for a larger girth. It clearly depends on the number of numbers you put in parentheses. But I mean, it's not like what generalized. Like what generalized Peterson graphs for Griffith's eight moments, it doesn't matter how big you make them, there it's the group still gonna be eight. This isn't exactly what's going on here, but anyway, okay. So let's get back to construction methods. It failed to improve the upper bound. The other thing I've looked at is partitioning the adjacency matrix into certificate blocks. And again, the size of the block in this case is at least the size of the girth. Of the girth. So, no point going smaller than that. It's not that I thought this was a good idea. I just had programs like that laying around from other problems. Anyway, I also have searched with all these candidates, add one new point that's asymmetric, that's fixed. So I thought, you know, maybe just one fixed point. I thought, you know, maybe just one fixed point, and everybody else is moving around under the action of a group. No luck there. And this other thing was, you know, partition the graph into girths of cycles. So in that case, the order you're looking for has to be a multiple of the girth. And I think I've done a fairly exhaustive search on those that you won't find it. The one thing missing here, I think, is Factor coset graphs, I guess. Schreier coset graphs, I guess some people call them. And the reason I guess I haven't is that's sort of open-ended, right? I mean, the group could be as big as there's no end. You're never done with those, but maybe there is some hope there. So that's one of the things. The other thing that I've done is one edge at a time in the methods. And so I want to describe what I think. And so I want to describe what I think is still a surprising experiment. Some of you heard this a couple weeks ago, but I'm going to describe two simple methods for finding graphs, pretty much anything, whatever you want, your graph. And the requirements I want are no symmetry assumptions. That's sort of what I want to avoid. And that they randomly sample whatever the graphs are kind of appropriately. Of appropriately. In other words, that p is supposed to be probability that you find the graph is inversely proportional to the automorphism group, which is kind of what you would expect with most models, I guess. And avoid local minimum traps. Heuristics searches are famous for getting stuck. And I want to avoid that. And of course, it might be at least occasionally successful. All right, so here's one method. One method, uh, let me this is for the computer scientists, let me do it in English. So, the idea is you have a partially completed graph and you've got a little list of edges, and you just iterate through the edges and add them to the graph. And if you can add it without violating the conditions, you add it. And so that's like a basic basic procedure that I'll use in other contexts. Okay, and I think I get. Oh, and I think I got an English version of this too. So here's a search that finds the 272 graph, which still surprises me. You create a graph with no edges, you create a list of all the edges, you order the list by some criterion, and the criterion that works is, well, I guess it's the first iteration, it won't matter, but in later iterations. Later iterations, you have decreasing sum of the degrees of the two vertices that make up the edge. So the vertices that have high degree go first, or the edges whose two vertices have high degree go first. Otherwise, they're randomly sorted. And you can start with a more tree if you don't want to start with no edges. And so I want to order them by degree cell. And this will. It doesn't seem like there's a bias in favor of symmetric graphs here. Not that I can see anyway. And it will occasionally produce the graph on 272 verses that we know about. It will never produce anything else. It will not produce anything on 270, 268, 266. Down, you know, the lower we go, the less I've actually tried, but except for T202, I tried. Except for 2202. I try that a lot, which is the lower bound right now. So, anyway, the fact that it finds that graph, only that graph, and repeatedly finds that graph indicates, well, it's another lawyer's argument that maybe the graph doesn't exist. Yeah, okay. Okay, here's another method. The first one thing seemed improbable, this one seems ridiculous. Well, this one seems ridiculous, I think. So I'm going to start with a randomly sorted list of all the edges in Kn, where n is the size of the graph that I want to produce. I'm going to run the greedy algorithm, the greedy method, and start with an empty graph, and I'm going to count the number of edges added. Then I'm going to shuffle the list again, and I'm going to run greedy again. And I'm going to count the number of edges. And if it's worse, I'll undo the shuffle. If not, I'll keep it. It and you know, do this for about a month, and you'll get the graph on 272 vertices and nothing else. Anyway, okay, so let me just compare the two methods. The new, that second one is better at reproducing graphs as you know, random selection might suggest. Suggest it does what it doesn't, it's stuck in the local minima and it's not as fast actually as the other one, but anyway, and they both find the graph on 272. All right. There's a slide you don't see every day. I think I'm going to skip this. These are just okay. Let me talk about Ellisbray connectivity for a minute. This is sort of the new thing that recently. Thing that recently is doing work with Theodore Kolokonikov. He's in Canada. Well, actually, he's in California now, but yeah, he's from Canada. And just to review these things, I don't maybe probably don't have time for much, but the normalized Laplacian I'm going to use, that's kind of if you have an irregular graph, you kind of want to factor out the degree. And so it's the second, the Elsewhere kind of. So it's the second, the L'sbreak connectivity is the second smallest eigenvalue of D. So we asked the following two questions. We're given, find the maximum AC for deregular graphs of diameter D and for deregular graphs of groups of G, what's the maximum L rate connectivity could be and find graphs. Okay, so the usual suspects show up here. First, let me give First, let me show you the theorem. The even case was sort of known. It's implied by all the expander work and so forth. I think the odd one seems to be new required some more work. And degree and girth, same idea. The even one was known. Believe the odd case is new. Okay. So I made another. We have a table here. This is for Dan. We have a table here. This is for diameter. The theoretical bound you can achieve occasionally by Grass, you know, famous Grass, Muggies, Cantor, Papus, Desard, achieve it. First case where we couldn't find one is 10. I don't know. I was surprised. I couldn't find it. So it could be that some of these don't exist. We disagree on this. Tibet believes that they exist. That they exist. I think that the following thing is going on, and this is gonna sound vague, but the order that this formula gives us and the diameter are not growing at the right rate together. And eventually, which I think is already at the bottom of the table, the bound won't be, the theoretical boundary won't be achieved. All right, but anyway, that's that. Bound won't be achieved. All right, but anyway, there's that problem. And same idea with birth, except we know that only a Mohr graph was achieved with the theoretical upper bound. And then a couple other cases, we managed to figure out what the, I don't know, the Foster's graph is the 60 vertex one. I don't know if that's the right name for this graph, but okay. So let's go back to English version of the I'm not. Of the, I modify this program here. Same as the earlier one, except I'm going to order the list by decreasing normalized. So, in other words, if for each edge, if I add the edge, what happens to the normalized algebraic connectivity? I'm not sure if that's really a phrase, normalized algebraic connectivity. It's the normalized second smallest eigenvalue, but whatever. This produces the 380. This produces the 384 vertex example that's the best for 14, which I'm not yet ready to believe that that's the best possible, but and I can say it's only succeeded once. So it could be there's others, but there are computers back in Indiana working on it as we speak. Okay, let me say something about the lower bound. This could be improved if somebody. This could be improved if somebody were kind of motivated to do this. I ran the following program. So, given we have a more tree of the right size, how many edges can you add to the leaves? So, five, the missing, there aren't any. You can do it in the Peterson graph, of course. With the group seven, you can get all the two edges. Get all but two edges. There's nine, all but four, eleven all but eleven, and thirteen all but 17. And so that alone, that so this is like a different version to prove that if there's 17 missing edges, there's 34 edges from the release out to the rest of the graph. So it's got to be at least 12 others. So then you get lower bounded 202. This is slightly different from what McKay and so on did. I mean, it's equivalent, really, but. Equivalent, really, but I've always thought this way of looking at it is worth trying to, I don't know, come up with some sort of relation. If you can only do 11 as worth 11, what does that say about the next one? But anyway, I don't have anything to say. There's a conjecture, I first heard from Frank Harrari when I was a grad student, that all, even grad cages are bipartite. Type and so I thought, well, let's find the smallest ones that aren't because this was for our survey. And we were, this was beyond memory, like nine years ago. I thought this would be a nice little bit to add to the part about this conjecture. And I never did it until I recently, we had thunderstorms in Indiana, which happens, oh, lovely thunderstorm. Here's the upper bounds. Let me just say one other thing. We don't know how to construct even, I mean, odd Earth graphs. I think Graham said essentially the same thing in a talk I heard. And all these bounds are excision from the even-girth graph, all the odd girth bounds, except for Bray-Parkman-Rowley. Bray-Parkman and Rowley know how to find odd girth graphs, but the rest of us don't, I guess, or something. Rest of us don't, I guess, or something. I don't know, I just think that's interesting. And theirs is a coset graph. So let's look at, all right, let me find the smallest evening groups graphs that I'm at by party. We had a thunderstorm, and the computers were all down for three days. So I thought, I wonder if I can do anything in graphic without a computer. I was skeptical. Plot. Okay, so so far I'm not doing too good. This is the Wienersen graph, of course, and the girth is not six, it's five. So I want to kill all the five cycles. So I subdivide those edges. And then each of those three colored vertices get adjacent to one more. And that's one of the two smallest. One of the two smallest. The other one isn't as nicely presentable. So there are two. And actually, this isn't much of a result because, as my computer later told me, there's only seven cubic graphs that you have to check. So it's not like this was a major discovery. So when I got the computer back, I thought, well, how about growth eight? And here's the answer: 38. And it's kind of the same idea. Well, maybe. The same idea? Well, maybe not. So I'm going to start with the 12 cycle and then I'm going to add how I used to call that a corona, I think. Yeah, anyway. So add a corona. And then a little tree. And then, okay, that's like we're up to what? 34. I need four more vertices. And so what I'm going to do, okay, this is the experiment. The experiment in describing a graph. We'll see. So, these four on the outside, I'm going to join them to the ones on the coronas, they're on the same colors, which is as you can see every third, every fourth one, 120 degrees. Okay, so that's those. They have degree three now, the four on the outside. And then the ones on the leaves are adjacent to antipodal vertices. Vertices and like each pair of leaves on the same stalk are adjacent to pairs at 90 degrees from each other. That's it. So there's that. And then there's the other one. So I thought, how am I going to put those two together? And my solution was to use shapes for the outer one. Anyway, okay, so enough pictures. There is a 8 to 80 vertex mount by vertex graph. I don't know that it's the smallest, but I hope to soon. 70 is the cage. Okay, let me go on to. I've been working with some little companies in San Francisco, little startups, five and ten people. And we work with Amazon. Amazon web services, Amazon Web Services, you know, because companies don't want to start their own IT department, they'll rent out email, they'll rent out web services, database, anything. You can buy hardware, you can buy what you want. And so I was doing some stuff with them, and I noticed in their price that their pricing structure is amazingly complicated. But you can just buy CPUs and And Amazon Web Service, 128, 3.5 gigahertz. These are Xeons, if that means it's anything to 256 gigabytes of RAM for $5.40 an hour. And that's if you're in on demand time. If you'll take it off time when they're not busy, you can get it down to 20%. If you're academics and they approve your project, you can get it down another 10%. Anyway, so here's one problem that I knew how long it took. Problem that I knew how long it took would have cost $30,000. Okay, so I thought, what's the next cage? Well, 8.5, which I had played with, the lower bound, improving it, and a million and a quarter. Now, probably not all of you came here today expecting to buy a cage from a million and a quarter, but so I have a couple bargains. A six regular two-geodetic cage for only two. 2 geodetic cage for only for 25 cents a year. And there's a couple other problems that I have actually tried to do. And the thing is, Amazon has this unlimited, they have like millions of these things. All right, there's a couple of problems that I've tried to work on. One is a strong mirror graph, and the other is factoring K-50, which I know we have the experts here, but. Here, but uh, all right, so anyway, thank you.
