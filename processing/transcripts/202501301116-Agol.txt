The auditorium in the lower corner of my screen. So I can't see if anyone has any questions. So if you have any questions, feel free to interrupt me and I won't be able to see though if someone has their hand raised. So yeah, thanks a lot to the organizers for letting me talk here. I'm not really an expert on markup numbers. I spent maybe a few months last year. Maybe a few months last year, after reading an article about some advances in the markup numbers. So, just for the fun of it, I thought I'd think about it for a while. And so I thought I'd share what little I need to do. So originally, I was going to give a lightning talk. So I'm going to give a short talk about the Markov theorem, but we've had a background talk already from Christopher. Already from Christopher Lloyd that told about the relation between the Markov theorem and simple curves in the torus. So instead, I'm just going to dive right in to talk about the theorem of, I believe it's due to Haas from around 86. And around the same time, Burritten and Wender and Scheingborn proved a similar theorem. And but I was originally familiar with the article Carolyn series from 1985. I think maybe I learned about this from Dylan Thurston about 20 years ago. And anyway, so this states, this theorem that an immersed primitive closed geodesic on a once-punctured torus is disjoint from a horocusp of area floor, if and only if it's embedded. So, anyways, I apologize if this has been discussed this week. I haven't been able to make it to all the talks. So, anyways, it's possible that this version of the theorem has come up already. But certainly, this was stated by Christopher Lloyd's talk for the modular punctured torus, the one with the hexagonal symmetry. But, anyways, this slightly more general theorem holds. So, and it's well known then that this implies the Markov theorem about the Markov spectrum less than three. So, again, this was discussed in Christopher Lloyd's talk. So the one direction of this is a little bit easier. So if we have a punctured torus with a complete hyperbolic metric and a rank one cusp, then we can always. We can always embed a Horo Toro disk or Horo cusp of area at least four. So the worst case scenario is when you kind of pinch down a curve to be parabolic. And then when you take a maximal such cusp in there, it'll become self-tangent when you reach area four. Of course, that's the same length as the length of the boundary. Boundary. And so we know from Diophantine approximation, again, discussed by Christopher Lloyd, is that if I have a geodesic, then the amount that it dips into the cusp is telling you something about how well you can approximate via continued fractions and it's related to diophantine approximation and the Lagrange number and the Markov number if it's a quadratic irrational. It's a quadratic ration. Okay, so on a torus with a conformal structure, there's an elliptic involution. There's actually many different elliptic involutions, but if we have a puncture, then there's a unique one that fixes the puncture. And it sends any curve to any embedded geodesic curve on the punctured torus to its inverse. And again, I think this has been discussed this. And again, I think this has been discussed this week many times. So with the isometry also of the hyperbolic metric, it takes geodesics to geodesics. And so we can look at the picture in the universal covers. I've drawn like the version of the modulo torus. And if we take a cusp of, oops, here I meant to draw. Oops, here I meant to draw of height one. So we can normalize it in the upper half space model. So we have a cusp of height one, and the translation length is four. Then this distance between here and here would be equal to four. So on the modulator, you get this by taking the maximal cusp and then shrinking it by a factor of two-thirds. And so we see this kind of shrunken version of the Apollonian packing when we're looking at the modulotaurus. When we're looking at the modulo torus. Anyways, if gamma is embedded, then it'll be disjoint from its image under the lift of this elliptic involution acting near the cusp, disjoint from this, and therefore it'll be disjoint from the cusp of area four because these circles must be disjoint. So their diameters are at most two, their heights are at most one, and hence they're just. Are at most one and hence they're disjoint from the custom. Again, I think this has been discussed in some fashion this week. So, the sketch of the proof of Haas's theorem using curvature flow. So, for the other direction, we consider an immersed geodesic curve called gamma bar. So, we have a punctured torus and we've what happens if it's not embedded? Well, we can look at gamma and then. Well, we can look at gamma and then we can look at its image under this involution. And so we get this, my picture's not very good, but you get this symmetric pair of curves that are related under the involution. Now, one fact about geodesics in hyperbolic surfaces, they intersect minimally up to homotopy, so they have a minimal number of self-intersections. Now, by uniformization theorem, we know that we can make this torus into unique, conformally equivalent Euclidean. Unique conformally equivalent Euclidean torus with fillets in the cusp of the point. And let's say it's area one, just a conformally equivalent. In particular, tau will be still an isometry of that metric. So now what we do is we can perform curvature flow on gamma and tau of gamma on the union of these geodesics. You can do it on any number of geodesics. Now on a flat torch, Now, on a flat torus, any curve of minimal length will be geodesic, will be some multiple of a closed geodesic curve. And so it will converge to a multiple of a geodesic or a point if it's homotopically trivial. Now, this will shrink the lengths of the curves, gamma t and tau gamma t. So in curvature flow, you have some curve, and at each point, there'll be Each point, there'll be a mean curvature vector. So you flow, if it's higher curvature, it'll be longer and you flow sort of faster. So here's kind of a picture. At points of high curvature, it'll move faster than at points of low curvature. It's a theorem that if you have an embedded curve, it remains embedded under curvature flow. So this, we can take our flat torus now and take our immersed curve, our pair of curves, and it'll under curvature flow. And it'll under curvature flow, it'll converge to some multiple of a flat geodesic. Now, let's see what happens with our curves on our punctured surface. Well, there's a theorem of Angenot from the 90s that says that if you have a tangency between these two curves under this flow, it'll occur only when the intersection number decreases. There's also a version for a single immersed curve. Single immersed curve, it'll sort of the locally the self-intersection number will be decreased when you have a tangency point. But because of our we know that the curves start out minimally intersecting, so the only way that and the two curves are invariant under this involution rotates here. So the only way that the curvature number can decrease. Curvature number can decrease as if they pass through the cusp. So there's to be some point where this curve goes, hits the cusp, and then tau will be, tau gamma t will be 180 degree rotation of that. And then after it's passed through the cusp, we'll see the intersection number has decreased. But if you back this up, what you see is this kind of bygone region going between the two curves. And so this, the existence of this bygone. And so, this the existence of this bygone is proved in Haas's paper and Meiner Schangorn. Now let's look this to H2, the universal cover, and what we see are gamma and tau of gamma are going to, this bygone lives to this sort of infinite crown sort of thing. And we get this picture here. This picture here, but now our the translation length here is um the translation length. Oh, something weird happened here, sorry. Anyways, it's um translation length four. So each of these must have length at least two in order to, and so they have to go into the cusp. So that means that an immersed curve must intersect H. Okay. Intersect H. Okay, so that's just a sketch of the proof. Now, obviously, it's using some high-powered theorem from PDEs about curvature flow of curves on surfaces. Nevertheless, I think it sort of gives an intuitive idea for the existence of this bygone, which leads to this estimate. Now, just a remark then, a much more elementary proof may also be given via There's a kind of simpler proof of curvature flow of Haas and Scott that can be adapted to the situation and give a proof that's extremely elementary, where you sort of do the curvature flow just by kind of straightening pieces of the curve locally and coordinate charts. And so this. And so, this there's a very elementary proof of this theorem this way. And I should say also that Haas and Scott sort of prove the existence of bygons or monogons when the curve goes to something that's embedded. It's really only the case of an immersive when the curve ends up being immersed multiple of a GDS curve in the end that they didn't prove exactly what's needed to prove this thing. So, anyways, that's a sketch of. So, anyways, that's a sketch of a proof of the Markov theorem, or this more general version that works for any punctured torus. Now, I have a question I have is the Markov spectrum above three, we've had some talks on that this week, has many gaps until you reach Freyman's constant. So, is there a topological explanation for the Markov spectrum below Freman's constant? In other words, are there, if we look at closed geodesics that have Essex that have their Lagrange number or their Markov number between three and Freman's constant. Do these geodesics, do they, they're immersed, so they're going to have to have some of these bygons around a cusp, but maybe they don't have that many. They have few bygons or something. So, anyways, I don't really know the literature on this. This might be addressed in the literature. There seems to be lots of papers on this topic, and I didn't, um, I haven't gone through them and see if anyone's. I haven't gone through them and see if anyone's addressed this question, but it seemed like a natural thing to look at the immersed curves that sort of realize some of these small Lagrange numbers for quadratic numbers that are in this range. Okay, so that's all I wanted to say on Markov's theorem. And I guess that was about half my time. So does anyone have any questions or comments? Does anyone have any questions or comments? And I apologize also if this is sort of well known, or I haven't done a thorough literature search on all these things. And I know that there's many other proofs of these theorems out there. So hopefully I haven't sort of just reproduced something that's in the literature. I have a question. Yeah. You raised this. Did you have an explanation of the whole array from any? Of the whole array from any viewpoint? No, no, I have no idea. This is just something. Yeah, no, I haven't really looked into these. Anyways, yeah, I don't know anything about these higher order Lagrange numbers spectrum. Yeah, thanks. This seemed like an interesting question. So maybe people have already looked at these like immersed curves that like the I think the spectrum from like three to square root of 12 is something like you look at Root of 12 is something like you look at continued fractions where all the coefficients are two or one or something like that. And so, are there any interesting immersed curves coming from those if they're periodic, say, and is some interesting topology going on? That might be well known. Like, for example, I think Christopher mentioned passing to congruence subgroups and look at embedded curves and congruence subgroups. So, do those give you nice small Lagrange numbers? Small lagarage numbers or things like that. This is something I haven't really thought about. Ian just saw this question. I'm pretty sure this is open. For a springman, and I spent a little bit of time thinking about it. We haven't gotten very far yet, but it does seem like there's going to be more deciding. Okay, cool. Great. All right. So now 15 minutes, I wanted to say a little bit more about. So, I thought a little bit about this sort of unicity conjecture last year, and it didn't really get anywhere. But I wanted to share a little bit of what I sort of discovered about the Markov equation. So I'm going to go to a different set of slides here and talk about factorizations of integral solutions of the Markov equations over the Gaussian integers. So, this is, and again, this is something that could have been discovered. I haven't found it in the literature, but I haven't done a completely thorough literature search. Completely thorough research. So, I just wanted to share a little bit of what I was, some things that I sort of discovered about the Markov equation. So, we've already heard about integral solutions, so I'm going to skip this part of the slide, but I want to talk about ways of parameterized Markov triples. And again, some of this has appeared this week. So, Harry Kahn realized the connection between Markov numbers and marginal torus that I was just discussing. It was discussed in previous talks. So, we have these conjugacy classes of matrix. We have these conjugacy classes of matrices in SL2Z, whose holnomy represents any Merse curve on the punctured torus, on the modular punctured torus. And he figured out a nice way to parametrize these matrices. So the Vieta involutions, they lift to matrix multiplication. So you have these con matrices where your M is a Markov number, the trace is 3M, and U is a characteristic number of that. Number of that Markov number. So we have these contriples and matrices that traces satisfy the version of the Markov equation without a three. And then if you have a contriple, there's an iterative way of generating them where you take R and T and you multiply them, or TNS and you multiply them. And this is from Egner's book. I found Egner's book to be quite a useful reference on these topics. And so you can generate this tree. Topics and so you can generate this tree of Markov matrices. And then you see that this u then for the determinant, negative u squared is congruent to minus one mod m. So this is called the characteristic number in Egner's book. And again, I'm not sure how normal that terminology is. But anyways, the claim is that U determines the Markov triple. And this is something I think that also has appeared in a paper of Jonah Gaster, but I'm not sure how well this is known. Not sure how well this is known, but if I take the disjoint geodesic from the simple closed geodesic that goes to the cusp and then normalize it in the universal cover, then it'll be go to the rational number u over m. There's an involution that fixes this point, a lift of the elliptic involution. And this point will be u plus i over m. And then you see that m divides u squared plus one. So we can rewrite. So we can rewrite Markov's equation then, and we see that u is congruent to A over B mod C, because A and B are co-prime. And so this gives the relation of U to the Markov equation. And then you see also immediately that U determines the Markov triple because it determines this closed curve and hence the disjoint, I mean the ray and hence the disjoint curve. Now there's another slightly different viewpoint where we Slightly different viewpoint where we can parametrize things. So, C divides A squared plus B squared, A and B are co-prime. And so we can factor it over the Gaussian integers. So we can factor these Markov numbers over the Gaussian integers in this more or less unique way, depending on the triple it sits in. And to go from U to well, so we just do the Euclidean algorithm, take the G C D of A, of C and A plus IB, and we. Of C and A plus IB, and we get some factorization. C is C1 squared and C2 squared. And C1 divided by C2 will be congruent to plus or minus U mod C. So for example, one is one, two is one plus I times one minus I. We get these various factorizations that mark out numbers this way. And so if we write D as 3ab minus C, then we can also sort of factorize this version. Also, sort of factorize this version of the equation where we've replaced D via the Vietnam evolution here. We've replaced this in the equation, and we can also take the GCD of D with A plus or minus IB, and we get some factorization here. So the factorization of the Markov equation in this version, what we've written it with four variables, is A plus Bi is these two Gaussian sort of roots of these Markov numbers. These of these Markov numbers C and D. We can also rewrite the Markov equation as a sum of squares is also another factor where we're sort of parametrizing things with the three times the Markov number, plus or minus two, which is sort of related to a little bit more to the binary forms that represent these Markov numbers. And so, in this way, we see that. And so, in this way, we see that 3A plus or minus b is a square root of minus 4 modulo 3c plus or minus 2 or 3d plus or minus 2. So the product of these two things is 9c squared minus 4 is the discriminant to the Markov equation thought of as a quadratic form. So So then we can take the G C D of 3a plus or minus B and 2, it's either equal to 1 or 2. I mean, we get a factorization. Now, if we take GCD over the Gaussian integers with the Gaussian root of this, which is this number here, we get a Gaussian root of 3C plus or minus 2. Now, if there's a factor of 2, these might not be co-prime, but they have various, you know, at most 2 is a factor. And we get a factorization of. And we get a factorization of d. So we get another sort of factorization of the this version of the Markov equation over the over the Gaussian integers. Now, so what I wanted, so what my hope was, so we know that, let me just, let me just say then unicity due to many people, Schmidt, Schaller, Bergar, Button showed that if a Markov number is a prime power to If a Markov number is a prime power, two times a prime power, then it's unique. And the proof is: well, we have this quadratic root of minus one mod C, and for numbers of this form, you see that there's a unique such root, and hence it determines the Markov triple uniquely because it determines the characteristic number. And in a similar way, Um, in a similar way, uh, due to Bergar and Zhang and Srinivasa and various people, um, if 3c plus or minus 2 is 2 to the j times p to the k, and we know what 2 to the j can happen here depending on the congruence mod 8, I think, of c, then c is also unique. And so, here the point is kind of similar. Now, this is a slight variation on a proof of, so there's a variation. So, there's a variation on the proof I saw in Egner's book. And again, I apologize if this is well known, but, anyways, you so there's a square root of minus four mod 3C plus or minus 2 that's from this factorization, Ramarkov equation here. And we get 3A plus or minus B is congruent to plus or minus U mod 3C plus or minus 2. 3c plus or minus 2. Now, when c is the maximum of this triple, then a and b are much smaller in general. And so we get a unique root, you know, it's less than half of this modulus, at least if a is not equal to one. So there's some extra, this is just a sketch of a proof, but there's some extra argument you have to make when a is one. But in any case, you get a quadratic root of minus four. So the slight difference between what Egnut looked at, square roots of minus. What Egnit looked at square roots of minus one there, and then did a similar kind of argument, but this is just a slight variation on that. So, this gives sort of another derivation of these terms. Anyway, so we get these various factorizations of the Markov equation, and they correspond to these various square roots of either a minus four modulo plus or minus two, or of minus one mod C. And I wanted to see like. And I wanted to see, like, since we have these three numbers, these square roots that parameterize the Markov triple, I wanted to know, well, is there some relation between these roots? Well, we see a slight relation here that 3A plus or minus B is these will be congruent mod two. So you get these two roots that determine the triple, and there's a congruence. Determine the triple, and there's a congruence relation between them. But that's, I haven't found any other kinds of relations between them. But I was hoping that these roots are also determined by the factorization of the Gaussian integers. There's a way to go between the square root of minus one, the Gaussian factorization, and which into almost co-prime factors. And so I was wondering if there's some relation between the different groups for the Gauss. Three different groups for the Gaussian integers of these three numbers. And again, the upshot of, you know, so is that I think there's no extra relations, like algebraic relations between them or anything. But I wanted to give a geometric interpretation of these things just and then and then I'll stop there. So again, we have the Markov number represented by a simple geodesic and the disjoint curve. So we can normalize this curve. And there's a type, there's elliptic involution that fixes. Type the elliptic involution that fixes the point in this curve. So we normalize it in the upper half-space model. And what is the Gaussian factor? Well, it's C1 over C2. So this geodesic will have fractions C1 over C2 and minus C2 over C1, the negative inverse. And so C is C1 squared plus C2 squared. So that's kind of a geometric interval of this factorization. Now, we can also view after the hyperliptic. Also, view after the hyperliptic quotient, we can view this as a disk with three cone points or two disc H2 mod gamma three. And so we get these arcs connecting these, you know, these embedded curves go to arcs connecting punctures to the boundary, and we can. To the boundary, and we can um so I wanted to talk about yet another parameterization. Um, we can project this also to H to the modular space, and we this curve will project to a curve that you know each each closed curve will project to a curve that goes through I, the cone point of order two. And so for every embedded curve, For every embedded curve, there's going to be some whole numbing matrix. And I wanted to find some inductive way of describing these whole numbers matrices. Well, it turns out that it's easier to sort of describe the slight square root of one. So each of these is a product of this elliptic involution, some other elliptic involution. It goes through two virus stress points. And so it's a product of two involutions. And so we have a product of tau times the conjugate of tau. And what is this matrix? Conjugate of tau, and what is this matrix? Well, it's just the matrix that's the holonomy of this arc, which is half of the arc because it's been folded over. And so we get these matrices that I'm writing WXYZ that are sort of, again, a square root in PSL2Z of my embedded curve. And these satisfy this equation, the sum of the squares of these matrices is 3C. And if I take W, take this matrix. W take this matrix times its transpose, or there's two different orders, I'll get the holomony of the simple closed curve that is geodesic. In any case, we get. So I found some kind of analog of the con tree where you start with three of these matrices and you can get the next set of matrices. And here's the beginning of this kind of tree that generates these kind of square roots. These kinds of square roots of the matrices whose commutator with the involution gives me the polynomial of the embedded closed curve. And we also have this relation here. So these matrices end up encoding the Gaussian roots of 3C plus or minus 2. And so that's kind of a geometric interpretation of these numbers in this case. And you can also see it that there's A, A transpose, and A transpose A. I can rotate one to the other, and one of these factors. And one of these factors will give me sort of the rotation in PGL2Q if you write it integer matrix. And the other one, if you write it the right way, will give me the reflection that exchanges these two. So that's kind of a geometric interpretation of these. And I conjecture there's no other algebraic relations between A and B. And this is also kind of a root of the Markov equation. So in any case, I think that's my time. That's about all I have to say. My time, that's about all I have to say. Here's something I pulled from my notes that shows some of these Gaussian roots for the Markov tree. And I was looking for various patterns among these numbers, but I found some patterns, but they turn out to be kind of spurious. They don't seem to really have any. I was able to explain them via some small coincidences. So, anyways, that's all I have to say. Any more questions for you? Do you have a geometric interpretation of the unicity in terms of looking at this in Z of R, you've got this continuum fraction expansion, and at some point, maybe you because you've leaded R. Because you've got the Euclidean algorithm, can you express it in terms of that point in the lattice as a unique closest point or something like that? In terms of the geometry, the Euclidean geometry of the Gaussian integer, do you have a formulation of finding this U in this? Sorry, I had trouble understanding the question because there was a bell that rang. But yeah, anyways, I haven't thought much about the continuity. I haven't thought much about the continued fraction relations. I mean, to go from the Gaussian factor to the square root, you know, mod C or 3C plus or minus 2, but these characteristic numbers, there's some kind of Euclidean algorithm that you need to do to go from one to the other. And I was hoping to find more algebraic relations, but the upshot is that I think there probably aren't any algebraic relations that, but sorry, I didn't really understand your question because I couldn't really. I didn't really understand your question because I couldn't really hear it. Boris Springborn, I have a question and a comment. So, the comment is: Can you show me the numbers again that you briefly show me the rational numbers again? Oh, yeah, you can other denominators, they're not always Markov numbers, but they yeah, some of them end up being Markov numbers. Yeah, some of them end up being markup numbers. That's also there's kind of a small coincidence explanations for those things. There could be a relation to the worst approximable rational numbers. That would be cool. Yeah, I mean, some of the approximable ones are just the U over Markov numbers, you know, the characteristic number over Markov numbers. But yeah, I would, I was looking at some of the numbers that appear in your examples to see if there's any overlap, but I didn't see. Any overlap, but I didn't really see, or I didn't spend a lot of time, but yeah, it would be interesting to see if there's some correlations there. And the question was, are you saying, what's the statement about minus 4 being a square? So is it if C is a Markov number, then minus 4 is a square mod 3C plus 2? Or U equals minus 4 is a square. Minus 4 is a square. u squared equals minus 4. Yes. Modulo discomfined. But the question is, is it true that if C is a Markov number, then minus 4 is a square mod 3C plus 2 or minus 2 or what's C is like? Well, if it's odd, it will be, I guess, because you can just invert 2. Yeah, I'm not sure about an even markup number. Yeah, I don't know. Let's see. Let's see. So we're looking at you're wondering if you can, if you can, well, I think you can just put, yeah, you can just put two on both sides here. Sorry, I couldn't hear that. Q squared equals minus four mod three c plus minus two. Two. Yeah, I think you can just put a over here? No, wait, wait, below. Boris is asking about mod 3C plus 2n, or 3C minus 2. Over here, yeah. Yes, I think there was the equation 2 squared equals minus 4 somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. There. Yeah. So is this saying if C is a Markov number, then minus 4 is a square mod 3C plus 2? Yeah, that's just this equation here. What do you mean by plus or minus? You mean for each one? Yeah, you just choose plus or you choose minus, and you get, yeah, so there's two different factors. Yeah, so there's two different factorizations you get: one for plus and one for minus. Sorry, I was just trying to compress the notation so I didn't have to do the two cases. But yeah, there's a plus case. And so one of these corresponds to a rotation between the two different geodesics going through eye, and one of them corresponds to reflection, these factorizations here. And again, I don't know what significance that is, but it was just something. What significance that is, but it was just something that was. I thought, oh, there's these matrices, there ought to be some recurrent way of generating them. And so I figured out how to do it. I'm not sure what it's good for, but it's and again, it doesn't seem like I looked through the literature of things citing Kahn's paper, and I didn't find anyone that had done this kind of thing before. It was just something I was curious about. Did you observe that there that C9 and C. 9 C squared minus 4 have the same number of prime factors for C of Martin's number? No, that's not true in general. No. Yeah, I wrote some Mathematica notebooks to generate these things. But yeah, in general, yeah, they don't. Oh, let me say one other thing. You can. thing you can you can factorize the markup equation over any over the gaussian integers over any um kind of you know any any entries the but you you you can sort of but there's some choices you have to make which gaussian factor do you choose and so when you propagate that you might get very different numbers than what you get here so somehow over the integers you're getting sort of a canonical way of choosing this factor or once you make one Choosing this factor, or once you make one choice, all the other choices are made. That's not completely obvious, but it turns out to be true in this case. Thank you, and what's more. Thank you.
