It was like this big at the top that's like good. When you like both the size, it's normal. I think when it really knows it or not as small, I don't know. See, that's fine. It goes exactly to where the text is on the thing. And covers if the if the text would be for a second it was bigger, but now it's fine. I don't know how seems to be fine. I think it's probably because I'm not behaving like your ordinary speaker and it's picking up sound from other places and things. Again, it should do whatever it was doing a few weeks ago. It should do whatever it was doing a few weeks ago. It just wasn't when we first started. Now it's a big thing, shh, isn't something new about it to the programming that has been there and it's just something that's triggering it. Okay and Chi, are you like, that's how it always was, right? Do you guys understand that? Or do you think it's too big now? Yeah, I think I think a few seconds ago that size is Seconds ago, that size is like how it used to be. Yeah, that's how it's supposed to be. That's how it always has been. It just started the test, something was going wrong, and it was showing a bigger was going double that size and getting onto the trajectory. But now it's... Because Ian says the script has not changed, so probably just some environmental reasons that's supposed to listen to microphones behind the boards, these microphones, and then make a decision as to what camera shot to show you. What camera shot to show you. Sometimes you can see it's deciding that it wants to show me over here. None of that's changed. That's exactly as it's like looking at the code, it's like eight years old or something like that. And that's not something that I can modify for you. If you wanted that stuff modified, that's go back to the auto-auditorium people, say this camera view sucks, we want it to follow the speaker when they just pop up's too big. That's something they Pop-ups too big, that's something they could fix, but it's not something that's exposed within Zoom or Castle. It's purely within auto-auditorium. I think it will. It's just like the only thing we've changed was the audio levels. And maybe that's enough to tell auto or convince auto auditorium it needs a big overlay, but there's nothing we can do right now. So far in this session, all the sizes are fine. With the first one, which was I think it vanishes under, I don't know what condition tells it to go away, but I think also like if you change slides and stuff, it does change something yeah, like when I move. Yeah, vanish. If you change a slide, it should show you this. Not working the slide thing disconnected only have one slide I think we're good at it. I don't know, link, I guess. Two weeks ago, we had a problem that no one had two weeks ago. On mine, I had pressed another application, so when I was pressing. Application. So when I was pressing up and down, it was trying to tell Zoom to do something, but that doesn't mean anything to Zoom. I had to click on PowerPoint and then it started whatever application. That's what it does. It goes right to the edge of the text. And then it goes back to the edge where the text is. And if I start talking again, get out of the way. So does it like depend on how much text is on the slide and it will expand accordingly? And make sure you can see everything on the slide. I haven't paid attention to that. Did you ever realize that in like 10 years or 80? No, I know that there was a pop-up. I knew that one camera detects the motion, other one just stays still. I didn't know that they go up and down and size like that. Okay. That was also the first thing I displayed. The first thing I displayed was my browser, which was probably fairly complicated for it to figure out where the text was. Right. Under the app that can be it, you can totally do it. I don't even know if that's possible. Um so changing this isn't going to change anything in the recordings. Change anything in the recordings, so you're free to do whatever you want to do in Zoom. It's at the moment not automated, but I can do stuff like my view to okay, that makes sense. Yeah, that's all we'll have to do then. I can do stuff like that, and I can probably figure out how to do that in the automation, but I think the default will be it might be just whatever the last Zoom meeting was, so you Didn't we mute the thing on the You say something, G? Oh no no no I did say something I didn't change it to him because it's local, I think? Yeah, so it's probably gonna remove this pile. I didn't see it. Yeah, I mean Carlos, do you want to reverse the pile? Can we move it just on there? Um Um that's not anything that's not the spotlight. There we go, now it's showing me. Yeah, no, I think when once the spotlight's back to I think you can do what you want to do, but the spotlight has to be You can do what you want to do, but the spotlight has to be off, which is not ideal because. Oh, but then it's gonna jump. So we'll have to like. Carlos, can you make sure spotlights turned off? Just turned off the spot off. There's no spotlight at the moment. Alright. Can you speak, Chief? Can you hear me? Testing one to three. And then that's the order, though, that I put it on speaker view, and then that's testing. Danny, if you can hear us, if you're still there, if you say something, it should bring you up. I can hear it in. Oh yeah, perfect. No echo? That is like, I don't know. That is like, I don't, I don't see how we can do anything about that, except we have to think you'd have to, like, that would be the end of a talk. I hear big, but then the voice is very small. I hear Ian more clearly. I'm right under the microphones, then that microphone isn't working. Which one? The one on the right? Yep. So, like, like the whole part, I'm just just like the point of this is so that there's a face. The point of this is so that there's a face to the question, for instance. But the way it is, like, if there's a bunch of virtual participants, we have to spotlight, otherwise they're gonna be like, What the heck? What's going on? I can't see the speaker. All I can see is they're just gonna see us, and they're gonna be confused. The best I can offer the moment is you know you need the spotlight still because Castle The best I can offer is the gallery view on that thing. Gallery view on that thing and make sure that stays on gallery. All you would see is the array of speakers and the glowing thing around them. It's not going to be a speaker view, but I think when you hit the spotlight, Carlos, can you turn the spotlight back onto this room? It just shhs that thing over, that green box over onto what we spotlighted, which is in the Have to stay always in gallery view? Yeah, that's possible, and what I don't think is possible right now is having it in speaker view. That's okay. Better than seeing your own presentation. Yeah, so even though it's spotlighted, you can get that. But then Chi, can you say something just to see where you can see if the green box is? Oh, green, green. Yeah, no, just. Yeah, no, that's Carlos. Okay, Carlos. Hey, Jake. So that's like... Oh, we don't know who is speaking. Say there's 10 people in there, and I'm wondering if that person's going to show up at all, if it's just going to be hidden. That's about as close as you're going to get. If you don't have, if it's just a discussion and there's question going back and forth, you can remove the spotlight and then what you're... You can remove the spotlight, and then what you're expecting would happen. But when there is a need to have the speaker recorded, would the speaker be within? I heard it's old now. Oh, you removed the spots I heard? No, well, what's the one? It's uh the remote spotlight. Oh, okay. Um, well it just has like kinda like limited application. I think like it doesn't really do what we hoped it would do. That's just what I'm thinking. That's just what I was thinking, I think. If someone is asking questions, once you see them, who's asking questions, and then you respond back, because right now you're just going to see all 150 people whoever that camera is on. Maybe you're lucky it's all people. That could sometimes be the case. There's only a few. And all I can think of to do would be I'm not suggesting I'm going to automate this, but you can remove it like when you get flight. Then like back to what we would read by the spotlight's acting, say the questions though because they'll if you move the spotlight in spotlight acting Highlighting one. If the spotlight and speeder starts talking, it will show highlight the one that's highlighted at the moment. Yeah, which is a problem, right? Because then they're going to answer a question and go back to the slide. They're going to say, well, can you see which go back to this slide? And then they're like So that won't work out it. It would work and if someone knows how to work it. File fault. Well, but well it yeah, if you know how to use zoom, that like as soon as you remove the spotlight they're not forcing the view for the other people. Allow your speaker view from your yeah just seems like the screen is like of limited use. Yeah, what's the point of the screen if you don't see the individual person like asking the question virtually to the inverse? Well, one use of the screen is that that's your view at the microwave. There are a bunch of limitations that we're up against with Zoom, but That's what I mean, yeah. I just don't know what we're saying. What happens if individually every uh virtual participant spotlights the speaker? So there's pinning and the spotlight. The spotlight, basically the host forcing the whole meeting to say, look at this person. Pinning is up to the individual participants. But you can have one view observer, and I can have a completely different, I can have a speaker view and gallery and stuff. Even if I spotlighted for everyone? Spotlight in is a suggestion. I can turn it off on my device and say, like, no, I'd rather see the gallery. Oh, I see, I can move it. Who's up the speaker switching? Because our audio goes into the Mac menu rather than goes into passing that top camera. That top camera because it thinks that's what's speaking for probably rather it shows the camera. Oh, it's the Zoom meeting you joined, right? About the laptop, about Danny. So you can see a part of the crowd screen. Okay, that's fine. Just I think now that you see it, it's like, okay, picture these limitations. Because it's good. Because it's good. Someone's going to say, like, people are asking questions and I don't know who it is, I can only see someone's going to say that. They don't find the laugh to answer the question, because usually they'll answer if they can't see them. But if they're offered the option to see them, and they can't see them, they'll be like, that's weird. What's the problem? And also, we cannot really see a person audience with lights down. Kinda dark. It's it must be my my facial hair. Yeah, I know it's his personal, but it's just the light, how it affects. So if we turn off the light, anyone using their own laptops here will be like this. I think we got it discovered, we don't need to have a lot of time. It helped put the turn the lights off. A bit washed out, but I think if you get so good next week, potentially. All our best to come back and think just the ones that don't. I think this does do thing. Does it do like but yeah. I mean it's a star, but the screen like for dot use is also made too small. Yeah, 'cause right now there's like seven people imagine hundred. This was this was all like a half of a year. Every curve screen is chosen so that it doesn't screw them all, which is I think I'll say fill out the whole edit campaign. I don't know if you have sixty people. So summing it up, like I'll have a think about it and see if I can make some suggestions for how maybe you'll get um started with every planning. Where do they need to use Zoom? Is there no other similar form of conferencing system which you would allow? Probably not, but then you have to go and rewrite all the automation scripts for those people don't. But I feel like it's like a third party, it's like Yapo back in the day, and it was just Yaku Mail. We have our own. We have this David person joining every meeting for past three months, and no matter what I do, we cannot kick him out. I don't know. I reported it to Zoom customer service. Reported it to Zoom customer service with block camp, it still pops up. So I'm not quite sure how to deal with this. Leave him be, David. Like, if I was here longer, you need a text up, but it's not working. I need these like callies. That's that's easy to repeat. Why would anyone even do that? I just don't get it. We can just kick him out when we see him and he's gonna get annoyed for sure. Honestly, you have this as an electronic problem, we've had it as a physical problem. Having people turn up at pins and we can't make them leave. Yeah. Turn up for an event. So I would pick pens and my cover. Regardless of what it is, if there's a registration fee involved and stuff, you're trying to come in. Yeah, well. Yeah, so it costs only 24. So it's not. So we doesn't cost us anything and it doesn't really change anything. I know, right? That's super weird. Which is true to you for coffee. Coffee and donut. That's kind of smart, I guess. Where I would make the change is if they started to move the trophy. If they were unneutrants, I should hate. Oh, it's just hanging in there. Yeah, it doesn't do anything. Yeah, he doesn't do anything at least yet. Kind of like Danny and Chi right now. I don't know what they're doing. I just my takeaway right now. At measure, like it seems like a lot of work. Um from the outside I would say yes. Um I think what's happened is auto auditorium, at the time it was built in was fantastic, very expensive. Was fantastic, very expensive. And what's happened is that they've a private meeting and decided to add Zoom onto the
