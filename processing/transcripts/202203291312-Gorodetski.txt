So uh what we um do here, we think uh M to be let's for simplicity consider just compact closed manifolds. Uh so it means that it's compact is our boundary and just think about a circle or a tolerance or a sphere and we consider the squeeze of CR diffeomorphisms of this given plane voltage. So those are CR diffeomorphisms MR would be in principle equal to zero. So let me use this a little bit non-specific notation for amendomorphisms of all manifolds. Or it can be anything up to infinity, and in fact you can even go further, you can consider real analytics of marketing. Sometimes we will Sometimes we will also consider morphisms that preserve some structure, for example area preserving or polypreserving the commorphic. So that's one object vector fields. So if you consider all the vector fields on M, a point in this keys are to be at least At least at least one, because uh if you have only continuous vector fields, then uh you don't have uniqueness of the solutions of differential equations if you don't have sufficient smoothness on the right-hand side. So let's restrict ourselves to this key. So the vector field on a manifold would define a flow of the corresponding smoothness. So here we are talking about the actions of C, and here we are talking about the actions of R. And I also want to introduce another object which is To introduce another object which is a little bit specific but kind of traditional, it's most dynamics. So, linear per cycles. So, here we are going to do the following. We are going to fix some dehymorphism of some um of some um meaningful M. So I will give a little bit simplified version. Uh there is no general version, but it's enough to give uh the idea. So It's enough to give once the idea. So, what I'm going to consider, I'm going to consider a map from our phase space to the space of, say, some matrix space, so for example SL and R matrices. And our map is going to be the map of M cross along Rn to itself, defined in the following group. The following grade. So you have a point in the grease and you have a vector in Rn, and the image is going to be the following. You start with some fixed diamond, or maybe it's just continuous map of a piece. And you have maps like to V on the fiber. So it looks very special. So it looks very specific and necessarily restrictive, but there are some reasons for that. So usually what people do, they fix the wage dynamics, and then the space of most cycles is the space of the maps that you consider here. The smoothness of a core cycle is the smoothness of this map. And the reason for that is twofold. First of all, it's usually easier to consider this object than the HMO students themselves, because roughly speaking, themselves because roughly speaking what you do you split the dynamics in the tension space and dynamics in the base so there is no relation anymore and usually it's easier to obtain some results in this context and secondly there are some specific models where those post cycles appear in a material way for example sharing the cos cycles in this case you will get SL4 for example cos cycles and the properties of those cos cycles then you relate to specific properties of someone Properties of some models in spectral series. Okay, so those are the spaces. As soon as you have a space, you certainly want a topology. How do you define a topology? There are infinitely many topologies that you can define at the same time on the same space. So instead of carefully going step by step with all those definitions and choices, I will just define And choices, I will try to define the topology in one dimensional keys, and then I will say that the rest is to the reader. So let's consider the space of C power maps from interval 0, 1 to sadial numbers. And I want to introduce topologies on the space. So certainly CMOT topology is defined by the metric, which is just about By the metric, which is just a maximum of the distance between the images. C1 topology, if you have smooth map, you can differentiate. So what you do, you get C0 distance, and then you get C0 distance between the derivatives. We take the derivatives and then you take the maximum. That defines C1 topology and so on. C1 metric, and therefore C1 topology. If you want to define C par topology, you can just define it inductively. This is maximum C par minus 1 and then we'll take our derivatives here. So, you have countable mini topologies. If here you have infinitely differential maps, for example, in order to define C infinity topology, you just take the union of all those topologies. So, C infinity is a union. You can also meet it. We have seen already that if you have counter gloomy topologies on the same space, you can think about that in those types of terms. You still have a polar space. So, this is a polar space with respect to. So this is a Polish space with respect to some unit topology. Let me now talk about the analytic space which is a little bit. Okay, so we have lots of topologies. Each of them gives you the structure of the polar space. And now what we want to do, we want to classify those. But in order to classify something, you need to specify the equivalence relation with respect to which you want to classify. So So, equivalent. And once again, we will get countable many different equivalent scalations. The most important one, in some sense, is the topological controversy. So, let me define a topological contravassy first. So, F and G are Are topologically conjugate. If, by the way, just one step back, here we defined everything for this space. If you have a space of the homomorphisms of a compact manifold, you just use charts. So you can cover the compact manifold by finite number of charts. Then, for each chart, you can roughly speaking think about the map in the Euclidean space. For the maps in the Euclidean space, more or less the same formulas work. Then you can say Same formulas work, then you can say that the choice of those finite atlas is arbitrary, which is true. That will the metric that you will define will depend on the choice of those charts, but topology. So the art topology is something that is over. Okay. Now, what is the topological conjugacy? Two diffeomorphisms are topologically conjugate if there exists one morphism called phase space such that Phase case such that if you apply F and then H is the same as to apply H and then G. So, in other words, if you have diffomorphism F and diffomorphism G, there exists a continuous change of coordinates such that this diagram permits. Okay. But the question is why do we want to consider homeomorphism here? Of course we can consider diffeomorphism instead of homeomorphism. Instead of putting a morphism. And let's say that F is CR contributing to G here exists h which is, well let's say C sub S. In case I don't necessarily need S to be equal to R if F and 3 are from please. If there exists diffeomorphisms, there is a small change of There is a smooth change of coordinates such that it sets one at the end of the level. Now, it really looks unnatural, if you haven't seen it before, to consider this equivalence relation or that equivalence relation if S is not equal to R. Because if you consider this group, and this is a group, then you certainly want to consider the contravici classes. And you want the change of coordinates to have the same smoothness as the elements of the group. The elements of the group. But it turns out that this is, from the medical point of view, not very natural city. And let me explain. So first of all, I want to remind you that dynamical systems is a subject that people studied because of its relation to differential features. Essentially, Differential equations. Essentially, historically, first people studied differential equations, and they realized that we cannot solve them actually in many cases, and they started to develop so-called qualitative theory of differential equations, and eventually jumped into dynamical systems. So, what you want, you want to be able to say something about practical models. And give you an example: each dynamical systems from a practical point of view should be considered the same. Suppose that I have a map. Suppose that I have a map of a circle that has one attractor, one repeller, and all points goes from this attractor to that attractor, from this repeller to this attractor. And I have another one with the same properties. This is F and this is G. Completely clear that for all practical purposes, you want to think about those two dynamical systems as the same. All the Dynamical properties are the same. Nevertheless, if you Nevertheless, if you have conjugacy which is smooth, so you have this property and H is at this C1, for example, then this immediately implies that multiplier of F at the repeller and multiplier of G at the repeller should be the same. And the same for multipliers of F and G. The same for multipliers of f and three at the tracker. And this is something that we can certainly change by a small perturbation of the map. So you don't want those invariants if you want to consider the dynamics in any way. So that's the reason why people consider topological equivalence as a primary equivalence in the space of the dynamical systems. You have one equaling point here, say P sub F, and you have one. P sub F, and you have one repelling point here, say P sub G. So the claim is that if you have this property, then it implies that the derivative of F at P sub F must be equal to the derivative of G at P sub G. So, and this number must be non-variant. And you can make a small perturbation of the map. You certainly have the same dynamics, but you can. Same dynamics, but you cannot have smooth conjugation between smooth maps. So it may, but those two maps are definitely topologically conjugated. So that's why you want to consider topological conjugacy as a primary equivalence relation. But that actually motivates the following definition. The definition we have to have a diffeomorphism Mortism is structurally stable if there exists a neighborhood open set in the space of Dishellomorphisms such that there are the space, so we have a neighborhood of F, such that That should be C1 open, so it should be C1 open set in that space, such that for any g from u, g is topologically contributed to. So for example, if you have a diffomorphism of the circle like z, where um derivatives at this point and at that point are not equal to one, an absolute value, that this is an example of stringent state multi-function. Great. So you have a space of all dynamical systems and the map F is structurally stable. If dynamics cannot be changed, if you make a small perpetration of that map, actually, small, even a little bit misleading, because this set is even bigger than just a neighborhood in that space. So, we want to consider all C1 perturbations. So, if instead of topological conjugacy we use the smooth conjuracy here, then that would be a definition of an empty set. Now we defined everything and the question is, can you classify dynamical systems that we have more zombies or file manifold with respect to the File manifold with respect to this equivalence relation. And now I have to switch from the audience in descriptive set theory to the audience in dynamics, because in dynamics people used to give classification, not to prove that classification does not exist. What does it mean that we do not have classification? Or better to say, what is a formal definition of capitalization? Definition of have classification. Because if you present classification, it's completely clear that it's a classification. You are happy with that, but if you want to prove that it's nothing for all definitions. So there are many definitions as we have shown already. So let's say that Here's a question. Is it possible to classify the space of diffeomorphisms using complete invariance? So can you find a Perl function from the space of different morphisms of a given manifold to some Polish space, let's say R, just we don't know what it is that it doesn't matter. All of them are the same. Snatch Z That two maps will be mapped to the same, you'll be assigned the same invariant if and only if those two maps are logically available. So let's let's give some examples. For example, let's consider all the real analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle. So consider all the real analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle. And I want to answer this question positively for this space. Claim that such function does exist, and what I'm going to do, I'm going to Uh and what I'm going to do, I'm going to present numerical invariance not as a number, but as a collection of some um some um quantitative data. And that's sufficient. So if first of all, we need the so-called rotation number. Uh let me not define it formally. I will just say that the rotation number of a metamorphism of a circle is just an average rotation of a point. So if you have a rotation of a circle, that rotation number is just the average rotation. Circle, that rotation number is just the angle of rotation. But if you have a diffomorphism, then you can think about it as about a little bit deformed rotation. You can pick a point and think about it as a rotation, and you can see on average what is average rotation number that we want. It turns out that this is a well-defined quantity, and this is some number that is associated to the differ mortgage. So if rotation numbers of f Of F and G are not the same. I need also to put minus just to be precise. Then f is not topologically equivalent to G. If the rotation number of F is equal to the rotation number of G and is not and is irrational, And is irrational, then f is topologically equivalent to g. If the rotation number of f is equal to the rotation number of g and is rational, then what I um then what I need to do, I need to calculate the number of periodic orbits. All the periodic orbits are going to have the same periods. There is quite you will find only finitely many of them because we consider Only finitely many of them because we consider real analytic dehomorphisms and therefore every periodic orbit must be isolated. And if you count the number of periodic orbits, then what you have, you have a splitting of a circle into finite number of intervals. For each interval, you can assign either plus or minus, and that was explained in one of the previous talks already. You just consider the functional view, trying to see whether the phase pointing homeomorphism. See whether the corresponding homeomorphisms for the corresponding power of the map is going to be increasing more difficultly. And if this configuration for F and this configuration for T are isomorphic, then those are topologically contradictive, not then. So consider, let me call it decorated splitting of the circle by the wood orbit. And then those two are conjugate if and only if, topologically conjugate if and only if the case pointing decorated splitting as the same. So we have a very nice classification here. Another example, let's restrict ourselves to the space of structural stable decampars. No by definition that the structurally stable maps form an open set, because if you have structurally stable maps, then the whole neighborhood is going to consist of structurally stable maps. So let S is this piece of homogenes as a set, all set of structural and stable ones. I claim that this is perfectly classifiable just because if you consider all the connected components, you have at most comfortably many different connected components of an open set. And inside of each connected component, any two diffeomorphisms must be topologically conjugate. And you ju just count them and that's that's a perfect classification. And that's a perfect classification. And that's it. So, how far can we extend a positive answer to this question? Turns out that the general feeling is that, well, essentially, what I said is it. So, as soon as you go into something more interesting, you lose that opportunity. But before I try to formulate Before I try to formulate and prove the explicit statements, let me try to explain what people from dynamics were trying to do evolving. So instead of providing classifications, they were providing more and more complicated behaviors, dynamical behaviors, that corresponded to the complement of the set. And then they would wonder: well, finally, we will get a limit. So, probably not a limit. A limit. Probably not. Okay, so we know that we don't care about structurally stable diffeomorphisms. Let's consider those that are not structurally stable. How can it happen that a diffeomorphism is not structurally stable? First of all, it can happen that you have a fixed point or a periodic point which is not hyperbolic. So let me give a formal definition. So a periodic Point P of I become one so we have let's say of your T is hyperbolic if in case you consider the case iterate of F, it sends P to P. It sends P to P, so you can consider the differential of this map at the point P, that will send a tension space to M at the point P to itself, and therefore it makes sense to talk about eigenvalues of this linear operator. If this linear operator has no eigenvalues of absolute value one, So no eigenvalues on the unit circle. There's a claim that I will not prove, but intuitively it's very plausible. If you have a structural stable deteamorphism, then all the wordic orbits are necessarily equal. If let me keep the status structuralist tables, then Structural stables, then all periodic points of F are hyperbolic. Indeed, if you don't have hyperbolicity, then you have an eigenvalue on the unit circle. So by small perturbation, you can send it inside of the unit circle, and then you will have a larger dimension of that trapped instead than if you sent it outside of the unit circle. Outside of the unit circle. So, roughly speaking, by a small perturbation, you can completely change the dynamics near the VO recording. This is a hand-waving argument, but roughly speaking, that's what we're doing. Okay, anymore. This is not a very few jurisdiction because there exists a dense delta subset in the space of diffeomorphisms such that those diffeomorphisms from the delta Zolidiamorphins from the delta algebra delta subset have this property. The eye conductors there don't necessarily span the template space. Well, um eye conduct um you don't even have uh to have any Even have to have any real like inventors. So no, the definition just requires you not to have any eigenvalues, complex eigenvalues on the unit circle in the complex space. So for example, if you have eigenvalue i, and then it means that roughly speaking you have a rotation, and rotation you can change it. In rotation, you can change it in such a way that it becomes stable or it becomes unstable. And so you change the dynamics. You're not going to span the whole tangent space, though, this is true. But even if you span the whole tangent space, let me give a simple example. Consider x equals 2x plus square. In this case, the point 0 is a fixed point, is eigenvalue 1, and that 1 is And that one is what? That one is not an attractor. And if you have x plus 2, x minus x 2, then this one is going to be an attractor. So those, the fixed point 1, fixed point 0 here, fixed point 0 here, both are fixed points, but in neighborhood of 0, this map and this map and in a neighborhood of neighborhood of 0, I'm not. I'm not a topological conjugate because the structures are quite a different. Right, so I mentioned that there is a density delta subset of the space of the combustion such that all of them have this property. All the people orbit the hyperbolic. And this is not very hard to see if you are satisfied with convalescent arguments because just due to simple transversality arguments, you can see that. Transversality arguments, you can see that if you consider only fixed points, then you can turn all fixed points into the points that affect your bullet. Okay. If you agree with that, then let's consider the second iterate and consider all the piodic orbits of period 2. That gives you open dense subsets of hymorphians where all the piodic orbits of period 2 are hyperbolic, and so on. Then you take the intersection of all of them, you have the density delta homorphins where all the piquants are. Okay. What would be other restrictions for diffeomorphism to be non-structuralistic open? What's one of them, I speak of? It's a transverse already. Transverse area. I didn't give the formal proof. What I said is that if you consider the space of diffeomorphisms where all the fixed points are hyperbolic, then it's an open and dense subset. Open and dense in space of diffeomorphisms. And so absolutely stable? But what's the relationship? If you have any fixed point which is not hyperbolic, then it's not hyperbolic. Not hyperbolic, then it's not structuralistic. So what I said is that this restriction does not work for open and dex sets. Let's consider periodic orbits of period 2. That restriction also doesn't tell you much about another open and dex sets. At the intersection of all of them, you have a density delta set, where this restriction doesn't help you much. There is a huge set at this point where you could potentially have structural stability. You don't, but could. Is it possible to leave any one structurally stable? Because I basically. This one is structurally stable, structurally stable on a circle. The cat maps. Circle. The cat map that was defined by Federica is structurally stable on Taurus. The Yanosov map is structurally stable. Horshu, Smells Horseshoe, if you include it properly as a diffeomorphism of the sphere, gives you a structurally stable diffeomorphism of the sphere. So they can have very complicated structures. They have can have infinitely magnetic origin orbits. They can they uh th there there could be the restriction uh to the set of non-wandering points that could be conjugated. Points that could be contradicated or could be a factor of some topological Markov chain. So there are some really non-trivial examples. Nevertheless, since we care about classification, those can be classified at least in the same way. And therefore now I'm trying to talk about the dark real, those that are not structural. So, there is another restriction. Well, there are many other restrictions, but there is another one that I want to explain. And in order to explain that, I need to take a step, not backward, but side, and to formulate and prove the following results. This is so-called Lamar-Peron's theorem. It claims the following. Suppose that you have a fixed point. I don't formalize it for fixed point for a periodic point. Everything is the same for the phase 20 iterator or not. So suppose that P is a fixed point of the terminal fixed f uh I need it to be at least C once because it is not works. So, suppose that we have a fixed point that is vectorable. Then the following holds. If you consider local stable manifold of this point, I will explain in a moment, I don't write the formula, I will draw the picture there. So this is a set of points, null manifold, actually in some neighborhood of E. In some neighborhood of P such that n of x remains, is this inside of this neighborhood for all iterates where, so if this is point P and there exists such a small neighborhood such that if you define the set, you will get a small sub-manifold as well as Sub-manifold as well as if we define the local unstable manifold. And those are um CR small manifolds. So think about just a linear map that has on a plane that has one eigenvalue which is smaller than one and another eigenvalue which is larger than one. Then you have stable direction and you have unstable direction. Then add higher order terms. Then you would expect that the picture locally wouldn't change much. After all, you just added some higher order terms. The formal proof actually pretty much Terms. A formal proof actually is pretty complicated. So I recently gave that formal proof in my topic course for students, and it took me one and a half lecture to go through all the details. This is so-called Krobben-Hartmann theorem. But nevertheless, intuitively, it's completely plausible that nothing changes. And this theorem claims that there is an analog of those stable and unstable directions locally. So this is in our case local. So this is in our case local stable manifold and this is local unstable manifold. And those are going to be smooth manifolds of the same class of smooth positions. Now I did require the points to converge to the point P, but that will happen automatically as well. Okay. Now, locally everything is great, but globally, notice that if I take the image of the unstable manifold or pre-image of the stable manifold, then those are still going to be points that converge to our fixed point in the negative or positive time correspondingly. So, what you can do, you can take the stable manifold, this unstable manifold, and you can start explaining. Manifold, and you can start extending it by negative or positive iterates. So I forgot what the numbers should be here, but it doesn't matter. So what I'm going to talk about is so-called homogene picture. So what can happen is that those two manifolds will get a point of intersection. There is nothing that would prohibit that from happening. So you could get a So you could get so-called homoclinic points, the points that converge to our point P both in negative and in positive time. Notice that our invariant manifolds are indeed invariant. So if you have one point where you have point of intersection of stable, unstable manifold, then its image is necessarily also point of intersection of stable, unstable manifold. And the second image as well, and the third image. And the third image, and so on. But the same if you are going back in time, you can only imagine how complicated this picture is going to be because those tanks can also be extended, and so on and so forth. Pretty ugly or pretty beautiful, whatever. When Pancaria realized what's going on, Realized what's going on, he wrote that there is absolutely nothing that would be more complicated than this picture, and that picture actually gave reason for the absence of integrability for the scripting problem. Okay, so you have this homoclinic picture. Existence of the homoclinic picture by itself does not prevent structural stability. For example, if you think about the cat map, about the Panosen map that was defined, so Federica defines. So, Federica defines stable and unstable manifolds of the fixed point. If you think about those manifolds and how they are located on the torus, they will intersect at some point. And then we'll get exactly this picture. So, I have a picture on a plane, so on a torus, they will go around the torus, but still, that picture is there, you still have structural stability. But what can happen Nothing precludes, nothing prohibits the following picture. You can have this fixed point, you can have stable and unstable manifolds. Those manifolds can have points of touches. And this is a point of homoclinic tensency. And if you have a point of homoclinic tensency, then it's easy to believe that. Tangency, then it's easy to believe that your map is not going to be structurally stable. Indeed, by a small perturbation of the dynamics, we can either get rid of this tendency or we can lead a monoclinic intersection. And that should change the dynamics completely. And that's exactly what's happening. So here's a claim. If F is structurally stable, then F has no homogeneous control system. I'm not learning that this is a fixed point of two-dimensional diffeomorphism. Suppose that we work on two-dimensional surface or even on the plate. You have a fixed point, which is a settlement with one eigenvalue inside of the unit circle and one eigenvalue outside of the unit circle. Therefore, the atomic period. Therefore, the Ademar-Pirot theorem claims that locally you have stable and unstable manifolds that are smooth pieces of those manifolds. Now let's extend those pieces by dynamics forward and backward. There is no reason why those two curves cannot have point of tangency somewhere far away from the center. And if it happens, then you have stable and unstable rainfalls that form this picture. But by a small perturbation of a map somewhere here, for example, Somewhere here, for example, if you so when I extend the map, I apply my map forward when I extend the unstable manifold. And if I make a small perturbation of this map, then I will make some perturbation of the unstable manifold. And if I don't touch this part of the phase space, then this manifold will go down or it will go up. And therefore, I can destroy the thermoclinic tangency by Destroys that I'm acclining tangency by small perturbation. So it means that I change the dynamics by forming airby diffimorphies, which means that this diffimorphism can hardly be structural stable. And the formal claim is indeed that it cannot happen. Nevertheless, it turns out that in spite of the fact that you can kill the Hamoclinic. In spite of the fact that you can kill the homoclinic tangency for that specific saddle at this specific point, in this picture, what could happen is that you could have both homoclinic tangents and homoclinic intersections, and maybe when you heal one homoclinic tangent, maybe somewhere else you create another. This is more even more elementary. When you're drawing those lines, you have a C actually. So perpolating the C, actually. So here I have a piece of unstable manifold which is a smooth manifold by Zadimarkerov's theorem. Now what I want to do, I want to consider an image of this guy. The image is going to cover that piece, but it will That piece, but it will give you a little bit more. Then I can apply it again. So that will be a square applied to this small curve. It will give me a longer curve. And then applying that, I will get a nested sequence of curves. The union of all of them can be very complicated. It doesn't have to be a sub-manifold. It will be only a mirror sub-manifold. But I don't even care. But I don't even care about that infinity. I want to do this finite number of times, and the same for inverse dynamics for the local stable manifold. And after a finite number of applications of this procedure, it can happen that those two are still detention. Just one or two minutes. Okay, let me formulate the new Haus theorem and then it will be the end of the story for today. So it turns out that in spite of this picture, in spite of our intuition that this picture can be healed by small perturbations, the following is true. This is the so-called McCraus theorem that was proven in a series of papers in the 70s. 70s. There exists an open set U inside of the space of all ideomorphisms of two-dimensional surface, or meaning two-dimensional surface. And R here is at least two. There are some technical reasons why this is necessary. The side set fewer. First, there exists a dense subset, let's call it E, inside of U, such that any F from E has a homoclinic tangency for some periodic orbit. And there exists a residual density delta. Plus they are inside a few. Such is that for image G from this residual set, G has infinitely many attractingly weighted points. In particular, you have the whole open set of maps that are not structurally stable. So, if you think about the space of all diffeomorphisms, say C diffeomorphism of two-dimensional surface, then you have some space of structurally stable ones, but you also have some open set of in the complement. And let me give the very close definition: New House domain. New Hausdom will be defined in the following way. Let's take the space of all ethomorphisms that have homoclinic tangency. So Nef has Hamoclinic tangency. Let's take the closure and let's take the interior. So this open set is called in half domain. And essentially, Nicholas's theorem claims that Nicholas's domain is non-empty. That's what Paulus called a dark reel in the Sempshint. I guess next time we'll talk a little bit more. Any questions? Okay, can I ask a boundary? So again? M has a boundary. And that theorem is that okay, m has a boundary. Yes, so the reason is because the reason why it's happening is because you can have horseshoes with tangencies that are sufficiently slick in some sense. And therefore, you can do everything inside of a disk. So even if you have a boundary somewhere, it doesn't matter. Uh you can locate all the dynamical properties inside of some bounded data. So it's not it's not related to global topology. It's not related to global college. It's local. Semi-local. Oh, we need to do the transition. Oh, we need to do the transition.
