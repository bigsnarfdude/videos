Okay, so then let's start. So this talk is all about joint work with Mark Stefan and Ergun Jelsin, and it's about Steenrod closed parameter ideals in this cohomology ring. So let's start with the motivating question. Suppose we have a finite group, and now we would like to find a set of all n-tuples. The set of all n-tuples such that there is a free g-action on this product of spheres s to the n1 up to the s to the nk. But of course, as we already know, this is a really hard question. So for example, for the specific group G equals Z mod P to the M, the question whether you can find any tuples where K is less than M is actually the rank conjecture. So we see. So we see this question is too hard. So let's stick to an easier question by asking the same question now for one specific group, namely the group A4, the alternating group on four elements. There the question is, well, it's the same. What is the set of all these tuples such as a 3G action on this product of spheres? And this question is still too hard. Still too hard, but there has been some progress. Namely, there's a result by Bob Oliver. Namely, if you only look at the diagonal, so all the tuples where all entries are equal, then there is no free A4 action on such a product of spheres. And sketch of the proof? Well, if we had such an action, we could consider We could consider the classifying map which goes from X mod A4 to B A4 and then apply cohomology with coefficients in F2 to this map. And in this talk, whenever I write chromology, I always mean cohomology with F2 coefficients. So I just wrote it here once, but from now on, it will always be omitted. And then Bob Oliver showed that the Then Bob Oliver showed that the kernel of this map is generated as an ideal by k elements of degree n plus 1, where n is the dimension of the sphere. And it's clear that the quotient of the source divided out by this kernel is finite because it lies in the chromology. It lies in the homology of X mod A4. And if X is a finite complex, like a product of spheres, so is a quotient. So here we have something finite. Henrik? Yes? So this K is the number of spheres? Yes, that's probably a good thing to say. Yes, the number K should be exactly the number of spheres up here. And this idea is then automatic. This idea is then automatically closed under SteenRod operations. Because whenever you have a map on comology that is induced by a map of spaces, then it's compatible with the SteenRod operations. So especially the kernel of this map has to be closed under SteenRode operations. And then Bob Oliver showed that all SteenRod closed ideals, oops, I wrote ideals twice, that's typo, generated. typo generated by elements of the same degree are generated by only a single element v to the i and the final step in bob oliver's proof is then to show or to observe that the cohomology of ba4 where we divide out this ring is infinite for any positive i so this means here we classified all the ideals that have this property All the ideals that have this property and this property, and then show that none of them have the second property. And this means that there cannot be a 3A4 action on a product of equidimensional spheres. And we are basically following the same argumentation in this proof, except that many of the steps are slightly different. So let's first introduce all the players in this group. Let's first have a look at the group homology. So we know that the group homology of zmo2 squared is just a polynomial ring into elements of degree one. Then if you recall Alejandro's first lecture, where it was said that, well, There it was said that, well, if we look at the group homology of some group here, it can be written as a limit of the group homologies of the p silo subgroups. And in this case, the 2 silo subgroup is zmo 2 squared. And the limit condition, well, we look here exactly at those fixed points, where we have the C3 action on this polynomial ring. And this action is given by, well, the first generator is sent to the second one, and the second one. The second one, and the second one is sent to the sum of these two. And a concrete presentation for this fixed point set can also be written down. So SO ring is generated by three elements, u, v and w. And there's only one relation, this one. And the elements u, v and w can be concretely written down in terms of a and b, namely u, A and B, namely U is this element, D is this element, and W is this element. And if you want, you can easily verify that all of them are actually invariant under this C3 action here. So especially we see here U has degree 2 and V and W have degree 3. And one more thing, which is nice to observe. Which is nice to observe is that u and v generate a polynomial ring inside of this ring. So when I write down in the talk some polynomial in u and v, then it's mostly immediately clear that it is not the zero element. Okay, so now we have written down what the group homology of VI4 is, and especially this element V here is. This element V here is exactly the element V from the last slide. But then we also need the steamode operations. So in general, they are just given by well on this polynomial generators A and B, they are given by A goes to A squared and B goes to B squared. And v goes to b squared. And then, well, if we look at the ring homomorphism induced by this choice of targets, and especially this total steenod square is not really, so it's not homogeneous, right? It sends something in degree one to something in degree one plus something in degree two. So it mixes several degrees. It can be sometimes confusing. And if you take this definition and check what is the Steenwood square of U, then you can plug in the definition of U from the last slide, then easily verify that this is really the Steenwood square of U, V, and W. And now let's go closer to the title of the talk. So, I want to call an ideal ice. So I want to call an ideal I, ste naught closed. If you apply this ring homomorphism to this ideal, it should still be a subset of the ideal itself. And because SQ is ring homomorphism, it suffices to just check that the generators of an ideal lie in this ideal itself. So let's have a look at one example. If we, for example, look at the ideal generated by U and V, I claim this is T naught closed. So here we easily see the square of U is U plus V plus U squared. So it lies in this idea. The square of V is V plus UV plus V squared. So it also lies in this idea. But the ideal UV squared is not still not close. Is not st naught closed. And here you see where the problem is. If you look at the square of u, here you only have a v to the one and not v squared. So this thing up here is not in this ideal. And that's basically the goal of this project is to classify all stenode closed ideals. So you just pick some elements and check. Elements and check: well, is this ideal steam road closed or not? And you're only looking at the square operation, not the higher ones? So this is basically the... So there are higher cohomology operations, but we didn't look at them. But here, SQ is the total steenwatt square. So it's all of them in one expression. So formally, it looks like So formally it looks like SQ of X is always of the form SQ naught of X plus SQ1 of X, where SQ1 is the stuff in one degree higher plus SQ2 of X. And you can look at all of them at once. And that's what we are doing here. And the total steenoid square is really a convenient way to look at all of them at once. Uh, well, we still didn't know what the set of all n tuples of all k tuples is, so we further restricted to the set of all tuples of two elements. And we asked the same question. And this question was already asked by Blasczik. And here, well, this set is non-empty. So, if you recall Alejandro's second talk, there he Alejandro's second talk, there he provided a construction how to construct an action of A4 on a product of two spheres. So it's clear that there's at least one tokle in the set. And well, maybe we can provide better obstructions to say, well, if you ask yourself, does A4 act on S37 cross S42? Then it might be a complicated question. Question, but uh I think now we can answer this. We cannot answer this question in general, but we can just provide obstructions that tell you are this specific total of elements cannot be in the set. And so let's have a look at what we actually did. So first, we are the first step in Bob Oliver's result. Step in Bob Oliver's result: What's some algebraic condition on the kernel of this classifying map? And here we also have such an algebraic condition that comes from the SARS spectral sequence. Namely, if A4 would act freely on a product of two spheres, then the kernel of this map is generated by two elements in degrees n1 plus 1 and n2 plus 1. So it cannot be. So, it cannot be some huge complicated ideal. It has to be generated by two elements. And actually, in the proof of this proposition, we never really used that x is a product of two spheres. So you can weaken this to say, okay, let's say if A4 acts really on a finite CW complex X, such that the cohomology is just a four-dimensional F2 vector space. four-dimensional F2 vector space with bases one in degree zero, Rs in some degrees, and the fourth element should be exactly the product of R and S. So that's the weaker assumption than being a product of Swears. The product of Swiers clearly satisfies this condition, but for example RP3 also satisfies this. And well in this when Well, when you have this assumption, then still the same conclusion holds: that the kernel of this map is generated by only two elements in the same degrees. And because we know that the target here still has to be finite, the two elements must form a system of parameters, since otherwise the quotient would not be finite. Would not be finite. This means that these two elements are co-prime. So now we have basically mimicked the first step in Bob Oliver's proof. We have our algebraic statement about the kernel. And now we want to define what we're actually talking about. We call an ideal a steenward close parameter ideal. If it's steenward close and a parameter ideal. And a parameter ideal. Okay, that's not really surprising. So this ideal has to be generated by a system of parameters x and y in the homology of BA4. And these elements x and y have to be homogeneous. And now the question is that we really want to answer, can we classify all Steenwood close parameter ideals? What close parameter ideals in the comology of PA4? And the answer is yes, that's the question that we can actually answer. But well, it's a bit more complicated than one might hope for. So in Oliver's result, the statement was just there is no such ideal which is generated by elements of the same degree, such that the quotient is finite. Is finite and then is still not close. Here we have to get a more complicated answer because we know there are already actions of A4 on a product of two spheres. So there have to be some of these ideals. And the main application is, of course, well, if you have this classification of all these ideals, and if you now know that there is no ideal where the problem. There is no ideal where the parameters have the degrees n1 plus 1 and n2 plus 1, then there cannot be a free action of A4 on a product of these two spheres. So let's start with the first case. Basically, these ideals are quite complicated. We divided them up into certain families. So we said, well, let's first look at Uh, said, Well, let's first look at all the ideals that have the following property, then the next ones, and so on. And then we go through all these families and state now what the classification is. So, the first case is a twisted case. And there, we first have to recall that if x has degree n, then the part in degree n plus one of square x of square x is called square one of x okay now if you see this for the first time then it might be a nice exercise to show that square one is a derivation which means that if you apply it to a product then you get the Leibniz rule and especially since we are in characteristic two this means that square one of any That square one of any square vanishes. Because then here on the right, you just have twice the same thing. Also, since in characteristic two, the cohomology is actually strictly commutative and not graded commutative. And then our definition for the first type of these steenot closed parameters. Of these Steenrod closed parameter ideals is well, we call them twisted, if they are of the special form x and square one of x. So the second generator should be square one of the first generator. As an example, the ideal that we have already seen before, ideal generated by U and V, is twisted. And this ideal here is also twisted. So let's, for example, go back to this slide and check what is square one of u, v and w. So recall u has degree two and v has degree three. So in this sum, everything which is in degree n plus one, which is here three, is v. So here you can read off square one of u equals v. Here. V here v has degree 3, so we're looking for something in degree 4. This has degree 3, this has degree 5, and this has degree 6. So there is nothing in degree 4. So square 1 of v is 0, and square 1 of w is u squared. So we have now verified that That square one of u is exactly v, so this ideal is indeed tisted. And here you can also verify this. If you apply square one to the left generator, then you can use that as a derivation to get square one of the left generator is exactly the second generation. And so our first classification theorem. Classification theorem is the following. If you look at the twisted spinoid closed parameter ideals, you can fully classify them. They are always of the form xn and square one of xn. Okay, that's the definition. But the xn can be explicitly written down as follows. You start with x1 equals u, so the example from here, and then the next one. And then the next one can be computed using this recursive formula, qxn squared plus square one of xn squared. So especially this means that these ideals are quite rare. The first one has degrees 2 and 3, the next one has degrees 6 and 7, the next one has degrees 14 and 15, so only near a power of 2 you can find one of these ideals. That's the full classification of the twisted case, and that's already quite nice because they don't appear so often. So then the next case is the fibot case, where we impose the following condition. We call such an ideal fibart. If you can choose a system of parameters, If you can choose a system of parameters such that the ideal generated by one of them is also already steady closed. And as you recall by the result of Bob Oliver, this ideal here is generated by elements of the same degree. Just one element. So we know that this ideal here is actually the ideal V to the I. And And okay, here I have written x is equal to b to the k. And usually I tend to write the generator of the smaller degree on the left, but here one should maybe stress that x could also be the generator of larger degrees. Then we showed the following classification theorem. All fibered ideals are of the form V to the k. ideals are of the form v to the k, u to the l, where k is not larger than the highest power of 2 dividing l. And half of this theorem was already known. Namely, Meyer and Smith showed that an ideal of this form, b to the k u to the l, is d naught closed if and only if this condition on k and l holds. And the main work in our formulation of the theorem. In our formulation of the theorem, then is really to show that the second generator y can always be chosen as u to the l. So that's the classification of all ideals in the fibered case. And now sadly, that's not all, but there are also a couple of ideals missing. So let's Let's find a way to construct new Steenod closed parameter ideals from given Steenod closed parameter ideals. So the first exercise is to show that if you have a Steenward closed parameter ideal and you square both generators, you still get a Steenward closed parameter ideal. And the proof is quite simple. You use Is quite simple. You use that squaring as a ring homomorphism in characteristic two. So if you know, for example, that square of x can be written as a linear combination of x and y, then square of x squared can also be written as a linear combination of x squared and y squared. And actually if you want to have a look at a harder exercise, you can also show the contrast. Show the contrast. So, if you know that x square, y square is a Steenwood closed parameter ideal, so is x and y. This is more tricky because here you cannot assume that the coefficient of x square is actually a square. So you have to do something. And the second exercise is, well, suppose we know that you have one stenotech. You have one Steenod closed parameter ideal with parameters x and y, such that if you multiply one of the parameters with the power of v, and you still have a steenoid closed parameter ideal. Then all these ideals here are also Steenworld closed parameter ideals. All these v to the i xy, where i ranges from 1 to n. And now we can use these two. And now we can use these two exercises to show or to construct all the remaining Steenrod closed parameter ideals. Let me show you how to do this. So let's suppose xn is one of the generators of these twisted ideals. Recall, that means that xn and square one of xn is this denote closed parameter ideal. Then what we Then, what we can do is we can first square the generators of this ideal, and we still get a steenword closed parameter ideal here. And then I wrote it in a slightly more complicated way, namely I added a multiple of the first generator to the second one. So, of course, this is still the same ideal. And we also can look at this idea. Ideal. So here I just looked at the next twisted ideal in our list of twisted ideals. And here we can then plug in the definition of xn plus 1. This is exactly this recursion here. And if you compute what is square one of this expression, you just get v times xn squared. So now we are almost in the situation. We are almost in the situation of our second exercise. Here we have two steenrod closed ideals. Here we have no factor of v in front of it. Here we have a v to the one in front of it. Now applying the second exercise is a bit pointless because this means just that we can write here any exponent i between 0 and 1, but there are not that many integers between 0 and 1. Between 0 and 1. But it actually becomes useful if you take these two ideals and further raise them to some power of 2. So just keep squaring the generators of these two ideals. Then here you would end up with v to the 2 to the m or something like this. And then you can really use the second exercise. And then you see that all these ideals here. These ideals here are also Steenwood closed parameter ideals. And these ideals we call mixed. And now it's not really surprising what our main theorem is. It states that any steenword closed parameter ideal is fibered, twisted, or mixed. So that's all of them. So that's all of them. If you look at some dimension and there is no ideal in this list, then you know there is no action of A4 on the product of spheres one dimension lower. And if you look closer, then it happens by coincidence that for any given pair of natural numbers, there is at most one such C naught closed parameter ideal with generators in these dimensions. With generators in these dimensions. So let's have a look here at how the situation looks like. So here I have drawn a diagram where the x and the y-axis are the dimension of the generators. And I wrote a certain dot somewhere. If there is a steel closed parameter ideal, Parameter ideal: the shape of the dot tells us whether it is fibered, twisted, or mixed. And the x-coordinate is always the smaller degree of the two. So it makes no sense to say somehow if we look at u to the i and v to the k, then this i should be the x-coordinate and this k should be the y-coordinate because we have no way. coordinate because we have no way to say for any generic C node closed parameter ideal which is the generator that corresponds to I to U and which is the generator that corresponds to V. So that's why this diagram looks a bit weird. For example, if you look here, then this is just u to the 16 and v to the 1, u to the 16, v to the 2, and then here you keep multiplying with You keep multiplying with v until you reach here a point where the degree of v to the i is larger than the degree of u to the 32 and then sorry u to the 16 and then you would just go up straight but by this convention that the x-axis is really the degree of the smaller generator then there's this kink here and you go to the right. Right, and it looks a bit weird. So, how it looks like in general is here you have this diagram where you have all these fibered ideals. And whenever you have here a power of two and you go up as far as possible, then here it doesn't end, but it takes a turn, and then there is a path of mixed ideals that grows out from it, and it ends somehow in a twisted ideal at the end here. Ideal at the end here or there or there. And then I have chosen color to colour these dots, depending on whether we know that it is realized by a space, whether we don't know that it's realized by a space, or whether we know that it's not realizable by a space. So let me briefly talk about realizability. So, what are the known constructions for free F4 actions on products of spheres? More precisely, if you give me such a Steednode closed parameter ideal from this list, can you find a free action on a nice space such that the given ideal is the kernel of this map? And of course, this question is a bit vague because here I used to. Because here I use the word nice. So, nice could either mean it's a product of spheres or it satisfies this weaker condition that the homology ring is just four-dimensional and something in top degree is a product of the two other generators. Or it could be that it's this homotopy equivalent, a finite CW complex homotopy equivalent to a product of spheres, or something like Or something like this. So, depending on what nice means, maybe the answer might differ. So, the first theorem, this uses fixity methods. So, the constructions from Alejandro's second talk. There the statement is that any fibered ideal I, so recall any fibered ideal is of this form, can v to the k, u to the l. k u to the l here we still have the restriction k is less or equal to 8 so we don't know about higher exponents here can be realized by a free a4 action on the total space of a sphere bundle over a sphere and unless you pick these specific four ideals where you have the same exponent here which is the power of two so uv So u v u squared v squared u to the four v to the four and u to the eight v to the eight then the sphere bundle is actually trivial and so you get a free A4 action on a product of spheres and this was already known for k is less or equal to four and the main result here is just that we could also include the octonionic case. So this should So this shows this for k equals 8. And then there's a trick to go from 1k to a smaller k. And with this trick, you also get all the numbers between 4 and 8. Okay. So this shows that here all these little squares are white until you get to the Until you get to this line of V to the 8, which has degree 24. Yeah. And one should say that in the four excluded cases here, one cannot find an action on an honest product of spheres. The problem is basically. Is basically what came up already in other talks, namely that if you have that, if you take the first generator and you apply one of those teamwork squares to it and you get the second generator, then the same thing also holds on any space realizing this ideal. So then you would get that square. So for example, for the ideal UV. The ideal UV, you would get that square one of the generator in degree one is the generator in degree two, and this doesn't hold for the product S1 plus S2. And same argument then shows that this can't be done for these four ideals. So you cannot let them act on a honest product of spheres, but only on a sphere bundle over sphere. Okay, that's the first realizability result. And the second one states that, well, so the interesting question is, what happens if k is now larger than 8? So we have this theorem for every k, well, could be any number, there exists some number L0 that of course depends on k, such that for every Such that for every S, this ideal is realized by a free A4 action on a finite CW complex homotopy equivalent to a product of two spheres. This also used the Adam Smith methods from the second talk. And in our picture here, this means, so for example here, all these squares above the line 24, they are still gray. And then up here, maybe there's another tower. Here, maybe there's another tower of squares growing up, and then further to the right, there will be another one. And if you go further and further to the right, at some point, you will always find a white square. So, somewhere things can still be realized above this line. So, the conjecture, maybe it only goes up to this line and stops. This is wrong. That's what exactly is going on above this line, we don't really know. And now you see here in this picture, there is one square which is really really black. So this is not realizable. It cannot be realized by anything. Namely, there's a theorem of Namely, there's a theorem of Meyer and Smith, which states that if you look at this thing, so it's a homology ring of Bz mod two squared, and you divide out this ideal, u and v to some power of two, then this thing is a homology algebra of a topological space if and only if t is zero, one, two, or three. So, especially if 3. So especially if t is 4, we would get here u to the 16, v to the 16. Then this would not be realizable as a cohomology algebra of a topological space. And if we had such an action of A4 on X as before, then the cohomology of this quotient would be isomorphic to this thing. Uh, this thing. So, here, as before, maybe I should have written if we had a three core action realizing the ideal u to the 2e 2t v to the 2t. Then this conclusion holds. And this would be a contradiction to the results of Meyer and Smith. So here, you cannot find any topological space realizing this. Realizing this. And sadly, that's all that we know about realizability so far. So it would be great to actually answer for any dot in this diagram. Is there a topological space or is there no topological space realizing it? But that's not what we can, so we can't do this. And this would be the question: well. And this would be the question: well, what is exactly the set of all tuples N1, N2, such that A4 acts freely on SN1 cross SN2? Okay, so that basically finishes my talk, but I still have a couple of questions that are still open in the setting. That are still open in the setting. So, the first question is: what about the realizability of the fibered ideals v to the k u to the l, where k is at least 9? We don't know what's going on here. Then the next question is: well, why don't we try the same strategy also for other groups and climbs? For example, QDP seems to be a UDP seems to be a nice candidate where one should maybe try and see what's going on. And the next thing is, well, we have a lot of gray dots in this diagram, so where we don't know whether they can be realized or not. And the result of Meyer and Smith relies on the Hopf invariant one problem. Variant one problem, which has been solved by higher cohomology operations. So maybe it's possible to also use higher cohomology operations to show that some of these grey ideals cannot be realized. Then another interesting question is, well, what happens if we consider actions where we want to relax the condition? Want to relax the condition of being a free action to just that the con to the condition that the two silo subgroup acts freely on a product of spheres. So the C3 in A4 is allowed to have fixed points. And there the statement is basically our algebraic result from the very beginning. This one. This one only uses that the target here is finite. And here we could replace it by the homotopic quotient and this would still hold. So if we have such a non-free action where only the two silo subgroup acts freely, then we would still get here that the kernel of this map is the steamroad closed parameter ideal. And especially this means. This means that our obstructions are not only obstructions to free actions, but also to actions where C3 is allowed to have fixed points. Then maybe the main question is, well, we have all these non-fibered ideals, mixed ones and the twisted ones. Mixed ones and the twisted ones. Can one of them be realized by an action on a space? We don't know any example where this is possible or we don't know for any one of them that this is not possible. So this is still open. And if you look at this question up to now, these A4 spaces realizing the pivot ideals always were at the proper. Always were at the property that you could consider the projection to one of these factors. So you have an A4 action on one of the spheres, which is not free. And then you have the G equivariant map that projects to one of these factors. This would be impossible for these non-pivot ideals because basically what you would get from such a map is that one of the generators also has to generate a steam. Also, it has to generate a steam of closed parameter ideas, which means that it is φ of 1. So, if you could construct an action realizing this, then you would really have to mix both coordinates. So, it should somehow look like the action of QDP that Jesper talked about in the questions and answer session to one of the previous talks. But we still don't know. We still don't know whether this is possible or not. And so the first example, also the smallest example of such an ideal where we don't know whether there's really an honest action on a sphere is actually this one. So here we have some ideal with generators in degrees 11 and 12. And so the corresponding question would be is there a reaction? Be is there a free action of A4 on this product of Cs? And maybe there is, maybe there isn't. Okay, that basically finishes my talk. Thank you for your attention. Here is a list of references. I try to keep it short. So these are only the three main references. Only the three main references that we needed. Okay, thanks again. Thank you. So are there any questions from the online participants? Hello? Hello? Henrik, this is Ian. Thanks very much for your. Henrik, this is Ian. Thanks very much for your nice talk. Wondering just about whether your techniques and odd primes might give new information on another old question of this sort about actions on equidimensional spheres of p groups for odd primes p. So Osbun and I studied this question for rank two p groups acting on Sn cross Sn. Acting on Fn cross F n in certain dimensions, but there are still many open questions there. I don't know. So basically, so I mean, it would be nice to look at one specific example of a P group and start with the comology ring of this P group. So the whole proof relied a lot on the fact that we explicitly know what is the cohomology ring of BA4. What is the homology ring of BA4? And we don't really, I think, see a way to write it down in full generality for any p-group or for any two group. And maybe the first step would be to look at one specific p-group, which might be interesting. I guess the first case, which might possibly be interesting, would be the extra special p-group of order p cubed for p odd. And then. uh yes and then um so it's known that there are so we i was going to prove that you can have free actions on the product of s2p minus one across s2p minus one but we don't didn't know about acting on higher dimensional products of spheres yes so my first doubt would be this proposition really used its rank was two And so that we explicitly know how the spectral sequence looks like. And there is no way to, or no space, to have any higher differentials. So as soon as I think this condition is not satisfied, maybe this algebraic result about that the kernel is generated by some elements isn't there anymore. Maybe this would be a problem. Problem, thank you. I don't know how it might be for the extra spatial P group or the P cube, the rank is still two, right? So product of two spheres. I think the ideal being closer under C naught should still hold. Still hold, but you can choose different k invariants basically than the ones you use to construct your actions and try to see if there will be other actions with different k-invariants. Maybe that will be the way to classify complete possible different k-invariants. Does this answer the question? Any more questions for online participants? Well, the participants in the room. I had a question. I was just wondering. I had a question. I was just wondering, you mentioned some result where you could realize the action on something homotopy equivalent to your product of the spheres. But do you know in that case that you can't realize it on actual spheres or is it just this one? Yeah, yeah, that one. I think we don't know this, right? Okay. Thanks. These actions are constructed using homotopy theory, so we don't know if you can get a manifold in this case. Is there some kind of like surgery theoretic thing or something like that? That's like some, is there some way of like, is there some obstruction type? Is there some obstruction to being a manifold, or is it like you have to somehow think of a manifold action? I mean, I don't know. I'm not sure. Yeah, for different dimensional spheres, surgery techniques, as far as I know, doesn't work very easily. But Ian should know this. They use the surgery techniques for equidimensional spheres, but I don't think they work for. But I don't think they work for different dimension spheres as well. I mean, if you're going to go to manifolds, you need to think of a good candidate for the stable normal bundle. And that was, that can be a bit tricky. So that's, I don't, in principle, there's no reason why you couldn't try to apply surgery techniques for the different dimensional spheres product. I had a question. So, at some point, you used instead of Zmon2 cross Zmon2. Actually, I think to say that something wasn't realizable. This one. Yeah. So I guess, did you try other sorts of things of this form to show non-realizability? To show non-realizability in some of the other cases? So basically, no, we only have this specific theorem by Meyer and Smith for the specific idea. And I don't really know whether you can take the proof and replace this idea by some of the other ideals. But it might be a good idea, right? To look in detail. Look in detail in the proof and see whether it can be adopted to some of the other ideas where it's interesting. Yep. Any more questions? Okay, so let's stay on the speaker again. Okay, so have a coffee break or no coffee break. No, no coffee bridge. I mean not the full coffee bridge. Yeah, sorry. So they continue in like seven minutes? Yes.
