That can go down will go down. Somehow, screen sharing and other things are going wrong. So, let's see if this works. Yeah, it works. We see your screen. You can speak a little bit louder, I think that will be helpful, but otherwise we can see it well. Give me one moment. Something again went wrong. Is this better? Yeah, it's better, yes. Okay, excellent. And now let me try if this works. Can you still see something? Yes, we see it. Okay, excellent. So, I thanks very much for the organizers for inviting me. For inviting me. This is a work that is done largely by my student Vipi Nagarwal. And I'm going to call it postmodern turbulence because it's actually something that is not supposed to be turbulent. So postmodernism sometimes has to do with finding art in things that are normally not considered art. So here we are going to look at things that are not normally considered turbulence. Normally, we considered turbulence, and hopefully, we'll find some turbulence there. So, what are the things that you typically think are not turbulent? So, the best examples, I mean, standard examples are cases where Dennel's number is very, very small. For example, if you look at microfluidic flows or if you look at swimming microorganisms, for example, sperms. So, there are two consequences of this that are. So, there are two consequences of this that are known very well. One is that the flow is instantly determined by the boundary, and the second is there is no mixing. And the best way to show this is to actually ask G.I. Taylor to show it for you. And I shared my screen now for something else. So, I hope you can see this.   So, this you must have seen many times before. Let me just take the movie a little bit forward and show you something else. So, here he has introduced a ring into the flow, a solid object. And let's see what happens to the solid object. Oops, sorry, sorry. Just a little bit backward again. Right, so let's start there. Is this recorded, or are you playing it now? I'm playing it now. Oh, great. So that's what happens to a rigid ring, and now So So, this is the problem that I want to talk about. And I need to do some more gymnastics. And here we are back. So, you have seen the example of most no mixing. And you have also seen the next example. The clue to the last video that I showed you is to Showed you is to realize that the important role played by the elastic nonlinearities. There are no full-show nonlinearities here. There are only the elastic nonlinearities of the very flexible thread. So we are still with Euler, but instead of the Euler equation, we now need to look at Euler buckling. So we do the following numerical experiment. I try to simplify the model as I try to simplify the model as much as possible. There is a single thread initially, which is just along the y-axis, and then there is a linear shear instead of a Taylor Couette problem. This is a plain Couette problem. But the shear is periodic. It takes the thread away for time half capital T and brings it back in the other half. So there are many ways to numerically solve this problem. To numerically solve this problem, we use something called a bead spring model, where the thread is made by many beads and the beads interact with each other essentially by a solution of the Stokes equation. And for the solution of the Stokes equation, we just cut off the terms up to a certain order. And this is what in the literature often called the Rotne-Pragot tensor. So, most remarkably, you will see you don't expect much to happen when the thread is being pulled away. When the thread is being pulled away, while it is being pulled back, that's when you expect buckling to occur, and that's when you expect the non-linearities to play an important role. So let me now show you another example. So this is a real experiment, but in this experiment, there is a linear shear which doesn't change with time. So initially, the thread is introduced horizontally and there is a thread. Horizontally, and there is a linear shear. Depending on what various dimensionless parameters are, in this paper, they point out three different behavior of the thread. One is tumbling, as if it's just a rigid thread. And then when the thread becomes somewhat softer, then you get what they call C-buckling. And then for an even softer thread, you see a different phenomena which they call U-turn. Phenomena which they call U-turn. So, this black and this gray scale pictures are what are from the paper, this experimental paper, and this blue lines on white background are from our simulation. This is just to demonstrate how well our code can reproduce what is actually seen in simulations. Coming back, this is what we see. So, there is a whole lot of things to see in this slide. Whole lot of things to see in this slide. So, let me walk you through it. So, you see, the important thing in this simulation or in this whole problem is that there is one time period. So, you could say that I could look at the system at exactly capital T time differences. So, that would be like a stroboscopic sampling of the system. So, on the top, you see one case where initial One case where initially the thread is straight and at some point it has buckled into a shape and it stays in that shape forever. The second case you see where the thread gets buckled, but then in the next cycle, it gets buckled the other way. So if you look at any two consecutive pictures here, you see that they are actually mirror images of each other. So your simulate your So, these simulations have actually reached a two-period. The thread doesn't come back to its shape after one period, but after two of them. Making the thread even softer, you see much more complex behavior of the thread keeps appearing. For example, in this middle plot, which I call C, you see that the things are quite complex and they are quite complex in space and time. By space, here I mean think along the Here I mean think along the thread. So, in the case of D, you get into a somewhat different case. You can think that look, it looks almost that it returns to its original shape, but it doesn't. There are actually small changes. So, there is a wide variety of dynamical behaviors possible. And depending on that, we construct a dynamical phase diagram. You can imagine that this requires a lot of simulations done. Requires a lot of simulations done very carefully over a lot of time. And this is what VPN has done. And this is a collection of all those simulations put together. There are two important dimensionless parameters in the problem. One is a ratio of two time scale. So you see, the problem is when you have a background linear shear that sets one time scale, and there is another time scale over which this shear. Time scale over which this shear itself changes with time, another time period, and that's the other time scale. And the ratio of these two time scales is sigma. That's along the vertical axis. In the horizontal axis, what you have is a dimensionless parameter called mu bar, which is a non-dimensionalization essentially of the bending rigidity. So let me step back here and tell you a little bit how the dynamics of the thread is modeled. Dynamics of the thread is modeled. So, for the thread itself, we assume that it just has bending rigidity and it practically is unstretchable. So, there is a very large stretching rigidity. But we don't consider any torsional rigidity. And all the simulations are done in two dimensions. So, if you put the same simulations in a three-dimensional, the same results hold, but I am not going to go into that. Am not going to go into that. Let me now walk you through this one. When the mu bar is small, that's when the thread is mostly rigid. You get a straight phase. The thread remains straight at all time. Then there is this blue shaded part where the thread gets into a two-periodic state. You make the thread softer, it gets into what we call the complex phase. Within the complex phase, Within the complex phase, the whole behavior is spatio-temporally complex. Above the complex phase, there is the phase which is buckling, where the thread becomes buckled and stays buckled at all future times. And for very small, very soft threads, we get to the case of complex transients. So, this is the place where the thread shows quite complex behavior for very large time. Behavior for very large time, something like 60 periods or 70 periods, but eventually settles down to one shape. Quite a com it could be a complex shape, but that's it kind of once it settles down to that shape, the changes are not very large. So the claim that I am going to make eventually is that it's this complex phase which is the most interesting part, and it is this complex phase which I am going to call turbulent. To call turbulent to show you an example of this, here I am showing you two things. The first is: see, one of the ways to think about the thread is to think of curvature as a function of arc length. So over here on the left, I plot in one of the complex cases, curvature as a function of arc length at different times. You see how strongly fluctuating it is in both space and time. Space and time. This thin panel B actually shows the same thread overlapped on its position at different times. This C is another example just to show you how complicated things can be. Below is a different diagram. So while the thread is being pushed back and forth, we sit at one point in the flow and measure the Eulerian velocities at that point. Velocities at that point. Then you can make a phase diagram by plotting two components of Eulerian velocity against each other. The orange plot here is the case where you have the straight thread. So you see here it's a very clear example that of a very simple behavior. The blue points here show what happens in the complex case, which is exactly what we expect. What I have not plotted here is the What I have not plotted here is the two-period, where you could see how this orange plot breaks into a two-period and eventually breaks up into this quite complex behavior. So now that I have told you what it looks like and kind of what it feels like, let's next thing is to study it in somewhat more detail. And to do that, what we did is we thought about the whole problem. About the whole problem as much intrinsically as possible by thinking about curvature as a function of the arc length. So, when I look at that, sorry, is there a question or is there any problem? No, no, no, no, okay. I hear some backgrounds which okay, sorry, back to it. So, now you have the curve as a. So now you have the curvature as a function of arc length. And again, I suggest you look at it stroboscopically. So you look at it at the end of every period. Then you can think that this is a map. The curvature as a function of arc length is mapped to the next curvature after time capital T by a map which you can find out by integrating the differential equation that we are dealing with over a time from zero to capital T. From zero to capital T. So this map converts our non-autonomous system, which has an external time-dependent behavior from the strain, to an autonomous system. So that falls into how we understand maps, just that this is a large dimensional maps. And the question to ask is what are the fixed points and periodic orbits of this map? Now there are many standard tools to do this. The tools are built on essentially extensions of Newton's methods. Extensions of Newton's methods with various softwares called GMRES and so on. And I am not going to get into that. I am going to tell you what the solution looks like. So we look for fixed points and periodic orbits of this map. And over there, the first top line is just one line from our previous phase diagram. And let me remind you what those points are. The first two blue points are where our evolution code. Are where our evolution code found our thread to be a straight thread. The next two points are where the evolution code found a buckle thread, which showed a two-periodic behavior. And the next red points are the one where the evolution code showed a complex behavior. And the final purple point is where the evolution code showed complex transients. So now let's walk through what the Walk through what the map shows in exactly the same places. At the place where the evolution code gives me a straight solution, the map also gives me a straight solution. In the beginning, in the next point over here, where I have this point B with B1 and B2, there are actually two solutions: one buckle solution and one straight one. And the evolution. Straight one. And the evolution code turns to favor the straight one. In the next point, by looking for the solutions to the map, we get two solutions, one two period, which we call C1, and one four period. Going ahead along the same parameter line, there is a case where you have two two period solutions. And then those two two periods disappear and you end up with one two period solution. And once you lead to the complex plane, And once you lead to the complex place, you find that there are lots of different solutions. And you can imagine that in the phase space, all of these solutions can actually live very close to each other. So your evolution code can take you from one solution to another. This, I would say, is a characterization of the turbulence that we expect to see in this system. Okay, given that we talked about turbulence, what about mixing? Because Mixing because, as G.I. Teller told us, things should not get mixing at these scales. But any mixing that you see here will be not because of flow non-linearity, but because of the elastic non-linearities. To demonstrate that, what we do is in a plane just above the thread, we introduce a set of Lagrangian tracers. The tracers are colored by their initial position. They are blue when they are towards the center, and they are red every century. Towards the center, and they are red away from the center. After a certain number of going back and forth, let's say eight cycles, you see how the tracers have become mixed up. And if you wait for a long enough time, you see all the colors getting mixed up quite well. So this is a qualitative example of the mixing that is happening in the flow. And we next look at a quantitative example. To quantitatively look at mixing, we again Look at mixing. We again go to G.I. Taylor, but this time to a different paper, the famous G.I. Taylor papers of diffusion with continuous movement. So we essentially look at the position of this Lagrangian tracers after every snap, after every stroboscopic picture, and look at the displacement. And then we calculate the mean squared displacement. Calculate the mean squared displacement summed over all of them and plot that as a function of the number of going back and forth, the number of periods over here. As you see, the period here is basically a code for time. So if you see the mean squared displacement going as t to the power 1, you would think diffusion. What we see is that the mean squared displacement goes as a power which is much higher than t to the power 1 and lying slightly below t to the power 2. Slightly below t to the power 2. So maybe, just maybe, you would think that this problem may actually have levy behavior. So, if it indeed has levy behavior, then something else should also be true. Then, from one end of one time period to another, this displacement of the tracers, their probability distribution then should have a power law tail, and that power law tail. And that power law tail should be either minus two or higher. So here we calculate that power law tail and we found out that it indeed has a power law tail and the cumulative distribution has a power law tail of minus three. So the actual distribution has a power law tail of minus four. So these are not levy-like. But because of this large power law tail, this takes a very long time to go into a brownian-like behavior. Time to go into a Brownian-like behavior. And I believe that's the departure that you are seeing in the mean square displacement. Coming to the end of the story, I now try to summarize what I mean by turbulence. The curvature as a function of arc length here behaves as a random function in space-time. This is turbulence, not chaos, because the system is infinite-dimensional. Now, the question is: can you imagine analytics? The question is: Can you imagine analytical attacks on this problem? So, you see, there are two difficulties to the analytical attack. One is that the elastic non-linearities, and the second is that there is non-local interaction in the problem. Because we are solving Stokes equation, every element of the thread interacts with every other element through a viscous kernel. So, as a numerical, as a mathematical experiment, As a mathematical experiment, we change that viscous kernel to a completely local viscosity. So every point in the thread now just dissipates by its own. And we still get a same qualitative behavior as the phase diagram that I have shown you. We still get chaotic solutions. So this is a much more tractable analytical model. The next thing that you can do is to go to the intrinsic coordinate, and in the intrinsic coordinate, it is And in the intrinsic coordinate, it is known that the dynamics can be mapped into a non-linear Schrodinger equation in the absence of any external flow. And then it would actually be a completely one-dimensional problem. But now with the external flow, the problem remains two-dimensional. However, there is still possible to have some analytical understanding of this. Thanks very much for your time. The paper is in the archive. It's called Chaos. Paper is in the archive.
