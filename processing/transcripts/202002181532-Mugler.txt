Right, so I'm going to tell a little story today about a particular type of cancer cell that detects the direction of the surrounding flow by basically secreting and detecting its own molecule. And some of the physics behind that process, and some of the limits to how well it can do that, and then comparisons to experiments where this has been. Where this has been investigated. So, but I'll start with a little bit of perspective. So, this is a workshop on complex regulatory networks, right? So, I think one of the ways that we can understand the relationship between networks and behavior is sort of a lot of experiments are done in principle to gather a lot of data points, and based on correlations or causal interactions, a large network can be inferred. network can be inferred from those experiments and then you know that network can in principle be understood to lead to certain behaviors right and then you can look for those behaviors and sort of test them with new experiments and I might call this a sort of traditional approach to understanding how a network drives the phenotype and vice versa. An alternative approach is to think about more coarse-grained experiments where you sort of look at the behavior. Experiments where you sort of look at the behavior directly and introduce perturbations, and then you try to think about maybe a possible network or perhaps the minimal network that could drive that behavior. And then you can, in principle, use that putative network to make a prediction about a new behavior. And then go back to the experiments and test that prediction. And these are two complementary approaches. I think we've seen. I think we've seen, at least already, over the past day or two, examples of each, or maybe somewhere in between. I'm more partial to this approach, and I'll sort of show you examples of this approach for a couple of reasons. One is I'm from a physics background, so I'm very partial to simplicity, and if something gets too complicated, then I start to get uneasy. But also, what you end up with by looking for sort of End up with by looking at for sort of the minimal mechanism is a very low parameter model. And so often you can make predictions that don't depend on any free parameters. And then at least from my perspective, that gives me sort of a lot of confidence that at least you're able to say something quantitative about the system, even if you don't have the details right or know the identity of each of the details and so forth. And then the third reason, and that's going to be sort of a particular relevance today, is that when you are looking You are looking for sort of the minimal description of a system, you can often arguably butt up against what's optimal or what's sort of fundamentally the best you can do as long as you are clear about what your objective is. And so that's going to play a role today. So I'm just going to show you a few examples of projects in the group where I sort of apply this approach. Sort of apply this approach. I can talk about them in detail for anyone who's interested, and then I'll sort of specialize to the topic of the day. But this is an example with a collaborator at Purdue, for example, where we're looking at the motion of cancer cells that are attracted to growth factors. And we found this funny thing where the attraction to two growth factors in combination is worse than that to any one of them individually. So that was very weird. And so we sort of did a systematic analysis and looked for simple. Analysis and looked for simple networks that could lead to that behavior. And we found a good candidate, and we've actually been able to make predictions using that network that we're starting to validate or not with similar experiments. Another collaboration where this sort of approach plays a central role is with two experts on C. elegans who have basically shown that during the development of C. elegans, a particular cell has to Men of C. elegans, a particular cell has to move from one side of the larva to the other, and it stops at a very precise time, not at a very precise place. And the precision is such that they know it's controlled by the accumulation of a molecule, but the noise level in the number of that molecule is like 10 times lower than what you would expect if it were just constitutively produced. And so we're looking for, you know, what's the minimal sort of sort of regulatory interaction that can get the noise down to what's seen in the experiment? And then To what's seen in the experiment. And then, you know, there's some feedback there. We're asking, okay, well, what could these additional players be, et cetera? I've also been asking these questions when you have multiple cells doing a behavior and you have cell cell communication playing a large role. So this is work that began in my postdoc with Ilya, where we were looking at multicellular organoids that sort of collectively do a gradient detection. And there, you can sort of think about what's the minimal network. You can sort of think about what's the minimal network that's required in order to do essentially a subtraction between the amount detected on one side and the amount detected on the other side, and then convey that information across the multicellular chain. And sort of similar in scale but a different species, this is now sort of more recent collaboration with Garol Suell at UC San Diego, where he has this nice system where it's a bacterial biofilm that basically sends an electrical signal from the center to the edge. An electrical signal from the center to the edge, and that's an excitable wave propagation. So, we've taken the approach to just basically take the very simplest model of, in this universality class, of excitable wave propagation, and we've been able to go a long way in describing, you know, the speed of the propagation and the minimal fraction of cells necessary in order for it to make it to the edge and percolate through non-participating cells and so forth. So, okay, so I now want to sort of describe So, I now want to sort of describe how I'm going to apply this approach to these funny cells, and I'll tell you about these particular cancer cells and why they do this. But just to sort of give you a sense of what's coming, the basic mechanism is one that I call self-communication, right? So there's going to be a molecule that these cells secrete isotropically, because they don't presumably know the direction of the flow off the bat. And the flow influences the distribution of molecules around. Distribution of molecules around the cell, and then they have receptors to detect that same molecule, but they detect an anti-site isotropic distribution. And then, you know, presumably inside the cell, there's some network to compute the subtraction between one side and the other to then initiate the migration in that direction. But I'm sort of going to pay less attention to the internal computation and more to what the physics of this flow and diffusive process say about the statistics of detection. Say about the statistics of detection. And just to sort of get everybody on the same page conceptually, this is a lot like, you know, something that we often do, right? Like an athlete who wants to know the wind direction. But it's very faint wind, so you can't really tell immediately. So there's this sort of like nice notion where you throw up some grass and you see where it goes. And that's, you know, secretion of the grass. The grass flows and diffuses. Of course, this is like high Reynolds number and the flow dominates and so forth. Reynolds number and the flow dominates and so forth. And then they detect it with their eyes and they compute it with their brain, right? So that's sort of the idea that is not proposed by me, but is proposed to be happening for these cells, but that I want to investigate using. Meaning it's functional? Say it? Say it? Meaning it's functional, that cancer cells are using this for something? Yeah, so I'll tell you about the background, why it why it's useful for them to know where the flow is going. It's essentially uh lymphatic drainage and the drainage points them to the blood vessels when they when they metastasize. When they metastasize. Not the blood vessels, but the lymphatic vessel. Okay, so this is work from two grad students, Sean Fancher, who's now a postdoc with Delaney Catafori at Penn, Mike Fettizilli, who's a current grad student in the group, and then an undergrad, Nick Hilgert. And it's not published, but it's on the archive if you're interested in the details. So the outline is that, like I said, I'll tell you a bit about the cancer background, and then I'll tell you a little bit of the history. And then I'll tell you a little bit of the history of how people have viewed these types of molecular sensing problems in the past and how that influences my view. And then some of the theoretical results and then what they mean for the experiments and what we're thinking about currently. So metastasis is of course a very important stage of cancer. It's the most deadly stage of cancer and broadly speaking it's when the tumor starts, cells start going away from the tumor into the vessels of the Tumor into the vessels of the body, and then ending up in a secondary tumor somewhere else. So it occurs in several canonical stages. They need to sort of detect where the blood vessel or lymphatic vessels are. They go in, they circulate, and then they need to come out of the vessel somewhere else in the body and seed a secondary tumor. And I'm primarily going to be interested in the so-called interposation process, which is going from the Process which is going from the tumor to the vessel. And so there's multiple mechanisms by which they can tell where the vessel is. There are chemical cues. I think this one's better, yeah. There are chemical cues such as oxygen gradients or pH gradients that arise that are thought to guide the cells toward vessels. There are normal cells of the body that are sort of co-opted into. Of the body that are sort of co-opted into providing cues. There are structural cues from the extracellular matrix. And then there are more mechanical cues like stress deformation or fluid flow. And I'm going to focus on fluid flow for this example in particular. So the role of flow for this particular type of cancer cell, which was breast cancer in this case, but I'll show you that it occurs in more than one type of cancer cell. Than one type of cancer cell. It was really beautifully elucidated by this paper in 2007 by the group of Melody Schwartz, who's now at the University of Chicago. And they showed the following thing. So they were interested in lymphatic flow. So it was known that lymphatic drainage was thought to guide the movement of these metastatic cells into the vessels. And so they basically used a flow velocity that was similar to what was known. Flow velocity that was similar to what was known in the body. And they showed that if there was no flow, then these cells don't migrate. If they provide a slow flow, then they do migrate. And if they block a particular receptor on the surface of the cell, then that blocks the migration. And this is a receptor that was known to bind to molecules that these cells were also known to secrete. And so that led to a hypothesis on their part that, and was basically the premise of this paper. And was basically the premise of this paper that these cells are self-communicating and producing their own gradient via the flow. And they termed this mechanism autologous chematitasis. And so they sort of went in and checked in a little bit more detail, and they saw that indeed the ligand that binds to this receptor CCL21, they also checked CCL19, was indeed found to be present on the surface of these cells. And if you look at something. And if you look at something that is cognate to migration, like the actin polymerization, then you see that it is biased in the direction of the flow and leads to the migration in the flow direction. And like I said, so in this paper they showed that this was happening for two different breast cancer cell lines and for our melanoma cell line, and then more recently they showed that it also plays a role for glioma cells. So this seems to be not. Leoma cells. So this seems to be not necessarily specific to a particular type of cancer. So what was interesting to us was when we started playing with some of the numbers, right? So this was a beautiful paper first and foremost because it was very quantitative. And it showed, first of all, that the flow is slow. So what do I mean by slow? So that's often convenient to quantify using the Peclet number, which is a dimensionless number that gives you essentially the flow. Number that gives you essentially the strength of advection to diffusion. And so if you take the flow velocity, the characteristic size of the cell, and the known diffusion coefficient of these ligands in the extracellular matrix, then you get a number that's less than one. And it can be, this is sort of the maximal flow that they used. And it's thought to be bigger than the velocity of the flow in the body. And the max you get is about 0.1. Get is about 0.1. So that's what I mean by the flow is slow. So it's already impressive that they're doing this from that perspective. And just a warning: this is, I call this epsilon, not PE, because I like one-letter variables, but also it's going to become a perturbation parameter, okay, so prepare yourselves. The second thing we noticed, or was interested in, is that the secretion of the ligand happens at a low rate. I don't know why this is Happens at a low rate. I don't know why this is. Maybe it's costly or something, but also I'll have to convince you more physically that this is low. But about 5,000 molecules are secreted by each cell per hour. And cells migrate within a few hours. The entire duration of their experiment was 15 hours. So, and presumably, you know, within the first few hours, they're actually detecting what the direction is. So, you know, it sort of begged the question to us: is a couple thousand molecules or maybe 10,000 molecules in such a slow biasing field, is that enough from a statistical perspective, from a cell to know right from left? And this is the type of question that's been asked before, but not to my knowledge in this context, this with this particular mechanism. So is this a plausible mechanism is what we wanted to know. Do they feel any shear stress at that point? Sure stress at that scale? So I'll tell you at the end a completely separate sort of pressure detection mechanism that occurs at higher flow speeds. And so that's maybe sort of what I can say in answer to that question. Okay, so, right, let me tell you a little bit about the history of questions like these, starting, of course, with the Starting, of course, with the famous paper of Berg and Purcell, who started with a bit of a simpler question, and that is, what is the accuracy with which a cell can detect a uniform concentration in the environment? And of course, they did the canonical thing that a physicist would do, and they said, okay, they were thinking about bacteria, but they said, okay, it's a sphere. Also, we don't care at first about the fact that there are receptors on the surface. It's a permeable sphere. So anything is trying to... Permeable sphere. So anything it's trying to detect is just sort of diffusing in and out of the cell, and the cell has a magic way of counting how many molecules are in its volume. This is their starting point. So that number, on average, is the cell volume times the background concentration. But of course, there are fluctuations in the number, and diffusion is a Poisson process, so the variance should be the mean. And then, of course, they wisely realized that diffusion is a dynamic process, and so if Diffusion is a dynamic process, and so if the cell waits long enough, then the molecules it's counting are refreshed, and it can get a fresh independent count. And so the variance should be reduced by the number of independent counts, which is the total time it's willing to wait divided by the characteristic diffusion time for a molecule to leave the cell. And if you put these together in sort of a relative error, the standard deviation over the mean, then you get what's now known as the Bird Purcell limit, that this should go down with the waiting time. Should go down with the waiting time, the diffusion, the size of the cell, and the background concentration. And of course, they then proceeded in that paper to calculate it more rigorously. And you see the same sort of scaling, but you get maybe a pre-factor of order one. You get a correction for the fact that there are indeed receptors, and maybe they can be bound. If they're bound too often, then they can't detect other things. And that has led to a long legacy of people. led to a long legacy of people you know considering and reconsidering this question and considering similar questions and you know most recently in or sorry subsequently 2005 Bialik and Serajeshkar sort of redirect or rethought about this problem and pointed out that there can be additional noise of course due to the stochastic nature of binding and unbinding to the receptors themselves and then Peter Reinstruct themselves. And then Peter Rhine's group more recently sort of re-evaluated this and sort of used reaction diffusion theory to sort of get a more exact expression. But essentially the basic scaling must remain unchanged. There might be some additional noise, but the Berg and Purcell scaling sets the limit of what you can do. And then the other nice thing that Berg and Purcell did at the time is they actually applied it to the problem of the run and tumble. Problem of the run and tumble chemotaxis of bacteria, and they use their scaling to set a bound on the minimal time a bacterium actually has to run in a straight line in order to get a statistically good sense of whether it needs to change directions or not. And they found that that should be above about half a second, and their actual run times are about a second. So they argued that bacteria are actually pretty close to this bound, even though they didn't include anything about the internal machinery of bacteria. Right, so more recently, people have Right, so more recently people have also applied this sort of back-of-the-envelope intuition to the problem of sensing a gradient, not a uniform concentration but a gradient, just an externally established static gradient. And the intuition there goes like something like the following. So to detect a gradient, you have to sort of imagine a cell is detecting more on the right part of its body than the left part of its body. So you can ask, well, what are the statistics of those two molecule numbers? Statistics of those two molecule numbers and those two sort of half volumes. And the difference is, you know, scales like the volume of the cell times the difference in concentration, which of course scales with the gradient times the characteristic length scale. And if you just consider once again that the noise is Poissonian, so it goes like the mean over the number of refresh times, then you can get that ratio, which has the following scaling, or if you're clever. Has the following scaling, or if you're clever, you can rewrite it not as the relative error in the gradient itself, but of the error in the gradient divided by sort of the change in concentration across the cell. And once again, you get the Berger per cell limit, right? It's sort of hidden in there. And yes, again, more recently, people have used all sorts of fancy techniques to, and I'm not dissing fancy techniques, I'm about to show you one for my problem, but to sort of confirm that this is true, right? Confirmed that this is true, right? I mean, maybe you get some pre-factor differences, but no matter what the technique, you always sort of recover this limit. Okay, and right, and this limit, so sort of being able to sense a gradient without moving around to do it is sort of the canonical domain of our friend the amoeba. And this type of expression has been shown to describe very well the response of an amoeba to. The response of an amoeba to attracting gradients. All right, so the question is: can we do the same thing first of all for the flow sensing problem? And then can we do something maybe a little fancier? And then how does it compare to the actual cells? That's the rest of the talk. So flow sensing is also, you know, secretion, it diffuses, you sense it again. It's also a question of sensing more on the right than on the left. So I'm going to divide my Than on the left. So I'm going to divide my cell into two halves again, and I'm going to think of things in terms of rates: rates of molecules being produced and rates of molecules going away. So the cell is secreting the molecules itself, and so there's a secretion rate which I'm going to call nu, and that's happening on both sides of the cell, isotropically. The molecules can go away due to diffusion, so if I want to make a rate out of that, then I take the diffusion coefficient and divide by the length scale squared. By the length scale squared. And then they're also sort of biased to the right by the flow velocity. And so I make a rate by dividing by the length scale. And so molecules flow from the left half to the right half or from the right half away. And now if I just sort of treat this like a birth-death process, total birth rate over total death rate, I can get an estimate of the number of molecules in each half and get their difference, right? Get their difference, right? So their difference, this one just has the extra rate of molecules leaving from the left side. And so their difference can be written in terms of the Peclet number. And since I told you the Peclet number is small, we just do an expansion here. And we find that the difference in the molecule number should scale like the Peclet number times essentially the mean molecule number. So here, are you assuming that the flow within the The flow within the cell is the same as the flow outside? You should be very worried about that very thing, right? So. I'm just curious. Yeah, yeah. I'm right now assuming the cell is totally permeable to flow, and that is totally wrong. It's just a fictitious sound. It's just a long line. Yeah, wait till the next slide, right? So that would be the mean, and then once again, if I say that the noise is the mean, or the variance is the mean divided by the number of refresh times, because again, we sort of are. Refresh times, because again, we sort of are allowing diffusion to set the refresh time scale here. Then you package this all up and you get this ratio, and you find that the error should scale like the following. So it should go down with the Peclet number, makes sense, that the flow is faster, less error. And it should go down with the square root of essentially the total number of molecules secreted in the waiting time t, which also makes sense. You just have more signal. But this is David's point, right? But this is David's point, right? So it's very worrisome that I treated the cell as permeable because we know it's not. And it's even worse than that. So essentially, not only does the cell sort of form an impediment and affect the direction of the flow lines, but it slows the flow down because it's laminar flow. So the actual velocity of the flow right next to the cell is actually zero. And you have to, essentially, if you're a molecule, you have to get far away from the cell to even feel the flow. And so that's the key question. So that's the key question. Is this right? Or in other words, is this going to essentially just raise the error, give me a larger prefactor, or is there other physics in here that I'm missing? At this scale, when you talk about laminar flow, usually we talk about that in the continuum limit where we don't have to worry about the size of molecules potentially. Yeah, so I'm not worrying about. Potentially. Yeah, so I'm not worrying about water molecules. I am worrying about ligand molecules. Yeah, I hope that's clear. This was Ilya's point, I guess, which you threw out rather randomly, I think, which is that with flow, we coarse grain using the Navier-Stokes equation. And I'm about to do that, right? So, right, so let me tell you the theory we did. So, this is the Navier-Stokes equation where I've thrown out the inertial terms because it's low. I've thrown out the inertial terms because it's low-Reynolds number flow. Typically, it's just these two terms, but I've actually kept an additional term which is necessary when the flow itself is in a low permeability environment. In other words, it's not just water. There's a lot of gunk, which is essentially the extracellular matrix, in both the experiments and in your body. And when that gunk reduces the permeability, you can essentially You can essentially coarse grain over that gunk and capture it in this additional term, basically. And this has been measured, by the way, and the square root of the permeability over the size of the cell is very small. So this is sort of the low permeability limit. Stokes flow would be the infinite permeability limit. So we're on the other end. Yes. So is it legal to use Nadia Stokes here? I mean, especially if we're talking about Excel and Agrix and so on, it's important. We're talking about Excel and Magics and so on, of course. Uh would we need to look at non-Newtonian sort of um and things? Uh I haven't thought hard about this. Maybe we can talk about it after. I do know that um the people who have thought theoretically about this particular problem, including the theorists on the experimental paper, um, who have just looked at the mean. Who have just looked at the mean, not the noise, like I'm interested in. They've all used this. So this is, that's all I can say at the moment. I mean, I remember there were sort of a few papers. I don't know which ways that Project went, but I think it was Bolden Blozzart and Eric Reiker were sort of trying to model flows around cancerous cells. And so they were existing on usage of. Maybe it was inside cells. Maybe it was inside cells. I just figured it out. Yeah, I don't know. I'll try to find it. Yeah, yeah, let's talk after. Okay, luckily this has been solved even in the low permeability, well, arbitrary permeability limit, and you get something horrific and ugly. And it's going to be okay because of the perturbation that I'm planning to do. In other words, it doesn't matter that this is going to be okay. In other words, it doesn't matter that this is going to be all ugly and nonlinear because essentially what it ends up being is just an input into an otherwise linear equation for the diffusion and drift of the molecule I'm interested in. Yes. Yes. Is this a two-dimensional flow or a three-dimensional flow? Three-dimensional flow? Three-dimensional flow. Okay, so then you have some sort of you have the azimuthal symmetry. Right. Yes, so in the end, it's really only gonna be a problem with R and theta. Everything is symmetric in phi. Symmetric in V. Good. So at the mean level for this ligand, we have a diffusion with drift equation. We have, of course, isotropic secretion with rate beta. This is the rate per unit area, by the way. So multiply by the surface area, we get back to nu, just for those of you following along. And then I'm going to consider two canonical ways to actually detect the ligand. One is by absorbing it, and one is by binding and unbinding to it. And one is by binding and unbinding to receptors. Okay, so starting with absorption, you basically complement this diffusion with drift equation with the boundary condition at the surface, which says you have isotropic secretion and you have absorption at a rate alpha. And the way we solve this, we sort of take a page from some classic papers from fluid dynamics. So it turns out you can do a perturbation. So it turns out you can do a perturbation expansion, which we do, but you can't do just one. You have to do one near the cell, and you have to do a separate one far from the cell, and then you have matching conditions to get everything to work out. So that's essentially what I'm skipping over here. And what you get is a solution. This is sort of the near-the-cell solution. And I'm showing it up to first order in epsilon. So you have this isotropic part where the concentration goes down like 1 over r, and then you have something proportional to epsilon. And then you have something proportional to epsilon, and something really complicated that I'm not showing you here, but something that depends on the absorption rate and also a cosine of theta. And the cosine of theta is the part that's anisotropic. It's bigger in the sort of forward flow direction on that side of the cell than it is on the backward direction. And I've non-dimensionalized this absorption rate. This is what the Absorption rate. This is what the alpha tilde is here. Okay, so now given that I've sort of solved for the concentration near the cell, then what does the cell know about it? Well, it has absorptive flux, which is alpha times that concentration. And then I need to somehow specify that it is computing a subtraction of some sort. It's comparing. Sort. It's comparing one side to the other and taking the difference in the flux, for example. So I define this anisotropy quantity, which is simply this flux times a cosine to implement the subtraction. And then I normalize it by dividing by the same thing without the cosine. So this is sort of like an anisotropy order parameter. And that is the thing. Yes. Sorry, so this is implying that the cell is doing some weighted integration. WAVID AB INTENTERS THEY ARE THERE ABOUT THERE WAS THEIR ABOUT IN THEY AND THAN IT MAY BEAM A FAST A FAST MOVING INHITOR AS SORT OF GOING AROUND IN RESTONS, A SLOW MOVING ACTIVATES GOING ARONDAS IMPLEMENTING SOME CIRICERY THAT IS PERFORMING THE SOTTRATION. All of that would presumably add some extra Presumably, add some extra noise, some additive intrinsic noise term, and you know, I care about the limit. Right, so this is the measure I'm suggesting to use. And then the mean is straightforward. We plug this into here and we get this. And then for the variance, we sort of follow previous work that basically the number of molecules to actually get absorbed. Molecules to actually get absorbed is a Poissonian variable. And so you can use that to calculate the variance in this anisotropy measure. And it turns out to actually be, indeed, just go like 1 over n, where n is the total number of absorbed molecules. And so when you put this together, you see that the error goes like you have your 1 over epsilon root nu t that we expect. You have a slightly bigger prefactor than 1, 4. Pre-factor than 1, 4. But then you have a term that depends on the absorption rate, or more precisely, the dimensionless absorption rate. And this actually has a minimum. And it has a minimum due to the following trade-off. So if you absorb with too strong a rate, that's bad because you essentially are absorbing instantly or immediately after secreting, and you don't allow the molecule to go away and interact with the flow. And so essentially that kills your anisotropy, and that takes this anisotropy to zero if alpha is too big. If alpha is too small, then you don't absorb enough molecules and your noise is too big. Okay, and so small alpha causes the noise to blow up. And so there's an optimum at around 0.78 in these dimensionless units. And that gives you a minimum noise of about 17 over this epsilon vertical t. So there is sort of new physics. There is sort of new physics due to the presence of these laminar flow lines and how you negotiate that with absorption. And if you take the opposomum, it is actually a non-negligible pre-factor as the bottom line. So then, how does this compare to the case of binding and unbinding? How much time do I have? A couple minutes. A couple minutes. Okay. So I'll just give you the punchline. So basically, we can write an equation that now includes the Equation that now includes the concentration of bound receptors. And we have, we solve it using a different technique. We use Langevin noise and we take the power spectrum, et cetera. And essentially you get something very similar where you have an additional intrinsic noise due to the receptor binding, but if it's diffusion limited or if there are a lot of receptors, then you can ignore this. And binding and unbinding gives a similar expression, but with a seven instead of 17. Okay, so it's. Of 17. Okay, so it's less than half the noise, actually. It's not negligible, but okay. So we've sort of done our homework, and the question now is: how does this compare to the experiment? So if I take the less noisy expression, the binding and unbinding case, and I plot it using the experimentally known values of epsilon and nu, in fact the maximal of those values, then I sort of get the absolute lower bound. And I plot it as a function of time, and I know that. And I plot it as a function of time, and I know that cells move well within 15 hours. So you can see that it's not possible, physically possible, I claim, to get better than about a 30% error. And more likely the cells are sort of detecting in a couple hours, so maybe they're dealing with 50% or 70% error. And so what this said to us is that these cells are actually making do with sensitivity that's very close to this. With sensitivity that's very close to this fundamental physical limit. There's potentially an issue here, right? So when one cell starts moving, it drives the flow with it. Yes. Right? And so other cells will sense. Yeah, right. It could easily be like collective effects. So I'll take uh that's the last thing I want to say is about collective effects, because there's actually been more recent experiments showing interesting things there. So I'll get to that at the end. So, I'll get to that at the end. I'll also point out that we have this prediction that binding should be better than absorption. And one of the main ways to absorb is to endocytose your receptors. So we would predict that endocytosis should be rare, or more quantitatively, we can calculate the rate of endocytosis should be less than about 25 times per minute. And for these receptors and this ligand, this has been measured, and it's about one time per minute. So that seems to check out that. Per minute. So that seems to check out that binding and unbinding is the dominant way in which information is getting into the question. Andrew, so how can the scenario of the binding be better than a normal disruption? Well, you may be thinking of intuition from Anderson-Wingreen and how to detect a static gradient in which absorption counts all the molecules and that's good, whereas binding and unbinding oh sorry, absorption counts all the molecules once and that's good. Whereas binding and unbinding runs the risk of double counting and you Runs the risk of double counting and you get additional noise. At least that was my intuition for why one would be better. Here it's different because the source is not from some external thing. It's not an externally established gradient. It is supplied by the cell itself. So there's a penalty for absorbing too strongly. The molecule really has to have time to diffuse away where the flow is strong and come back. And that is not possible with... And that is not possible with perfect absorption. That's how we understand it currently. Okay, so, and then the last thing is, is what are we thinking about now? And that is indeed collective effects. So there was actually, four years later, there was this nice experiment from the group of Roger Cam at MIT. Same exact cells, same sort of setup, but now they varied the cell density. And so what they saw actually is if they were at low cell density, Actually, if they were at low cell density, which would be like the previous experiment, if they have no flow, then there's no sort of bias in the migration. If they turn on a flow, then there is a bias and the cells start to move in the direction of the flow. However, if they're at high cell density, then that doesn't happen. And so, and I'll explain the rest of this plot in a minute because it gets weirder, but the point is that what they are thinking and what we are thinking is that. Thinking and what we are thinking is that if you have cells that are too close together, all trying to do this flow sensing mechanism, then a cell will be sensing the molecules not only secreted by itself, but maybe secreted by a cell behind it or in front of it, or maybe just a uniform background. What I'm saying is, you know, if your cells are, that's why I was asking that slide, if your cells are given at 10% accurate rate or whatever, or a 90% error rate or something. or a 90% error rate, or something. As long as the cell can detect the flow at 1% better 51.49, right, when it's figuring out that there is flow or not, or which way the flow is. And it starts moving, it creates more flow and it's going to drives the other cells with it, right? And so you can actually make a collective mechanical decision rather than a collective sensing decision. Well, okay, so one thing I can say. Decision. Well, okay, so one thing I can say is that these migration speed of these cells is about 100 times less than the flow speed. So maybe that starts to take your worries down. And also, if a cell starts to move in the direction of the flow, I think it doesn't increase the flow. It might actually decrease the flow. But once again, the orders of magnitude are quite different. Yeah. Okay. So it makes sense. It makes sense to me at least that there's confusion that happens when a bunch of cells try to do this mechanism, which is really an autonomous mechanism, and they start to overlap. Then this weirder thing happens which this group sort of showed was more like a pressure sensing mechanism where if the flow gets even stronger, then they actually start to move backwards if they're at high cell density. And so the idea, if you actually just So, the idea: if you actually just block these receptors altogether, they still move backwards. And so, the idea presented by these people is that there's two flow-sensing mechanisms going on. One is chemical, and the other is pressure-sensitive, and they have different directions. So the chemistry wants you to go with the flow, and the the pressure wants you to go against the flow, and I don't know. As far as I know, that's where it stands, and I don't know the the rationale behind that. Behind that. Okay, so that's it. So I've argued to you that these particular types of cancer cells approach the physical limit of what's theoretically possible for the statistics of flow sensing by this mechanism. I've shown you that binding is better than absorption in terms of error reduction. And then a lot of people ask, you know, so what then, let's zoom out, what does this mean about metastasis? This means about metastasis? What have we learned about metastasis here? And what I can say to that is that, you know, the supposed closeness to this limit, sort of, I would argue that that shows that this is a weak point in the chain of events that need to happen for metastasis. In other words, if you want to target these receptors or if you have a way to slow down the flow, then that should be effective here because they're sort of just on the cusp of being. Just on the cusp of being able to do to use this mechanism for whatever reason. And once again, I don't know the reason. Why don't they just submit secrete ten times as many molecules so that they can do things faster with less error? Maybe the molecules are costly, I don't know. Okay. So, right, so these are the group members I want to acknowledge, and I'm happy to take more questions. Thank you. So cancer cells don't usually invent anything. They hijack an existing mechanism. Do you have any sense of what normal cells use this for? I don't know that. No. So from the paper I showed you, they actually also tested this in a non-cancerous cell line and they showed that it just didn't happen. So whatever normal So whatever normal cell line that was wasn't doing this. Sorry? The migration didn't happen, but the secretion? That's a good question. I need to check, actually. Yeah, I don't know. But they know. I just need to check. So, you know, I don't know I don't know if it's known even what mechanism is being hijacked here and and what it's used for in normal circumstances. And what it's used for in normal circumstances. I have two quick questions. But first, like a guess under the question was just what mechanism is being hijacked. So in general, epithelial cells don't migrate from one tissue to another. And so the common idea is that what's going on is something called the EMT, the epithelial to mesenchyme transition. So they become kind of like they from a pitilial cell they become like phyloglasts and then and then Become like fibroblasts, and then they might, and fibroglasts do mine. But now, so then I have two questions. One directly related to that. So in the cartic metastases, there's a lot of studies that show that it's not individual cancer cells or individual malignant cells that kind of drift away in the stream, but rather, first of all, it's something called collective migration, so they kind of form these chains. But even more, we're just talking about fibroblasts. So what literature shows is that they have So what literature shows is that they hijack fibroblasts in their surrounding and then they form these very neat chains and the fibroblast is the leading edge. So that kind of, so in that sense, these models are maybe oversimplified, even though that doesn't mean that they don't provide important information. But and in another kind of biological context to this, so let me just respond to that real quick. So I think that Respond to that real quick. So, I think that it's safe to say there were no fiberblood. Also, I know about these other mechanisms. In the experimentals, actually, there was no fiberblood. Exactly. But in the physical mechanism, of course. Right, so I would say these are experiments that are almost designed to isolate this particular physical mechanism. And that was what was guiding the theory as it stands. But because we are sort of looking toward collective effects, we have also thought about collective migration in the context of, you know. In the context of a bunch of agents sharing information and potentially acting like one big agent, which is sort of one of the putative modes of collective migration in metastatic immediately. So then I'll give one more similar question, but then another like physiological, as the cells migrate, especially if the lymph, the lymph tubes are often their diameter is close to the diameter of the cell itself. The cell is actually squeezing through. The cell is actually squeezed right through. And so, when you're talking about, even if there's no cell there, I'm assuming that the rate of flow will be slower at the periphery. But they often migrate, before they even get to that, they migrate through the extracellular matrix, which is like fecan diffusion in sand. So I think that. I I think that that the parameters that you're identifying may be very important. The hard question is to think, so basically you're designing an experimental system that kind of isolates a fundamental kind of behavior, and then the hard question is how does that fundamental behavior fit into the force? Yeah, I mean, you're absolutely right, and that's just as much a question. That's just as much a question for me, who's guided by these isolating experiments, as it is for the experimental group, perhaps. But yeah, so I think I'll just leave it at that. Okay, so one more question. I think it's great. So did you say that the secretion rate is treated as constant? Yes. Okay. And so do you think that that would have an effect if it was a non-like if it could be, if does someone could adjust the secretion rate based on the environment and maybe would that help it? the environment and maybe would that help it potentially to be a little bit more you know with poor statistics what it thought the direction was maybe it should secrete more in that direction than the other yeah um I don't know I imagine that might reduce error if that were coupled yeah but we haven't looked at that yet okay so let's thank and do again So our next speaker is Eric von Niendbegen from Fiod Central Basel. And he's going to tell us about how to infer gene regulatory landscapes from single-cell RNA. Um single cell RNA-seq data. And everything's working, so looks like Alright, so thanks very much to the organizers for asking me to come here, tell you a little bit about one of the topics that we've been working on in my lab, which is in Basel. All right, so looking at these beautiful pictures of Beautiful pictures of human cell types, it's easy to forget that all these phenotypes are made from the same underlying genotype by different gene expression patterns. And one of the questions that my lab is very interested in is to understand how the genome-wide regulatory networks read out the information in the DNA to control cell fate and identity. And so, questions that we're interested in. That we're interested in is: can you rigorously define what a cell type is? Is there even such a thing? How is the identity of a cell stabilized in the face of a large amount of noise that exists in these gene expression systems? And where is the key information encoded and what are all the things that do not matter? And so, when I moved into this field sort of late 1990s as a sort of As a sort of at the end of my PhD, I really thought, well, this was when the first microarrays came out, and so on. So now you can quantitatively measure the expression of every gene in any set of cells you want. You have the genome in your hands. So now it's just a matter of time and some clever people like me to look at that quantitative data and build some models. And then we're going to understand how these genome-wide regulatory networks work. Why the regulatory networks work. And over the last maybe seven years or so, I've gotten in a sort of a crisis of faith about these things. So some of you may have heard about this effect described in psychology research. This is called the Dunning-Kruger effect. And the Dunning-Kruger effect measures somebody's confidence in their ability to solve a particular problem as a function of how much they're going to. As a function of how much they've studied the problem. And so typically, when they start out having studied at all, they know they know nothing. So their confidence is low, but as soon as they start studying the problem, after a while, you start thinking that you know quite a bit, and your confidence is rising that you will be able to solve this problem. But then there comes a point where you start getting a sense of how enormous the spaces of things that you don't know, and then your confidence may start. Confidence may start rapidly dropping, and I'm still sort of in this free fall. So, I mean, at the moment, I really think it's really kind of ridiculous to think that we are going to be able to understand such things. And why do I think that? Well, one of the things is that we think we know how to measure a lot with these sort of multi-omics measurement technologies and so on, but there are orders of magnitudes of things going on inside. Of magnitude of things going on inside cells that we have no idea how to measure. We're nowhere near the ability to meaningfully model what's going on, in my opinion. Nowhere near. And on top of that, all these high-throughput measurements are full of artifacts and biases that are typically very poorly understood. It's not like in physics, right?
