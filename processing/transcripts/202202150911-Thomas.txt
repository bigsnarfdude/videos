And I'm going to show you a few different donors that were agreed to be sampled after their flu vaccine by blood and by multiple sampling of that lymph node across these different time points and then got re-vaccinated a year later and then got sampled again. So they got two flu vaccines like we do where you get it every year if you work in certain places. And none of the people in the study had been vaccinated in at least the last five years. So this was the first vaccine and they had no memory of a known diagnosed flu infection, but that is Diagnosed flu infection, but that is obviously very fuzzy. And the work in my lab is being done by Stefan Check. And so, just that we're all on the same page, the cell type that we're interested in that we think is really critical for driving productive antibody responses is the T follicular helium cell, which is the CD4 T cell that differentiates. We define it by these surface markers, chemokine receptors, so the CXCR5, specific transcription factor profiles, and they make surface. Profiles and they make certain cytokines like IL-21 and CXCL13, and then they're going to go into the lymph node and talk to B cells and help the B cells mature and make good antibodies. There are, just like everything in immunology, there are multiple flavors of these T focular helper cells, and the field's actually relatively junior in that regard and is still defining what they mean by this. But there's potentially a regulatory type here. Inventory type here. This is actually now already falling out of fashion after being introduced like two years ago, but definitely a spectrum of activity that I'll show you in lymph nodes. And another thing to remember is there's very good old literature now that this response is improved when both the CD4T cell and the B cell are looking at an epitope from the same protein. So if the CD4T cell is presenting an antigen from HA and flu, and the B cell antibody is recognized. And the B cell antibody is recognizing an epitope in HA and flu, that interaction is going to make a better terminal center defined by various parameters. So these are our sampling times again. So up to six months after the first vaccination, and then a year later, re-bleeding, resampling the lymph node, and then about six months, four to five months after the second vaccination. So these are all the CD4T cells. So what we did is we took all So, what we did is we took all the cells and we just ran them through TEDx. So, there was no sorting, there's no tetramers here, and this is where some of the techniques Aja showed you is going to become useful. And so, these are all the CD4T cells from the blood and the lymph node of all of our donors. So, you get all different kinds of different types of CD4T cells just clustered here. We have, I'm just showing you actually two donors here, or three donors of 4, 5, and 11. If we look at the broad T4 cells, If we look at the broad T cell phenotypes, again, this is L C D4s. We've got a bunch of naive CB4s, we've got a bunch of non-naive CB4s, and then this little sort of wart on the cluster here is what we would call the TFH cells that we defined by various markers that I can talk to you about. It's a mix of the study years, years one and two. It's a mix of tissues, though most of those TFH cells came from the lymph nodes and not the blood. And it's a mix of time points. Time points. So if we just take what Stefan did then is he just took all the cells that were in that TFH cluster and we did 5'10x, so we had the alpha-beta TCRs, and he took any cell anywhere in that map that had the same alpha beta TCR as a cell in the TFH cluster, so he could get some cells from the blood, and then reclustered. And so now we're looking at a little blob of just TFH cells and their related clonotypic friends from any tissue. From any tissue. So there were some nice things here. So, one thing, if we just count up the different numbers of TFH cells at each time point, it correlated very nicely with the number of germinals that are B cells that we had at those same time points, but not with the resting memory B cells. So this was a nice correlation between, we actually had cells, CD4 T cells that were, TFH cells that were talking to GCB cells by phenotype. Again, most of the cells here are from the lymph node and a little bit of cells from the blood. And a little bit of cells from the blood, and a range of different time points. So, I've colored this graph here with what we're calling TFH type. And there's three types that I'm going to tell you about. So, what we call a pre-memory type, a germinal center type, and then an IL-10 type. This is sort of our new name for that TFR type that I mentioned briefly at the beginning. And this is just a dot plot for the genaficinatos. The Gina Ficinatos among you as to how we define these. They're very nicely clustered in space. Again, we can talk about that offline if you're interested as to how we came up with these three. But they're really distinct in terms of their functional profile. So these pre-memory don't have a lot of the mature features of an active germinal center CD4 TFH cell. Whereas the GC cells are what we would call our classic cells. They've got TCF7, BCL6, TOX2. These are transcription factors. TOX2. These are transcription factors that really enforce this TFH phenotype that are going to help B cells. And then this IO-10 phenotype is really metabolically distinct. It's almost, if you can think of it on the CD8 side, it's almost like an exhausted T cell or almost even has some features of T regs as well. So there's a lot of PD1, LAG3, this huge metabolic cluster that indicates sort of resource depletion. Of resource depletion, it's no longer glycolytic. It's this sort of very late stage unhappy cell, I would say. Unhappy is maybe a strong word, but just elderly, maybe. And so just to prove to you that these are really distinct phases, this is just looking at Go terms. So these are enriched pathway analyses and the relative p-value of each of these pathways in each of these different cell types. And you can see they're largely non-overlapping, though, this IL-10. Overlapping, though this aisle-10 compartment does have some features of a few of the other ones, but there's this strong maturation from the very earliest differentiation state to these later stage differentiation states. And so if we, if we just, again, we're nothing antigen-specific yet, just looking over time, it sort of fits that idea of differentiation. So you start out with many more of these pre-cells, you see the emergence of. You see the emergence of the GC cells. This is all in year one. And then at the later stages, you see the emergence of those IL-10 cells. They never get very high, but they do come up as a significant component of the overall mix in the node. And then in year two, you can already see even not looking at antigen specifically, the kinetics are very, very different. So you almost immediately lose that pre-phenotype. You rapidly transition into this GC phenotype. Remember, these people had not been. Phenotype. Remember, these people had not been vaccinated for quite some time. And you actually, it's tough to see here on the scale, but you actually get this emergence of the IL-10 phenotype much, much quicker. What are the data that expected? Oh, that's a very good point. These are the different time points, but this is something Stephen needs to fix. They're just categorical. They're not actually laid out. So this is 0, 5, 12, 29, 60, 90, 180. So they're not spaced. under native so they're they're not spaced to scale um so on the right are these pseudo time plots which uses the gene expression to infer differentiation trajectories and you don't tell the algorithm really anything about where you're starting or where you're ending and it tries to guess where you're going and so what we've done is color so it's made the plot it's put the cells in some relationship to each other based on gene expression and then we've overlaid what we call Gene expression, and then we've overlay what we call them. And so we would suggest that everything's starting out over here at the pre-memory time point, and then differentiating up, and there's bifurcations into a more GC type, and then GC in the IL-10 TFH type. And if you overlay the years on it, I thought this was really cool, which is what I want to show it: is all the year ones start over here, and then you have the year two starting over here. And so you can kind of see the memory response starting over here, and they both end up over here, which is where most of the And they both end up over here, which is where most of the IL-10 TFH responses are. I joke in the lab that anytime you see a pseudo-time plot, there's always a bifurcation in every one of us. So that's the point of a pseudo-time plot. So we've fulfilled that obligation here. What was the time plan might be for 180? 120. Paul. Sorry. The time plan might be for 120? I think. Oh, on the top one, it's 90. 90. Yeah. Three months. Three months. So, this is already actually, we've been with this data for a while. This is already shocking because this is a terrible vaccine, right? We don't normally think of this vaccine doing much. And six months after this flu vaccine, there's still disturbances in the lymph node that would potentially be antigen-specific responses, which I'm going to show you are antigen-specific responses on the next slide here. So, before we go in there, in the previous plot, year one and year two, so the quality In Year 2. So, the clones in Year 2, do they have anything to do with the Year 1 clones? So, this is all non-clonal. I'm about to show you, this is all just bulk TFH phenotype count sets. So, then the question is, can we add specificity? And does that tell us anything? Sorry, for one question. How variable it is across donors? Because the 90 days that are still really high, that's really so. So, we actually have 12 donors. So, we actually have 12 donors. We just don't have tax on all 12 donors. But on the 12 donors, the phenotype responses are actually quite consistent. There is a fair bit of variability among donors, but it's in sort of more functional kind of phenotypes. And these core phenotypes are all always there, but then some people have more of an interferon response than others. So, there's sort of features like that. Okay, so as Anja just showed you, you can use the TCR to try to work backwards. To try to work backwards towards the epitope. And we saw this yesterday also and had this really nice talk. And so, what we've done here is say, let's try to get at the antigen-specific response by looking at only the clones that are dynamically changing, just like she was showing you in those early slides in the last car. And so this shows you the dynamics there. And again, you can see out to 180, MAVIS is actually two-scale. You have clones that have gone up very early and then are sort of maintained at a relatively high level. And then they are sort of maintained at a relatively high level. And the same thing in year two, it's noisy, but this is at the individual clone level rather than at a cluster level. And so then what we did is we cloned 12 of these TCRs and tried to work backwards to find the epitope. And it could be really anywhere in the flu virus because even though we standardized the flu vaccine on HA, a lot of the different flu vaccine components get in there, a lot of the different flu proteins get in there. And all of the flu vaccines are made on this lab strain background. Made on this lab strain background called PR8. So we actually used PR8 to try to find some of the epitopes. And for three of the 12, we were able to map both to the HLA using similar approaches to what Aja just showed you and to the peptide. And the three I'm showing you here, none of them were from the HA. So this is from M2, this is from M1, this is from MP. These are known targets actually of the antibody response and flu, and probably useless targets of the antibody response and flu because they're all inside the virus. All inside the virus. So M2 has posted that a little bit. But we found three more that I'm not showing you that were HA specific. They were H1 specific. But these were actually the larger responses, these internal protein responses. And again, these people hadn't seen vaccine in at least for five years. So now if we just focus on the specific clones, and this plot up here just shows PC1 of the gene expression. PC1 of the gene expression variation across the specific clones across time. And it's obviously, you don't know what PC1 corresponds to, but I show it just to show that there's this maturation over time, and this goes from year one to year two that is sort of linear and directed. So you start out in this potentially early pre-phase, and then you mature into this GC or IL-10. Into this GC or IL-10 TFH face, and you don't come back. And this is shown, I think, a little bit easier down here where we've taken those gene sets and made modules out of them. So we have a pre-module, a GC module, and the IL-10 module. And again, we've got all of our individual cells that we think we have good evidence for being, they're part of these 12 clone types, basically, good evidence for being specific. And you can see they're sort of, they're not. Sort of, they're not, they're ordered somewhat through time here. This is the dayline up here, and then year one versus year two. You can see really clearly that in year two, in these same clonal lineages, which is what you were asking, Armita, you start out already largely in the GC phase. You have almost none of this sort of more naive-like state, so this is all recall, and you're already in this regulatory state in year two. And again, this is with a dead protein unagivated vaccine. Unagitated vaccine. And so, what I've shown you in this first part is this repeated antigen exposure where you're getting the flu vaccine every year, what you end up doing, at least in these small group of people that haven't received the flu vaccine recently, is driving this response potentially much more quickly to completion so that you're potentially telling the system that it's already seen this before. Already seen this before, and that it maybe doesn't need to mount a new whole germinal center response. It doesn't have to go through all the motions of that this is a new pathogen. And so, this is just a hypothesis. I don't have much more data than what I've shown you here for this. But thinking about original antigenic sin and what we heard about this concept yesterday from PENA, is whether or not the original antigenic sin is actually coming on the CD4 side more than the B cell side. Because we know that B cells can actually distinguish very subtle. That B cells can actually distinguish very subtle differences, but these CB4 cells are seeing the exact same antigen. They're going into the germinal center and they're telling the B cells there's nothing new here, so you don't need to do anything new. And so potentially original antigenic sin, especially in the context of these unadjuvenated protein vaccines, is a CD4-mediated event. And one way around this would just be to introduce novel CD4 epitopes if we're going to do annual vaccines every year. So that was. So that was the first part of the talk. I'm doing a little okay at time because we started it. And so, what I've shown you is that influenza-specific TFH cells mature linearly from this early activation to GC to this TFR IL-10 state within the same colonial lineages. The maturation occurs over 180 days in the lymph node. None of this is really detectable in the blood. I can show you that data, but the blood peaks very quickly and then it disappears, which is part of why we think this is such a terrible vaccine and not particularly potent. Potent. Recalled cells one year later rapidly acquire this GC phenotype and progress to the IL-10 phenotype. And the internal proteins can be really prominent targets of this GC response. And just to emphasize that it's really this combination of specificity and function that's allowing us to see these things. And the 10x platform is, I think, really great for sort of pulling this together. And so, in the second half of the talk, which will be quick, I just want Quick. I just wanted to show you sort of the same concept on the CD8 side of things. And this is from a SARS-CoV-2 study that we had at St. Jude, where we had been enrolling employees that were getting tested asymptomatic, they were just getting tested, everyone was getting tested weekly throughout 2020, basically. And so we ended up with multiple groups of people that were very well characterized and that we had very solid infection histories on. So people that had just been vaccinated, and this is all Pfizer. Been vaccinated, and this is Al-Pfizer. People that had been infected only, people that had been infected and then gotten vaccinated, and then people that had gotten vaccinated and then infected. So these are breakthrough infections, and this was all pre-Omicron. So these are Delta and earlier breakthrough infections. And we analyzed CD8 cells with a panel of HLA-specific Multimers. And I'll show you which ones here. So this was actually done by Aja and Misha, who you just met. And this is the cohort. So we have people that are just infected, people that are infected and vaccinated, just vaccinated, and then the breakthrough infections. And these are the multimers over here that we selected. This was largely from various literature searches and some of the papers actually that others showed you. And what we did is we tried to match people. So everyone had at least two of the HLAs that we're looking at. The HLAs that we're looking at. People had sort of even numbers of the HLAs matched for age and sex. And so if you just even add up, so we sort all the cells that are tensor positive, and then we put them through 10x. If you just add up the number of cells that we had that were specific in each case, it's actually this is a log scale here, but this is they're relatively similar across all the groups and the breakthrough groups actually, if anything, were maybe even slightly higher than the other groups in terms of the total CDE response. In terms of the total CDE response, this is each epitope response. So everybody made a response, it was detectable. For those of you looking in the literature, so this is sort of a non-functional assay, right? It's tetramer sorting directly versus the AIM assays, where the AIM assays, I think, are really underestimating the CD8 response, in part because they're comparing them to the CD4 response. But you can see everybody makes a nice response, and pretty much everybody. And pretty much everybody that has an epitope can more or less detect that epitope in the majority of people. And some of the epitopes are quite large. So this one is my favorite. It's this AO1-TTD epitope, it's not a spike epitope. It's highly immunodominant. Like this person, 10% of their peripheral CD8s were specific for that one epitope. If you look now in people that were infected and then get the vaccine, which is what we've been recommending for people, is this Been recommending for people is this is just one example, but this is adding up all of their non-spike responses and putting it in this purple. And then all their spike responses are in this pink. And so this is after their infection, the vast majority of their response is against non-spike epitopes. And then they get vaccinated, and now they're only seeing spike again. So that's getting recalled and expanded. And now the most of the response is spike-specific as the majority of the response. And this is looking at all of our people pre- At all of our people, post-infection, pre-vaccination, and then after the vaccine, you see the shift towards this is the proportion of spike in the response. So they become, you continue expanding that spike-specific response when you get the vaccine after infection, which is potentially a good thing. You're just making more of CDAT cells that can be protective. One interesting thing is: so, this is three exposures to spike anagen, infected, vaccinated, vaccinated. The breakthroughs also have three exposures to spike anagen. Break threes also have three exposures, just like antigen, but it's vaccinated, vaccinated, infected. And if you look at their proportion of the spike-specific response, they look more like people that had just been infected, like they hadn't seen it three times. And plotting that out a little differently, you can see the if we're plotting the number of non-spike-specific cells versus the number of spike-specific cells. So, vaccinated people are all on the axis because they've only seen spike, but the breakthrough people are all sort of off the axis. They actually have more non-specific. Off the axis, they actually have more non-spike than spike. And again, it's sort of reminiscent that they're not actually recalling their spike-specific response in the blood, at least that we can see. So, huge caveat there, as efficiently as other individuals. So, one question you might have is, are these the same T cells? And so, we looked at the repertoires with TCR disc using exactly the same methods that I should just showed you. And this is looking. And this is looking across the larger responses that we saw, making these dominant clusters. And this gets to one of the questions I think that was asked, which is: you asked how public these responses are. If you look across each of these matrix epitopes, there's always a public element if you can find the response this way with a multimer. I don't know of any even a multimer-based response that's fully private in each individual. And as they mentioned, the motif could be either in the alpha chain or the beta chain, or both. Either in the alpha chain or the beta chain, they're both. But if we look across all of our conditions, so breakthrough infections, vaccinations, or vaccination only, or infections, this is just looking at this prominent spike epitope, NaO2. Everybody has the same motif. So they're pulling in the same cells, regardless of how their antigen exposure history went. So the differences between people are not necessarily because of the players that they're recruiting to the game. The other point I wanted to make on the slide. The other point I wanted to make on the slide, so this is all public now, it's on EDJDB, and it's on the scale of the DASH data set. So it's about 4,000 unique receptors across, paired across these 18 epitopes. And so for validation sets for some of these methods we've been talking about, I think it's a very useful data set. And Aja wanted me to mention that. That was very interesting. So if you, was that conditional on the HLA types already, these clusters? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yeah, it is. Um yeah, it is. So if you if you now slide your sort of threshold for defining uh how you call a cluster, that would change, I guess, the number of um public versus private. Because now you basically say within each cluster you can find at least one representative sequel that's a public basically. Right, right. That's really interesting. Well, public motif, right. So like it's rare that you get a, especially at the alpha beta level. If you see actually a public alpha beta motif, it probably means you have a contamination in your lab. You have a contamination in your lab, but a public motif for sure. Yeah. Okay, my last slide here. Yeah. Is so what does this mean functionally? Again, trying to pull together these two things. So everyone's pretty much identical specificity-wise, but are they the same functionally? So this is a giant UMAP of all of the CDAT cells. So all of these are SARS-CoV-2 specific, so it's filtered down on only bona fide. You know, bona fide, multiple binding cells. And to orient you, this is sort of the most naive part of the graph. This is the most sort of classical memory. And then these are the effectors, little dagger up here. And these are like super exhausted and climbingly expanded up here. All antigen exposure groups appear in all clusters at some level. So there's no sort of total exclusion, but there are enrichments. So if you see down here, the breakthroughs have a lot more. The breakthroughs have a lot more yellow, statistically significant more yellow, than in either spike or non-spike responses than the other groups. So that's this cluster five here. What's yellow? Yellow is this Granzyme K C D 8 effector. And if you do a lot of 10x, granzyme K is like, it's just super easy to detect. It's very high. We were talking yesterday. 10X isn't very efficient. It can see Granzyme K really easily. And it's often a poly. Easily, and it's often opposed on the CD8 site to another effector profile, which is kind of this grandzyme B, grandzyme H, like the sort of classic profile. There's a lot of hand waving in the literature about what the grandzyme K profile is, and there's no, I don't think there's a consensus right now, other than that it's different than the classic CD8 response. So they do seem different. We don't know how they're different, but just that they are clearly distinguishable functionally. The other thing that's interesting about them, and this is kind of a, well, this can Is kind of a, well, this, I can make an easier point first. So, this is just looking at the temer phenotype, so the sort of late maturation phenotype where memory cells re-express CB45RA. If you look at infected, people that were, people just infected, people just vaccinated, or even the breakthrough infections, they all have about the same kind of TEMRA phenotype percentage, same activation level, which is also interesting because these folks, again, have had three exposures and everybody else has either had two. Exposures and everybody else has either had two or one that we're comparing them to. But once you start getting into the infected vaccinated, and particularly the infected vaccinated twice, folks, that goes up. And so this is, I think, this is just across the whole cluster. But so every time you're getting the vaccine, you're actually driving those spike-specific cells farther. They're expanding more. They end up in this effector phase. And this is something I think we need to keep an eye on just because if we're going to keep. We need to keep an eye on just because if we're going to keep getting all these boosters, particularly these RNA boosters, we're not, we sometimes I think have this idea that the vaccination is just sort of topping you up to where you need to be, but you're actually driving things forward and eventually that might not be the best strategy. And then the last sort of subtle point I want to make is this is sort of another gene dot plot of these are all sort of classic effector or transcription factor. Factor or transcription factors controlling CDA differentiation. And we can get in the weeds of what they all are. There's a grainzyme B, graenzyme H, but the comparison I really want you to make is that the breakthrough spike and non-spike responses look almost identical, even though their spike responses are third-time recall and their non-spike responses are naive. And so that is also interesting and consistent with the idea that we're not seeing a ton of evidence of spike recall. Not seeing a ton of evidence of spike recall in people that have the breakthrough infection. Versus, if you look at the people infected vaccinated, their spike and non-spike responses look very different because their spike responses are a third time challenge versus their non-spike RNA being recalled after the vaccination. Okay, so that's what I just showed you: is that vaccination infection induce these robust CDAT cell responses. All individuals found multiple CDAT cells. individuals mount multiple CDAT cell responses and they use the same repertoire. So again this combination of specificity and function I think has been really useful because what we can see is that the function is different. So vaccination continues to expand T cell responses even in convalescent individuals and so we're constantly maturing those phenotypes every time we get the vaccine again. The conditions all have distinct gene expression profiles with the breakthroughs as the biggest outliers and the breakthroughs have the specificity profile more like infection. Have the specificity profile more like infection. The positive spin on the breakthrough infections is that if you got vaccinated and then you get a breakthrough infection, now you created this great memory pool to the internal protein. So there was nothing wrong with people that got the breakthrough infections. They make a really great response in that regard, and now they have new memory. But I do think there's this impression that there's very little spike recall in those individuals that's really interesting. The reviewers hated this point, though, so we just focused on the very positive point that the The very positive point that the breakthroughs make this great spike memory response, and that's what the paper is going to be about when you see it. But, okay, and that's my talk. I just acknowledge Aja, Misha, and Stefan, again, who did most of the work, and the rest of the lab and our collaborators. That was the first part, the question. So I forgot what you mentioned. Did you find that these early, the GC-like TFE responses, do they share clones with the later TFR response and the soft IO10 response? Yes, so we can, each clone appears in each category.
