Okay, so I hope you can see this. Alright, thanks very much for the introduction. And also I would like to thank the organizers, of course, for organizing this uh very interesting uh conference. I wish that could be different, but I'm here. Be there, but I'm here just like a me. So, today I'm gonna talk to you about trying to combine experiments and modeling to understand chemotaxis, better understand chemotaxis. So, this is a problem in cell migration, and I thought I have to dwell on this, the importance of this in biology for this audience. I just do want to show you these movies because I think they're really nice. So, here are a couple of examples. So here are a couple examples of cell migration in biology. The left one was developmental biology. The osophila, there's an immune system example, a single cell migrating to a complex environment. And of course, the other one was a wound limit experiment where the wound was closing. And of course, this is also important for cancer metastasis, where tumor cells are migrated through the exosomal matrix and into the Through the exercise on the floor screen. These examples are, of course, very interesting and really important, but also very complicated and essentially too complicated for us. So we're using a much simpler system. It's called the Dickey's Belium Dyscordia. It's an alleviate system. And it uses chemotaxis if you take away its food. So this is kind of a life cycle of chemotaxis. So this is kind of a life cycle of it to stealing here. And here I've shown you some movies. So if you take away its food, it no longer is a unicellular organism, it actually starts to respond to secreted chemotractins, as I've shown here in this movie. And then it uses this chemotactic process to aggregate, together in a large clump of cells, about 100,000 per cell, within this clump to differentiate. Within this quantum, they differentiate, and eventually they form a fooding body with about 80% of the population as force inside the pruding body. So, this is a survival mechanism for the organism. Okay, so this is the system that we're using, and again, it's a very good system for chemotaxis, and you can look at both single-cell and multi-cell rubric. So, today I was gonna try to tell you a little bit about two projects. Tell you a little bit about two projects. One of them is a single-cell project where I look at different modes of cell migration. And the other one is actually some behavior of multicellular organisms or multicellular aggregates. And the general theme is that we try to combine modeling with quantitative experiments. So the first project is cell migration using different modes. Using different modes. And it's well known that cells of the same type can move and switch between different migration modes. And this is schematically indicated in this figure here. We have different migration modes. You can move like an amygoid cell, like a fan-shaped cell, or a plant-based. And this is also implicated in cancer metastasis, where it's seeing that cells can actually switch between these migration modes. Switch between these migration modes, and if they switch to migration mode, maybe it's more difficult to target these cancer cells. Now, Tictyosthelium can also show different migration modes, and this is experimental work then. And the first mode is the well-known amevoid mode, and this is shown here. The top movie is the DIC image. Is the DIC image, the bottom one is where we have visualized actin or LINE inside the cell. And this particular cell is responding to a cyclic ANP gradient that is pointing to the right. You don't have to do this. This mode of migration also exists for vegetative cells, cells that happen up to. Now, if you create a mutant cell or you develop these cells under very low density conditions, you can get a ton. Low density conditions, we can get a totally different cell shape and a different cell migration model, which we call a fan-shaped cell. So these cell shapes are roughly constant, and the cell, rather than expanding to the pot, is migrating in a functional morphology and gliding output surface. And again, you see GIC on the top and LE acting, fresh and acting on the bottom. And there's a third mode that you can create. Third mode that you can create, you have to engineer the cells for this. These are cells with a low F3 level and they oscillate. So if I look at the basal surface of this cell, this cell surface is oscillating between small and large. And you can also see, and I'll come back to this a little bit later, that there are these waves of acting on the basic surface expanding outwards. It's kind of like a target wave going outwards. So what we wanted to do is we wanted to see how cell migration and fraction forces and signaling are all integrated in these three different modes. And for that we use fraction force microscopy to get an idea of the forces exerted by the cells on the substrate. We also use the fluorescent microscopy that can track the cytoskeletal distribution for the interstellar distributions of acts. Distributions of acton and myoson, and then we combine it with some modeling topics. So, of course, I cannot give you all the details of all the and all the nitty-gritty, but I'll just give you some overview of what we found. I should probably say a little bit about the force measurements that we use. So we use the fraction for microscopy, as I said earlier. Our setup has a very thin layer of soft elastic. Layer of soft elastic gel on top of it we have the forest and beads and then once the cell is exerting forces it can actually reform or it can then shift the position of the beads and from that we can then backtrack what forces are that are exerted by the cell onto the substrate. So here's an example of the cell moving along the substrate. You can see you have a high density of pizza. You can barely see if it's quint very very hard. You can probably see a little bit of movement of the pizza very little. Very little. But then you do some image processing and you do some regularization, and then you can get the fraction force maps. And you learn the details of the fraction force with a fairly high spatial resolution and temporal resolution. Okay, so here is a Levoid cell. On the right, we see the cell expressed in Lin E, and on the left, we have the reconstructed fraction for the map. So this is showing the four. So this is showing the force per area or stress. It's in a polar scale ranging from zero to almost 50 Pascal. And there are errors here which are probably a little bit hard to see, especially since you're moving quickly. The errors indicate the direction of the forces. And you have to just, if you can see, just have to take it from you that all the forces are pointing inward into the cell. Now once you get these Now once we get these trajectory force maps we can then start asking questions how are things correlated. So for example I can plot at the functional time, the area and Lini, the partial intensity of Lini, and I can look at the correlation between them and from that you can then conclude that, not surprisingly probably, that Liny activity is correlated with extensions, but they're negatively correlated, so that means that extension That extension limby is speaking first and then extension follows. And this is all consistent with the idea that active waves are underlying this motion, and that's something that others and we also have published on before. And so there are short-lived active waves that are created and nucleated at the pseudonym, and that is actually driving the extension of itself. So, another view of this can be obtained by looking at chemographs of the fraction force and the fluorescence. So, these are just the same signal as before here, but I just now look at only what happens along the membrane. So, I take the membrane and cut it and splay it, and then I display it as it comes from time. The time is going to the right, and up, down is the membrane. Membrane. And you can see that I can have a frame for political tension on the left and the fluorescent intensity on the right. You can also see from if you just look at these things, you can also quantify, of course, is that regions of high stress are mostly correlated with hatches of GFV myoes. In this case it's MIOS. So with remember we have foreshot intensity maps of both mice and then link, but I cannot show all of that. But I cannot say all of that. Okay, so what about the oscillatory cell? Well, we can do the same thing, of course, for an oscillatory cell. This is now myo that I'm showing you on the right, myo intensity. If I look at the area as a function of thin, you can clearly see that it's oscillatory. And the myosin also shows an oscillatory pattern, but well delayed on the area. And what happens here? And what happens here is that there's an acting wave that's nuclear at the bottom of the basal surface that is spreading outwards, that is creating the protrusion, and a misinterpoles and creating the contraction. And in both cases, both during expansion and contraction, the forces are always inward. And this is kind of schematic, not so schematic, this is the actual data, but I've indicated these grey arrows for visualization. Gray arrows for visualization purposes. And the traction forces are definitely larger during the contract out phase. Alright, so here are the kinographs of a particular oscillatory cell. You can clearly see, of course, that the membrane is expanding and shrinking and expanding in a fashion. And it's also shown from this that the attraction forces are higher due to contraction. Higher during the contraction. On this particular case, here you can clearly see that the fraction forces get larger during the contractile phase. And LIMD is typically only elevated during the truth of particle size. Okay, so now let's go to this fan-shaped cell. So surprisingly, or at least not surprisingly, at least more surprising to me, we found two types of fan-shaped cells, with two different Of fan-shaped cells with two different fraction force patterns. And I'm going to first talk about what we call type 2. These are typically the larger cells, and I probably should have made it so that this was repeating, but actually it didn't help. This is a cell that's moving upward, and the attraction force pattern is below the cell, displayed below the cell. So I look at it as a still image, it looks something like this. And I can see that I have two large force poles. Holes at the back, both sides of the back. And this is very similar, of course, to what is observed in fish cheratocytes. So keratocytes, fish keratocytes are also fan-shaped cells. They are, of course, different because they are well they are keratocytes, but they have a nucleus, a large nucleus here, and they also exhibit these actin bundles connecting Actin bundles connecting the two ends at the back, which the Tictyosinio cells do not have. Nevertheless, the force pattern is almost identical to the one we found for this type of cell. If I then look at the traction forces, in particular the component in the direction of motion, I see that the component is going backwards, so blue is negative, red is positive, positive means in the direction of motion. means in the direction of motion, is negative at the front of the cell and positive at the back of the cell. So this is consistent with the idea that there's retroplate flow at the front of the cell. So the actin is pushing up against the substrate. The whole cytoskeletal network is flowing backwards and that's creating retroplate flow and therefore attraction forces that are pointing backwards. And then actin is at the back of the cell, is contracting the cell, is pushing the actin' cytoskeletal network. The actin cytoskeletal network forward and is creating forces that are pointing in the direction of potion. And this is also clearly seen in this chimograph. If you go along the cell, you switch from backward to forward to backward again. Now we also saw a different cell type, typically in smaller cells. And it's very hard to see what was different in this particular case, but if I look at it From a still image, I still see that there are two large force poles in the back of the cell, the posterior corners. But now, if I look at the traction force in the direction of motion, I see a difference. I see that along the midline, only red appears in this map, which means that all the traction forces are pointing forward, not backward. So there's no more switch between backward and forward. Switch between backward and forward, as in the previous image. But now all the forces, especially in the middle of the cell, are pointing in the direction of motion. And this is also seen in this gamma graph here. You get two switches. You can switch from red to blue and then again from blue to red again. So that means that along at the front here, there cannot be any retrograde flow. And this is also obvious or evident. Obvious or evident if you look at the direction of the forces. So, this is essentially the same picture as here, but here all the forces or the arrows are scaled by the magnitude of the force or the stress. Here I've just indicated the direction of the stress, of the force. And if you look at this picture, you see that there are actually two counter-rotating fortices. So this one here is going clockwise, and this one is going counter-rotise. And this one is going counterclockwise. And then you meet in the middle and the middle, the attraction forces are pointing forward in the direction of motion. Okay, so this is quite distinct from what has been observed in fish heretocytes. So you can also of course determine the limb E and myosin distribution in these two cell types. They're roughly similar. Myosin is enriched in the back. Myosin is enriched in the back and the knee is present all along the membrane for both cell types. And so this is consistent with the idea of an action wave that is propagating constantly and is pushing the cell forward. So the cell membrane is just following an acton wave, continuously propagating actin wave. So to get a better idea what this all might mean, What this all might mean. We try to use some modeling. And in our model, the interior of the cell is modeled as a compressible fluid. And the friction of this fluid with the substrate is providing attraction forces. And so this is, I think, a reasonable assumption in the case of ticyosthenium, because ticyosthenium does not have full cohesion complexes, not like a maliac cell types. Maybe it cell types or there are integral complexes that are causing the or that are responsible for the adhesion between the cell and the substrate. Is there a question? Okay. So we can try to model this as a deformable cell object, which we have done in the past, and actually create PDEs to and actually create P D E's to create distributions of actinomyosin. That is very complex and probably very difficult and diverse. So what we did, we did something a bit simpler. We used the distributions of actin and myosin that were observed in the experiments and use that as input and see if that created the correct morphology and fraction force patterns. And the nice thing about that of course is that we can then also independently alter the protrusive strength. Independently alter the protrusive strength, which is associated with actin, and the contractile strength, which is associated with myosin. And so we did this, of course, for all three cell types, and we found consistent results. So here's just an example of an amoeboid cell where we create patches of actin and a patch of myosin, and you get traction force patterns that is that are similar and consistent with the experimentally observed traction force patterns. Observed traction force patterns. But let me just focus on these fan-shaped cells. And what we found is that by changing and playing with the balance between contractile protrusion forces, we could easily switch between the two observed patterns. So in the case of a large contractile force, we create these 40 sets, these two 40 sets here, counter-rotating scrolling patterns. As you have counter-rotating scrolling patterns, and basically, what happens is that the myosin contracts and pushes the entire fluid forward. That is then pushing the membrane forward. If we reduce the myosin and make actin dominant, then we get actin-based propulsion as showing here. So here the actin is causing a producer force, creating a retrograde flow, and myosin is still contracting in the back, and therefore. Contracting in the back and therefore still oops. What was that? Sorry. Something happened here. Hold on. What was that? Here. Yeah. Okay. It's still creating the two large force faults. Okay. And so just to show you that this is actually dynamic simulation, here's an example of a movie that we can create. So all of these examples, all of these modeling efforts are actually dynamic simulations. Simulations and where the cell membrane and the cell shape can vary. Okay, so what is what can we conclude from all of this? This is a very busy slide. But nevertheless, what this suggests is that the intracellular flow is actually determining the attraction force patterns in the HTOS field. And as schematically shown here, so if I have actin, red is actin here, it's polarizing, it's pushing against. Is polymerizing, it's pushing against the membrane that can push the cytoskeletal network backwards, which creates a flow, which creates attraction force. Same thing for myosin. If myosin contracts, it can create a flow, which can create attraction force. And by playing around with the balance between actin and myosin, in other words, protrusion and contractile forces, I can create two different cell patterns or attractive force patterns in the fan-shaped cells. Okay, so now in the let's see, I have a little bit of time left, I think, maybe ten more minutes. So I wanted to switch and to talk about a completely different problem that we kind of found by coincidence. So if you remember, in the beginning of the talk, I showed you a very dense line of cells that all clump together in a nice aggregation pattern. What we wanted to do is we wanted What we wanted to do is we wanted to see what happens if I do not start with a large density, a high density of cell, with a low density of cells. And what we found is that in this case, for some situations, we found an aggregate. Let me just start this again. So this aggregate forms. And I think you start paying attention. Yeah, right now the white circle is around it. But instead of all the cells kicked. But instead of all the cells keep coming in here, at some point you can see that cells are actually being ejected or moved away from the aggregate. And so this aggregate still is still there, now it traps the cell again. But you can also have situations where this aggregate completely falls apart. So this is an example of dispersal behavior. So we get cells come together in aggregate, but then they start to disperse. Then they start with the spurs. So we wanted to quantify this, of course, and quantifying these individual cells is difficult. It's actually very difficult. So what we used, we used optical flow. And so in this case, blue is corresponding to movement that's going away from the activate. Activate is here in the yellow cross, and red is movement going into the active cut. Going into the reactive phase. And if I plot this as a function of time, what I see is a follow-up. So this is a function of time in minutes. And here I've plotted the out and inflow of cells towards or away from the activate. And the blue is going outward and the red is going inward. And at time zero, which is just an arbitrary chosen time point, we can see that the We can see that the behavior of the cells around the epidemic is switching, is changing. Suddenly, the blue takes over, it's much larger than the red. So this corresponds to this onset of dispersal. And eventually, of course, dispersal ends at that, where the blue has become almost zero, and all the cells have spoken into the leg. But what you can also see, I think, is that during this instruction. Is that during this dispersal, it is not like all the cells are coming in uniformly and continuously. There's actually oscillations of the map. And you can shown quite nicely here. And we wanted to figure out is this happening for all aggregates or only for maybe different sizes? And what we found is that this oscillatory dispersal is limited to small aggregates. And as is shown here on the y-axis, which somehow has disappeared, is the size of the aggregate. Not actually it's been yes, the size. And we can show that on average, only small aggregates show dispersal. Next, we wanted to figure out: are they still supreme data and responding to cyclic gain p? Remember, cyclic gain p is the fright intimate. That we can use the thriving chemotraction during this aggregation process. And for that, we can use cells that have a label in them from Window 2, which is measuring the intracellular state AMP level. And you can see for this dispersing cluster, you can still see flashes, meaning that there is still periodic signaling of the NP signal. And of course, you can quantify this as well. And what we observed is And what we observed is that before dispersal, the significant AMP signals oscillate with a typical oscillation frequency of about 6 to 10 minutes. But at dispersal, this frequency suddenly changes. In fact, the period doubles. And we can also quantify this. On average before, it's roughly 10 minutes and afterwards it's 21 minutes. So there's a doubling. So there's a doubling of period of the cyclic AMP signal inside the activities. Okay, also we can figure out that the cyclic AMP signal is still correlated with the input motion. So the cells are still responding to the remote facted sigma. Okay, so the experiments have shown the following. We showed that dispersal is oscillatory. It can last several periods. It can affect cells at large distance. I didn't show it, it's recently showed it, but it's Show it, it's recently showed, it's good to step into it. Cyclic AMP signaling is still present in the agricultus, and there's an increase of the cyclic AMP period of the chemo tracking community. So then, of course, the question is, how can they show this dispersal? Why did some cells go away from the agro-protected start to move outwards? And what we think is going on is that it is an interplay between the It is an interplay between the schemotractin, cyclic ANP, and phosphodiesterase. So phosphodiesterase is also secreted by cells. Phosphodiastrid breaks down cyclic NP. Imagine if these cells are all secreting cigar AMP and of course at some point everything gets saturated with cigar NP. So there must be a mechanism that also breaks down cyclic NP. And this secretion by these cells is non-pyrule, it's constant. So what we think there is a competition between the two. Between the two. And if the cyclic ANP period is increasing, the PDE, the phosphodiesters, has a larger, has more time to break down cyclic ANP close to the acrotet, which would create a gradient of cyclic ANP pointing away from the acrotet. That's basically the idea. So we wanted to test this idea in a simple simulation, in 2D simulation. So we have Stimulation. So we have a circular aggregate and we have phosphodiesters being secreted constantly by this circular aggregate as well as purely cyclic AMP signal. And then we can change the period of the cyclic AMP and then we can track cell motion that is indicated here by these white dots that are just cells randomly placed within this simulation domain and they respond simply to the gradient of Respond simply to the gradient of the cyclic NP. And as you can see here, that these white dots are actually moving away from the aggregate because cyclic phosphodiesters has time to degrade cyclic NP around the aggregate. You can create a phase diagram. The two important parameters are the degradation constant of cyclic MP due to the phosphodiesters, as well as the length scale of the PDA profile. us the length scale of QD profile. And let me not go more into detail this. I think this is fairly detailed. The predictions of the model. So the model can actually make some predictions, which is I think always very nice for a model. The first one I'm not going to show you, but this was kind of I think a two-de-force by Wicha, who did the experiments. You can actually take up a little bit of the Take up a little bit of the medium surrounding a dispersing aggregate and place it next to a non-dispersing aggregate. So if that is high in PDE, it should also degrade the silicon gain in T close to the non-dispersing aggregate, which makes it dispersal, makes it disperse. And we figure that this is actually true. A bit simpler one, and actually something that we can explicitly quantify is that if we add a PDE inheritor, Add a PDE inheritor, we should abolish this dispersal. So, again, if PDE degrades cyclic AMP, if I then remove this degradation mechanism, cyclic AMP should always be present and will never have a negative gradient there. And indeed that is the case shown here. So I have a dispersing aggregate, I add the inhibitor, and it becomes non-dispersive. Because red is inward, blue is outward. A third prediction is that if I add PDE, so I wash, so I put a lot of PDE in my system, I basically get rid of all my cyclic AMP and I should also get rid of this dispersal. And that is shown here as well. Alright, so this is the summary of what we found. So these examples of these self-generated So these examples of these self-generated gradients are also shots seen in different systems. In particular, I would like to point you to the work of Robert Insel and colleagues. Some very nice work. And you might ask yourself, you know, why would this happen, dictious theorem? And so my hypothesis is that this could be a mechanism to protect against the formation of very small aggregates. Very small aggregates are probably not. Very small aggregates are probably not viable because you need to make a stalk and a pruning body, and that's not very efficient if you have only a limited number of cells. This might be a way of preventing very small aggregates to occur. Alright, okay, so last but not least, of course, I would like to thank all the people that did the work. So the first part was carried out by Elizabeth Kabash, modeling work by Timothy and Marco. By Timothy and Marco. The second part was done by Richard Karmakar with the help of Richard Dawr. Peter Daviotis and Yushan Meow were also involved in the first part. And of course the funding agencies are definitely acknowledged. And we have most likely a postdoc position available. So if anybody's interested in being on this nice campus with the ocean running right next door, please drop me a like. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. So I see a question from Ryan. Yeah, very nice, Rajan. So a couple of technical questions and sort of an extension of some of the work that you're doing. So obviously the dark matter in this is the direction and magnitude of the protrusive forces. First of all, the work you've done. Here's a question on the work you've done. So the fact that beads are all in one plane, you might be able to get some Z information out as well. Is there any can you with the way you're just set up using sort of defocus to get Z information? And is there anything interesting in that? And if one wanted to either get the protrusive forces or at least the contractile forces under a protrusive, more protrusive dominant situation, if you tried any adverse overlay or confinement. You can address overlay or confinement on top of the cells to actually have them pushing against opposing surfaces to see if the force distribution shifts? Okay, yeah, good questions. So for the first one, so for the Z direction, we don't have a way of measuring this. However, our gels are very thin. They're about 3 microns to 15 microns thick. So, and especially for the very thin ones, 3 microns, it's Think on three microns, it's not believed that the Z direction is really affecting the motion that much. Because basically, the beats are so close to the glass substrate that it fills the glass substrate right away. So, the second one, that's a very good point and a good suggestion. We have not tried that. We are looking at aggregation with an overlay, but not single-cell migration yet. That's a good question. That's a good question and you might want to try it. Thank you. I have a question, if any, really nice talk. It's tending to speculate that these different modes of migration that you see could all emerge as sort of different variants of some variant outputs of some bigger mechano-chemical system that includes both protrudes. Includes both protective force generation and contraction and some other underlying signaling system. Do you have some speculations about what that, you know, what mechanic chemical system might look like? What would you have to add in order to be able to realize any different things as variances from underlying model? Yeah, yeah, no, that's an excellent point. And I have not, I did not really touch on this because Touch on this because probably out of, you know, don't have enough time for this. A lot of people have looked at this actually, and I think what most people believe, and we believe that too, is that it is really a different way, the different migration modes are all coming from different types of actin waves. So it's a system that can be both excitatory and also. Can be both excitatory and oscillatory. And if you play around with the parameters of that system, you can either get consistent waves that are just propagating forever, corresponding to a fan-shaped cell, or short-lived waves that create pseudopods, or these target patterns shown in these oscillators. So it's a coupling between, I think, the signaling system that can show a different Signaling system that can show a different qualitative behavior. And then the force generator, I think, is the same in all cell types. It's basically active protrusion and myosin contraction. Is that kind of the ratio of that? Yeah, I mean I would imagine that then it would come down to the relationship between length scales of the excitable system and time scales of oscillations generated by an excitable system and length and time scale. system and length and time scales associated with viscoelasticity and so on that govern the mechanics. Yeah, absolutely. There's certainly, absolutely, that's completely correct. Yeah, I have a related question because usually when I hear talks about sort of excitable actin waves, people talk about excitatory and the salatory, I haven't seen these fancy I haven't seen these fan-shaped ones before. How often do it actually occur in dicty versus excitatory and musculatory? Right. Frequency of different patterns. Yeah, another good question. So if you develop dicty, developing means take away your food. If you do this under high density conditions, very, very few cells show this fan-shaped morphology. Unless you have a particular Have a particular mutant cell type. If you have a particular mutant cell type, it's called MEP nil cells. They show about 40% of them become panchick cells. However, if you develop them under low density conditions, about 30 to 40% of the cells actually show this and shape morphology. So it's relatively common. It's not something that you have to look hard to find one. If you do the experimentation, If you do the experimental setup correctly, they're plenty cool. Thank you. Okay, so are there any questions from the in-person audience now? I don't think so. Okay, well, we're exactly on time and to switch to our next speaker. Our next speaker, Ruth Baker, who is a professor.
