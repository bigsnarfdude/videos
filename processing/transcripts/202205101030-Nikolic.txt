Yeah, so I would also like to thank very much the organizers for the opportunity to speak today in this very interesting workshop. I have really enjoyed and learned a lot from the previous talks. So essentially what I want to talk about today is mathematical modeling in the context of nonlinear acoustics that is based on using fractions. Is based on using fractional temperature laws in place of, let's say, more common or more standard integer order temperature laws. And the talk is largely based on the joint work with Barbara, which has the same title. And I believe recently it has appeared online in the M3AS journal and contains all the details, some of which I will have to skip today. I will have to skip today. So, before I get into the specifics and the mathematics of it all, I would like to give some motivation for the models I will discuss today. So, these models will describe propagation of sound waves, and I will mostly focus on nonlinear wave equations or wave-like equations. And so, I'm talking about non-linear acoustics and the motivation. And the motivation for studying nonlinear sound wave propagation largely comes from ultrasonics, because nonlinearity is closely tied to the amplitude, high amplitudes on the sound waves and also high frequencies. And so some ultrasonic waves, due to their high frequencies, are then a prime candidate for finding nonlinearities, in particular if they are combined with high pressure or amplitude values. Pressure or amplitude values. And so a GOFU application is related to Haifu waves. These are high-intensity focused ultrasonic waves. And this is something that is depicted currently on my slides. So on this left picture shows hypha waves as used in treatments of cancer. So because they have high amplitudes and then as they propagate, they well. as they propagate they well in this setup they sort of self-focus as they travel due to the curved geometry of the excitation surface and so they're focused at this target area which is in this case a cancerous region and this focusing additionally generates localized pressure values that are very high and so naturally in these applications medical applications of ultrasonic waves safety is very important so one wants to treat the cancers So, one wants to treat the cancerous region and generate high-pressure values there, but in the surrounding area in the healthy tissue, it should be unharmed. And when one thinks of further development and use of hyphen waves in medicine and also in industry, mathematical modeling is, of course, very useful and important. So, accurate mathematical modeling. And then on the right-hand side, this right picture is a numerical simulation that is. Numerical simulation that is motivated by such an application of focused ultrasonic waves. And of course, when one thinks of a reliable and accurate and reliable numerical simulation, then gaining as much knowledge as we can from our mathematical models is, of course, also very important. So this is where the motivation for the research done in this talk, that I'm presenting in this talk, comes from. So modeling of So modeling of this non-non-literal ultrasound propagation and also modeling in a sense of well-poseness and analysis of the derived models. So this work that the talk is based on with Barbara has sort of three aspects, and so I also structured my talk around them. So first of all, there's the actual derivation of these nonlinear acoustic equations. These nonlinear acoustic equations that are time fractional. And so, in the first part of my talk, I would like to say something about nonlinear acoustic modeling and what changes when one replaces this common temperature laws by their fractional counterparts. And then I will discuss the analysis of the derived models or some of them in more detail. And as a last part, of course, we would like. As a last part, of course, we would like to relate these fractional models to the ones that are kind of there in the literature. And so, in the last part of my talk, I will also discuss the limiting behavior of these models with respect to the fractional order of differentiation. So, if we would like to have an equation that describes nonlinear acoustic propagation, Acoustic propagation. Due to the high pressure and/or frequencies that are involved, we would have to go back to a full system of governing equations in fluid dynamics, which means a full system of including a Nair-Stokes equations and also a non-linear state equation, so a nonlinear pressure density equation. And of course, there is also a temperature loader involved, which is an important point in my talk, and I will come back to it in a moment. Back to it in a moment. And since this system is quite complicated to work with, there are commonly in physics derived approximations of it. This is known as the so-called weakly nonlinear modeling. So this relatively complicated system is then replaced by typically one wave equation that is much simpler to work with, but still captures the important effects of the original system. And in the System. And in deriving this one equation approximation, the guiding principle is that one should neglect perturbations that are of order three and higher. So in the end, the nonlinear wave models that we end up with will have nonlinearities of quadratic type, as we will see. And so within the system, the temperature law that is, let's say, a go-to temperature law is the Fourier one. Is the Fourier one, so the standard one, where Q is the ball Q is the heat flux vector, kappa is the thermal conductivity, and then here we have the gradient of the temperature of zeta. And let's say in the last 10 plus years, also another temperature law has become quite popular in the context of models in nonlinear acoustics, and this is also called Maxwell-Katanel. And this is the so-called Maxwell-Katenero law. So, compared to the Fourier law, this one introduces a time lag between the gradient of the temperature and the heat flux that is induced by it. And here, tau is the intrinsic relaxation time of the heat flux, or also simply sometimes known as thermal relaxation time. And depending on which of the two temperatures, Depending on which of the two temperature laws we use, we will end up with wave models that are of different order. So, if we use the Fourier flux law, then we end up with models that are referred to as classical models of nonlinear acoustics. And Kuznetsov's equation is probably the most widely accepted model of nonlinear sound propagation that is sufficiently general to accommodate all important effects. Accommodate all important effects in a let's say 3D wave propagation. So, this is an equation that is solved for psi. Psi is the acoustic velocity potential. And to arrive to the acoustic pressure from it, we should take its time derivative and then multiply it by the medium density. Of course, C is as usual the speed of sound. And then here we have an additional term. Have an additional term where delta is the sound diffusivity, and so this is a term that's a bit surprising in the context of wave propagation because it induces diffusivity. So this is a strong damping term. And then on the right-hand side, I have these nonlinearities, which, as I already mentioned, are of quadratic type. So we have the psi t squared, which will be then differentiated in time. And then we have Differentiated in time, and then we have also the gradient psi square as well. And another model also is quite popular, and it arises from simplifying the right-hand side nonlinearities, or more precisely, this gradient term on the right-hand side. So the quadratic gradient term can be approximated by psi t squared up to a c-dependent term. Such approximation. Such approximation is valid if we can assume that the cumulative nonlinear effects dominate the local ones. And this is the case, for example, if we're sufficiently far from the acoustic source in terms of wavelengths, then this is a good enough approximation according to physicists. And so, what happens is that we lose the quadratic gradient nonlinearity on right side. So, from the point of view of the analysis. So, from the point of view of the analysis, this makes our lives a bit easier. And we have to adjust a bit the nonlinear coefficient or the non-linearity coefficient on the right-hand side. But other than that, we then end up with the nonlinearity of this type, so slightly squared, and then differentiate it in time. And this model is known as the West-Tools equation. So, the Kuznatsu and West-Tools equation are the two classical models of non-linear acoustics, I would say. Linear acoustics, I would say. So they're based on the Fourier temperature law within the system of governing equations. And then I mentioned there is the Maxwell-Catanel law. And this one leads to a slightly more unusual wave-like equation. So this one leads to a third order in time equation. So tau is this thermal relaxation time. So the third order term is weighted by this tau. Weighted by the stau, which also appears here. So, this is now a hyperbolic equation. So, we don't have this diffusivity that was present in the Vasto-Kuznatsuv equation. So, this could be understood as a hyperbolic approximation of the previous models. And in terms of nonlinearities, we retain the same nonlinearities on the right-hand side. So, these third-order in-time equations appear, go way back. And time equations appear go way back to the work of Stokes and then later on they were also studied by Moore, Gibson, and Thompson. So, in the linear version. So, the linear version of this model, if we would set the right-hand side here to zero, would be called usual in the literature Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation. And then in 2014, Pedro Jordan derived a non-linear version in the context of acoustics. And so the full nonlinear model is then often referred to as this Jordan-Moore-Gibson nonlinear. To as the Schordenmoor Gibson-Thompson equation or JMGT to make it a bit shorter. And it is possible again to simplify it using this approximation, assuming that the cumulative effects are the dominant one, nonlinear effects are the dominant ones. And then we get what, at least in the mathematical literature, is called JMG, the equation of pastoral type, meaning that the nonlinearities as it appears in the vastuval type. Vestival type. And I already said that these higher order time equations can be understood as hyperbolic approximations. And indeed, if we formally plug in tau to zero, we are back at these classical models, either Kusnatzer or Rastwald. And this has also been made rigorous, such a study. So it has really been proven that the solutions of these higher order models converge to the solution of classical models and the To the solution of classical models and the limit of tau to zero, and in the works that I included on these slides. So these types of equations based on one or the other temperature law have been circulating for a while in the acoustics literature. And I will later on give some references, but they have also been quite well studied from the point of view of their well-posedness. Their well-poseness, regularity, and so on, symptomic behavior. However, there are known issues with both of these temperature laws. So the Fourier temperature law is known to lead to the paradox of the so-called infinite speed of propagation. And this is actually what we saw in these wave equations: that they have the strong damping, which essentially makes. Damping, which essentially makes them parabolic. So, this is diffusivity that one does not necessarily want to have in a wave propagation. On the other hand, the Maxwell-Catenell law, which does solve this issue, so it does make our equation hyperbolic. However, the Maxwell-Catenell law is known to violate the second law of thermodynamics. So, it also introduces another type of unphysical behavior, as it may lead to. Behavior, as it may lead to the absolute temperatures going below zero. And so, somehow the idea behind our research and work here was to try to interpolate between these two laws to try to retain their good properties and somehow avoid the bad ones. And to do this, one can use a fractional heat flux law. Heat flux law. And these, of course, have been studied and are available into the literature. So they go back to this very nice paper by Comte and Metzler from 93, where they considered generalizations of the flux law that they motivated and also studied. And they considered four generalizations. So the first three, they gave different motivations. They give different motivations. The fourth one they sort of introduce ad hoc and disregard it. However, it has been then later on included in some numerical studies of these fractional models. So we also included them in our considerations under H. And I should say that in our work and later on, we always assumed this to be the Caputo fractional derivative. So essentially what we wanted to do is we wanted to what we wanted to do is we wanted to see what kind of acoustic equations one ends up with when using the Compton Etzler fractional laws and to study their properties and also relate them to then this let's say standard JMGT models in the literature and I also want to mention that there is this very nice paper by Jan Kao There is this very nice paper by Zhang, Kai, and Holm from 2014, where they compared the resulting fractional heat equations that are based on these four fractional laws by Kant and Metzler. And they wanted to see whether they may introduce or not some unphysical behavior. And so overall, their study wasn't completely conclusive. However, the best, let's say, properties were displayed by this. Displayed by this first fractional law, which Compton means, or for short, you know, GFE, one, if the alpha is in the range from 0.5 to 1, but close to 0.5. And then the, let's say, the tendency to kind of bad behavior in terms of negative, leading to negative temperatures was mostly displayed by the second law that was proposed by Compton. That was proposed by Compton. Okay, so coming back to what we did: so the derivation of the fractional nonlinear acoustic equations. So we largely based it on the derivation of these higher order and time acoustic equations, the JMGT equations by Pedro Jordan, which are just written here. So, as I said, they are of Kuznetsu type, and then if one can simplify. Nets of type, and then if one can simplify the nonlinearity, we end up with the Wasterlot type equation. And so he sort of went back to his work and retraced his steps, but this time changing the Maxwell-Gattenel law by the Comte-Metzler laws, the four different versions. So I will not give this derivation as it is quite technical. I will instead show you the four equations that are. That are the result of that process. So, in terms of the involved coefficients, there, as before, and also the unknown function. So, my psi still denotes the acoustic velocity potential, c the speed of sound, and delta is this diffusivity coefficient, which not necessarily now has the same units. So, now we have in the three of the four derived models, we have the leading. Models: We have the leading term, which is fractional, and then the differences arise in these two terms. So, I should say, of course, that formally, if we plug in alpha to one, we are back in all cases to these JMGT equations of third type, of third order in time, and which is something that we also largely justified rigorously. Largely justified rigorously. So these are the two equations that are based either on using the law number one or law number two. Okay, and then going to law number three, this one is a different because the leading term is of integer order. And also later on in terms of the analysis, this meant that we can mimic to a certain extent the analysis of the integer model. Of the integer model. And then finally, this is the last one. So, GFie law. So, here again, we have the fractional leading term, and then one of these two contains a fractional derivative. Okay, so these are the equations that are of the Kostantov type. And then, because they resemble the JMGT model, but they're fractional, we kind of denote them for short F JMGT. And then the number corresponds to the number. And then the number corresponds to the number of the original fractional heat flux law. And then, of course, these can be simplified as before. So we can go from their Kuznetsu versions to their Vastavalt versions. And I only highlight here the two models, two nonlinear models, because I will talk about them in the analysis. So the one based on the heat flux. So, the one based on the heat flux law number one, and the one based on the heat flux law number three. And they will require a different approach in the analysis because the leading term is different. So we have either an integer order term or here the fractional order term. Compared to how the equations were written before, where my nonlinearities were on the right-hand side, I took the time derivative of the nonlinear term. The nonlinear term, and then I group together the terms containing second time derivatives. So, this is why this blue thing pops up here now. And this also hints at some challenges in the analysis. So, once we go to a variational form, weak form of the problem, we will have triple products involving psi t and psi tt. So, to sort of handle these nonlinearities, we will need sufficient smoothness of our Uh, sufficient smoothness of our potential, so we will need the side t to be in L infinity space, which we sort of resolve by going to an H2 regularity and then using an embedding. All right, so I would now like to talk about the well-posedness analysis of these equations, and I will mostly focus on these two. And I will mostly focus on these two non-linear equations that were highlighted in the previous slide. And then I will briefly touch upon linearization of one of the models based on the law number two. So before I go into that, I just want to acknowledge that there has been really a large body of work on these higher order and time integer order models in acoustics. So this family of JMGT equations in the last In the last 10 plus years, a lot of interest has been really shown in these types of models, and really many interesting results have been obtained. In the last couple of years, also JMGT equations with sufficiently nice memories, memories with smooth kernels, have also gained some attention. And there are also quite a few important works in this direction. And then, of course, I should also mention the analysis of the fractional. The analysis of the fractional Westerlt equation, which is a relatively recent, important result. So, these, of course, can all serve and did serve as an inspiration for our work as well. So, in terms of the actual well-poses analysis, so this is my equation, one equation with the leading term that is of integer order. So, we have a third. Is of integer order, so we have a third order in time as the leading term in our wave equation, a non-linear wave equation. And we consider it in a relatively simple setting with homogeneous Euriclidata. And then we have a third order in time equation, so we have three initial conditions. So the strategy in obtaining local well-positions is to be expected. So we Expected. So we consider a linearization, a suitable linearization. And then we want to combine it with a fixed point approach. And in particular, what we used is the Banach's fixed point theorem. So the question is, how to linearize the equation? Well, here we essentially replace this 2k psi t term by a function sigma, and this function should be nice enough. I will go into that on the next slide. And so then we want. slide and so then we want to end up with a linearization which is nice but this is still a linear but so frack of course fractional time fractional equation but now with a variable coefficient so a coefficient that varies in space and time but still it is a it is linear so it makes our job a bit easier and then after hopefully obtaining results for that we can combine it with contraction. It with contraction principle. Let me just mention that this will be the solution space for the acoustic velocity potential for psi. And here is this spatial regularity that I already hinted at. So H2 in space. So this is just H2 intersected by H01. So we incorporate the boundary conditions. And this relatively high regularity in space of psi is needed because, and psi t as well is needed. Because and psi t as well is needed because we want to kind of have a control of the L infinity norm of this psi t term in our analysis. So to be able to sort of tame the nonlinearities in the equation. So in terms of the analysis, and yeah, I should also say that we added a sort of a general right-hand side source term. Hand side source term to our equation compared to how it was derived. So the analysis follows by Fyendo-Galerkin semi-discretization in space based on the eigenrexters of the Dirichlet Laplacian and follows largely by energy arguments. So the central point of the proofs are actually the energy estimates for the semi-discrete. Estimates for the semi-discretization uniform energy estimates, and this is regularity that we assume of our sigma. And the sigma is sort of a placeholder for our psi t up to a constant. And so this is something that we should at least get from psi t in our in terms of regularity in our linear proof. Okay, and then in the semi-discrete system. The semi-discrete system, we should also, of course, prove that it is well-posed, and there we need to use the Voltaire integral theory due to the fractional term. So in terms of the test functions that one uses, well, if we had just a standard wave equation of second order, we would go to test function would be side t. But because here we are working with an equation of third order, the canonical test function. Third order, the canonical test function is actually psi tt, so the second derivative with a second derivative with respect to time. Um, and of course, now working with the non-linear and fractional models, the challenge is in the fact that our test functions are limited, so our choice of test functions is limited compared to the analysis of nonlinear integer order models. Um, and uh, yeah, this is what uh Yeah, this is what makes the energy analysis delicate and tricky. So, this is an example of let's say an intermediate estimate that one gets when we test with psi TT. Of course, this is at first in a semi-discrete setting. And this is not enough. So when working with these nonlinear acoustic models, let's say more involved testing is needed to arrive at a higher order balance with respect to Bounds with respect to space. So, this H2 regularity that I mentioned now already twice means that it is not enough to just test with site AT, but we have to involve also a test function of this type, so involving a Laplacian. So, assuming that this works out, then we want to employ a binax fixed point theorem, and now we want to sort of map our omega to our solution sign. To our solution of the nonlinear problem, and this omega is taken from a ball in this space that was written out on one of the previous lines, okay, with the radius r, and of course our initial conditions should hold. So this is then the statement of the theorem, assuming that we have checked the conditions of the Banas fixed point theorem. point theorem. And yes, so these are the assumptions, the regularity assumptions on our data. And for sufficiently small time, so locally in time, we can show that our original problem, so the nonlinear FJMGT3 equation has a solution, a unique solution, and furthermore, in this space, and then furthermore, it satisfies this kind of energy bound in terms of the Bound in terms of the right-hand side source term, and then, of course, the initial data. So, this was the equation that has the leading derivative that is of integer order. And now I want to sort of contrast that with the analysis of the equation that has a fractional leading term. And there I take this equation that was. And there, I take this equation that was based on the first flux law of Comte and Metzler. And again, I consider it with our general right-hand side term, the source term, and with homogeneous Diraclet eta. And in our analysis, we need and assume that alpha is here larger than one-half. And this somehow aligns with what is observed in this numerical paper by Zhang, Kai, and Holm. Chi and Hall, where they also noted that the original flux law behaves well if alpha is in this range. So, in terms of the strategy in obtaining local well-posings, we want to mimic again the previous setting of considering a linearization combined with Banach's fixed-point theorem. And we replace this 2k psi t by sigma. So, sigma is for a moment the placeholder for that term. Placeholder for that term, and we go back to analyzing our linear time fractional wave-like equation that is written here. And here is now my solution space. So, alpha figures, of course, here in all terms. And of course, here again, we have the spatial regularity h2. So, this is still needed for For proving well poses into non-linear original nonlinear problem. So, again, we want to use a Fayedo-Galerkin semi-discretization space. However, the difference now is that we need also to assume that this variable coefficient sigma is small enough. So, we will assume that this bound in the space, so this is the space for sigma, that this row is small enough. Is small enough. And let me try to show you why this is needed. So here, testing is a bit more creative. So this is a test function that we use. So again, this Laplacian comes from needing, let's say, higher spatial regularity to tackle the nonlinear terms in the fixed point arguments. And then here we replace what was previously side tt by such a term. So formally, if alpha would be. A term. So formally, if alpha would be one, we would be in the sort of integer order setting that we expect. So this is sort of a check of being on the right track. At some point in the proof, we have to estimate the term of this type, so sigma multiplied by psi dt, and this pops up on the right-hand side. And so by Catapont's inequality, we can sort of estimate it as a product of sigma and pseudo. Products of sigma in suitable norms and psi tt. And so, because these terms pop up on the right-hand side of our energy estimates, we need to use that sigma is small enough so that we can so that these psi terms can be absorbed by what we have on the left-hand side in our estimates. So, this is somehow, roughly speaking, where the smallness of sigma comes from and is needed. And this is an example of, or this is the resulting bound that one gets. Of course, this is again first in a semi-discrete setting, so we have to justify that via the relatively usual weak compactness arguments that a similar bond holds also for the solution of the linear problem with the variable coefficients. But the dead part sort of works as one. But that part sort of works as one would expect. And then, this is again the statement. So, this is the statement of the theorem for the nonlinear problem that corresponds to the flux law number one. So, as I said, we need our alpha to be larger than one half. And here, due to the smallness of sigma, what this sort of translates to in the fixed point proof is that we need the smallness of our data. So the statement is slightly different compared to what we had before. Different compared to what we had before, where we assumed the smallness of time. So, here we really need the smallness of our data. And provided this holds, then our initial boundary value problem for the F JMJT1 equation is well posed in the sense of having a unique solution in the solution space and psi satisfying a bound as written here. And I also want to briefly discuss whether the equations can be restated in a different form. So if they can be reduced to wave equations with memory. And in fact, they can, but the question is whether the resulting equations are then, yeah, whether they offer an easier path. Whether they offer an easier path to analyzing them or not. This turns out to be the case for one model, so the model that was based on the second law, second flux law by Comte and Messler. So we can reduce the equation to a second-order wave equation if we introduce this new unknown set that combines psi and then the fractional derivative of psi. And this is also an idea that is used in the James. idea that is used in the JMGT model, so an integer order model, to reduce it to a second order wave equation. And so if we do it for the, we can do it for all fractional nonlinear equations that we derived, but only in the case of GFE2, it kind of reduces to something that we can analyze. So it is a wave equation of second order. Then it has a non-local term. non-local term and with such a kernel that is sort of success success is relatively let's say that fits into the the the known analysis frameworks so in the case of the gfe2 law such an equation of this type have been analyzed in the literature so we could sort of extrapolate from their results okay so this is of course in the linear Okay, so this is, of course, in the linear case. So this is a linearization, a linear wave equation that we reformulated. As I said, it is possible also for other linearizations. However, it is not clear whether the involved kernels are sufficiently nice to fit into the well-poseness result available in the literature. And in particular, the result that we used here is the one by Canarsa and Swarsa. And then it can be directly applied to our Z equation. Can be directly applied to our Z equation, so Z reformulation of the linear problem. And so the result gives well poseness, so in a sense of existence of a unique mild solution to the equation, a solution giving Z in such a solution space. And then from there, we can sort of conclude that using the relation between psi and Z, we can The relation between psi and z, we can conclude properties of our psi as well. So, existence and uniqueness with certain regularity. All right, so this was a little bit about the well-poseness analysis for the non-linear models and a little bit about how linear models, at least in About how linear models, at least in one case, can be reformulated into something that is known and studied before, has been studied before. And then in the sort of last part of my talk, I would like to discuss how we can relate these fractional models to their integer order counterparts. And I also, at the end, want to discuss a bit about some future research topics. Research documents. So, what we want to do essentially is we want to characterize the limit as alpha goes to one. So, because if alpha goes to one, then we are back at these J and G T equations that have been well studied in the literature. And we would like to, yeah, we wanted to study this process rigorously. So, essentially, we want to define or we need Want to define, or we need uniform balance of our acoustic potential with respect to alpha, which were largely there due to our energy analysis. So somehow our energy analysis is the key piece in these results as well. So provided that we have this, roughly speaking, what we would want to do, we would look at the solutions of the fractional models and then the solutions of their integer order counterparts. integer order counterparts. And here I first write it for this for this equation here. So their difference then solves an equation of this type, right? So the difference now is denoted by psi bar. So psi bar solves a wave equation that has an integer order. Equation that has an integer-order leading term. And so we just test it here with psi tt. And what we want to get is a convergence in the energy norm for the third order in time model. So this can be understood as that. So what appears on the left-hand side of this first bond. Okay, and on the right-hand side, we get this difference, and we would want it to go to zero. So we need sort of a left-side continuum. A left side continuity of the fractional term because our alpha here goes to one. And so, for that reason, we need to assume that our function here, our psi t, is zero at zero. So, if that is the case, so if we have condition psi one being zero, then we can show that this limit is indeed zero, and then we obtain the convergence that one expects. And this proposition more or less states that. So we assume that the assumptions in the Wall Posen's theorem are satisfied. And then additionally, we need that our initial condition for site t is equal to zero. And then the families of the solutions of the fractional models converge to the solution. Models converge to the solution of the integer order model with respect to this energy norm that's tailored to the third order in time equation as alpha goes to one minus. In other words, we get convergence and this space here. So, what changes if we have the equation? The equation based on the complete Manzaur law number one. So we have this FJMGT1 equation. Well, we sort of follow the same approach. So we look at the solutions to the fractional models, which we proved exist and have certain nice properties. And then we look at the solution to the corresponding integer order model. And of course, also then the add to difference. The difference. And again, we rely on the energy methods in the analysis. So we want to test. And previously, we tested with a psi bar that has this second time derivative. So now we, okay, this t here is extra. So here it should be one plus alpha psi bar that we test with. And we get the convergence again. However, here it turned out that we Here it turned out that we need a bit more regularity from our integer order model than what is obtained under the sort of corresponding assumptions on the initial data. So here we need to assume a bit more regularity on psi. Such results are available in the literature if one assumes even more regularity of initial conditions in the JMGT model, but likely this can be. But likely, this can be optimized. So, likely, one would be a bit pessimistic there. So, under this additional regularity assumption on the solution to the integer order model, we can again show that our solutions to the fractional models converge to the solution of the integer order models in the space that we denoted here by x low. So, in this way, we managed to. So in this way, we managed to relate the models that we derived, so the fractional models, to the ones that were circulating in the literature, so the JMJT equations. So from here, there are further interesting studies to be done, and I would like to, at the end, At the end, discuss two of them. So the four fractional laws of Compton Metzler can, in fact, also be reframed. So they can be reformulated into the so-called Girtin-Pipkin framework, where our heat flux vector is then expressed in this form. So we have again a non-local behavior. However, now this kernel will depend. Now, this kernel will depend on the thermal relaxation time. So, here it depends on tau. And one can see what this is for each of the four fractional laws. So, these kernels are now of metaglefloor type. So, for example, here for if we have the first fractional of content meter, the kernel would be given by such an expression. Given by such an expression. And so the question is: what happens if we reformulate the laws in such a way? So, what kind of wave equation one ends up with and how do these two approaches relate? And this is sort of an ongoing work also with Margaret. And the resulting equations would then be of second order in time, but they will have a damping. They will have a damping terms that have such kernels involved. So, again, related to this, let's say, delta diffusivity term. And of course, then the question is also how they behave and if we can show well posedness and so on, and the relation to the approach by Compton Metzler. So, this is one So, this is one kind of topic of study that is worth pursuing further. And then another one is related to, of course, the thermal relaxation time. So I already mentioned before that for integer order models, it is possible and it has been done to rigorously justify this limit as the relaxation time tends to zero to the so-called class. To the so-called classical models of nonlinear acoustics. And so it would also be, of course, interesting and important to do the same for our fractional JMGT equations. And the interesting thing is that if one, at least not formally, just formally takes tau to zero, we obtain the fractional, what one may call fractional Westeral or fractional Kuznsov equations. And these do a And these do appear in the literature based on using a fractional pressure density relation. So, somehow from a different modeling point of view, at least for the West-Weld equation. What would be new here and interesting is that these sort of Kuznets of nonlinearities, so with the fraction, with the quadratic gradient term on the right-hand side, have not been derived before. And so, this would be also from a modeling point of view. From a modeling point of view, I think an interesting aspect to consider. So, this is also something that we want to do. So, justify the vanishing tau limits in our fractional models. And of course, also using this Grotin-Pupkin approach, one way thing to try to do the same, where one has a tau-dependent kernel. So with this, I would like to thank you very much for listening to my talk.
