Great workshop and for giving me the opportunity to speak. And also, thank you all for coming. I'm happy to report about this joint work with Patricio Gallardo, Gregory Pearlstein, and Zhang Jiang. And as the title suggests, my talk would be very much complementary to what on the first day Julie and just yesterday Rita talked about. So for this purpose, I need to review a few of the things that they already talked about. Things that they already talked about, but you know, with the intent of setting up appropriate notations and to also set up the context of the mean results. So, to start, let's quickly review what do we mean by a Horikawa surface, which will usually denote by S. And so this is a smooth projective. Projective connected surface, which we take over the complex numbers. This will be of general type, and it is such that a few numerical invariants are satisfied. So we want the irregularity q to be zero and the geometric genius to be equal to k squared over two plus two. This is over 2 plus 2, this is when k squared is an even number, or ks squared over 2 plus 3 over 2. And so those describe infinitely many families of surfaces of general type, which lie on the Nature's line or very close to it. So we are at the boundary of the universe of surfaces of general type. And today we will focus will focus on the case where Ks squared is equal to 1, which forces the geometric genus to be equal to 2 as a consequence. And those are precisely the surfaces that Rita introduced, the I surfaces. So I'll call them this way, or if I simply say Horikawa surfaces, it's understood. Surfaces, it's understood that I'm referring specifically to those. And it turns out that they have a very explicit and nice geometry. So they have a very explicit geometric realization. So if S is one of those surfaces, and if you look at the linear system induced by twice the canonical class, this gives a very This gives a very nice morphism down to the weighted projective plane P112, and this is going to be a degree 2 map because possibly some curves get contracted. And if you want to resolve this, you can factor this morphism through the canonical model S C. So this is going to be the canonical model. What does it mean that the linear system gives you a map of P1, 1, 2? system gives you a map to p112 so yeah you need to take two dates so like the image is a p112 p3 it's a quadricone exactly you map down to the quadricone in p3 yeah okay thank you and so you can factor this map through the canonical model which has 80 singularities 80 singularities and we contract a bunch of curves We contract a bunch of curves so that the canonical class becomes ample. And I think you should remove the minus before the canonical class. Oh, that's absolutely right. So let me make a bullet list. Thank you, Tom. And so this diagram for newts. And the map here, it's a two-to-one map, finite. And the great advantage of this is that we can write SC in a Can write SC in a single line as the. Oh, well, before I do this, I want to clarify that as this is a covering map, you can ask what's the branch divisor. That's what I should say first. And this turns out to be the vanishing of a homogeneous polynomial of degree 10 in the variables x, y, and z, where x has degree 1, y has degree 1, and z has degree 2. and c has degree 2. The advantage of this, as I was saying, is that we can write Sc as the vanishing of W squared minus 10 of X Y Z, where now this lives in the weighted projective space P1125 as the hypersurface, and W is of degree 5, so everything is nice and homogeneous of degree 10. Okay, so those are fairly nice surfaces. Those are fairly nice surfaces, and so it's very natural to study their moduli. And by work of Dieseker, we know that there exists a projective course, module S space, which I will denote by MH, which parameterizes all Which parameterizes all possible isomorphism classes of the canonical models S C. So parameterizing all, let me just simply write this way, all possible S C's. Quasi-projective. Oh yeah, apologize. Thank you. Quasi-projective. Otherwise, my talk would be over. Thank you. And as it was already mentioned, And as it was already mentioned by Rita yesterday, this is a fairly high-dimensional moduli space. Because, so if you want to count parameters, you can first count the monomials of degree 10 in P112. It's 36 of them. Then, when you have an equation, you can consider it up to projective scaling. And then you can subtract the dimension of the automorphism group of P11. Group of P112, which here is acting on the whole situation. And this is seven-dimensional. So if you put everything together, you get 28. So this is a fairly big moduli space. And the focus today is to continue the discussion about compactifications of an A. About compactifications of MH. So, how about compactify MH? Okay. And there are some different reasons why you would want to pursue this, which go beyond the intrinsic difficulty of the problem, because this is a big space. And some of those were already outlined by Rita, and I'll just repeat a few of them. A few of them. So, how about the relevance of this? So, when talking about compactifications, there are some kind of standard tools that we like to use. And some classical methods of compactifying a moduli space include the so-called Bailey-Borel and toroidal compactification techniques, which in this case, they're not available because the period domain is not Hermitian symmetric. The period domain is not Hermitian symmetric. So the classical Bay Liborel, Bay Liborel and toroidal compactification do not apply. Those are the ones that we like to use in the context of moduli of a principally polarized. moduli of a principally polarized abelian varieties or polarized K3 surfaces. And because of this, this is motivation for work of work of Green Griffith Lazar and Robo. and robots and work of Kato and Kusui that want to generalize those techniques in the non-Romission symmetric case. And the case of Y-surfaces is really the very first test case where you would want to work. At the same time, there are also other classical, if you want, compactification methods that you can consider. And so every time Consider. And so every time you have an explicit equation and there is an algebraic group mapping on it, you should think about geometric invariant theory, right? And so today we will also play around with a GIT compactification. And as you know, when you do GIT, there are some choices involved. And so to be specific, I'm referring to the GIT setup of Gavin Guen, which you can find in a preprint on the archive. Which you can find in a preprint on the archive back in 2021, where it has a nice setup where you can reduce this GIT from a non-reductive GIT, because this is a non-reductive algebraic group, to a reductive one. So let me just tell you, give you a few pointers about this. So first, you need to understand that you can put this equation in what he calls a normal form. So you can write it as W. So you can write it as w squared minus z to the fifth minus, then there should be like the term z to the fourth, right, with some coefficient. We skip that. So there is z cubed, and here there is a polynomial in x and y, which I needed to be of degree 4, so that this has degree 10. And then you keep going all the way down until you hit the power. Let me write this more clearly. Yeah, better. When you hit z to the zero power, so I have q ten, x and y equal to zero. And as you can see, you have an action of G L 2 here by linear change of variables in x and y. And what David Gwen shows is that those orbits are in bijection with isomorphism classes. Bijection with isomorphism classes of the colour surfaces. And so you could consider as GIT the quotient of the space of coefficients. If you count, there are 36 of them. Of course, you need to take an appropriate open subset, modded out GL2. So just to give an idea of the GIT setup, you see. GL2. GL2, because there is GL2 because there is some okay, because it's not. You could, what you could do is you can then quotient by the torus. And so you get a weighted projective space. And you quotient by PGF2. But then you can use SL2, and so you can reduce it to an SL2 quotient of a weighted projective space. Yes. Yes. It's specific of this case. Is the stack is isomorphic to the actual stack version of A36 by 2? Oh, I don't know. I wouldn't know. Let's see if I can. So I don't think there is any remark about this, but not that I know of. I'm sorry. Because sometimes you need to act not by the weights that you see, but also multiply by the term. C, but also multiplied by the term. That's important. Well, here, when uh if you're talking about the weights of the torus action, no? I'm talking about the weights, how GL2 acts so that we get the model space of surfaces as a global portion. Oh, like the action, I was specifying it by change of variables here, x and y. That doesn't answer your question. Okay. Yeah. It's 32, not 36. It's 32, not 36. Yeah, oh, thank you. Oh, I was about to ask you about the dimension number. Oh, yeah, thank you for catching it. It was 32 or minus. Okay. So you're saying that he proved that if you do the non-reductive GITV, that would get this quotient, or you're saying not in the reductive GITV. You're not doing this. Yeah, so you would get a different boundary. No, I mean, he's only saying the small. No, I mean I mean he's only saying the smooth locals. Yeah, so the small part, the the reduction part, exactly. And so this thing that you write is just yeah. Anyway we don't need it we will not need it much. It's just to give an idea you know of the fact that we use you know this version of GIT with this action and okay. But the linearization is we should linearize. Yeah yeah but that's not yeah but there is an explicit linearization. There is an explicit linearization that you can find, yes. That you can find, yes. But I didn't mean to get too much into the details of it. I just wanted to point out the form and that it becomes a reductive jet. And the way it works is already changing. Yeah, I mean, exactly. Yeah. But then if you want to do the thing that Radu asked, if you want to go to the weighted projector space and get an SL2. Okay, yeah, no, but I don't know. Yeah. And there is a. Okay. Okay. Enough of GIT. Another perspective that you can consider, and that will be the center of today's attention, is the PSB compactification, the colar shipper baron. And Alexander compactification by stable surfaces. And recall that by stable means two things. It means that the singularity are not too bad, semi-loc canonical, and that the canonical class is ample. That the canonical class is ample. Okay. And we want to study this compactification, especially because what happens with GIT is that the boundary tends to be quite singular, it could be not the Versailles, and therefore, it can acquire singularities. And so that's why we want to study this because also strong of the experience that we have with the model. Of the experience that we have with the modular space of curves with MGMY. That has a nice boundary structure. And as we already saw in Nanita's talk, a lot of work has been done about this. And so I would like to recall a few, a little bit of this work that has been done. Actually, I'm just going to refer to this as an H-bar for simplicity. And so the results that I'm about to recall are due to different combinations of the following names. So Stephen Kaflin. Marco Franciosi, Rita Bardini, Giuliana, and Zambia Rolenske. And I want to start by first making a little clarification about MH bar. So on the one hand, we have curvy M bar one three, which 1, 3, which parametrizes all possible stable surfaces such that the square of the canonical class is 1 and the other characteristic of the structure sheaf is 3. And they showed that this is reusable. And it has at least two irreducible components. One is mh-bar, also referred to as the Giesecker component, and another component, mbaru, which parameterizes the Ranauzua surfaces, which are generically not smoothable. So, I'm focusing on this Giesinger component today. Can I make a comment? It's generally safer to fix the whole Hilbert polynomial and or or all the Pluy genera, because otherwise, I mean, there's another component, but the second Pluy genus is different. which uses different. So it would be safer to. We also don't do it, but it would be safer not to not to allow the components that really have different compiler known which has different segmentary lists. Are there small points on that? No. Second floor, I mean Riemann Rock into the second progenitions. So it's only half a second. But that one is not even connected to this one. No, it can't be connected because the progenitor is interested in, but it's in the details. I see, I see. Okay. And you can describe a few of them. Generic only. Okay, thank you for mentioning. And so the second result that I want to mention is that Frances, Pardini, and Lenski give a full description of a reasonable intermediate locus that sits in between MH and MH bar. MH bar which can denote by MH Gore, which parametrizes Gorenstein stable surfaces. And this may or may not be normal, but one thing is that those are all irreducible. So I'm going to write it as a note here. Those are irreducible. Lastly, I would like to recall also that altogether they were able to identify three boundary divisors, D1, D2, and D3 inside of MH bar. Those are boundary divisors. And those generically parametrize Stable surfaces with a unique cyclic quotient singularity so with ink which is Which is cyclic, which is ocean similarity. And those were like a 4.1, 1 18th, 15, and 125th, 114. And within this framework, I can now state what are the main results. So, to be able to do so, I first need to introduce some singularities. So, let's consider the following Uh unimodal non-locanonical singularities so those go under the name of E twelve E thirteen E fourteen Z eleven Z twelve Z12, Z13, and W12, W13. Okay, so those are eight, right? So first of all, what is modality? So that is an invariant that you can use to study singularities and roughly counts the number of parameters that the singularity has. So for instance, 80 singularities. For instance, AD singularities have modality zero, simple elliptic singularities have modality one, which by the way, those are parametrized by this, mh core. However, those simple elliptic are log canonical, so we want to look at the non-law canonical ones. So for this, we use, we look at the work of Arnold, where he gives a complete, he gives a complete He gives a complete classification of those singularities of modality one from which you can read off the non-local canonical ones. And among those, we select those eight because they can be easily realized as by a degree 10 hyper surface in P1125. So that's how we find them, basically, from our nodes list. So uh two questions before you. Is it known that MHQ orange thing is the parameter? means to parameterize the stable GIT I think yeah I think so like th this parameterizes GIT stable in the sense yeah GIT stable in that sense yes and these are also stable or stable stable uh-huh I'm gonna make uh I'm gonna make a remark about this uh but what we will see is that GIT theoretically are stable in this you know with that GIT and I'll also mention it So in the first part we say that for any sigma as above so I'll use sigma to denote just one of those eight singularities like this no more singularities or like normal singularities. Yeah, so they don't appear in the double curves, okay? They're in the internal They're in the interior. Yeah. But they're not KSBA. No, they're non-local canonical. So they're bad. I mean, they replace them. Exactly. So this will be clear. Exactly. Yeah. So like, of course, I will not say that. So what I wanted to say is that for any sigmas above, there exists a d sigma contained in an h bar boundary divisor. This d sigma is nu, it's different from d1, d2, and d3. And generically parametrizes surfaces. Of course, I'm not going to say that they have one of those singularities because this is impossible. I'm going to specify what surfaces they parametrize. So, generically, parametrize. Parametrizing reusable surfaces as follows. So, as was also noted in Rita's talk, so in the very first, one of the very first examples that Rita showed us was a stable surface parameterized by this moduli space, which is given by the glue. Modulized space, which is given by the gluing of two K3 surfaces along a P1 with five A1 singularities. So, in the same spirit, those boundary divisors parametrize stable surfaces that also break into two surfaces. Okay? So, let's see more in detail how they look like. So, a cartoon for it, just to have a picture in mind, could be the following one. I will call one surface A. One surface A, the other surface B, and the curve along which they're glued is isomorphic to P1 in each case. Now let me tell you a bit more about the geometry of the two pieces. They are K3s. They are K3s. Okay, most of them. So A is an AD. An 80 K3 surface in weighted projective space. And as we know from Miles Reed, there are finitely many ways to do this, namely 95, and those recover eight of the 95 families of Miles Reed. So those are eight out of five. So, those are eight out of the ninety-five of reads families. I mean, playbooks, though, is not familiar. Yeah, exactly. I wanted to specify hybrid surface. Yeah, thank you. Because otherwise you could have intersection of two also. You really mean way that with three space. Yeah. Projective. Yeah, three space also. Thank you. Three space. So, you do it in 95 possible ways. Those are A family leaves. And I also want to mention that A depends on... So you also want to count parameters. Oh, before that, I also want to mention that those recover the full families. So if you fix one of those eight families, it's not that you just get some. Family is not that you just get some, you get the full family in the voided projective space. And in particular, you can compute that A depends on a number of parameters which is equal to the Miller number of the singularity minus two. So for example, if sigma is E twelve, the Milner number of E twelve is twelve, and so the A depends on ten parameters. A depends on 10 parameters. The story for B, it's a little bit more involved. So we can show that H1 of the structure sheaf of B is equal to 0, H1, H2 of the structure sheaf of B is equal to 1. And we compute And we compute all possible values of k b squared. Okay, this is a list of eight values, which you can find in the paper. I will not list them because I don't need to. And also, you can count the number of parameters of v, which if you want to cheat, you know you want to get 27, right? So it's going to be 29 minus mu, right? So I will, but I'll write it. So it depends on. On 29 minus mu sigma parameters. But then, of course, you would like to know more, like, sure, all this, but what is this surface B? And what we were able to show is that if E is biorational to an ADE K3 surface in weighted projective space P113. So I'm talking about double covers of P2's branched along a sextic, uh twenty eighty three here, if we have that sigma is either of text Z or W. Type Z or W. So in five out of the eight cases. The birational transformation that we use simply doesn't need anything if we use it in the E series. And so we left that unanswered in the paper. And yes. In your moduli, is there any moduli for sort of the choice of P1 in these? Is this so? Once you've got your A, is there like a unique P1? Got your A, is there like a unique P1 or is there specific stuff? Yeah, the P1 does not contribute to the moduli count. So that, so it's simply like the number of parameters of A. So your A has got like a unique P1 in it. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Which also comes like... Oh yeah, like the way I think is that it comes with like three distinct markings. This one. So no, no, but and but the P1 whatever is kind of one of the special lines of the we did we take space. Lines in the weighted projective space of the stable. So you get a K3, but it's in a weighted projective space, and kind of the rule in is one of the special yeah. So there's no moduli for the choice of that. Exactly, not just this specific thing. Yeah. So wait, so in the E case the answer is that you don't know if it's a K or Exactly. And but I can tell a little bit more just for since last week. Since last week. Okay, so then you want to know about the E's, right? And just last week, there was a paper on the archive by Pearlstein with Chris Peters about hypersurfaces with amplitude one in weather projected space. And if you use their results, you can identify. You can identify P if sigma is equal to E13. And what we can say is that it is birational to a hypersurface with amplitude 1 in greater projective space, and it's elliptic. So, a little bit more. Okay. So this is the as far as the main theorem, this is the end of the statement for the clarify that. Yeah, Rita's example is ex okay. So maybe I'll get there naturally. How about that? Okay, but I will have an answer to that. To that. So, those are the results that concern the ASBA compactification, but we also talked about the GIT compactification. And it's nice to understand how they are in relation with each other. So, first off, you have the identity on the two moduli spaces, or the identity. Spaces, the identity in the interior of the two moduli spaces, which sits here and there. And what we can show is that this rational map, this birational map, extends to a dense open subset of D sigma mapping. Mapping to orbits of stable parts. So, somehow, if you look at those degenerations with the classes of geometric invariant theory, they're stable. And the geometric interpretation of this extension is that the extension takes the point parametrizing this surface and forgets about x. This surface and forgets about A. So D1, D2, D3 are already stable? You have the D sigma, but also D1, D sigma. Ah, yes, they are. Yes, yeah. And this is also there. You should put stable points with the simulating sigma or something. Oh, yeah. Stable points parametrizing a surface with. Yeah. A surface. A surface with a singularity of pi sigma. Yes. And the interpretation of this math is that you forget about k, and on top of that, you can count the relative dimension of this extension, which is given by mu2 minus 2, which also gives you an idea of how much you contract. Also, gives you an idea of how much you contract the boundary going from KSVA to GIT. The last part of the main theorem is related to the Hodge theory of those degenerations. And what we can say is that those surfaces have pure Pure limit mixed Hodge structure. So also from the point of view of Hodge theory, they're in some sense in the interior. And very quickly, the reason for this is mainly because the H1 of O of A equals H1 of O of B. H1 of B, which are both equal to one, and oh yeah, H2. Sorry, I meant to say H2 is equal to one, and PG of Hasbut Horikawa is equal to two. And since the two pieces end up to one, you can use some result of Morrison that allows you to conclude that. It's this numeric that makes you say. You say that is a pure limit mixed out structure. And so, this is the end of the statement of the main theorem. I also want to mention what is in progress. We're looking into modality 2, so modality 2, and we're still running it, but running a very similar analysis. Running a very similar analysis, looking again at Arnold's paper and selecting appropriately which singularities we want to study, we can, this yields five more boundary divisors. Can you clarify what you mean by pure limit mix R structure? You mean like limits of pure hard structure as a variety as a limit structure? I mean, what I mean is, you know, like, you know, you have a degenerate variety, and so you have a limit-mixed Hodge structure, you know. Right, just that I never heard of a pure mixage. Oh, because it's like, you know, is the pure Hodge structure is the one that, you know, for example, if you have a smooth variety, is the Hodge decomposition. No, no, but okay. So you mean mixed Hodge structure is pure? That's what you meant. I see. I see and definition for IC. Okay, so there is a definition for Linux structure, I guess. No, for Linux structure to be open. Okay. Yeah. I see. Exactly. Well, that's pretty cool, I see. That's surprising. Okay. And despite the fact that it breaks. And what did I want to say? Ah, and but the thing that makes this trickier, which doesn't become just an appendix of this, is because in this modality, Appendix of this is because in this modality 2 business, it is harder to identify the surfaces, especially the A part. Because what happens is that here A sits as a hypersurface of amplitude zero. And so, okay, it's a K3. I don't have to think. But what we observed in those cases is that it sits as a hypersurface of positive amplitude. And so may or may not be a K3. It could still be. Oh, I should repeat that. So amplitude, when you are. I should repeat that. So, when you have a hypersurface in weighted projector space, amplitude is the difference between the degree of the hypersurface and the weights of the projective space. And so, since it's not zero, it's harder to identify, you need some tricks. Anyway, in some cases, we can still see a K3 plus K3 type of degeneration in some cases. So in some cases. In some cases, we can still see K3 plus K3 time. But none of the, like in those cases that I'm referring to, they don't include the N16 singularity. N16 is the one that gave Rita's example with the 5K3s and the 5A1 singularities. But it's not one of those. Because the contability. N16 is modality 2, N16? I think so. Yeah, this should be. But the thing is that N16 does not give a divisor. It gives a higher co-dimensional locus. No, no, it was a high co-dimension. I see. Because that was actually my question. Why would we expect devices to keep the noise forward? I mean, in your I guess what you're saying is that in these examples you get the Is that in this example get devices? Yeah. But there is no need of get devices like that. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so let me see. I have 15 minutes and other question about the statement of the results. Because what I was planning to do to finish is to explain a little bit about how those devices. About how those divisors are constructed. And since those divisors are geometric, I can equivalently just tell you how the surfaces parametrized by it are constructed. And so we can describe the surfaces parametrized. By d sigma, at least generically, as follows. Okay, so I will do this following some sort of procedure algorithm. So the first step is to introduce a weight function for each singularity type, which is defined on the set of monomials of degree 10. Of degree 10, which is z-valued. And of course, I could just give you a list of eight-weight functions, but that doesn't really explain much. So rather, let me tell you what's the property that we wish it has. So this wave function is such that for general polynomial h of degree 10. Of degree 10 in the variables x, y, and z. If you decompose it into its negative weight part, zero weight part, and positive weight part. So if I can write h as h minus plus h zero plus h plus, so those are the monomials with negative weight and so on and so forth. And so on and so forth. Let me see, and we write it this way. Then S defined as the vanishing of w squared minus H zero plus H plus which is inside P1125. I want it to have exactly one singular point at 1000. We off type sigma. So has only one singular point. The singular point is This singular point is 1000 and this singular point is of type C. Okay. So is there a relatively simple way of how you decompose H into H minus H2 and H plus? Yeah, you need to look at the germ of the singularity. I'll give you an example at the end. Okay. Yeah, but you need to look at the singularity. That's a reasonable. Yeah, it's very expensive. Now I'll just give the general idea and then. Which means that S0, it's basically, you can think of it as a limit of smooth Orikawa surfaces, but it's the wrong limit because it has a non-log canonical singularity, right? But you know that the right limit exists because the KSBA compactification is projective. You just need to compute it. So the starting point is: okay, I need to fit as zeros the central fiber of a one-parameter family of smooth surfaces. So we need to, we got two smooth. So we need to, we got to smooth this S0. And in order to do this, I need to do the following. So say you have omega, which is the weight with respect to sigma of a given monomial m, and suppose it's negative, then let me define. Let me define t star m. We should think of t as being the deformation parameter as t to the minus omega m. So we multiply it by a positive power of t. And then I can finally define my family as curve s, as the vanishing of w squared minus t star. D star H minus plus H zero plus H plus, which lives in P1125 cross A1T. And now you can see that if you view this as a family over A1, Over a1. For t equal to 0, you recover S0 as the central fiber. So S0 sits inside of S as the central fiber. And for generic T, you have a smooth Orikawa surface. So now to compute the correct stable limit, you need Correct stable limit, you need to worry about two things. So you need to make the singularities right, and then you need to make the canonical class right, which has to be ample. So in the next step, which is step four, we take care of the singularities by performing an appropriate weighted blow-up of curvy S, which returns a central fiber, which at least is SLC. Okay? So this is an appropriate. This is an appropriate weighted low-up such that the new central fiber, which will be A union B, I will explain what A is and what B is, is semi-log canonical, where I'm using the letter A. Using the letter A to denote the exceptional divisor. Exceptional divisor. And then I'm using P to denote the strict transform of S0. Okay. And if you do this, though, you know, there is no guarantee. So, you know, there is no guarantee that what you got is stable. Actually, if I can go back to the N16 case, in the N16 singularity setting, this will not be. So you need to actually do more work. But what happens then, we check, is that in this eight singularity type suffices. So I'll write this as theorem is that A union B A union B is actually stable. Is there anything ends? Ah, yeah, I want to remind that N depends on mu sigma minus 2 plus fifty nine minus mu sigma parameters describing thus a divisor. Describing thus the visor. And so this procedure works, and I would like to give you an example to conclude. There is one thing that I would like to say before showing the example, though. So as you can see, I focus the exposition at the level of Orikawa surfaces and their degenerations and their stable replacements. But this is not really where we really work. Where we really work. Because if you go back at the beginning of the talk, those surfaces were coming from P112 and a double cover branched along a curve of degree 10, which you consider with coefficient a half. And that's rather what we work on using the theory worked out by Alexeyev and Pardini. And, you know, by first degenerating the base of the cover into toric degenerations and then reconstructing. Generations and then reconstructing the degeneration of Oricawa on the top by taking the double cover. But I did not want to highlight too much that in the exposition, but it's there. So I have five minutes, maybe I can show you an example so that you can see all those steps with numbers. So and just because it's the first one on the list, let's take E12. So the germ of the singularity is w squared equal to t cubed plus y to the seventh, which we see inside of. Receives an oh A3 with coordinates yzw, sorry for the weird choice. And the weight function, in this case, the one that works is 6 times B plus 14C minus 42. And to understand the meaning of And to understand the meaning of this, I'll make a couple of remarks. So if you ask which monomials have weight zero, you do a quick enumeration and you find that those are precisely x to the fourth, z cubed, and x cubed, y to the seventh. So somehow the weight zero monomials are responsible for the germ of the singularity. The positive weight monomials are responsible for having that. Responsible for having that S0 is only singular at that point, and then the negative weight part is responsible for the smoothing in a one-parameter family so that you don't have to do weird base changes when you do compute this table replacement. And another thing that I'd like to remark is, for the purpose of distinguishing between weight zero, positive weight, and negative weight, it's absolutely unnecessary that this function is divisible by two. function is divisible by 2. However, the reason why it's this way is because if you have that z, if you have that y as degree 6 and z as degree 14, then this will have degree 42, right? And then you can assign weight 21 to w and everything becomes nicely and homogeneous of degree 42. Okay. Then Then let's perform this blow-up. And I will not do it directly on S. I'll rather work with the ambient space in which it's contained. And we will blow up the ideal given by t to the 42, y to the 7, z cubed. Z cubed and W squared, and this will give you a new fourfold, key prime, and this will induce a blow-up of S, which embeds in here. And you will have two exceptional divisors. One is A, and the other is, so if you perform this weighted block, you will get an exceptional divisor that is a You will get an exceptional divisor that is a weighted projector space. And so the weighted projectus space that you get is going to be P1, 6, 14, and 21. And A sits inside here as a hypersurface of degree 42. So A is at degree 42 hypersurface in In here. And this weighted projective spaces will form. A is quasi-smooth, so you can use a junction. And by a junction, you have the 42 minus 1 minus 6 minus 14 minus 21 equals 0, which implies that A has to be an ADK. That A has to be an ADK3 surface. And with that, I'm done. Thank you so much. Perfect. I'll then emasculate it. Okay. Oh, not really. So I know that those get contracted, but if you ask me more about what type of blow-up you do at the level of JIT, no, we haven't looked into that, but it's a good question. But how explicit is the JT? Okay. Okay, it should read the when payment. Yeah, exactly, yeah. But it's very yes. I think that's about the intersection of the divisors that you can expect. Do you know how they do not, but that's something to study. We started to look into, well, can you realize two singularities simultaneously? Yes, no, we started to look into that. But yeah, that's definitely one of the next things to do. Yes? There is this thing called colour stability for hypersurfaces in rotated public. Exactly, this scenario happens. You improve the central fiber. It looks like what you're doing is you're looking for stable, colour, semi-stable objects. And then fixing them. Yeah, and it gives you this numerical conviction based that these stabilizer origins is a problem. But you mean to understand the blow up at the level of GIT? Oh, yeah, just to get the button beyond the remote. Yeah, exactly. Like, like, exactly. Like, this procedure seems very specific about those surfaces, but it's really not. Yeah, absolutely. And that's why also, okay, now let's do modality two. It's kind of the same machinery. Modality 2 is kind of the same machinery, but then you encounter new phenomena. That's then where the difficulty is. But absolutely, I agree with you. So let's just think about exactly what you can say. Exactly, I mean. Oh, like the basically the exceptional local kind of what's the geometry of it. So like I know it So, like, I know it. So, sorry, I didn't understand the question. Can you repeat that? D sigma are exactly exceptionally hard. Yeah. Yeah, and this is the relative dimension of the contraction. So it does not go to a point, you know, you know, because just the A part gets contracted. So you lose this many moduli. So you learn yeah maybe maybe I mean you should mention this is what's happening for caspital curves so this is exactly the same the same process when you have caspidal curves to do the replacement with an addictive table so this is exactly the the same yeah that that that's the whatever dimension to one arrow of whatever of the first has Do you have any like idea for how you might show that you found all the divisors at some point? That's a great question. And I don't so i i i in in in one way, like the way we think is like a it is kind of a path which is signed by those numerical invariants. Is signed by those numerical invariants. And another philosophy is the one of Rita Janque, where you're looking at the Cartier index, you know, to describe more and more. But I wouldn't know how to answer your question. I don't know if you have further insights on this, but it's yeah, I don't know. Your surfaces have this genus2 pencil that comes from the standard for straws or whatever. Do these degenerations in your advisors also have a genus2 pencil? Oh, I don't the genera so like the genus2 you know, whatever, genus2 uh Genus2, you know, whatever, genus2. Yeah, yeah, I don't know. I understand the question. Because the genus2 pencil is in use by the canonical class, right? And no, I don't know how that transfers, if it does, on those singular surfaces, it's the next question. Maybe there's most of the class 3 curves. Oh, genus 2 with a nodal blocker. Genus 2 including nodal curves. That's what I mean. Yeah, yeah, but and but it might be whatever. It might mean that's a little unused. Yes, but the generic point of this V sigma, I assume that the model space is smooth, right? The formation is an obstruction. Yeah, yeah, I mean, because those are high-profile stuff. They're really devices. Oh, okay. They're nothing funny. So, like, are you thinking of an extra component that kind of cuts it out? I was hoping there would be that there wouldn't be such a thing. This is the analog functions of the past. More questions? Okay, let's thank because I think Sorry for it, Dad.
