With the talk by Andrea Venturelli, is the second part of the okay, of the one about the Busman function and hyperbolic motion in the Newtonian body problem. Okay, so thank you very much and thank you to thank you. So a great thing. A great thank you to the organizer that gives me the opportunity to That gives me the opportunity to give the talk here. Yes, this is the second part of the talk about the second part. And in fact, I am a bit frustrated because after the end of the talk, I could not use the word the word book. The more the boot notes will see. Okay. So, in fact, as yesterday said, as Esther Michael said yesterday, we are interested into the M-body problem. So, the equation of motion of the n-body problem is written here. It's double dot equal to the gradient of u of x. So, in fact, Of X, so in fact, X is the n-body configuration, so R1, Rn, U is the freedom space, and U is the Newtonian is the Newtonian potential of Mi Mj divided by the motor distance of i. And we are interested in hyperbolic motion, okay, so. The solution of this M-barger problem such that is equal to t times h not of e where A is a This configuration without the collision. So I can say that the configuration is without collision when two modular distance are not electing place and this is equivalent to the fact that the potential is so in fact that a hyperbolic motion is a pollution of the of the n-body problem such that The n-body problem such that when t goes to plus infinity, in fact, up to some term that is sublinear, what you can see is something that looks like a linear function. So it is T times the configuration with a condition. And the configuration A is called the mean shape of the The lead shape of the hydrobolic motion. So, in fact, now as we wrote yesterday, this is the energy is positive and is given by norm the square of the normal of A divided by two. Of A divided by two. And the norm is the norm with respect to the mass of scalar problem. So now I introduce again the Lagrandon action. The Lagrandon is defined in this way. And the exon. Excellent. Of the Lagrangian calculated as gamma d gamma dot of E, where gamma gamma is a curve on the configuration spaces, and every time I speak about the curve, I speak about the curve i will always assume it is an absolutely it is an absolutely continuous curve now even two contiguous controls x and y let them let us define the action potential given by the infinite of the h of gamma plus each time Let us see gamma. The interval is between the set of all absolutely continuous curve joinings x to y in some time. So the time. So here gamma is the the time need the time needed The time needed the gamma meter is point. In fact, it is the length of the interval of definition of gamma. So let us say something now about the age. So some facts about the age. So the first fact is that So the first step is that pH is a distance on the constraint space. So it's a metric. The second factor is that if x different of y, the infinite is in fact a minimum and if If gamma the curve realizes the mean then there are several factors first of all first of all gamma p is without collision for every For every heat in the interior of the interval, the fact may be due to Christian Marshall. And so, in fact, the initial and final configuration are rescued. So, in fact, if you choose X and Y configuration. Why configuration with collision necessarily we have some collision, but what the Marshall theorem says is that in the integral there are no collisions, then gamma is a solution of n-body problem. Ah, okay, sorry, I forget to say To say something, we assume that H is always positive, otherwise, it is not true with energy H. Okay. So, in fact, the very big part is this one. One you know this, all the rest is quite uh somewhere. And so, in fact, okay, now I give some definition. So, gamma, a curve, that is always assumed absolutely continuous E to be The name is minimizer for every interval, for any interval, for any second, let's say the action of gamma respectively plus h times minus k is equal to the action of the Example content just begins and then the screen. Ah, sorry, sorry, I forgot. Sorry. Okay. Not the selecting. Sorry. And uh so in fact if if this is true, so if in fact if this condition is is true, it means that on any segment, this curves, on any segment, this curves This can also realize the minimum in the definition of gamma. And in particular, once again, gamma is a solution of once again the equation of the n-body problem with energy h. H. Okay. So now I need to give again some definition. And I try to be quite synthetic. So I give some definition with some comments. With some comments inside. So the first one, so Ezekiel gave already yesterday, a continuous function u is a viscosity subsolution. So let's say. So let us say H is always assumed to be fixed of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. If for any X and Y configuration, the difference between U of X and U of Y is smaller or equal to ph the. The action potential computed between X and Y. So if it is, if the function U is one leap shift with respect to the action potential. So in fact, I prefer to say dominated function, but let's say viscosity subsolution. If u is a viscosity subsolution. A curve gamma is said to be to be you calibrating if let us say. Let us see. If in fact u of gamma A minus u of gamma B is equal to the action, no, sorry, if for any segment in E, in I, u of gamma A. U of gamma A minus U of gamma B is equal to the action of gamma restricted to AB plus A plus H times B minus H. So in fact, if yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, understand. So in fact, this is not the standard definition of calibrating curves. Usually, Usually, one take you computed in gamma B minus U in gamma A. But in this talk, I make this choice for reasons that will become clear later. And in fact, so let us remark if gamma is calibrating. Then, what you can say is that by denomination, you get that this is smaller or equal with the action potential between gamma A and gamma B. But this is by definition smaller or equal to this term. And by the calibration, this is equal to u of gamma a minus u of gamma b. So this means that all these inequalities are equality. And then in particular, what you get is that gamma is an H is an H It's an H minimizer. So when you have a calibrating curve, it is always an H minimizer. So then, okay, I continue with the definition. Uh three a viscosity so U is a viscosity solution if if it is this quality. A viscosity substitution and for any x, for any configuration x, there exists gamma u calibrating such that gamma of zero is. That gamma of zero is equal to x. So let's say, in fact, starting from x, starting from any x, there exists a eucalyptine curves. And then a last definition, and then I stop with the definition you once again. So let's say given a configuration such that norm of A is so given a collision-free configuration such that norm of H is equal to square root of norm of A is equal to square root of H, a function is an A hyperbolic Viscosity solution if you this viscosity solution and all calibrating curves. Of you are hyperbolic motion of you, yeah, sorry. Let's let us say such that, so with limit shapes given by P. So, in a sense, what happened is that let us say the direction of A is this one. Direction of A is this one, the calibrating curves always go more or less in the direction of A. In fact, now I can say a statement. So the theorem. So the theorem is that so the result that For any A for any non-collision configuration with normal three equal to square root of two H, there exists there exists an A hyperbolic, so let us say hyperbolic viscosity solution U. Moreover, to such a Haley hyperbolic viscosity solution differs from a constant. So, in fact, in fact, here there Here you have an existent statement, and here you have a uniqueness statement. So, in fact, up to an additive constant, all such hyperbolic viscosity solution are the same. And then, so Ezekiel yesterday talked about the existence part with the method of horror function. Now, Horror function. Now, I would like to give an idea of the uniqueness part of this theorem. So, in fact, what you Of you after a pal straight So, in fact, how many times do I have ten minutes? Ten minutes, okay, ten minutes. So, in fact, it is based on the following proposition. So, now before, let me introduce some notation. I denote with this symbol the cone the cone in. The cone in the configuration space with axis R plus A and angle alpha. So this is my cone and if R is positive, I just denote in this I just denote in this way the cone where I subtract to this cone the ball of radius air centered in the in the origin. So I just so this is my cone and this is what I call a what I what I call a cutted cone So, in fact, the proof is based on the following proposition. The proposition says that there exists alpha. Exist alpha and R such that for any X in the cutted cone well okay there exists a unique gamma there exists a unique curve gamma Gamma starting with at X that is a NH minimizer and the hyperbolic motion let's say with the limit figure the The limit figure with limit shapes given by A. So, in fact, okay, in this cone, from every point in this cutted cone, there exists a unique curves gamma that is an H minimizer, and it is a hyperbolic motion with limit shape A. shape A. Now, in fact, so why from this proposition from this proposition we can so I admit the proposition and then in fact a standard set So, yeah. So it is a standard fact that a viscosity solution u is almost everywhere differentiable. On omega, so on the configuration without collision and a viscosity solution, yeah, and if X is a point of differentiability. There exists a unique gamma calibrating u and starting at x and moreover let us say the gradient of a small Of small u at x is equal to the opposite of the velocity of gamma at zero. So in fact, if you need the sensibility, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And okay, and X is the point of differentiability if and only if. Differentiability if and only if there exists a unique calibrating curves starting at x. So this is gamma zero that equal to x. And in fact, the gradient of u at x is equal to the opposite of the velocity at gamma at zero. So as a consequence, you have data. Consequence, you have data to take now u and v to a hyperbolic disconnective solution. So in this cone, so So they are necessarily differentiable on the scattered cone just because, in fact, necessarily a calibrating curve of U and of V is necessarily an H minimizer and also Minimizer and also hyperbolic motion. So, and here you know there is only one starting from each point. So, you know that they are both differentiable on the score and the differential are equal for every x on the score. The differential of u is equal to the differential of d in particular. In particular, the difference is constant on the score. Now, I want to show in the last minutes that in fact the difference is constant everywhere. Et everywhere. So if eta so to do this, so let x any configuration Let us take a calibrating course Let Gamma calibrating U and starting from X. So at some time, after some time Some time. So, necessarily, gamma is a hyperbolic motion with limit shapes given by A, then necessarily, gamma after some time, it must enter definitively into this cone. So, there is some time such that gamma of t is always into this cone for every t bigger or equal than t. So, let us denote, let one. Let y equal to gamma of capital T. Then, so you know that gamma is calibrating for you. Attributing u we have that u of x minus u of y is equal to the action of gamma restricted to zero capital T plus H of capital T. At the same time, but V is dominated. Sorry, it's viscosity subsolution. Subsolution. This means that V of X minus V of Y is smaller or equal of V H of X on Y, that is smaller or equal of A gamma recipient to zero capital T plus H of T. Take the subtraction, you find that U of P you find that u of x minus v of x is now bigger or equal to u of y minus v y that is equal to c. If you repeat the same argument by taking calibrating curves with gamma, you find the converse in Find the compress inequality by exchanging Q and D, we find that okay let's mean that. SQL to see for every pix. Is it finished, or can I say just one statement without any proof? Okay, so in fact, of course, I so there is a proposition and all the difficulties are hidden in the proposition that I didn't prove. That I didn't prove. But in fact, there is a consequence of this fact, so a corollary. A corollary is that for almost every, so once again, H and the configuration A are fixed for almost every X in the. In the configuration without collision, there exists a unique curves gamma that is H-minimizer and hyperbolic with limit shapes. equal to R to A. So this means that gram of T is equal to T A plus mod of T so in fact so I will try to explain why this is true just by just by words. In fact okay so they Okay, so the existence part is tr is true for any configuration, not for almost any configuration, because in fact you know that there exists a hyperbolic viscosity solution at every point there is a calibrating curve that is H minimizer and it is a hyperbolic motion with a limit shape. Is a hyperbolic motion with limit shapes given by A. Now, the uniqueness part. So, the uniqueness part, in fact, you know that you know that when you have two A hyperbolic viscosity solutions, necessarily they differ from a constant. So, two solutions that differs from a constant are different. From a constant are differentiable exactly in the same points. And in fact, if you look at the definition of calibrating curves, if you add some constants here and some constants here, this equality still holds. So in fact, two functions that differs from a constant have the same calibrating curves. So in fact, So in fact, now you know that any such solution is differentiable almost everywhere. You take the set of full measures where it is differentiable. You know that at any point in the set, there is a unique calibrating curves that is calibrating for your function u and for any function that differs. U and for any function that differs from a constant. Now, the last step to do is to show that any such curve, any curve that is H minimizer and hyperbolic with limit shapes given by A, is calibrating for some function. But this function is what we call the Bozeman function. So at the very end, okay, the what. We can see what is the Bozeman function given gamma H minimizer and let us say A hyperbolic let us define Let us define the Boolman function say u of gamma of x that is equal to the limit for t that go to plus infinity phi h x gamma of t minus phi h of gamma zero. Gamma zero, gamma of t so we have gamma, we have x here, we take gamma of t in a sense we take the we take the distance for the metric phi h between x and gamma t, and we subtract the distance between gamma zero and gamma t. We take the limit, then u Then U gamma is a hyperbolic discoditive solution and gamma is calibrating for u gamma points. So this means that if gamma is mean that if gamma is such a curve, then it is calibrating for some A hyperbolic viscosity subsolution. And then necessarily for almost every point X, so there is a unique such course GAM. This is the end. So first does it okay so I have a comment? This is another current which is mentioned for is that that For me is that any hyperbolic motion, any hyperbolic motion becomes minimized after some time. Because if you take an in-maiser motion with some V-shape A, this will be entered in this column, and then this motion must become the gradient of the Bushman factor. Of the Gusman function, yeah, it's a defect, yeah, but um, yeah, this is true, but uh any hyperbolic motion is after some time, yeah, it's a basic way. Okay, okay, you think uh guys.
