So F is a F a finite family family of contact sets sets in R3 but sometimes in R2 on R1 as you will see soon and I say that F is intersecting is intersecting Is intersecting if A B in F implies that A intersection B is non-emptied. So this is an intersecting family of convex action free space. This is what I'm going to talk about. And the reason is for that one is a question. Is a question, question under this condition F is intersecting there is a line a line intersecting five percent of the sets In F in F or alpha times alpha times F set P in F. So this is a question. And the question is due to Martinez, Rodan, and Rubin. So the paper appeared in 2020, but the question came earlier because the papers come up later. And this is the question, and I want to have a look at similar case in dimension one and two first. So in dimension one, so F is a finite family of intersecting sets in R. Family of intersecting sets in I1 that this is intervals, intervals intercepting pairwise, and then they have a point in common by Halley theorem, if you wish, in one dimension or by choosing the rightmost left-hand point of the intervals, which has to be cut in every one. So if this is the case in R1, one. And then there is a point containing every set. Let's look at the case R2. R2. So if you project down the sets on an arbiter on the line L so this is my set A and it projects down to an interval here, A star, then these projected intervals have a point in common. Projected intervals have a point in common, right? Because they had a point in common up there. So the intervals have a point in common. So if this is the point that the line orthogonal to that, the line at that point, just intersects every single set. So then you get more than you wanted. In every direction, you have a line intersecting everybody. But this is just one side of the question. But this is just one side of the question because remember I want to have a three-dimensional set that have every two of them have points in common and I want to have a line that intersects many of them. So in this case I may want to have a point intersecting many. So this is the case where I want to have a point common to a line common to intersecting everybody and Intersecting everybody, and I may want to have a point intersecting a positive fraction. This fails quickly, because if my system is just lines in a plane, any two intersect, there is no chance for a point to hit positive fracture. Right? And there is some remedy if If you have a set in R2 and the positive fraction of the triples have a point in common, then there is a positive fraction Halli theorem that tells you that there is a point common to a positive fraction of them. But that's beyond the question here. So this is my This is my first question. This was my first question. There will be a second question soon. But I want to give a, I go to R3 now, and I want to give you an example which shows that this is going to be difficult. And the example is the same as before, the lines in three space that all lie in one single frame. In one single plane. Right? Any two of them intersect in one single point, and any line in the almost any line data plane hits every one of them. But this is a degenerate case somehow. I can modify it a little by the following trick. I built around every line a small cylinder or pipe so that these pipes still have. Show that these pipes still have pairwise intersection, but no multiple intersections. Okay? And then for any A and B, I just choose a common point of the intersection of the two pipes, any way I like. And then I replace the set A by the point that I chosen for A. I take the convex R of those points. This set of this set. This set convex sets will intersect pairwise, behave very similarly to the lines, but I don't know how to prove that there is a line hitting a positive fraction of them. So this is my second question. What happens in this case? I have complete freedom of choosing the pipes and the points, and the condition remains valid, and I don't know how to prove that there is a line hitting 1%. There is a light hitting 1% of all of them. I like this question, the original question, because it is a highly typed problem, right? It's highly typed. I guarantee some intersections, and I want to have some object that hits many of the guys. I like it because it is a fine equivariant. Affine equivariant. If I use a affinity, the intersection is not, the existence of an intersection does not change. The existence of a line, hitting many of them, does not change at all. And this is just the first step in many further questions. You have in seven dimensions convex sets that any five of them have a common line, a transverse. Common line, transversal, and then you ask whether there is a hyperplane or a three-dimensional plane heating or positive fraction of them. So this is the first question in this series, and I don't want to talk about the others. There are too many of them at the moment. This one is to be solved first. A third question is what happens if you're What happens if you're no first? If all my sets are balls, that statement is true. I leave the proof to you, but it's not difficult and usual. If all the sets are well-rounded, meaning that the inscribe ball and the out circumscribe ball have bounded radii, their ratio is bounded. The ratio is bounded, then it's again true depending on the bound on the ratio. So for Moles it is true and it is true for well rounded convex bodies, but for ellipses it is ellipsis. Ellipsoids I don't know the answer I don't know what happens in there. So three dimensions. So R3. Everything is in R3. I used just R1 and R2 for illustration. There is an example of which I will describe if I have enough time at the end, but probably I won't. A family of four and one. A family of four n convex sets so that any two of them intersect and no line intersects more than two n plus one of them. This is the worst example that I know of. And in this case, two lines hit all of the cells. So this is the worst example that I have, and I want to have only And I want to have only 1% intersection, and here is half of them are intersected by a line. So this is not clear what. An even more annoying factor question is the following. This is question number four. Number four. If F is an intersecting fabric, Fabulous quadruped sets and F has more than a hundred elements, and there are five among them that are hid by a line. So, this is needed for the positive fraction. 1000 would be equally good. So, if you can prove that you have any So if you can prove that among any one thousand convex sets in this property, there are five among them that have a line hitting all of them, then that would be also good. Five is a critical number because any four sets have a line transverser because the first two have a common point and second to have a common point and the light through the those two hit all four. But I don't know how to grab the a fifth one. A fifth one. No matter how big it is. So a thousand would be a thousand. Anything is okay. Any number here would be an answer in this case. I give you more questions than answers. But here is a small result, small positive result. For that one, I define a definition. Definition. Definition cylinder is a set C, which is of the form for K plus L. That is a convex set in convex set in RV, and this is the line. And this is Mink of Kesar. It's easier to assume that L contains the origin, but not necessary. So the picture is this. Here is. So, the picture is this. Here is my K, and this is my line, and then this is the object that I'm looking at. So, this is a cylinder. And if theorem, if F consists of cylinders and intersecting, then there is a line. There is a line hitting alpha times F of them and alpha positive. Actually I get one over 14 for alpha from the proof that I'm going to sketch soon and you can improve it a little with that. So I want to give a sketch of the proof. So, proof. If ABR in F, well, I define a directed graph on the vertex set of consisting of the convex sets. And AB form an R A B. If this is the picture, here is B, this is B, and here this is A. It comes out on the other side and continues this way, which means that A minus B is disconnected. Is disconnected. So, this is my directed graph. Definition is clear, right? I understand that if the outdegree of any set, if any outdegree is Is larger than alpha times n than alpha because any line in that A will hit many sets. So if all R degrees are smaller than alpha n, then every jealous is smaller than alpha n, then half of the of A in F has A in F have at least half of A in F have integrity smaller than 2 alpha N. Right? So I keep that half. So F1 is a subset of F with in degree smaller than 2 alpha N. And I know that F was. And I know that F1 is at least half of everybody. And then I pick C from F1 with the smallest, smallest width. I don't have to explain what the width of a convex body is, shall I? What is shall I? This is the C is the right with the smallest width, and C is of the form K plus L and L is little. And then I project everybody onto the, or project everybody in F one onto G. Which is a plane orthogonal R2L, right? So this is what happens. What do I see? I see here No, no, no, sorry. No, no, no, sorry. I have before, this is the smallest, and the projection comes a little later. So I look at those that in F1 F1 that for AC is an arc. There cannot be more than two alpha and or two, right? Because every Right? Because every every indegree here is equals 2 alpha n. I delete all of them from F1. So F2 is just F1 minus set minus these sets. So I'm still have F two has F two has n times one half minus two alpha. minus two alpha elements, at least. I did the n alpha element and I deleted the at most the n degree of C, which is smaller than 2n, 2 alpha. And then I project everything down to P, and this is what I see. This is the projection, I call it K of C and A is projected down onto a slab line. To a slab like that. This is A star. Or it is a convex set if the line of A was parallel with L, then I get a set like that. I have two types of sets, steps of widths larger than the widths of this one, my condition, or sets of this type. Sets of this type are easy to Sets of this type are easy to control because this is a two-dimensional instance of my problem. Right? Two-dimensional instance of my problem. There is a line intersecting all of them. And then if there are too many, too many of them, more than alpha n of them, then I'm done. Because then they have a a line transverse. So these are the projections, huh? What do you mean? These are the projections. These are the projections. These are the projections. And I look at the projections of those guys that have a line parallel with L. And then you get a compact set here, and you get an instance of the same problem in the plane with convex sets, pairwise intersecting. And I know that there is a line in the plane that intersects all of them. So if there are. So if there are no more than alpha n of them, if there are more than alpha n of them, I'm done with my project. So I delete all of these guys and then I get an F3 which is n minus one half minus two alpha minus alpha. So F3 is what I want to work with. And then a little lemma so So, W is the width of K, which is the projection of C, and you have to... What are the properties? First is that every slab in the set, and the second thing is that A set minus K is connected because of the original. Because of the original condition of this is my situation. So if w is 1, w is 0, so this is a line segment, and it's very easy, because in a line segment, anybody has to hit the line segment, cannot cross, so has to hit one end point and are done. If it is not a line segment, Line segment W, then here is my K and this is the width. And then you prove I skip the details that any A star has to contain one of these four points. That is one of the four points here. Not too difficult. Not too difficult to show because this has length larger, exactly W and if A star hits this segment, then it must hit one of the endpoints, otherwise the width would be larger, then would be smaller. So if it does not hit this one and does not hit this one, then it then it must go with failure. My score between the two. I skip the details. And then, and then you know that alpha has to be larger than one-half. No, four points hit every projection. Right? Then the four lines orthogonal parallel with L hit every set, every cylinder. And then you get 1 over 14 for alpha. Alpha equals 1. Alpha equals 1 over 14. And you can do a little better because this was you can play with this. And you get one over 12, for instance. Five more minutes. Yeah, yeah. I don't know the same the answer to the simple case but this is a half line half line so you you you don't have full cylinders, you have half cylinders. This is question number four. Um I have many more questions, but I won't have time for them. Any more questions, but I won't have time for that. But here is actually the original question of Martin Edwardan and Rubin was slightly different. You have two families of convex sets F and G in R3 and they are intersecting this way. So A in F A in F, B in G implies that A in text actually is non-empty. And then the question number five is that five or five is that there is a line intersecting five percent. Of sets in AF or in G. So this is another question. This is a bipartite version of the previous one. And this is also quite open, same way open. So if the sets here and here are cylinders and the Cylinders and the sizes are close to each other, then again it is true with alpha equals one over twelve or a slightly larger number, but in that case it is true. But in general, it is also there is a there is a an example which is annoying the the The um the one treated hyperboloid has a sequence of lines this way and another sequence of lines this way. You can choose a large number large subsets of the lines this one and this one. Any two intersect. This one, any two intersect, and of course, there is a line intersecting every red line, or there is a line intersecting every green line. But this shows that this is going to be a difficult thing. I can repeat the same silly pipe argument, replacing every segment with a pipe and points inside, and I don't know how to wrap up. This is formally stronger than a non-bipartite just by setting F equal to G. Yeah. It's got to be harder. This is harder. If I know the positive answer to this one, then I know the positive answer. Not the other way around. I had the impression that the answer was yes, here and here, but afterwards. And here, but after working on, I have the impression that the answer is rather no. I don't know how to come up with a counter-example, but I want to tell you in my last minute a possible counterexample. It's not a and there is a long way to reach that counter-example, the possible counter-example, but And so what happens is that you have a chessboard-like structure here. Lines, lines, lines, lines, lines. One hundred lines this way and one hundred lines this way. And on top of it, so this is On top of it, so this is my set F is going to be sit on top, so the three-dimension comes out this way. And the set F is going to be, consist of sets sitting on top of this line, on top of this line, etc. That is the top of those lines. And what happens is that I have to tell you where the intersection point is about this chessboard-like structure. And I know that if there is a counterexample, it should look the following. On top of this one, everybody is a... So there are points outside here. And on top of this one, everybody has to be a... We're looking here. Cap. A cap this way. Cap this way. A cap this way. A cap this way. A cap this way. And everybody in the opposite direction has to be a cap. Be a cup this way, this way, this way, this way. So if I define here a function which is a saddle function, then the points will be the points of this function above it. And my convex sets are just convex sets with one long edge and several points over there, and one long edge this way, several points down there. And my attempt to find this function failed so far, and my attempts to show that in this case there is a line intersecting everybody, have also failed. There are many Ramsey steps and elders like a rich steps when you reach this position, but you can. But you can. So that's the that's it. Quick questions? Slow questions? So the question about 100. So do you have examples of say five or six convex sets which don't have? Which don't have this kind of we can lead a hundred or five for sixty just an example of 100. Yeah, I'm saying I can use course for five I don't have an example of a five so can you remind English what is the statement that what is that? So the statement was it is that if you have a some number of sets that among them are five which start by line intersect yeah by the
