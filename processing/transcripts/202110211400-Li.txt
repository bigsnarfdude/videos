Good afternoon, and good afternoon, or good morning, and depend on which time zone you are. And it's my pleasure to chair this afternoon session and thank the organizer and organize such a The such a good and wonderful conference, and that's online. Okay, and then the first speaker for this afternoon session is Jin Li from Shanghai University. And he just come back from Vienna and last month, as I know. So, the talk he will give the title is Function Valued Evaluation. Please, Jindi. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you very much for the introduce. And also I want to thank the organizer, alright. Definitely is not here, but maybe Ni is here. So thank you for their many works for this conference. Okay, so my talk is about function valid variations, but I put a file. invalid variations but i put affine in before so because i consider invariance on the affine transform okay so we working in euclidean space consider complex bodies which allowing not just the full dimensional bodies but also allowing lower dimensional bodies so a is an opinion semi-group and a map or an operator from a subset An operator from a subset of KL to abinence of a group is a valuation if and only if it satisfies equations for all KL in each subset such that the intersection or the union also in each subset. Okay, so the function valid variation here, although you can define more general, but I put here the albino. Here the Arbene semi-group is a set of all functions from Rn to R without any further assumptions, without any further assumptions. So addition here is just the ordinary addition of functions. So why we are interested in such evaluations? Okay, so it starts the theory starts from Herbert's third problem asking if you have two polytopes with the same. Two polytopes with the same volume, are they equally decomposable? Equally decomposible meaning that if you have two polytopes with some volume, can you cut one polytopes into finite pieces and resemble to another one? Okay, this history can be even tracked back to Euclid's time. That's that, can you copy? Can you calculate the volume of permits by doing elementary movements, just the same cut and glue them? Can you do that? Okay, so as far as I know, from some reference, even Gauss still thinks it's possible for higher dimensional space, especially in three dimensions. He think it's possible. Well, in the plane, yes, it is true. Plane, yes, it is true, which is called the blind-going theorem. But Dian shows it is not true for three-dimensional or high-dimensional space. Well, how Dian solved this problem? So he restates this problem in the language of valuations, asking, well, is the volume the only simple and rigid motion you write valuations on polycode? Valuations on polycotops. Of course, you allow a scalar multiplications and the simple valuations meaning it vanishes in lower dimensional space. And the rigid motion invariant just say it doesn't change anything with rigid motion. Okay, so DNS find another valuation. It's now called DNS invariant. So now the answer to the Herbert thought problem is kind of negative. Problem is kind of negative after 50 years old, after 50 years later. So, Hardywick finds quite now famous, useful characterization theorem, which you also see in Monika's talk, which I refer here just for simple variations. The volume is the only one, now it's continuous variations. It's continuous variations, so it's kind of a positive answer to the problem, and there are many applications using Hardwick's theorem. For example, Kochito-Koboto formula, Kropoten formula, and many other kinematic formulas. Okay, so a little bit attention, not generalized here but problem, which you can also say is hardly the same. You can also say it's how do we execute for polytopes without any further assumptions, or equivalently asking how do we characterize equidecomposable polytopes, which is still open, well also interested by many algebraicists, which they do not call it valuation, but called CSAS congruence group. This problem is solved in three-dimensional space and In three-dimensional space and four-dimensional space, but it's still open for five-dimensional space and higher, and also other space for example, a sphere or hyperbolic space. It's just a little bit of history. Okay, so let's back to the function valid relations. So, why we started that? Because it's first, it's extensions of many nodes. Many known kind of no variations. So, for example, if you take real value variations, just the range is real number. So, then you can identify them to the variations whose range is constant functions. And also, if you consider vector or tensor value variations, which you can consider variation taking values in multilinear function. Using multilinear functions, which I actually play a trick here because I did not define before function to be a multi-variable, but you can define that. Also, convex body or star body valid variations usually be considered with respect to LP Minkowski addition, LP or LP radio addition or LP. Radio addition or LP harmonic addition, which you can all identify them to valuations taking values in homogeneous function space, homogeneous function space. Okay, so the second motivation actually use from well transform of functions, which you well you see in Monika's talk talking about the variations. Talking about variations on convex functions. Well, actually, you don't really need to remember what's the definition. It's just many classical transform of functions. Well, when you restrict them to special functions, for example, Lachan transform, if you restrict them to indicated functions, meaning that indicated functions like ink here is In here is k, k is zero, and outside is infinity. All support functions, then you got function valid variations on complex bodies. Also, Laplace transform and Fourier transform, which also a little bit tricky because I did not define for complex functions, but you can, of course, define that and study them. And many other, for example, Arbier transform and many other. And many other integral transforms, you can associate them to, well, here, function valid variations. So it's somehow suggest that when you study them with variation theory, you should better understand the general theorem for function valid operations. Okay, so it's a motivation. So also we start in geometry. We study in geometry follow Klein's Ernlen program. So says geometry is a study of the invariance of transformation groups. And here you might talk about special linear group or maybe a little bit stronger assumption with general linear group. Okay, so let's start some result, classical result. Classical result to understand it. We say SL invariant, things like that. And let's first assume it is also translation invariant. A theorem before Hardwick, which now you should credit to Blask, says a map from conspiracy to real number is a continuous SRN and translation. SRN and translation invariant evaluation if and only if it's a linear combination of the Euler characteristic and the volume. Okay, so yeah, if you remember Monica's talk, if you replace it with rigid motion invariant, then you have also other interest volume, but with SRN transform only Euler coefficients and the volume here. So without transform. Without translating invariant and continuity, then you have something like well. Constant times is volume. And times of this volume, and here is just the volume of the convex hole of polytope and origin. So here is something, well, something similar to the Euler question tick. So it also well comes nature question. So because the Euler question risk tick has risk Euler formula. Euler formula. Well, for example, you can calculate the Euler stick by adding the faces, adding the number of faces alternatively. But is there any similar formula? Just a question. Is there any similar formula for those two variations? Which question I will be answer later? Okay. Okay, now let's see a little bit different. Let's see something different. So now we consider SRN core into function valid evaluations. Now here is general space of functions. And a short remark. So if you still say here, consider SRN invariant. So not put here phi T, but doesn't change anything. But it doesn't change anything, then there is nothing beyond the previous theorem because if you fix x, then it's just the real value, the SR and invariant valuations. There's nothing beyond them. But you change SR core and you really get something nice. Okay, so now a map, a map from Portops contain origin. Well, actually, you don't. Origin. Well, actually, you do not need to worry about this position of origin. We also have results for polytops, all polytops, which you don't really care, really consider about where is the origin. So now just now map from prototype container origin to function space, general function space, is a continuous and SRM core evaluation. Core variation if and only if you have something associated with support function. Here, just the continuous functions and some well reflection of the reflection. And here is, well, you integral of the section functions. Here is just the hyperplane with distance t and with normal x. With normal x. So here, Î¼, because we have continuity here, so mu has have to be a continuous rather measure, but it's not necessary to be positive. It's a sign measure. Okay, so and you can see x is zero. It is, well, it's the same as in black theorem. Okay, so a little bit Uh a little bit more introduction introduction for the variation which I call the weighted moment functions. So first if you consider mu has a density theta then you can use Fourier theorem and you can write like which something more similar similar to people in complex geometry. Well let's first take exponential functions then Then it's associated with the classical Laplace transform. Here, just you take a curve relative functions. So just here is k and here is one and here all is outside is zero and inside is one. So it's Laplace transform and it's a useful tool in clax paper. Clarate paper works on slicing problem and categorization is additional assumptions was established by me and then Ma in Shanghai Norman University. And well now you do not take exponential but take the peace power, the absolute value of peace power. Then you got L P moment body and And for P equal to one, the classical one is an affine isoperometric inequality established by Pecky. And for the LP case by Newtwater, Young, and Zhang, and also asymmetric case by Harbour and Schuster. Okay, the characterization in variations by first by Monika Ludwig and also Vanora Harbor and the properties. Okay, it's for the case p greater or equal to one. So, what's about p smaller than one? So, then you do not directly have a support function anymore. Well, but you can still consider it's defined a Minkowski function. So, then you associate it with a star body is basically similar. So, p now p greater minus. P greater or minus one, which I written here, p is not zero, but you can also define p equal to zero with log since. So which I forgot here. But anyway, why it's also called L minus P intersection body? So because when you take P tends to minus one, you really get the intersection body. And which also you can just from the integral transform taking the Taking the measure to be the zero measure. Okay, so associated with those bodies, there are some called LP Boosman-petitive problems. The classical one, usually people write P equal to one, but because here I write minus one, so P is minus one is proposed by Bozman Petty. Then a key step by Lutheran. A key step by Luther introduces the intersection body, and then by Kisba found a nice counter example, and the Gardner and the John find its positive answer to in three-dimensional and fourth-dimensional space, the complete service problem. For the LP problem by Nutwork and the Grimbertson, and Yaski and Yasmina, I think Professor Kodowski also had some results. For yeah, they should be embedded in. There should be a main name, but I sorry for the forgetting main name. Okay, so the calculation theorem was also first established by Monica Ludovic for the classical intersection body and by Harbour and Ludovic for LP intersection body and also some work by Harvard in 19 in In 2019, 2009. Okay, so anyway, you see, the previous theorem includes quite general geometric function nodes on consequent bodies. Well, now it's easy to see. Well, I mean, it's not directly, but you can think that if you want specific things. want specific things if you want specific things you just assume additional some specific specific assumptions for example if you take in the range of variation to be some q homogeneous the q homogeneous defined like this one q homogeneous functions then you get something much more familiar to you here somehow related with the lp difference Related with the LP difference body. And here is just asymmetric LP mode body. Well, we see assuming the range of function is Q homogeneous, but you can also play a kind of theory where it says the variation itself is homogeneous, but the function, the range doesn't assume anything, then you get some. Missing, then you get something similar. So just use different power, which you can easily verify it is true. Okay, so it's something, some corollary to the previous theorem, to the many theorem established before. Okay, so it's the classifications. Okay, so without continuity. Okay, so without continuity, what happens? Okay, so now we not assume variation itself is continuous, but the range to have some continuous. Well, here C just mean it's continuous. Well, I remove the origin point because it doesn't matter actually. So because I don't need to assume at the origin is continuous. So just remove that one. And here are just the meaning. And here R, just meaning it has some limit conditions with radial directions. So when R tends to zero, it must be zero. Okay, so regularity assumption just make sure no Cauchy functions appears because currently it's not scales if the Cauchy function appears here. Okay, so then we have since before. Since before, load support functions, integral of section sections, but something additional, which I denote by E is negative. So why we denote by E? Because actually we found it's related with Euler expansions of support functions. Okay. But it's still maybe not. It's still maybe not good to use. So we want something really without any continuity because here still you have UCCF here functions still continuous functions. So then we replace the SRN covariant to GRN covariant. So I put here plus here, just that we only need the transform, the determinant of transform to be. The determinant of transform to be positive. So, well, then we got something like that. Unfortunately, the interval of section not exists here, but we now do not need those functions to be continuous, just a general one-dimensional functions. And I also list here x when x equal to zero, which is actually the result from Which is actually the result from Monica Nudik and the Matthews Reisner I showed before. So, well, it's maybe not theoretically because you don't have any continuity here. So, but it's somehow actually you can consider when it is a constant function. Then those two things corresponding to the Euler characteristic, and those two correspond to this one, which Y. This one, which why I can answer the previous question. Okay, so now let's, yeah, a little bit more remark. So also advantage, we do not here consider continuous functions because for risk functions, really we also get some polar, although it's not clearly to see, but it's easy to verify. You get a polar body. You get a polar body here with those things. Okay, so the definition of the E minus, so we first make it clear. The face of the product talk is either P itself or a support set or a support set is hypername. Then we consider all the so the normal con is the set of all the It's the set of all the outer normal. We do not really need to assume units, but you can assume uniting normal, but it doesn't matter. So FP denotes all phases of p and the negative one is just those faces of p such that all the support functions with the directions of the Directions of the well with all the normal directions, it is smaller or equal to zero, and the positive just greater or equal to zero. And a geometrical view is just if you have a face here. So, for example, you have P here, here is a face, and you consider a file, the affine hole of which phase. Of which space, so if origin, so you see actually from the reverse, reverse direction of the normal of the outer normal. So if the origin is hidden in this, always hidden in this affine holes, then it's positive. If it's not high, then if it's always clear. If it's always clear to you, then it's negative. So if origin is inside key, then it's much clear. So the with plus here is the same result plus. And the negative here just the faces containing the origin. Okay, so now we have a different class of Different class of phases. Now we can similar to the Euler formula, define it with support functions. So you add in the support functions alternatively, and you have three, actually three valuations. But you see before only negative part appears. So why? Because the P now contains origin, then the positive. Origin, then the positive is the same as here without positive, and how about this one? Well, actually, I've uh well, actually, we found is we can actually from the previous theorem find a corollary, says Euler type relations of the support functions. But it's well, it's already used a different method to prove that by share part. And in Shirpa's original paper, his paper results theta, but I checked his proof. Actually, his proof also works for general theta. So this result already found by Shepard in 1968. And we can also play a little bit. So get an Euler formula for the mixed volume. Euler formula for the mix volume. So it's orange mixed volume. This arrow contains origin in the interior. So it's just a little bit. It's very, very easy to see. Okay. Yeah. And okay, to solve the question I proposed before, let me still. Then we still make it clear with each dimension, we have FJP and a plus and a negative. And let's recall the Euler formula. Says if you add in the Euler characteristic of the faces alternatively, or you add in the number of each dimensional faces. Alternatively, then you got Euler accuracy characteristic. Okay, so for those two additional variations, we have a similar result. For example, if you replace here to be negative or positive, you get two variations. Or you replace here with X intersect with F, then you get recent. At least I know the last one is already known to some discrete geometers, but I'm not sure if the above two relations is known or not. But it's a corollary from the previous classification theory. Okay, so as I said before, we do not need to worry where is the origin. Origin. Well, actually, consider all prototypes, then you get a little bit complicated representation, which plus comes out. Of course, negative also here. But one might ask where is support function because it doesn't appear here. So actually, if you remember when Polytop When polytope contains origin inside, then risk plus is equal to result plus, and by the original formula, it is risk one. Theta h p, the correct hole of p and zero. And what's this one with risk one is just the virus relation. Well, it's not well by definition, it's not hard to see that actually, but uh. Actually, but maybe a little bit surprising at first because there is no support function up here directly. Okay, so that's a regular case and a continuous case was much nice to read. So now you only have support functions and the support functions of the convex whole and the section also itself and the convex whole or P and origin. Okay, so. Origin. Okay, so that's it. It's for the time reason. It's actually too ambitious to introduce the details of the contrarian case. So I just quickly pass that. So a valuation, a map from Polytop still contain origin is a measurable and SRN control valuations, which you actually, if and only if you have something. If I know if you have something like orange mixed volume of segment, like also here. But now, origin code on the boundary, so you have to remove those faces, those bad faces. And which, so Rosine, you can also write generalized projection projection functions. So, for example, here. So for example here, if you take a power, p power, then you get support function of LP projection body and asymmetric one and also you can write as mixed volume, mixed volume and the origin mixed volume was first introduced independently by Gardner Hook and Weyer and also Xi Jin then. Also, she then and well, which I rethink is just a change, removal of spare phases and some asymmetrical versions. So let's not check the detail for that. Just well, yes, as the covered case, you can also assume, for example, the range of functions to be homogeneous functions. homogeneous functions. Then you get a previous result. And also I didn't written here, but you can also assume the variation itself is homogeneous. You get a similar result. Okay, so which I want to show here, a characterization of LP mix volume, which is not a, well, it's a small work. Well, it's a small work because I actually assume quite stronger things. So, bi path, so it's two variables. So, one is polytopes, one is convinced bodies, symmetric convents bodies. It's SRN invariant. It's this one. Of course, LP mixed volumes satisfy this property. And it is a valuation with respect to the first one, the first variable. first variable and it is a linear well linear meaning meaning linear with respect to L P mean coffee addition so then if I well I also need the P greater or equal to one and the P not an even integer because I really need to use the L P cosine transform extension in the continuous functions so then I get something Characterizations of LP mix volume. Of course, I hope in the future we can, I or other people can get some better result. So it's a question. Okay, so a little bit idea of the proofs actually. So let's take cover indicators as an example. So I didn't know. So I didn't not take too much detail on different types of technical complicated details, but just easy understand idea. So first from polytope, we can easily reduce it to symbolic. It's just, for example, if origin is inside, then we can cut it into sympathysis. Uh, sympathysis, then it's uniquely determined by SRN core and uniquely determined by those standard syntax for each dimension. Okay, so when origin is outside, then we cut into pieces. Well, we cut the convex hole of the origin and this polytop, and then well, actually, you can see the face. Well, actually, you can see the phases also makes make important here. So the standard syntax is not is not sufficient to do that. We also need to consider with, well, but still similar, the phases of standard simplicity. So similar to those things. Okay, then we only need to consider standard simplics. So we cut. So we cut so we cut it with the hype plane with pass through this point and origin and also I didn't pick didn't draw in here E3 E4 and here E D, the risk hypern is D minus one dimensional hypern. So it cuts it the standard symbol to smaller to two smaller symbols, which is a Sympathy, which is a fine transform of standard sympathies. So then we use validations and SR recurrence and also a kind of trick. So I didn't say it's always possible, but somehow you can consider it is it vanishes on lower dimensional space. So then you can. So then you can make the formula a little bit easier to do that. So here actually it's a diagnosis, it's a dination of standard symptoms and it's a different diagnosis and it's another different diagnosion. But if you're familiar with Cauchy functions equations, then you can see somehow if here is the same. If here is the same with x, then you really get some linear property with regularity assumptions. So, and also with equations, well, quite powerful actually. So, for example, a key theorem which I call uniqueness theorem. So, it says the valuation. Is uniquely determined by those things. Okay, so it makes things easier. So you just need to figure out what's this one, what's this one, what's this one, and what's this one, and then what's this one. Okay, and also one example. Okay, and also one example, I didn't show how to calculate those things, but for simple valuations, meaning here since they're also zero. But by the way, so we write unitless theorem like that because the space of such variations are linear space. Such variations are linear space, so you can arrive like that. Okay, so example to use the unique theorem to do our desired result just with this lemma. Use this lemma with the unique theorem, then you can just replace here to general polytop p and here to be a general x and you get everything what you desired. If you still remember the integral of the section function. Of the section functions. Okay, how do we prove risk neural? The first as I said you can with Cauchy functions equations, you can get some linear, get some homogeneous properties. And then you just calculate the right-hand side. Particular right-hand side, but a little bit technical. bit technical is just put here also multiply with r n and here just because this homogeneous homogeneative and you just consider r here here without s and the calculation find that with this one so then you well how do we prove this functions is equal to this one then it just well it's from the It's just from the knowledge of analysis, then you well, if and only if this star property holds. What's star property? The star property says the derivative of G exists and is continuous from first derivative up to n minus one derivative and also with this limit condition. With limited conditions. Okay, so the last quite technical, complicated things just to show this star of the holes, which I do not tell here. Okay, so that's all. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jean. I think we should have time for questions. Time for questions? Any questions, comments? Hello. Hi. Hi, Sama. Hella Jean. I want to ask um your study the S L N convarant. Convariant idea is to change the condition to SLN controvariant. Yes, I hope so, but I make it quickly because it's too ambitious to introduce a lot of results. So yes, with results, of course, you can improve it, actually. I think you can improve it with some weak assumptions. Weak assumptions. I mean, like in current case, I did do not really assume the to be continuous also at the origin. Or I have some result continuity assumption, but they replace with GRN control accurate. I mean, for example, the radio functions is not here, but you Yeah, but you I think it's possible to to find them if you yeah with some different machines okay okay any other question
