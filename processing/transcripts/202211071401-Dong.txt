Welcome to the end of the session. I'm very happy to introduce Honjo Dong from Bryan University. Tell us about some of the estimates for fractional PDs. So first I would like to thank our organizers for the nice invitation. So it's my great pleasure to give a talk in this event. So today I'm going to talk about some recent results of solving festival for fractional PDEs. So in particular, I will talk about So, in particular, I will talk about result for error alphabetic cognitions with production of derivatives in either time variables or the space variables, or both. So, this is based on joint work with Doo Yong King from Korea University, and also Yanse Liu, who is here, and PLB Jiang, also from Korea University. So, let me start with the classical. So let me start with the the classical cardinal signal next main. So this is elliptic equivalence uh in divergence form. Uh divergence that is second order operator is equal to F on the right hand side. So we assume the usual ellipticity condition. So Aija Cij is bounded from below, the other times C squared. And also Aij are bounded from above. And so for simplicity we assume that the lower coefficients are bounded and also C is an negative. Then we have a cardinal classical cadence. Then we have a classical caddon zigmann estimate, which says that if Aij disbedian coefficients are sufficiently smooth, for example uniformly continuous, then we can bound the LP norm of the hash of U by some constant times the LP norm of F. So we have similar results for probability coefficients and also for divergence from LPT probability coefficients. So there's a, besides the VMO coefficients, there is a class of very important classes. Class of very important class of coefficients which is called VMO coefficients. So elliptical coherence with VMO coefficient, elliptical equations with VMO coherence was first studied by Charlenza, Frasco and Wrong in 1991 and 93, where they proved the W2P estimate for non-divergence forming coherence response in the VMO being coherent. And later, their results were extended by T50 to divergence. And he obtained WLPSM for divergence forming elliptic equivalence with bounded and VMO coefficients. And later, Bramanti and Sir Routi in 1993 extended their results to parabolic coefficients with bounded VMO coefficients. So in all this work, the proofs are based on Cardinal-Ziegman theorem and also Kaufmann and Richmond. And also Kaufman and Richburg with computers here. So let me remind you that the function is VMO for this average in VR x0 of the absolute value of f minus its average goes to 0 as r goes to 0 uniform with respect to x0. So this method is very powerful, but my drawback of this method is the proof needs to use the smoothness of the corresponding fundamental solutions. So that means this method does not does not allow Does not allow coference with jump discontinuities. So there's another method by first used by Kirov in 2005. So this method is called the mean oscillation method, where he studied both divergence and non-divergence type probability coefficients with leading coefficients Vij VMO with respect to the X variable. So in the T variable So, in the T-variable wave, the coefficients can be discontinuous. And he obtained the W12P estimate for non-alignance forming coefficients and also H1P estimate for divergence form equivalents. And a bit later, he obtained a mixed norm estimate in this LQ in T and L P in X space, where Q is assumed to be greater than or equal to P in a non-double-dimension space. So, this estimate is an So, this estimate is sometimes also called maximum regulatory estimate. So, the idea of this proof is to first obtain a point-wise estimate for sharp functions in the U in the divergence case and the d square u in the non-divergent space. And then use the frequency CRM1 sharp functions and also the hundredth volt maximum function CR. So, this is the hundredth volt maximum function CR. For any p greater than 1 ms infinity, we can bound the 1 ms infinity, we can bound the LP normal of the maximum function by the LP normal of the function itself. So this is the hardly to the shell function here. So this is the shell function. Yes? You just answered the child function? Yes. Well, child function is the similar to to to the one I'm finding about. So I see there's a nice method last time. Yes. So this is uh x zero is equal to sum r and equal to the average of f minus this average. Okay, so in some sense his proof is based on interpolation between C2 alpha estimate and also W2K for equation to this constant equal. For equations with constant equations and certain perturbation algorithms. There are some subsequent work, for example, with Garati in 2016. We consider high-order elliptic and probabilistic equations on half space with general boundary conditions which satisfies the Rupertinsky Shapiro condition. So this is also known as a complementing condition. Complementing condition in the famous work by Edmond, Douglas, and Newberg. And in 2018, we extended the result in the AP weighted setting with AP weights. And we obtain mixed form estimate and also weighted estimate. By using extrapolation theorem, we remove the condition uh Q is greater than or equal to P in in great result. Result. So we obtain the result for any PMQ. And a few years ago with Greylock, we extended the result to fully non-intergrid with VMware cookies. There's another method due to Kafari and Pereuel in 1998. So this is called the level-side argument. So where they started, WOPS meant for linear and quasi-linear cohesions in the original form. and quasi-linear covariance in the variance form uh with continuous covariance and uh as well as some uh elliptic uh homogenization problem. So the idea is uh first to get Lipschitz estimate for any weak solution uh u two equations with constant coefficients. So this is the if you have an equation with constant covariance then you can bound the infinity norm of gradient u by some constant times the L2 norm of u. Then they use some kind of comparison. They use some kind of comparison, estimate, compare the solution to equations with variable coefficients, to solutions to equations with constant coefficients. Then finally, they use a crawling of ink, lambda, originally due to Safonov and Kirov in 1980 when they prove the Hanukkah inequality for non-hours from equipment. So they use this method to estimate the level set of the maximum function of du squared. That's basically irrelevant. So, this level zero argument has also been applied to many equations or different situations. So, first by Beyond and Wong in 2005, they studied elliptical coherence with the VMO coefficients in rough domains, so riven with domains, which in particular is more general than C1 domains. And then Zhang Shan in 2007. Zhang Weishen in 2007, he applied this method to the ELP boundary value program in Lipschitz domain. And a few years ago, with Choi and Sonya and Li, we started mixed boundary conditions. So we decomposed the boundary of the domain into two parts. In one part, we imposed the delivery boundary condition, and in the other part, we imposed the connormal boundary condition. So we are able to. So we are able to obtain W1P estimate for such equations with such boundary conditions in very rough ways. And later we also consider non-homogeneous bounding conditions in Lipschitz. Okay, so today I'm going to focus on fractional derivative. So this is the time fractional derivative. So first introduced by Caputo. So when alpha is between 0 and 1, this So when alpha is between 0 and 1, this derivative, time fractional derivative can be written as follows. So this is some constant, this is gamma function of the derivative of this fractional integration from 0 to t of t minus s to power minus alpha by u s minus u u 0 ds. So this was introduced in his 1967 paper and has been used to model fractional and anomalous diffusion in plasma distribution. Diffusion in plasma determines. So, this derivative, if you look at the right side, so this is in the local. So, this can be considered as a derivative with memory effect or delay effect into consideration. So, when alpha is between zero and one, and in a special case when u zero is equal to zero, then this fraction of derivative can also be written into current forms. Current forms. Where this i to the power 1 minus alpha is this fractional integration. And when alpha is equal to 0, that's exactly the antiderivative of u. So this has actually appeared a long time ago. You can find it in a book by Hardy and Littlewood in their book in 1928. And when alpha is between one and two, is between one and two we can define the fractional time derivative as follows. So you first take the second derivative and then we take the fractional integration. And when u0 is equal to the first derivative of u0 is equal to 0, then this fractional time derivative is equal to these two two forms. Maybe it's a question. Okay, so we consider equations in this non-divergence form or the original form. So this is the first you have the fractional time derivative, and this is second-order derivative in space, but this is divergence form. But this is divergence for equations. So when alpha is between 0 and 1, this equation is called a fractional probability equation. Sometimes it is also called a sub-diffusive equation. So this describes a particle with sticking and chopping effects. And when alpha is greater than 1, this is some sometimes sometimes called a fractional wave equation or diffusion diffusion wave equation, because this is someti something between diff diff diffusion equation and wave equation. diffusion equivalent wave equivalent. When alpha is exactly equal to 2, that's wave equal. When alpha is equal to 1, that's diffusion equivalent. So that describes wave propagating in viscolastic media. So these equations are also related to normal covariant diffusion process with a memory effect. So recently there are many work in this direction. So let me just mention two of them. So when alpha is between the So when alpha is between 0 and 1 in 2013, he obtained the George Nashmodial estimate for divergence from equation like this. And in 2016, Alan, Kafarari, and Vasall, they also obtained C-alpha DeGeorge National Estimate for equations with the fractional operators in both T and X. So related to this L P L Q L P estimate. LQ LP estimate. There are also many work. For example, in 1992, Climo and Pruss, they consider a case when B alpha beta is delta ij as a plus operator. Alpha is between 0 and 1. And under some conditions on PQ and alpha, they can obtain this LQ, LP estimate by using the semi-group and operator theoretical approach. And later Zakara has And later, Zakar has also without any condition that Aij is uniformly continuous and P is equal to Q greater than one when alpha is in this range. So in his paper, he also assumes some continuity at infinity. So this limit as A R J of A R J as X goes to infinity as a limit. So this is some kind of continuity at infinity condition. So there are some other work, for example, by Some other work, for example, by these authors, segmental motor, some L2S standards, with C1S C1 coefficients, and also some other workplace by these sources. Okay, so the equation we want to study is the first non-divergence formulas with time-fractional derivative. So if alpha is So if alpha is less than 1, we can impose this zero initial condition when t is equal to 0. And when alpha is between 1 and 2, we need two initial conditions. So this is similar to Wavercook. So we need two financial conditions. One is some U, the other is some UT. So there's a work by Kim Kim and Lim in 2017 where they consider the case when alpha is between 0 and 2 and AIG. 0 and 2, and A i j uniformly continuous in X and piecewise continuous in T, and also this continuity of A i j at infinity at X constant. Under these conditions, they obtain the cardinal G model L Q P, L Q L P estimate. And also they obtain the existence and the uniqueness of solutions. So their proof, they use a representation formula for solutions to the time fraction phi. To the time fraction features, which the operator looks like this. So, using the metal-Laufra function, which is defined like this. Then, to consider these coefficients, which are continuous in X and piecewise continuous in T, they use a perturbation of nodes. So, another question is: is this condition can we Condition, can we relax this condition? So, can we remove this piecewise continuity in T connection and can we relax this uniform continuity in X connection? So, in 2018, with Dui Yunkim, we considered this case when alpha is less than 1. So, in our first paper, we consider the case when alpha is less than 1. And we assume that the Eij Vmo in X, then the measurement T. VMO in X than a measure in T. So that's exactly the same condition creator imposed for second-order parabolic equations. And in this case, we obtain unmixed result with LPSN and also the solar rating of equations. So for the proof, we used levels of argument due to CAFRI and Parallel without any current estimates. So the main difficulty is So the main difficulty is, as I mentioned before, to apply the the capillary parallel method we need to control the the supino of readiness u. But in this case this is not immediate so it's hard to get local infinity aspect of hash of equivalence to contingency equations with covariance depending on t. So you can see this from this inviting so if the solution is in w alpha 2 you have 2, you have alpha is derivative and also it is your 2, then this is only embedded into your infinity when alpha is large. So when alpha, for example, when alpha is small, this space is not invited into. So the idea is we use this first we s uh start from the the L2 estimate. So you test the the function by UCL then we can obtain the L2 estimate. Then we can obtain L2 estimate. Then we localize the L2 estimate and use sublife type in writing to prove that if you have a solution to a homogeneous equation. Then this hash is not in your infinity immediately, but it is in your P1 or some P1 slightly bigger than 2. Instead of your infinity. Now we use a modified level side argument and prove the LPS fit and stability for non-home synchronous one P. For non-home synchronous when P is less than P home. And after that, we can iterate. So we localized this LPS unit of 10 before and use the Sobrio Fing writing again to prove that D square units L P 2, also P2 bigger than P1 for Homogene square units. So we can repeat this process and successfully increase the exponent p and eventually we obtained the solvent. And eventually, we obtain the solvability for any p less than infinity. And when p is less than 2, we use a direct element. And to treat VMO coefficients, we use perturbation algorithm. So that's basically the proof of our first paper. What you just described, was that for the constant coefficients, the space constant coefficients, or no? You mean which one? The first, I guess the first two steps. The first two steps. Two steps. The first two steps are for a constant. Yes. So measurable is a function of t. So they can just depend on t? Depend on t. It's independent of x, yes. And after that, we can use perturbation to have VMO governance. It is okay. Yeah, I just want to try to follow. Alright, so in our second paper, we consider equations with. Equations with AP, milk AP weights. So let me record that. And the negative function omega defined on R D is called in the class AP for this integral on the right side. If you take the supreme R, it's less than infinity. So let me notice, let me emphasize that this quantity is always greater than or equal to 1. So if this is also uniformly bounded from above, then we see that this only values. From above, then we see that it is only very simple. AP class. So by using Hodos inequality, we have this relation. So if P is less than Q, then AP is a subset of AQ. And as I said before, this AP constant is always greater than equal to 1. And again, my folder is important that AQ constant is less than or equal to AP constant if Q is greater than P. So this class of weight is very useful because the hydrogen will. Because how do you determine the maximum operator is found in weighted ERP space with AP weight? And this is actually if and only with the condition. Then we define this weighted mixed model. So we first integrate in X with weight omega 1. Then we integrate in T with weight omega 2. So for weighted estimate there's also a result by Han, King and Park in King and Park in 2020. And they again consider the case when alpha is between 0 and 2, and A alpha delta is delta Ij, so constant coefficients. Omega 1 is in AP and omega 2 is in AQ. Then they obtain this weighted mixed model estimate and also solarity in this space. So their proof is to establish the mean oscillation estimate using the kernel estimate in their previous paper. in in their previous paper. And then oh and then uh they used the the uh the weighted mixed norm shell function uh result in in my paper with two. The natural question is to talk about variable coefficients because in their paper they assume constant coefficients. So the above result can be extended to the case when omega 2 is equal to 1 and Aij uniform continuous and also when p is not equal to q So when p is not equal to q, we require this continuity at infinity. So did anything anything about the can you go back one side? Was the previous side just the definition of the previous side is just the definition. Okay, did anything change in the equation to get the different so is this L P P Q is space and omega 2 omega 1 are time? Yeah, no, sorry. So this opital 2 is the waiting for time. This is the weighting x. So that's exactly the D. But somehow I cannot change this. I don't know what the antivirus thing? Maybe. I cross this question. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, sorry, the windows strike. Great. But did anything to get the new for the new estimates, did any assumptions about the coefficients? Yes, so in their result, they are the constant. Constant. Okay. I guess you can also, so as I said, you can have uniform continuous index. Continuity in X, continuity at infinity. Because you can use, if you have a result for constant coefficients, then you can use perturbation. But as long as it's uniform incomplete, then it's okay. So with DuNke, we extend the above result with VMO X coffins when alpha is less than 1. So this is our result. We assume again ERG is VMO in X and measure in T. And then we have this And then we have we have this QP estimate and also solarity result. So again, our proof does not any does not use any kernel estimate and the iteration element I mentioned before does not work in this case. Our strategy is first to apply the mean oscillation element by establish a holder estimate of the hash norm. The hash of V. So where V is a solution to a homogeneous equation. So to prove the holder estimate, we use a bootstrap argument, which is based on our previous unmixed ELP estimate. And to overcome the difficulty from the local effect in the time variable, so our idea is to consider infinite singleness, so minus infinity to t0 times BR X0 instead of usual problem x. So this is of the local Of the local tail effect in the time rate. And then I apply the harder data toward the maximum function for strong maximum functions. So here are some two key elements. The first one is for homogeneous equations. If V is the solution to this infinite cylinder minus infinity to T0 times PR, then we can estimate the LP norm, the disease LP average is our cylinder by this right-hand side. So this is some. Hand side. So this is some constant times this average in this single. So this sum of these constants are finite because alpha is bigger than 2. And also we can control the holder law by this y and sign, the same rye answer. And the second lemma is for the lemma is for non-dawande, equation for solutions to non-dawanders for. Solutions to non-Western coordinates. So we assume that W is a solution to this equation in its infinite signal with zero bounding condition. Then we can control this average by this summation on the right hand side. And this SK is dielectric T0 minus 2K plus Y. And the sum of CK is bounded by some constant. Okay. Okay, so that's basically the idea of the proof. And the natural question is: what happens when alpha is bigger than 1? So, can we prove a similar result in this case? So, what's the difference? So, let me give you a very obvious difference in this case. So, you can see this in L2 level. So, if you multiply the cohesion by u and integrate with your And integrate with respect to time, then when alpha is less than 1, this is actually bounded below by this quantity. And then if you further integrate, you can see that this integral is always non-negative. In a case when alpha is less than 1. But when alpha is bigger than 1, this quantity is not always negative. So that means we no longer have the maximum principle in this case. In this case, not always. It's quite temporarily. So we addressed this question in a case when the coefficients are VMO in both T and X. So in our case, we can obtain the following result. So that's my result with my student Yensu. So we assume alpha is greater than one and AIG are VMO in both T and X. And o omega one is AP weight in space and omega two is AP weight in time. Omega 2 is AP weight in time. Then we have this weight and mixed normal estimate and also solar rate. So for the proof, we follow the strategy in my work by myself and also him, by establishing mean oscillation estimate. So because this alpha is bigger than 1, the proof is more delicate. So to estimate B, we apply the unmixed Europe estimate due to Kim. Your PS meant due to Kim King and Lim. And so that's the solution to normal use equations. And to estimate W, we need to solve an equation in a bounded symmetrical domain. So for that, we use the method of eigenfunction expansions and also meta-law function. So in the same paper, we also consider divergence formation. Paper: We also consider divergence form equations and also equations in half space and also spoon steam space. Alright, so the next part of my talk is about equations with non-local derivatives in the space variable. So we can consider this operator. So this is the local operator with pure junk Lab process. So that's the integral of ux plus y minus ux minus y times gradient u. So this is like a function minus it's a first of the total expansion. And then you multiply by some kernel and then integrate in y. And this function chi is defined as follows. So when sigma is less than 1, chi is equal to 0. When sigma is greater than 1, chi is financially equal to 1. And when sigma is equal to 1, And when sigma is equal to 1, chi is equal to indicate the function of all three displays. So these models in physics, from models in physics, engineer, and finance, which involves long-range interactions. So a simple example is when k is equal to this function, y to the power minus d minus sigma, and then this operator becomes the fractional plus. So there are two cases. One case is when k is symmetric. So when k is symmetric, say kxy is equal to kx minus y, then this integral can be written as the integral of the second order of finite difference. So ux plus y plus ux minus y minus 2 times ux. So we do not always assume the symmetry condition in our work. And let's assume that in this case, And let's assume that this k, this kernel can be written as phi x, y times y to the power minus sigma minus d minus sigma. So this operator is of order sigma. And when sigma is equal to 1, we further impose a calculation condition. So this integral for y times a times on this wall freedom t is equal to 0 for any point. So this is satisfied in particular when So this is satisfied in particular when k is symmetric. So this is always satisfied. And we need to impose certain empty conditions for A. So we assume that A is greater than or equal to 2 minus sigma times delta. And let's say equal to 2 minus sigma times 1 over delta. And as I said before, the order of this operator is sigma. And instead of this strong pointwise ellipticity condition, we can impose a weaker elliptic condition. So this is the weaker condition. So, this is the weaker distribution. So, A is bounded and also bounded below by a function defined on this one, spin of relative, which is negative. And also this integral is bounded from below for any K C in S D minus 1. So, this integral inside is omega dot K C to the power sigma A tilde omega d omega. And this condition is weaker than this point-wise ellipsoid condition. And the reason we impose this ellipsoid condition is because it has applications to reanalyze the Boltzmann equation with the spectrular reflexive Baltic condition. So when we study this in a forthcoming work with Yango and Ema, just chose some scheme. Acular reflexive boundary condition. Reflexive boundary condition. Oh, so this is like periods. So you take so you have income velocity and outcome velocity. So the spectral boundary condition means that the income, so this angle is equal to this angle. It is reflected on that boundary. Broadly speaking, it makes sense. Okay, so we are interested in Okay, so we are interested in the LPS for such operators. So we take lambda bigger than zero and f is in L P. Then we know that we want to show that there exists a unique solution in this special potential space H sigma p to this equaling. And this H U satisfies this equation this input. So when L is equal to this fractional R, this follows from the classical theory for super differential. Theory for super differential operators. And in general, if the symbol for this operator is sufficiently smooth and is the derivative satisfies certain decay, then the LP is already also constructed from classical free multiparosis. So there are some known results in the literature. So when k xy is just a function of of y, then this symbol can be written in this form. Symbol can be written in this form. So, in general, this is not sufficiently exposed to apply the classical multiplier theorem. So, in 1992, Michelovisius and Prabhu Raskas, they considered a case when ky is equal to ay divided by d to y to the power d plus sigma, where a is a homogeneous function of order zero and a sufficient spool. Then they can prove that the fundamental solution to this operator are well defined, can be well analyzed, and we can apply the Majikovich theorem to get the LPS state. And also in a symmetric case, Ky is equal to K minus Y, the LPS minus was also obtained by Panulus and Oklahoma in 2007 using probabilistic method. And also they can obtain And also, they can obtain the best constant of the estimate. And about 10 years ago, with William Kim, we also considered a case when Axy is equal to Ay, and we do not impose any regularity assumption on A, so it can be a measurable function with no symmetry assumption. And we prove the continuity of this operator from this specific potential space to L P. So let me imagine that when sigma is equal to 2, a second order operator, Equal to 2, second order operator, we do not need any variety of this A with respect to X, but this is highly non-trivial in the fractional case. So we first consider the situation when A is translation value, so A is a function of Y. So this is for elliptical queries. Then Shi Shenzhen in 2013, he obtained a maximum. She obtained the maximum BLP coercion for the local power equations and also equalizes in the parallel risk because in 2014 they considered local power weight equations with this kernel A depending on both T and X. And in the X variable they assume A is wholly continuous, where beta is greater than D over P. In particular, when P is very small, When P is very small, they need a very large beta in. And under this assumption, they prove the continuity of operator and also the existence of solutions. Can you remind me again? The K in this is going to be A times the kernel for fractional constants. K is equal to A divided by multiple constant times. Okay. And so on the previous slide, when you say was the A constant. When you say was the A constant, so it's, or I guess not that, two back, yeah, yeah, yeah, that one with the one forward. Oh, shoot, where did he the one that the Vanuato spoke on this one? What okay, and then so what does the And then, so what does the now for the next for the next one where A is just measurable, where is is there not an ellipticity assumption? Oh, still assuming. So in this work, we still assume A is spawned from below and above. Okay, so that's it. Yeah, next. Uh so another uh question is is it possible to remove this or relax this condition? Or relax this condition of A with respect to the X variable. For example, can we impose the holder regularity for small beta? Because here you need beta to be sufficiently large. And what about DNI continuity of the A with respect to X, and uniform continuity or even VM of? So in my recent work with Kim and John, we partially answer this question. Partially answer this question. So we prove that this operator, fractional operator, is continuous from this Bessel potential space to the LP space, provided that Axy is holder continuous for any beta. So if it is holder for small beta, that's enough. So consequently, we obtained the solvary phase matter and also solability of the local elliptical and probable equi probable equivalence with such uh operator. Such operator. So, in our paper, we prove that this is actually continuous from this weighted cell for annual space. LP space. So, this should be omega. Omega is AP weight. So here's the idea of the proof. So, the proof is based on weighted estimate first for large P. P is bigger than D or bigger. So, that's the second condition. I think. I think they are their work. So, beta times p should be bigger than d. But here we introduce this AP weight. So, this is a weighted version of their result. And the proof, we use some ideas in the paper by Michelis and Pro Provaroscus. And with this weighted estimate for large P, then we can use extrapolation theorem to obtain the the weighted estimate for any P uh between one. For any p between one. That's basically the idea of our proof. So still, it remains open whether we can further relax the condition of A. For example, if A is DNI continuous in X, then we obtain a similar result. So this is still unknown. So there are also some recent results about local operators in divergence form. by this four process for Mega Shakeshaker and HIPO in 2021 and more recently by Simon Nowock. In particular in the work by Simon Norwalk he obtained the estimate for the ability to form equivalence when the covariance of VMO. So such a result is not available in the normal in this case. Case. So I think this is a very interesting book. So more recently, we also consider fractional probability equivalence with space-time and local operators. So we have fractional derivative in time, and also we have a fractional operator in x. So this the difference is equal to f in this time interval 0 to t times r d R D. So we assume that this A is holding continuous in X for some beta bigger than zero. Then we can show that this operator is continuous from this potential space to L P. Moreover, we have a unique solution to this equation. And this is for any alpha between 0 and 1. And when alpha is equal to 1, we can obtain better results. We can obtain better results, so we also obtain a waiting stop. Okay, so that's all I want to talk about tonight. Thank you for your talk. Questions, comments? I have a question. You set out the questions that You said on the questions that your A, X, Y was Dini-continuous. A is a DNI continuous unit. Can you explain briefly what Dini continuous is? Dini-continuous means... So if we define the modulus of continuity, or maybe X minus X prime. Maybe x minus x prime is less than r of a xy minus 8 prime y. So this is the observation of a when x minus x prime is less than 0. So dining continuous means that this integral from 0 to 1 of 0 up rho out exponent. Because it would be holder continuous. That's more general than that. Right, so this is like some more. Exactly. It's weaker than every holder continuous. Thank you. I have two questions. One concerns page twenty-one. Maybe actually, maybe I didn't mean this one. Okay, now it continues. Maybe can you go to 23? Yeah, that's right. That's right. In this result, alpha is between 1 and 2, so we are between heat and wavy heat. So can you please comment on this result? On this result for heat and wave equation, or if I want to prove similar results for heat and wave, I mean, I have seen that you don't claim robustness, so you constantly depend on alpha. But are the limit results true or not? And are they maybe by far not optimal in that limit? So, certainly, when alpha approaches to 2, the constant goes up. It has to go up because for vector, the result is equal to 0. So, wave equation, the result is for wave equipment. And for alpha equal to 1, we don't care because we have the result already. Yes. That's how we have programmed. And the second question concerns the Hanack inequality for time fractional equations. Some time ago, I learned from Rico Zacher, who you cited, that at the time it was not known whether the plain Hanack inequality for time fractional equations is true. What is the current state of the art? What is the current state of the art? I don't know. I'm not sure. So you know that there are some results in that direction, but I don't know what is the most recent. Even if you forget about the space derivatives, if you just have a time fractional equation, so Rico said that he does not know whether Hallach is true or false. And I found that very remarkable. So that's for political solution. So that's for positive solutions. I haven't looked into that, but I think that's a very quick question. Earlier in your talk, you had the Georgie Nash Moser site. Is it not? Yeah, it does for you get the regularity there, so the Herder regularity and all this stuff, but then that's just weak HAMAC, but it's not really the point-wise estimate where you compare super thin. This one, right? But it's a while ago. It's it's okay. Oh, no. I defer to my co-organizer. Can I make a comment? So, for example, I know that so I kind of surprised that for like BMO, the estimate that you get from Then you get from are kind of the same, alpha less than one, alpha greater than one. But so there are some equations, say for example, the fast diffusion, where the behavior is very different if you have the standard derivative, in which case we have finite time extinction. And if alpha is less than one, there is no finite time extinction, but solutions are regular for all time. Solutions are regular for all time. So, and of course, it's a non-linear problem, this is linear, but do you have an intuition why for some problems the Kaputo derivative or the standard derivative play a very meaningful difference. And here, this seems somehow to yes, so we also see the difference. So, when alpha is less than when the So when alpha is less than 1, the coherence can be measured in T. And when alpha is bigger than 1, it should be VMO in T. There's already a difference. But as I mentioned, we don't have the maximum principle when alpha is critical. Either there are many differences when alpha is less than one or quite a bit. This might be a question just for after discussion, so please just tell me, let's talk later, but I figure I'll ask since we're here. So when you want to get the very weak estimates, you know, LP for the solutions, you're kind of asking a lot of the equation in X, right? Like, still, VMO is somewhat regular. That's right. And so I was curious, and I apologize. Curious, and I apologize if this is naive. What is anything known when, okay, forget about the LP estimates. If I want the coefficients to now be very weak in x, say what if for AP? So in X if they're AP weights. Is there any existing for either local or non-local, you know, non-divergence? So, what do you mean by confidence in AP weights? Suppose, say, like for that equation right there, Aij depends on X and is AP for something. Or you would say whether, think of for example, if the Aij depends the AP test debris, instead of being bigger than some cost and is bigger than some APY under X in the LS and APY. Yeah, I know for the for secondary. Uh for second order second order equivalent status in doubts, but like for uh Egyptian archmodels made uh AP. Uh yeah, I think this is possible. Wait, that was that that's for divergence, right? That's for divergence. How about non-divergence? Non-divergence. I don't think that's true. But by uh by treating, right, students. Yeah, no, I mean, I was asking because I thought you might know. I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. I previously had the response to follow. What about the previous form with non-local ink caps? That's a good question. Work session later. Close session. Great. Alright. Other questions or comments? Thanks, Monday. Thank you. Now to make sure I reconvene at 3:30 and you're standing. So I guess now it's the break.
