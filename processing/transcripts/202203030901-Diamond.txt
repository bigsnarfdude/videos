So the you know Pat Diamond will be giving the first talk. So Pat, if you could share your screen. I'd just like to tell you in the program after the talk by Nicola, we will just wait here for a couple of minutes for a group photograph, which the people at BIRS have put in the schedule and then we wait for coffee. Okay, great. So, Pat, is it all right if after 20 minutes I just let you know that you have 10 minutes left? You have 10 minutes left, or yeah, so I can just sort of break in. Okay, so the first speaker is Pat Diamond, and he'll be talking about MHD turbulence in the prescribed stochastic magnetic field. So, Pat, over to you, and I'll let you know when you have 10 minutes left. Hey, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, for organizers, for inviting me. Apologies, I've been scarce. I had some issues this week. So, this talk. So, this talk is definitely probably going to be offbeat relative to the other talks in this meeting. And it deals with magnetic fusion physics, and it deals with something that's a kind of a wacky problem, namely MHD-like turbulence in a prescribed stochastic field. And I'm chosen this because I'm interested. Chosen this because I'm interested in getting comments from this group, so comments from people who are somewhat different from the usual ones I talk to. And the work is done by myself and a very good student, Ming Yun Kao, and in parallel on the experimental side by a group at K-Star in Korea, which is a large tokamak project, and in particular Min Jun Choi and Jai Min Kwan. Choi and Jai Min Kwan. And it certainly fits the topic of stochastic approaches to turbulence. So now we've got to advance the, now we're not advancing the. So what I want to do is spend a lot of time explaining why we're doing this, which must strike you as bizarre, right? In other words, studying turbulence in a pre. Studying turbulence in what amounts to a pre-existing stochastic environment. Then I'll give you some evidence that this, in fact, actually occurs, okay, which is interesting, and then discuss some of the theoretical problems and ideas that occur along the way. And finally, I hope we get some feedback. So, you know, you probably with the recent developments in jets. The recent developments in jet you've heard about, you know, every now and then there's a step forward on magnetic fusion. And maybe I should answer the question right away by saying, why am I doing this? Because actually, confinement now has gotten too good, which is not what you've been hearing for the last 50 years or so. So, just as a quick review, you know, a token. Quick review: You know, a tokamak is a toroidal confinement device, and a figure of merit is the energy confinement time, the ratio of stored energy to injected power. And this is manifested by the structure of the profiles of things like pressure, density, and temperature. And as you can well expect, the crucial element in the story is what's going on in the plasma boundary. Boundary, as in so many things. And in the profile gradient at the separatrix is the key indicator of confinement. So, if you look at the history of fusion theory, I won't go through this, obviously, but there's kind of three phases. There was a beginning, which, you know, among other things, put Trieste on the map back in the 60s, and this is really. 60s, and this is really was the work. This early stage was the work of people you know, like Rosenbluth and Sagdev and Kadamtsev. And then there was a period of optimizing good confinement, and in particular, this thing called the H-mode, which you may have heard and which I'll explain, appeared during that period. But we're now in a period heading hopefully to ETER and something useful. To eater, and something useful of good confinement and good power handling, in which, in some sense, we need to figure out how to live with the consequences of good confinement and address trade-offs between confinement and the power loads on the plasma boundary. And this, of course, tends to a mix of physics and engineering considerations, and the engineering Considerations and the engineering considerations present rather interesting challenges for the physics. So, what is this thing, the H mode, the LH transition? It is fundamentally a transport bifurcation. So, you could think of a plot of the thermal diffusivity versus negative the pressure. And this is a poorly drawn cartoon, but it's a jump from one branch to another, which has a lesser slope. Has a lesser slope, okay, that occurs under certain circumstances, a critical power. And this is a transition to improved confinement. And the key element in this improved confinement, this quintessential S-shaped bistability curve, is the development of an insulation layer at the plasma edge. And that insulation layer is due to the development of a shear. Development of a sheared flow. In this particular case, since it's a magnetized system, a sheared E cross B flow. Okay. And this is a well-established phenomena. And the basic story, physics is well established. There are some subtleties, okay? And the subtlety is the trigger. So you might ask what physics allows the pressure gradient to steepen to start the feedback loop on the shear D cross B flow? On the shear D cross B flow. Well, that physics really is the coupling of the plasma of the energy in the turbulence to an edge zonal flow. And this is something that's a variant of a kind of thing you're probably familiar with, right? When you go to it, when you start to develop a zonal flow at, say, in thermal Rossby waves, you do that for a critical Rayleigh number, which is effective. Rayleigh number, which is effectively here a critical heat flux, and that immediately results in a drop in the Nusselt number. And in other words, a reduction in the turbulent heat flux. And that's exactly what goes on in here, this story. And there is a sort of a tricky phase in between of limit cycle behavior and so forth as the transition progresses. So this is now a four. This is now a 40-year-old story. It effectively saved the magnetic confinement program and it has had profound impact. It introduced the ideas of transport barriers and bifurcations and state phases and transitions, brought the role of flow feedback or flow shear feedback on confinement, introduced various ideas of predator-prey. Dynamics for the transition cycle and has most importantly forced us to face the consequences of marked transport reduction. And this highlights the need for transport regulation, not transport elimination, which is where we are today. And the upshot of all this is when one arrives in the state of In the state of very strong confinement, one of course develops a sharp pressure gradient at the plasma boundary. And this pressure gradient starts to challenge what I might call the boundaries set by 19th century physics, namely things like stability limits on ideal MHD type of processes that you can calculate with the variational principle, what's called Variational principle, what's called the energy principle, which was done in the 20th century, but and could have been done in the 19th for all practical purposes. And what happens, of course, is that is that when the stability limits are challenged, and again, the details are very still an open question on the physical process, but there is no doubt you get bursty. There is no doubt you get bursty relaxation or ELMS, edge localized modes. And these are not good because they put a huge transient heat load on the boundary of the system. And in ETER, the amount of energy released in one of these things is 20 megajoules. And that's a serious amount of energy, right? In a small region of a few of the plasma. Of the plasma facing component. So, to control these things was invented something called the RMP, the resonant magnetic perturbation. And that is basically a system of coils that is put around the plasma with the aim of producing some magnetic perturbations in the plasma that would hopefully relieve the sharp gradients. In other words, it would It would, in some sense, the aim was to stochasticize the magnetic field near the boundary of the plasma in order to limit these bursting events. So that's why we're doing this crazy problem, right? And you'll notice now you've come to the stage where it's actually necessary to, in some sense, degrade some of the good confinement a little bit. And there have been various, you know, obviously more here to talk about than could be said. To talk about than could be said, but there have been some very interesting experiments on how the COIL interferes or modifies the cycle to go to the LH transition, which is a subject maybe for another talk. But one thing that is unambiguous is that you have now to make, in a practical world, to make the transition with the coil on, with the RMP on. So you're making. The RMP on. So you're making a transition in now what you think is a stochastic magnetic field. And this increases the power required to make the transition. So this is a significant change. So in some sense, you're paying a penalty here for the improved power handling by living with a higher power threshold. You also now have to understand the dynamics of the transition in the presence of the Transition in the presence of the stochasticity, and that even more fundamentally drives you to turbulence in a stochastic magnetic field. So that's why we're doing what we're doing in case you think we're crazy, which we may very well be are. But so far, this reasoning has been, I would say, somewhat successful. And I should say this question of the operation. The operation in H mode and use of the resonant magnetic perturbation as part of the EDER design. So, one question is: is there any sort of evidence for stochasticity actually occurring? So, here we come to some interesting experimental work done in K-star. Okay, so yes, when you have Elm suppression. You have Elm suppression, you have a change in the structure, you know, you see a resonant surface or a resonance between the coil is close to the top of the edge layer of the pedestal. And you see something is going on as a consequence of that applied magnetic field in that's. Field in that they are that smells of stochastization in that profiles are flattened and flattened in the region of the resonance. Now, one can look at the turbulence in a variety of waves fairly conventionally. So you look at the cross-power spectrum and you study wave by coherence. And the main focus is on temperature fluctuations since these are accessible to a very clever. Accessible to a very clever little diagnostic, the electron-cyclotron emission and ECEI imaging. But one can go a little further and try to undertake something like a statistical approach. And in particularly, this leads us to a complexity entropy analysis. And so what is done effectively is to try to compute from the data the Shannon entropy, a measure of. Entropy, a measure of the missing information, the normalized Shannon entropy, which you might, which you can think of as the information, and the disequilibrium, which is the distance from the equiprobable distribution, and then putting it all together, the complexity, right? So you want to see, in some sense, what is the effect on the complexity of the turbulent state with and without the co- The coil being applied. Interestingly, the temperature fluctuation level actually increases with the coil, which, but the rescaled complexity of the temperature fluctuations decreases with Elm suppression. So, in some sense, you're getting perhaps you're getting a less complex pattern of temperature fluctuations that's consistent with something you might. Consistent with something you might think might be the outcome of applying stochasticity in the region where they're occurring. And one can support this a bit more by looking at a naturally elm-free phase, in other words, where there's where no coil use is needed to control the elms. And what one finds there is the temperature fluctuation level is larger, but Level is larger, but the rescaled complexity also increases. So, in some sense, it says that it's the absence of elms with the presence of the applied coil that produces the lower complexity turbulence. Interestingly, however, the bicoherence of the temperature fluctuations increases, which at first seems sort of says coupling increases or nonlinear transfer increases, which Transfer increases, which is a superficially contradictory result. And I should say that the bicoherence and the complexity are changing in different regions of particularly of frequency space. So in other words, the rescale complexity analysis is sensitive to higher frequency, which is saying effectively maybe the stochastic. Maybe the stochastic field is interfering or otherwise schmearing the higher frequency components in the turbulent field. And the bicoherence is stronger at comparatively lower frequencies. So the interpretation of this is that a partially stochastic island, a partially stochastic region at the top of this good confinement. Top of this good confinement layer may be able to explain both the changes in bicoherence and the rescaled complexity analysis. And this can be, you can think of this, I mean, we like to think of this as the applied stochastic field produces, you know, fine scale structure that results in the drop in complexity, gives an enhancement of the high K fluctuation. Of the high K fluctuations. As you see here from kind of an old simulation, you'll note the development of fine scale structure. And also, is another way of saying this is it may, another way of explaining this is the turbulence may somehow lock on or develop correlations with the ambient magnetic fluctuations that are magnetic. Fluctuations that are magnetic perturbations that are producing the stochastic field. So, this effectively brings us to the theoretical problem. So, about the simplest model one could think of is that of a resistive interchange and resistive interchange turbulence in a stochastic B field. And this is the single cell problem and beyond. And these resistive interchanges, I mean, I've Interchanges, I'm sweeping a lot of technical stuff under the rug. You can think of them as cells modified by the presence of a complex sheared and toroidal magnetic geometry, where a certain amount of the resistive means, of course, the freezing in law is broken and there is a certain amount of decoupling that allows interesting things to happen. And these are usually. And these, or you can think of them as sort of the magnetic confinement element of convection cells. And you may have seen these in the classical paper of Firth, Kaleen, and Rosenbluth, and also in the dynamo business in the work of Briginsky and Maitlis. They're certainly a player in controlling the geodynamo. And the interesting, it's probably better to listen to the words than. Better to listen to the words than worry about the view graphs. The interesting thing in this is, of course, that you absolutely positively have to maintain quasi-neutrality at all scales in this problem, which means you have to maintain a divergence-free current. In other words, the Debye length is so pathetically small compared to any other scale that any charge That any charge buildup is neutralized. And this has certain interesting consequences. And in particular, even if you start with a single large-scale cell in the stochastic B field, you're going to end up with a turbulence problem of multiple small scale cells and familiar concepts from turbulent transport. And all this is done in a somewhat non- A somewhat non-trivial configuration. So if you wanted to see one of the basic equations look like or the basic equations, you'd have them here for vorticity, for Ohm's law, basically in the electrostatic limit and pressure advection. And vorticity is simply divergence J equals zero. And what you've got in then for And what you've got in then for a single cell would be a cell sitting in a background of fixed magnetic perturbations. So, really, the system of equations then becomes a system of stochastic differential equations in a prescribed field, which is starting to get perilously close to a turbulence problem. And it gets even yes, okay, and it gets even closer. And it gets even closer from the consideration of maintaining divj equals zero. And the upshot of that is the following. Because the stochastic field modifies the parallel current, there must be a perpendicular current, and the perpendicular current is due to E cross B dynamics. To E cross B dynamics that's generated to maintain div J equals zero. And the upshot of that is that the system then forces the introduction of or forces the existence of small scale electrostatic microturbulence, which is necessarily generated by the beats of the stochastic magnetic field and the large cells. Field and the large cells. And this is similar to an interesting old problem done by Kadamta-Paguza on the matter of transport in a stochastic magnetic field, where if they wanted to maintain basically fixed flux transport, there had to be temperature fluctuations to maintain give P equals zero, which is an interesting result. Here, there are potential fluctuations. Fluctuations. So you can go off and do the things this crowd does in its sleep. I mean, you can set up a multiple scale problem and a mean field and an average and work through the whole thing. So then you're faced with the problem with looking at the evolution of the large-scale cell in the presence of all the small-scale goodies. And it makes for an interesting problem. Problem. And there are kind of not interesting feedback processes at work, in particular to maintain the effect of the small scales on the large, make it a turbulence problem with turbulent transport coefficients to be produced. And I would make the comment that then you have these complex feedback loops, and maybe without getting too much. And maybe without getting too much into the details, I would say that these electrostatic cells have recently, small-scale cells have recently been observed in D3D. D3D is a tokamak near us in San Diego and been dubbed electrostatic microbursts. So these small-scale cells are actually seen. The other interesting thing is that you can go. The interesting thing is that you can go through this calculation and quite naturally falls out the existence of a non-trivial correlation between the, in principle, applied magnetic perturbations and the convective cells. So it's saying the velocity field V that's produced in this process tends to lock on to the magnetic perturbations. This is, in some sense, one way. This is, in some sense, one way of looking at the complexity production reduction issue, but it also, I think, at least for me, is introducing a new phenomena. And one can go off and calculate things, which we've done. And there are several papers. But maybe it would be good to sort of jump to the bottom line here. The bottom line here is that this process is Here is that this process, this multi-scale interaction process, seems to explain why the stochasticity reduces the predictability or the complexity of the pedestal turbulence. And the interesting thing is the development of the correlation between the spontaneously generated turbulence and the ambient stochastic magnetic field. And this, and the theory is capable. The theory is capable of giving a testable prediction. And all of this looks sort of generally in line with some old simulations. Amazingly, there's nothing more recent of this problem that were done, where you see turning on the stochastic field sort of reduces the larger scale cells and generates a lot of fine-scale structure. So let me, before we burn all the time, Before we burn all the time, come to the discussion. So, the message is that a stochastic field and resistive interchange produce these microbursts, sort of a naturally multi-scale turbulent state, and that the fluctuations lock on to these imposed magnetic perturbations. So, this leaves me with the question I'd like to get some feedback on is how does Some feedback on is how does one understand this kind of turbulent state, the resistive interchange turbulence in a system like this? In a system where there's a pre-existing stochasticity? And how does one think about, say, our usual concepts of turbulence, things like cascades and so forth? Do we think of interaction of dressed structures? Rest structures? How do we incorporate the development of correlations between the stochastic field and the turbulence? How do we understand the energetics? So really having, in some sense, we've mapped out the single cell problem. The stage we're at now is trying to understand the turbulence problem. So I would, it's So I would, it's something of a progress report, but I'd be curious to hear any comments. Thank you. Thank you, Pat. Thank you very much. We do have time for a couple of questions. If you would like to ask someone, you could unmute yourself and ask or if you want you can type it in the chat box. Nigel, yes. Nigel. My colleague at UCSD. Nigel. So I was fascinated by this sort of fluctuation lock-on phenomenon because a similar thing happens in superfluid turbulence, which I think has some similarities to this because of the existence of line defects. What happens in superfluid turbulence is that the quantum vortex lines actually nucleate. Lines actually nucleate around the vorticity structures, high vorticity structures in the normal fluid. And so the two fluids essentially get coupled together. And then the end result of that is that the superfluid actually behaves like a classical fluid from the point of view of looking at the large-scale structure of terms. So have you have you, you know, I didn't really understand because you didn't have enough time to really explain this lock-on, but does that does that kind of coupling sound Does that kind of coupling sound related to what you're talking about? It does, in a sense, here that the magnetic perturbations are the defects. Okay, they're prescribed. And then, however, they enter the evolution of the cells, and that's what produces the lock-on. And the lock-on is a consequence of, again, the key point of maintaining divergence J equals zero. Divergence J equals zero at all orders. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think it's very similar, actually, listening. In the superfluid case, what happens is that the quasi-particles in the normal fluid basically transfer momentum to the superfluid through the normal cores of those vortex lines. And so the two fluids, which are supposedly decoupled in the usual pictures of superfluidity, actually become coupled. And so you have to worry exactly about the overall conservation of momentum. The overall conservation of momentum? Yeah, I think, well, I think it's similar. I mean, you just said the magic word, conservation of momentum. The divj equals zero in some sense is enforcing that. And the conventional wisdom is to say the two are uncorrelated. But again, that's neglecting the conservation of momentum. So once you bring that, then the correlations develop. Correlations develop. But then, you know, how do you maybe the back question to you? Well, it might be useful if the two guys from UCSD talk at home, but how does one understand, say, the superfluid turbulence in the presence of those interactions? Right. Yeah, I can tell you about that, but we should discuss this offline. Right. Thanks, Angel. Any other quick questions? Because you know, we'll have a different. Quick questions because you know we'll have a discussion after the first three talks this morning, so we can probably, in the interest of time, postpone further questions. And there's a quick question.
