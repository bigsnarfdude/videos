Michael well the original discussions also included Michael Farber and Alexandra Frank, Vasek Marsantovich and Yuli Rudiak. Okay, and I'm going to talk about Morita invariance of the invariant topological complexia. Well first just to remind you I'm going to call Robert You are going to call robot any mechanical system capable of moving autonomously. And the configuration space is going to be the collection X of all possible states of the system. And the motion planning problem is going to be given an initial state, a final state, find a path for the robot to move from initial to path. Move from initial to final state. So, this is achieved by the motion planning algorithm. That is a section of the evaluation fibrillation. So, if we have the path space going to the product, and so that this takes a path and assigns the Path and assigns the initial and final of this path. So then the section is going to be the motion planning algorithm. And we know that this section may or may not be continuous and it's going to exist, a global continuous section, only when the space is contractible. And then we have the definition of farburt, of the classical topological complexity that I'm going to use it in this. Use it in this sense. I'm going to use the original one that my topological complexity is going to be just the number of open sets needed to cover the product such that over each of them exists a continuous section. So, but what if in the configuration space we have a group acting at it? So, Acting at it. So maybe I should say: let's see if we have a real situation in which to have an action in the configuration space may have some meaning. So for instance, let's say that we have the configuration space is a disk with a reflection given by the action of Z2 in the disk, with all these fixed points here. Or if we have, suppose, a configuration space that is distorous, we say, That is this torus with a rotation here given by the action of the circle. So, the notation that I'm going to use for group actions is this notation that comes from group points. I'm going to use this notation for a group, a Lie group G acting on a topological space X. And an equivariant map is going to be a map between the topological spaces, a map epsilon between the topological spaces. Spaces, a map epsilon between the topological spaces, and homomorphism between the groups, such that when we do the image of gx, it's the same scene that applying phi to g and so do epsilon x. And all the maps considered are going to be continuous. So what would it mean an equivariant motion planning problem? Well, maybe we had an actual application Maybe if we had an actual application, we can have a more complete answer to this question. But without, there are different possibilities for equivalent motion planning problem. One of them would be if we have state X and state Y in different orbits, for instance, so a possible equivalent motion planning problem would be just find a path between them such that Between them, such that when we multiply this by g and when we multiply this by g, so we get the section give us the multiplication of the path alpha by g. So that will be one possible version of the equivalent motion planning problem. Another possibility is still having a state A. A state X and state Y, but instead of asking for a path from X to Y, we could ask for a broken path. So a path that starts at X but somehow in the middle finish at certain orbit, and we have another piece that starts in the same orbit, and so finish at the final state. So that would be a broken path. Broken path, and we would like if we multiply this by certain element, and we multiply this by maybe another element. So, we would like that the broken path given by the section is actually the multiplication of the two original pieces. So, that would be another possible way to understand an equivariant motion planning problem. And depending on which one is our And depending on which one is our equivalent motion planning problem, the answers will be different. I mean, the motion planning algorithms will be different. So the answer to the first problem is actually the equivalent topological complexity that was introduced years ago by Mark Rand and myself. And this equivalent topological complexity considers the path. Complexity considers the path space with the action of G by just multiplying the whole path by G. And consider the product G times G also with a G action. And this G action is going to be given by the diagonal action. And so with these two spaces being G spaces, we are asking our and of course being invariant, right? The the spaces, the open sets are going to be invariant. Open sets are going to be invariant with respect to the G action. So we are asking here for a section that is G invariant. So as we saw in the first statement of the problem, we are asking for a path, like in the regular sense, right? So we are asking more. So we are asking, we want a path and a path that also satisfies something else. So because of that, the classical topological complexity is a bound for this one. Okay, so this is the Okay, so this is the equivariant topological complexity. And if we go for an answer to the second problem, the second equivalent motion planning problem, so we have the invariant topological complexity that was introduced by Luvatsky and Marsantovich. So, this topological complexity is going to consider Is going to consider a variation of the path space. So instead of the path space, they consider the space of the broken path. So this P prime x is going to be the set of the two pieces that I mentioned before, where the first piece finishes in the same orbit that the second piece starts. So this is the new path case for this topological complexity. Complexity. And the evaluation from this path space is going to be just take the first point of the first piece of the broken path and the last point of the last piece of the broken path. And so these spaces, I mean both the spaces, the path space and the product, have an action of G times G. And this is the fundamental difference of this topological complexity with respect to the equivalent. Complexity with respect to the equivariant one. So we have here the action of g times g in this space that just multiply each piece of the broken path and we have also the action of g times g in the product, right? The natural action there. And then these open sets that are going to cover the product should be g times g invariant open sets. And then the remaining of the And then the remaining of the definition is the same, right? We are looking here for a section. Now these spaces are G tens G invariant and the section is a G tens G equivariant function. Okay, so some of the, I mean, if we calculate this topological complexity, see that the equivariant or the invariant in different group actions, in general, we will get different numbers, right? But there are some group actions. Some group actions that, even if there are different actions, they ought to be considered the same. So, I'm going to define here some idea of sameness to be equivalent. So, for instance, this action that I mentioned before, if we have the action here by rotation, is one acting in this torus. So, we see here that the orbits are circles here, right? So, we have a torus here, 48 and by these horizontal circles. Circles. And this action actually should be the same that just the action here, right? If we consider a circle just where the orbits are just the point. So if we have here the trivia group acting in the circle where the orbits are just the point, should be considered like the same that this action, that is the action of S1 in the church. Well, we may think of many reasons for these actions to be considered. Actions to be considered the same, but I guess the reason that we see right away is that the quotient spaces of these ones are the same, right? So the quotient space of this action and the quotient space of this are the same. But these are free actions, right? So who would like a notion of equivalent that somehow generalize this idea? I mean, for any action, when they are going to be equivalent, something that generalizes the idea that for free actions, the ones equivalent are the ones that have. ones equivalent and the ones that have the same quotient space. So in order to construct this idea of equivalence, I'm going to define what is an essential equivalence. So an essential equivalence is an equivalent map between two group actions. And in order to be essential equivalence, have to be essentially surjective. So essentially surjective is going to mean that this map here, this composition, Here, this composition is an open surjection. That what means is that this map, I mean, the map epsilon, the map between the topological spaces, doesn't have to be necessarily surjective, but it had to happen that for each Y in the second space, had to exist an X in the first space, such that the image of X by epsilon is in the same orbit. Epsilon is in the same orbit than y. So that's the meaning of being essentially subjective, somehow it reaches all the orbits. And we want also that this equivalent map is fully failed, which means that this product here is obtained as a pullback of these maps here. And this means that if we go in the domain here from any two points in the order. From any two points in the orbit, and we consider all the ways to go from x to x prime, these arrows we mean all the ways to go by different elements of the group. So this set here should be the same that this set here, all the ways to go from epsilon x to epsilon x prime by the elements of the group acting here. So the homeset here should be the same. So we have then that an essential equivalent. An essential equivalence had to reach all the orbits, and also the list of ejection induced by the isotropy. So, these two sets are the same. The isotropy is conserved by essential equivalences. Okay, and to make a relation of equivalence, we are going to say that two actions are morita equivalent if there exists a third action and a spound like this of essential. Spand like this of essential equivalences. So any notion that we want to define in a group action that is relevant to the geometric object, let's say, that is defined, should be invariant under Morita equivalent. Okay, so let's see some examples of group actions that are Morita equivalent. So for instance, So, for instance, if we have a trivial action in a topological space, so this is the same thing that having any group acting in the product of that topological space by the group. Where here the actions are by multiplication and the trivial action on X. So, these two actions are going to be Morita equivalence. And we can generalize this a little bit more, just saying if Little bit more, just saying if not necessarily the trivial group, but if we have a subgroup of G acting on X, so this action is going to be Morita equivalent that the bigger group G acting on the induced product, where the induced product is defined with this relation of equivalence. So these are examples of group actions that are morit equivalence. I'm going to show now a concrete Now, a concrete example of an equivalence of this type. So, for instance, let's consider this group action here, where we have the topological space is the interval and the group acting is Z2, and it's acting by reflection here. So, we have that, for instance, the orbit of this red point is this two point, the orbit of the blue point is just itself, right? So, it's a It's just itself, right? So it's the fixed point of the action. So this is the action of Z2 in the interval. And now let's consider separately here the action of S1 on the Mavius band. And the action is the one that have these orbits. So I mark here some red orbit that goes twice around the core orbit in the middle, and all the orbits goes around the core. Goes around the core orbit twice. So this group action here and this group action are morita equivalent. Moreover, there is an essential equivalence between them that is given just by the inclusion. So this epsilon here is just the inclusion of the inner valve here as a transversal of this foliation here. So we can see easily that this inclusion actually satisfies the Inclusion actually satisfies the conditions to be an essential equivalence. First, it's obviously not surjective, but it's essentially surjective, since any point here is in the same orbit of something that is in the image of epsilon. And also we can see that the isotropies here are also concerned. So, this is a concrete example then of that type of essential equivalence. So, we have this other. So we have this other type of essential equivalences if we have a group acting freely on X. So this is a free action here. So a free action is always equivalent to the trivial action on the quotient. And this is a very important example to have in mind of actions that are Morita equivalent. Any free action is going to be equivalent to the three. is going to be equivalent to the trivial action on the, I mean, the action of the trivial group on the quotient. And we can generalize this example by considering any normal group of G acting freely on X. So if we do the quotient here of G quotient H here acting in the space of orbits here X H. So this is Mauritius. So, this is Maurita equivalent to the action of the whole G on X. So, an example of this type of essential equivalences, if we have the action of Z2, Z two times Z two in this circle, where the first Z two is generated by this rotation row. This rotation rho, and the second Z2 is generated by the reflection sigma. And so we have the action of Z2 times Z2 here, where the orbits, the orbit of this green point, for instance, will be this four point. The orbit of this red point will have these two elements. The orbit of this orange point, we have these two elements. So this is the action of Z2, then C2 on the sarto. And then we can consider. And then we can consider the quotient of Z2 times Z2 by one of the Z2, by the rotation. And so this quotient gives me Z2 again generated by the reflection. And now if I make this Z2 acting in the circle, so this action here, according to the example before, will give me also an essential equivalence. So this is the action then just of Z2 in the circle by reflection, right? So the orbit of the green point now. The orbit of the green point now is just these two points. All the orbits here are two points, 70 is one, this is only one point, and this is only one point. So these two different actions then are going to be essentially equivalent. And in fact, these examples that I was showing to you are not just examples. Actually, Prong and School prove that all the essential equilibrium That all the essential equivalences are of that type. So, this is a very useful result since it gives like a very concrete form of essential equivalences that we can use to produce essential equivalence, but also to prove that Samsion ESO is not an essential equivalence. So, they prove that any essential equivalence is a composite of maps at the ones that I showed before. So, the quotient I where this one is. Where this one is acting freely in the space, or the inclusion map, where here we have the induced product defined as I did before. So these are the only types that the maps can be to be an essential equivalence. Well, I'm going to remind you a little bit of the classical theory of the Lustonic Schneiroma. So we know that the classical Lustonic Schneirama category of the topological Category of the topological space is just the minimal number of open sets contractible in the space needed to cover the space. And the equivariant version of this, what is written here, the equivariant category of the space is the minimum number of invariant open sets needed to cover the space. The space such that each one is compressible into an orbit. So we have the inclusion from the invariant set should factor through the orbit. So this is what the equivariant category is. So for instance, in the example that I mentioned before, if we have this action in the disk given by the reflection here, so we can see Here, so we can see that we can actually deform the whole space into this orbit, right? And this deformation is equivariant. So, in this case, the equivalent category is going to be just one. But in this second example, we can see that we can deform almost the whole torus in this orbit, right? But we have to leave some other orbit out. So, we have this space that will be G equivariantly. V G equivariantly categorical, but we need also some other invariant neighborhood to cover the other orbit. And so then the equivariant Rustami-Koshnuelman category of this action is true in this case. Okay, so this is the classical G-equivariant category, and we have later on a generalization of this category done by Category done by Club and Pupe. This is the A category. And the A category is the same idea that we have equivariant, I mean we have invariant open sets covering the space, but each one is allowed to deform, not necessarily in an orbit, but in any invariant set. So this is the A here is a class of invariant sets. So the A. So the A category is where we allow to deform the spaces in a set of the class A. And of course if we take as the class A, the orbit, so N will be the same, right? So that the A category is the category, the G category in that case, if we consider A as the class of orbits. Okay, so these equivariant and invariant topological complexities that I mentioned before. That I mentioned before, as well as the classical topological complexity, they have a characterization as an A category. So the characterization of the equilibrium topological complexity as an A category is like this. So the topological complexity is the same scene that the A category of this space, I mean of the product space, is the equivariant category of the product space, where the action here. Space, where the action here is the action that I mentioned before, the diagonal action here. And the class of spaces is just one space, just the diagonal here. So the idea is that anything in the product should be deformable into the diagonal. Okay, so this is then the characterization as an A category of the equivalent topological complexity. Though anyway, the equivalent topological complexity doesn't have a chance to be Morita. To be Morita invariant. I mean, this topological complexity is going to be different actually in spaces that are Morita equivalent. Since we have a conterexam, if we consider the action of S1 on S1 by rotation, I mean we have the S1, so the orbit here, everything is in the same orbit, right? Sing is in the same orbit, right? So the past space here is going to be just a point. So we know that these two things are more equivalent, but the topological complexity of this is one, just a point. Instead, the topological, the equivalent topological complexity of this other one, as I said before, we are asking more than the regular topological complexity is bounded by the classical topological complexity of the circle. So because of that, have to be greater or equal than two. Had to be greater or equal than 2, right? And the other is 1. So the equivalent topological complexity is not going to be invariant of Maurici equivalence. And so let's go to the invariant topological complexity that also has a characterization as an A category. And the characterization is this one. The invariant topological complexity is the same that the L'Ouster Luxene The Luftwaffe category of this product now with the action of G times G, and where we allow each invariant open set here to deform into this space that is the saturation of the diagonal with respect to the G times G action. Okay, so now we have again the whole product covered by invariant sets. This invariant should be invariant. invariant sets, this invariant should be invariant by the G times G action, but we allow them to contract into things into the saturation of the diagonal. Okay, so then we set ourselves to actually prove that this one is invariant under Morita equivalence, and actually it is. Well, first, I mean, in order to prove this invariant, we are going to put This is the invariant, we are going to prove actually a more general result. We actually prove that the A category is moderate invariant. To prove that, well, we consider an equivalent map as before, and if we have a G invariant set, if we have this G invariant set here, for each invariant set, we are going to consider A prime, which is to do the image of that invariant. image of that invariant set by epsilon and to do the saturation of that image. Okay, so given A, A' is the saturation of the image of A. And so if A is a class of G invariant sets here, A prime defined in this way is going to be a class of H invariant sets in here. And so with these definitions we prove that the A category We prove that the A category of this group action is actually the same that the A prime category of this other group action. So to prove this, actually, we use heavily the characterization of Pronk and school of the essential equivalences. So we consider the A prime sets as these ones. I mean, if we have the A sets here. If we have the A sets here, we consider the quotients, or we consider also, if we have B here, we consider the induced products here. And we prove that the A category of this action is the same scene that the AK category of this action and same scene here. In order to prove this theorem, we use the equivariant principle bounded theory here. Okay, and once we have that proof, we use these small lemmas that these things are all the same. If we multiply these quotients here, it's the same thing that we do the product, and then we do the quotient, and the same thing with the induced product. And we also observe that to do the saturation of the diagonal of this space here, respect to this action, is the same thing that doing. Is the same thing that doing the saturation of just X doing the quotient space after that. And doing the saturation of the induced product is the same thing that doing the saturation of X here and doing the induced product after that. And so by using this result, we were able to prove that the A category of this space, x times x, space x times x where we allow to deform here to the saturated diagonal is the same scene that the a category of this space where we allow to deform to here. And each of these things, I mean this scene here is nothing but the invariant topological complexity of x and this scene here is the invariant topological complexity of xk. So then in that in that way we prove that the invariant We prove that the invariant topological complexities of these things are the same. And then we have as a corollary that if we have two group actions that are Morita equivalent, the classical equivariant G category is the same. So we prove the result for the Chatham G equivariant category. But also the invariant topological complexity is also the same. So then we do have a well Do have a well-defined now number that is the same across all the actions that are Morita equivalent. So that gives in particular a well-defined number for orbifolds that are exactly defined in that way. I'm going to define now what an orbifold is. So an orbifold is a topological space, we say, Morita equivalence class of orbifer structures. Of orifice structures, and a specific such structure is given by a compact group acting on X. So essentially, a group action of this particular characteristic with finite isotropies is going to give us orbit for. In the past, actually, in our paper, we wrote that almost all orbits are Orbits are obtained in this way that they were called representable orbifas. But lately, it was proved actually that all orbifas are represented. This is a very recent result. All orbifas are representable, so actually all orbifas are given as a group action of this type. So this invariant is now good, well-defined for all orbifers. So these two group actions are Morita equivalent, they define the same order before, right? So all the class of Morita equivalent group actions define the same order for. So for instance, the example that I showed before, the Z2 acting in the inner band and S1 acting in the Maybius band, these two actions are morita equivalent, so both define the same. Equivalent, so both define the same orbifold. And the orbifer that they define is this one. I mean, it's just the orbifold that topologically is this half-interval here with one singular point. So the singular point with isotropy 2 and all the others with trivial isotropy. So we can define then a topological complexity for all defaults, or at least an invariant topological complexity for all defaults. For orbifold. And our definition is going to be just the orbifer invariant topological complexity of the orbifold, notated in this way, is actually the invariant topological complexity of the group action present in the orbifold. I mean, of any of the group actions that present the orbifer, right? All of them will have the same invariant topological complexity. So, for instance, for this particular case, of this orbit Particular case of this orbifa, this topological complexity is going to be is going to be one. And I could calculate this topological complexity in this group action, right? I mean, this group action of S1 acting in the Mebius band define this or default. But of course, I'm not going to calculate it in this one. I'm going to calculate it in this. And this is actually part of the point of this, right? That we have now a way to calculate a topological complexity. A topological complexity with a simpler version of the action. So I'm going to calculate the topological complexity just in the interval, I mean Z2 acting in the interval by reflection. So if I have here the initial state, the final state, so I can say the algorithm is going to be go to the center, shortest path, and from there go to the final position, shortest path. So that would be the two pieces of the Will be the two pieces of the broken path. And of course, in the orbifa, that will be just go to the singular point and back to the final. So the idea, as I said before, will be then that we solve the class of equivalent group actions, we can calculate now the topological complexity in a simple model, let's say, of the group action. Also, this will give a way to... Also, this will give a way to go back and forth. I mean, the essential equivalences will give a way to go back and forth between the different group actions. So, for instance, we can transport actual algorithms. I mean, we can have an explicit algorithm to move in a group action and translate it to move in a more complicated equivalent group action. Okay, I see that's That's all what I have. So, thank you very much. So, thank you, Elena. So, is there any question, any comments? Oh, Miguel, I'm reading the question here of Miguel. Miguel, yes. No, no, in general, I don't have a we don't have any particular word before in mind. Though though these kind of constructions For instance, the disk, I mean, my idea of including the disk there are like the building blocks of the cipher vibrations, for instance. So, all the orbitals obtained by cipher vibrations, where we can calculate like the partial, let's say, parts there of the construction. There may be one possible example that may help this to calculate, but we don't have the calculation. But we don't have the calculation. Also, we don't have an application, let's say, not necessarily a concrete application, but I guess I would like to have an idea what would it mean in a real application to have a group action in this space. And I've seen that, or even in an or before, no, I mean, what would it mean for Would it mean for a robot that the configuration space is an orbit for it? So, I don't know if anybody has a suggestion in that direction, but I mean, I see in that I'm at least a little lost about what this in may mean. Okay, thank you. Uh uh there is a Israel yes, can you ask? Can you ask? Oh, yes. So, yeah, so I have a question regarding the visualization of the Obi fields in one of your slides, which that's kind of fascinating for me. When you prove that those two things were equivalent and you define the OB folds, and you take the line and kind of fold it onto itself, and I just want to understand. And I just want to understand that bit more. If I remember the slide correctly, what's happening is you are taking the quotient of those equivalence classes. So in the line situation, yeah, so it's much easier to talk with the slides. It's a slice of visualization of the, oh, yeah, exactly here. But in the example where you have the line segment that is equivalent operation on the line segment. Operation on the line segment? Yeah, yes, this one. So, if I understand correctly, what you're doing in the visualization is to say that I just take the quotient over the equivalence points and I kind of fold the line onto itself. And then is it true that when you say the singularity is sort of the middle point of the line segment, is that how I would interpret it this notion? Yes. Yes, I mean like this actually, this example here is like the local model of all orbifers. I mean all orbs locally are like that. It's like a final group acting in the space. And so the isotropy of the point here, so if the isotropy is greater, it's not trivial, so then it will be the singular points of the orbital. So here the Of the orbit. So here, the singular point in here will be this. It's a singular core. I mean, all those points in this other model will be the ones that go to this, right? To the singular point here. So this thing of the folding that you are saying, I see the folding just by the, I'm not sure if you're saying the folding in the Mabus band, but the folding in the The folding in the interval is just the one given by the reflection, the reflection of Z2 acting in this interval and identifying this point with this point, for instance. So once that we have an algorithm here, so what you can transport to the other model would be if you have some initial point here and a final point anywhere here. Anywhere here. So the idea of the path here will be that you will go somehow in a transversal with here, you will jump in the blue orbit and we will come up here and that will be your other piece of the broken path. So we will have an alpha here and a beta here with two pieces separately. So in this example that I show, the two pieces That I show, the two pieces go like together, let's say, right? Because they happen to finish in the same orbit, and the orbit is just a point. But it could be a space like is happening in the Mebius band, right? That is a jump, right? You have a piece, jumps in the orbit, and so goes to the final position. So, I guess the follow-up question is more of a curiosity. Is how complex do you expect, you know, if I'm thinking about OB. Expect, you know, if I'm thinking about OBFold as some sort of come with some form of singularity and stratification, how complex can it potentially be in the current setting? I mean, do I expect sort of very complicated structure with sort of singularities across different dimensions? Is there a way to kind of describe, you know, in terms of stratification, how the orbifolds in your definition might look like? Yes, orbifolds can have a singularity. Can have singularities of all dimensions. Yes. Okay, thank you. Okay, there was, I think, one more question by Jose. Yes, can anybody hear me? Yes, all these invariants are defined by using covers, but we know in the classical We know in the classical case that the category of Lusten-Sniedermann or topological complexity can be defined in a more categorical way using Y-HED type or Ghana type characterization. So do you think it is possible to do this for your invariants? Thank you. Yes, I mean like I seemed um I don't recall exactly but maybe I don't know if Basek is here but uh I think that uh Basek proved the gave the characterization as white type right of the invariant TC. I'm not sure are you here, Basek? Andreas I assume that this characterization exists in the original page. Exist in the original paper of the invariant DC. I'm not completely sure, but I've seen it. It is done. Okay, thank you. Okay. So yes, so Andres and Serze and gave the original Blubowski and uh Amar Santovich, yeah. Okay, any further comment? No? Okay, so thanks again, Elena. Thank you. And okay, so this is the end of our formal program for today. So, but like you So, but um like uh yesterday, uh we can go in the in the two rooms for discussion. So as you as you prefer and okay so bye bye see you in the wounds
