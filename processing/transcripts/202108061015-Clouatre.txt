Michael and Stefan for organizing this conference and especially for applying to get a spot here. I understand that this must not be very pleasant. And thank you all as well for doing such a good job that we actually got a spot. Of course, this is great for the community. So thank you very much. Yes, so I want to talk about the Crozet conjecture in this talk. And to be clear, I have never worked on I have never worked on this, never really thought about it before reading these papers. And the papers that my talk is based on, the papers that my talk is based on are these two things. A paper by Ransford and Schwenninger, another one by Ostermann and Ransford. And they're quite short and beautifully written. So I encourage you to go read them. There might be some mistakes during this talk, and of course, these are all my own. So if you want more precise. All my own. So, if you want more precision, then you should go read those papers. Okay, so I would like to start by giving you some motivation for this conjecture. And I think the natural way to do that is to discuss spectral sets. Sorry, there's this bar on top of the screen that's kind of annoying me. I don't know why it's there. Oops, that's not what I wanted to do. Okay, well, I'll just deal with it, I suppose. Okay, so yeah, spectral sets, as I was saying. So, um, throughout my talk, omega will be a bounded open convex subset of the complex plane, and t will be a bounded linear operator on some Hilbert space H. Now, here's a definition. We see that omega is a spectral set for t. If whenever you look at the polynomial p applied to your operator, you take the norm, then this is dominated by some constant times the sup norm of p over the set omega. Okay, more precisely, omega. Set omega. Okay, more precisely, omega is a q spectral set if this inequality holds with the constant q on the right-hand side. And there's a variation on this notion, which will be useful for my talk, and that is that of a complete spectral set. So if the same condition holds not just for polynomials, but for matrices of polynomials of any size, then you see that omega is a complete Q spectral set. Okay, and there is a trivial reformulation of this condition that I will be. Reformulation of this condition that I will be using a bit throughout my talk, which is the following. So, denote by A of omega the sub-algebra of continuous functions on the closure of omega that consists of those functions that are actually holomorphic on the interior. Okay, so this is what A of omega is. Then the condition that omega is a Q-spectral set is equivalent to the following. So, look at the polynomial functional calculus, which I denote by theta t here. And the condition is that this should be that you can extend. Is that this should be uh that you can extend this to a homomorphism on A of omega with norm at most q. Okay, so omega is a q spectral set if and only if this map theta t extends to a dundant homomorphism on a of omega with norm at most q. And this works for complete versions as well. All right. So before starting to discussing, starting to discuss the Cosette conjecture, let me make a few more comments about these spectral sets in case you haven't thought about these objects before. So the first observation is that if omega is a spectral set for T, If omega is a spectral set for t, then it has to contain the spectrum of t. That's not too hard to see. So, right away you see that there is some kind of relationship. It seems that probably explains the name, spectral set. And in fact, when you're lucky and your operator T is normal, then you get something very nice. You get that the spectrum is the best kind of spectral set. It's a complete one spectral set for T. Okay, so this is a consequence of the spectral theorem. Generally, however, the spectrum is not quite rich enough to do the job. Typically, the spectrum is not a spectral set for T. This is easily seen. So, you could have a non-zero operator with zero spectrum, in which case the condition for being a spectral set fails for the function z, right? A function z applied to your operator is non-zero, yet the supernormal of z over the spectrum would be zero. And the last comment I want to make about spectral sets is the following, which is About spectral sets is the following, which is kind of a nice observation. This is just fundamental inequality. It says that the unit disk is always a complete one-spectral set for any Hilbert space contraction. And in light of this fourth item here, you might wonder if there are other such sets in the world that, you know, you don't need to think about them too much. They will always work out to be a spectral set for a given operator. Okay, so what is another instance of a naturally occurring spectral set? And before hearing about the And before hearing about the Jose conjecture, I don't know that I would have been able to give a good answer to this question. But now I can. Oops, there's something in the chat. I don't know if something is going on. Oh, Meredith is telling me how to get rid of the bar. Go to the three dots. Oh, it disappeared. Just maybe just reading the advice of Meredith fixed it. This is amazing. Okay. Well, thank you, Meredith, for this magical help. Yes, so as I was saying. Um, yes, so as I was saying, um, before uh learning about the closet conjecture, I don't know what I would have given as an answer to this question, but now but now I know. And this is where the numerical range enters the picture. Okay, so let me remind you what the numerical range of an operator is. So it's the set, which I will be known by w of t, that's a subset of the complex plane that consists of all those complex numbers of the form inner product of t with c, where x is a unit vector in the helmet space. C, where x is a unit vector in the helmet space. Okay, um, there are a few uh basic things that are known about this that I want to mention here. The first is that, um, and this is not hard to see, that the closure of the numerical range, this always contains the spectral. Okay, so in view of what I said in the previous slide, you know, you might start to guess that maybe the numerical, the numerical range could be a spectral set because it contains the spectrum. But then, of course, you have to address the fact that the spectrum The fact that the spectrum typically is not rich enough to do the job. And the other fact I mentioned here about the numerical range is that seemingly it is rich enough to prevent this obvious pathology that I mentioned before, right? So it is known that the supremum of the modulus of all points, the numerical range, this is a quantity that is comparable to the norm of t. So, you know, this numerical range does not have the same problem as the spectrum has. So it's not possible to have a non-zero operator that has zero numerical range, okay, because of the. Zero numerical range, okay, because of these inequalities. So, um, this is very, very weak kind of evidence that the numerical range might possibly be a spectral set, but you know, maybe you can wonder if that's the case. And the first kind of concrete indication that this could be true is the following theorem that was proved by De Leo and De Leon in 1999. And it says the following: so you have your operator T acting on H, and again, you have your bounded open convex subset. Again, you have your bounded open convex subset omega. And you assume that the set omega contains an emergency range of t. Okay, and then what De Lion de Lion says is that omega will have to be a spectral set for t. Okay, and in fact, it will be a q spectral set for t for some constant q that we can write explicitly that depends only on omega. So that's not quite proving what I alluded to earlier. It's not quite proving that the numerical range is a spectral set, right? Because you have Range is a spectral set, right? Because you have to take something that's a bit bigger than the numerical range just for in order for this to work. But then you might think, okay, well, here's maybe what you can do. You can just kind of inflate omega, sorry, not omega, you can inflate the numerical range a little bit, get some bounded open convex subset, apply this theorem, and then maybe take some kind of limiting procedure, like shrink down to the numerical range. One issue with this approach, however, is that the dependence on this constant Q on omega is not the greatest. Omega is not the greatest. Okay, for instance, it tends to infinity as the area of omega tends to zero. So you might have some problems if you just try this naive approach that I just mentioned. But then eight years later, José came about and actually proved exactly what we were wondering about just a minute ago, namely that the numerical range of T always is a spectral set. Not only that, it's always a complete spectral set and with a constant that depends on nothing. Okay, so Coset proved that the numerical range is a complete 11.0. Range is a complete 11.08 spectral set. All right. Okay, and now the discussion shifts toward finding the kind of the actual value of this constant here. So the Sharp constant. So the basic question is this. What's the smallest Q that works in Crozet's theorem? So what's the smallest Q for which the numerical range of T is always a complete Q spectral set for T? So whatever it is, cool. So, whatever it is, we know because of Crozier's theorem that it is, whatever the answer is to this question, it is at the value at most 11.08. Okay. And then Cruz actually had a guess. Cruz's guess was that the answer should be two. So that's quite a jump from 11.08. So why would you guess that two is the correct answer? Well, one thing that is easy to see is that you cannot hope for something better than two, okay? For something smaller than two, and that's in view of the following. Something smaller than two, and that's in view of the following classical example. So consider the following matrix T, two by two matrix, zero, two, zero, zero. You can just calculate this by hand. The numerical range of this matrix is the closed unit disk and the norm is two. All right, so if you want the numerical range to be a Q spectral set for this operator, then there's no way this can work if Q is to be less than two. Okay, so because the question is about all operators, then the smallest constants, whatever it is, cannot be less than two. Whatever it is, cannot be less than two. And basically, Jose's guess is that that's the worst that can happen. Okay. Now, before kind of discussing some partial progress that was obtained over the years towards this conjecture, I think I should give you some motivation as to why you may care about the value of this sharp constant. In my work, in my research, I'm not used to caring about the value, the sharp value of constants. So, why would you care about something like this here? Something like this here. And in my opinion, the kind of one great reason to care is because of normal dilation. So let me remind you a little bit how these things go. So take two Hilbert spaces, H and K, with H contained in K. And again, you have your arbitrary operator T on H and omega, your bounded open convex subset of the complex plane. And then a normal operator U acting on the big Hilbert space will be said to be a normal dilation on the boundary of omega. On the boundary of omega for t, if two conditions hold. First of all, the spectrum of u is contained in the boundary of omega, and the second condition is that you have a kind of a standard dilation condition. So you can recover any polynomial f applied to t as the compression to h of the same polynomial applied to u. So how should you think of this? You should think of this as a generalization of the notion of a unitary dilation for a contraction, right? So there's a classical theorem of non- also does a classical theorem of knowledge that says that for every contract every contraction there is a unitary dilation so what's a unitary uh operator it's a normal operator whose spectrum is contained in the unit circle okay and being a dilation is just the fact that this equality holds okay so you should think of this unitary dilation of the contraction business as the special case as a special case of a normal dilation where the set omega is the unit disk and i don't think i need to to uh elaborate this point too much but of course Belaborate this point too much, but of course, the existence of the unitary dilation for a contraction, this has changed the face of operator theory. It really has had dramatic impact, really connected operator theory with function theory in a very intimate way. So it stands to reason that these normal dilations, which is basically just a version of a unit-three dilation for more general domains, that this would be a useful thing. Now, if you don't find this convincing, I'm afraid that this will be an axiom for the rest of my talk that normal dilations are a good thing. That normal dilations are a good thing. Okay, this is a thing that you actually might want. Now, why is this connected with the sharp value of the constants in Coset's theorem? It's because of the following fact, which is a combination of two theorems, one of which is U2 Arvison, the other one is U2 Paulson. So this theorem, roughly speaking, says that the two things are equivalent. First of all, is that your operator is similar to one that admits a normal value. Okay, so that's equivalent to. Okay, so that's equivalent to the fact that the set omega is a complete spectral set for T. Okay, but in fact, this theorem says something more precise, and it is actually important for the point I'm trying to make here. So what it says is this, you fix a positive constant q, okay, then the following statements are equivalent. First, you can find an invertible x, okay, which conjugates your opportunity t to one that has a normal dilation on the boundary of omega, and such that the conditioning number of x, so the norm of x time its inverse, is at most q. norm of x time its inverse is at most q so this is if and only if the set omega is the complete q spectral set for t okay so notice how the q enters the enters in both statement here that's really kind of the what i want to emphasize so determining what's the smallest value of q that you can put in the statement omega is a complete spectral set then this basically tells you how much you have to pay to conjugate your operator to one with your normal dilation okay how violent you have to be to your poor operator t so that it becomes To b to your poor operativity t so that it becomes um such that it becomes that uh it becomes a one with a normal valuation, and then you can imagine things like numerical linear algebra or something, the conditioning number actually plays a role. So, um, I think that this gives good motivation for determining the value of the short constant in Jose's theorem, all right. Um, so now let's get let's get into it. So, so before I um mention some of the progress towards Jose's conjecture, uh, what I would like to do is. For this conjecture, what I would like to do is kind of explain in the first place why you should expect the numerical range to work out as a spectral set for T. So before I read these papers, I really didn't know how it worked. So I would like to kind of convey this to you. I think there's some kind of nice intuition here. So the next two slides will be a touch technical, but I think they're informative. I think at least I got something out of reading this. I'm trying to convey what I learned to you here. So here's the basic So here's the basic insight. Okay. I recall what a setup is: you have a bounded open convex subset omega of the complex plane. On these slides, I will assume that omega has smooth boundary. Okay, so this, of course, is not required. You can just approximate your way out of this problem, but I don't want to worry about this too much. So let's assume that the boundary is smooth. We have an operator T on H and its numerical range is containing omega. Okay, and I've highlighted in red here the two crucial And I've highlighted in red here the two crucial pieces of information. Okay, we have convexity for omega, and omega contains the numerical range. Now, I'm assuming the boundary is smooth, so let's pick a parameterization gamma for it with positive orientation. So let me remind you some kind of calculus convention here. So you have this bounded set in the plane. In principle, you have two choices of orientation for the boundary. And the one that you call positive is the one that is such that when you Is such is the one that is such that when you walk on the boundary along this orientation, then the region is to your left. Okay, all right, and now fix a point between zero and one and apply gamma to that point so that that spits out a point on the boundary of omega, which I will call zeta. Take the derivative of gamma at that point t, multiply by i and call this beta. Okay, so I drew a picture here to represent what's going on. It is a little small, however, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to quick quit full screen. To quick quit full screen here, hopefully, it doesn't break zoom, and I'm going to just zoom in a bunch so that we can all see what's going on. Well, okay, try this again. Okay. Okay, so let me recap what we have. We have this bounded open convex subset omega, the complex plane. This is the stuff in the red, okay, with smooth boundary. It contains the numerical range, which is the blob in purple. Here, of course, this shape is not really. Blob in purple here. Of course, this shape is not really realistic for the numerical range, but that doesn't really matter to me. Okay, the only thing that matters is that it's contained in the set omega. Then, what else did we do? We have our parameterization that parametrizes the boundary. We plugged in the point E and we got a point zeta on the boundary. That's the blue dot here. And we also calculated the derivative of the parameterization at that point. So, by standard calculus, we get a tangent vector, which I drew in green here, which points in this direction because the orientation of the boundary is. Because the orientation of the boundary was chosen to be the positive one. Okay? And now, what did I do with this derivative? I multiplied it by i, right? So you can sit up here. Beta is i times the derivative. What happens when you multiply by i? You rotate by pi over two radians in the counterclockwise direction. So you get from the green vector to the orange vector, which is what I call beta. Now recall what the crucial two assumptions were. It was that omega is convex. Okay, so what does that buy you? Here it buys you. So, what does that buy you here? It buys you the fact that omega, whatever it is, lies entirely on one side of this green dotted line. Okay, this is by convexity, basically. And what was the other piece of information? It was the fact that the numerical range was contained in omega, and this is why I drew the purple blob inside of omega here. Okay, now here's the key observation: pick any point, little w in the pink or purple set here, and form the vector w minus zeta. So that's the vector in yellow. is zeta so that's the vector in yellow okay now because this vector because this point um w is inside of omega then this vector um in yellow points approximately in the same direction as beta does okay so that that's just then that's really what i want the point i want to make with this picture is this is that when you look at double u minus zeta you get a vector that points approximately in the same direction as beta okay so now let me go back to uh full screen here if i can Yes, okay. Okay, so this was the picture. We just discovered that w minus zeta always pointed approximately in the same direction as beta, which means what? Which means that if you take the inner product of these two vectors as vectors in our two say, then you will get something non-negative. Okay, so here's what I wrote here: W minus zeta, inner product with beta is always non-negative. Of course, these are complex numbers. You can rewrite this inner product as this real part. Inner product as this real part right here. And because this is true for every point W in the numerical range, then it's readily verified that this implies something about your operator T. It implies that this real part of this operator is non-negative as an operator. Okay. And now there's one more thing you do here is that you look at the real part of this object. Okay, do one over two pi i times the derivative of the parameterization times the inverse of. times the inverse of gamma of t minus the operator capital t. Note that this is invertible, why? Because gamma of t is a point on the boundary and the spectrum is contained in the closure of the numerical range and that's in the interior. So that's always an invertible operator. Let's calculate the real part of that guy. It's not completely clear why I'm doing this right now. It's going to be clear in one minute. So you calculate the real part of this. So you do that operator plus it's a joint divide by two. You rearrange a bunch of things. Two, you rearrange a bunch of things, and then you get this nice expression here. Okay, which, and what you should notice about this expression is the following: is that in the middle, I have exactly the operator that we discovered was non-negative in the previous line. I have a one over four pi, which doesn't matter. And then on the left and on the right, I have conjugated by an operator and it's a joint. Okay, so that preserves positivity, which means that this entire thing is non-negative. Okay, so this is the crucial insight of De Lion de Lion, is that when you take the real Of Der Lion-Der Lion is that when you take the real part of this quantity, you get something non-negative. It's still completely unclear why this should relate to spectral sets, but this will come in the next slide. Okay, so this is the thing you should remember. So this stuff in purple here or red, this is what you should remember. We have a real part of this operator is non-negative. Okay, and then the next ingredient is the Cauchy transform. So observe that if you take a function f in A of omega, remember what that means. It means that f is continuous. Remember what that means. It means that f is continuous on the closure of omega and it's holomorphic on the interior. Then, by the Maurice-Stunford functional calculus or Cauchy's formula, you can write, you can define or write f of t, f applied to your operator t in the following way. The integral of f against this operator-valued function, integrate along the boundary of omega. So that's one fact, and here's another fact which is not so trivial, which Which is the following lemma, okay? You start again with your function f and a of omega, and what you do is you take the Cauchy transform of the conjugate function of f. Okay, and I call this function alpha of f. So pointwise on the interior of omega, what's alpha of f? It's this. You integrate along the boundary of omega, the conjugate function of f against the Cauchy kernel. And the statement of the lemma is that this function actually lies in A of omega, okay, and it norm decreases. So alpha of f and That norm decreases. So, alpha of f and norm is at most the norm of f. So, I claim that this is, okay, so there's two things here. So, first of all, it's pretty clear that whatever that function is, it's holomorphic in the interior, okay, simply because of its definition here. The dependence in the integral on Z here is clearly holomorphic. So, that's holomorphic on omega. That's easy. What's not so clear at all to me, at least, is that this extends continuously all the way to the boundary of omega. Okay, but that is. Okay, but that is true, and I claim this is a classical fact here. I apologize if this is a historical inaccuracy. So, in a paper of Jose and Palencia, this is they point out that this was known to Neumann. So, that sounds pretty classical to me, but again, I apologize if this is not quite the right attribution. Okay. All right, and then here's what happens. So, let's take this operator f of t that we saw above. Okay, now what this lemma gives us, it gives us a new function, alpha of f and psi. gives us a new function alpha of f inside of the algebra a of omega so i can apply that new function to t and i'll take it's a joy okay and if you just kind of write down what the definition definition is with the integral combine everything you'll get this funny expression okay two times the integral of f times this object in purple which we like very much because this is the thing that we know something about from the previous slide okay so this is what degion deon observed is that this stuff is always non-negative and now And now, here's what happens. Now, you can actually estimate the norm of the left-hand side. So, this implies readily, because this is quite an elementary argument once you have positivity, you conclude that the norm of the operator on the left here is at most two times the norm of the function f. Okay, and really, I'm not hiding much, I'm not sweeping much under the rug here. This is done in a paper by Jose Palencia, and the estimation is actually quite elementary. And I think you can probably imagine why it's used. And I think you can probably imagine why it's useful when you want to estimate the size of an integral to have positivity. Okay, so this is really what's going on here. The rest is seemingly quite elementary. Okay, so this, as far as I can tell, this is the essence of what your assumptions buy you when you want to prove Coset's theorem. Convexity and the fact that the numerical ranges contain omega, this buys you this fact. And from this point on, the analysis that at least I will be discussing is quite a Be discussing discussing is quite a bit softer. Okay, so this was kind of the hard analysis part. And once you know this, then things get a bit smoother. And notice, by the way, and I call you know that you get a two here, okay, which I colored in blue or teal. And remember that Jose's conjecture was what was that the norm of f of p was at most two as well. Okay, so you know, maybe things are starting to come together here. There's a two on the right-hand side. Of course, you don't have the right of the correct thing on the left-hand side, but still, there's a two. Still, there's a two, okay. So, I just remind you here what José's conjecture was. All right, and now, um, basically, what I would like to do is go back and discuss these two results, that of DeLion, De Leon, and of José, in light of this kind of piece of information that we've extracted and see how this comes about. Okay, so here's some partial progress, if you want, towards Cosi's conjecture. Okay, so it's not really correct what I'm saying here because this was proven before the conjecture. Saying here because this was proven before the conjecture, but we're trying. What are we trying to do here? So, in purple at the top of the slide, I've just kind of summarized what we know. Okay, convexity and the containment of the numerical range got us this fact that f of t plus alpha of f, remember what alpha of f is, it's the Cauchy transform of the conjugate function. Apply this to t type the adjoint, then the norm of that as an operator is at normal two times the norm of f. And the goal, the ultimate goal is to take this information and say something about the norm of Can say something about the norm of the polynomial functional calculus, theta of t, right? The ultimate goal will be to show that the norm of theta of t is at most true. So let's see what can be said. Okay, and the first thing I would like to do is mention how Delion-De Lion go about proving their theorem. Okay, so let us denote by R the operator that associates to a function f. This is very quantity here that we discovered something about in the previous slide. Okay, so r of f is f of t plus alpha of f t star. So what do we know? We know that this. So, what do we know? We know that this operator has normal true. And the goal is to say something about theta t. So, and what DeLion-De Lion do is actually quite nice. They say, well, theta t can be factored as r composed with some other function theoretic operator s omega. And which is defined just in terms of defined on the functions of omega. I don't really want to write this in detail. I mean, Delion Delion are quite explicit with what that is. And then, once you know this, then this. And then, once you know this, then this is great because if you're interested in the norm of theta of t, then this will be, this will give you what will give you that the norm of theta of t is at most the norm of r times the norm of s omega. Okay, the norm of r is at most two. Okay, so this is the entire point of the previous slides. So that gives us that the norm of theta t is at most two times the norm of s omega. And then they work hard and they get an estimate on the norm of s omega, which is this quantity. Okay, it involves some kind of geometric quantities, the diameter of omega and the. The diameter of omega and the area, and so on. And this is where you see what I announced on my second slide, I guess. Third, whatever, that I told you that if you look at the De Lion-De Lion result, then the constant that they got had a dependence on omega, which was a bit tricky. You can see right here that when the area of omega tends to zero, this constant blows up. But anyway, this is more or less how the proof of De Leon-De Leon works. De Leon-De Leon works. And now I also mentioned to you that eight years later, Jose came about and said, forget about all of this omega stuff, about these crazy constants. You can just do it with 11.08. Now, I'm not going to tell you how Jose does this. His picture is extremely complicated. I don't really understand what's going on in there. One thing I want to point out, however, okay, so I should say one thing. As far as I can tell, the techniques are not unrelated to the De Lion-Der Leon paper. It just seems to be more. De Lion-Dénion paper. It just seems to be more careful estimation of integrals. One thing I want to say, though, about José's paper is: I want to point out what I think is kind of a heartbreaking quote at the very end of José's paper, and a very kind of humble quote. So what he says is this, is that the proof only uses old-fashioned mathematics. And he also says that he has found no help in the modern literature on operator theory. So I will come back to this quote at the very end of my talk. Okay, so this is where we were in the previous slides, right? These are the two results that I mentioned to you. And then fast forward by 10 years or so, and then something quite miraculous happened. So up to this point, these two results are actually quite difficult to prove, I would say. And then 10 years later, something happened. So there's a paper of Christian Palencia that came out. And then there's a kind of a follow-up paper by Rensford and Schrödinger that point out that really, if forget the 11.08, we can just do this with the following. We can just do this with the following constant: one plus square root of two. Okay, not only this, but the proof went from extremely complicated in Crozet's paper. I mean, to give you an idea, I'm pretty sure there are some cotangents in Crozet's paper. That's pretty scary to me. And then, yeah, so Ransford and Schrödinger point out that actually you can do much better, right? This number is much smaller than 0.08. But what is really miraculous here is that the proof is extremely slick. Okay, I don't really know how to describe this. To describe this, uh, you know, young saying that this is basically alien technology. I, I, uh, so, what are you trying to do here? You're trying to estimate the norm of this homorphism. Okay, so you fix an f and then you have to get an upper bound on the norm of f of t. Now, f of t is a bounded operator on a Hilbert space. So if you want to calculate its norm, it's sensible to look at the norm of f of t times f of t star. Okay, so this is the c star identity. This is standard operator theoretic procedure. Operator theoretic procedure. But what Renswin and Schrödinger pointed out is that, well, no, this is not what you should do. What you should do is look at f of t times f of t star squared. So this is going to, I mean, I'm a complete genius. I don't know how you're supposed to come up with this idea, but anyway, this is what you do. And then, and then it's not over, then you take the second term here, and then you kind of add and subtract something so that this term R of F makes an appearance. And then, and then I don't think I'm misrepresenting what is to come. I think I have to let it. Representing what is to come. I think after that, it's just basically the triangle inequality. A few basic algebra, four lines later, you get this amazing constant. Okay, truly, truly amazing, truly genius idea. So Greg Neese yesterday, I think, was telling us that he had this constant worry that this kind of, what was it, this transfer function realization would eventually be discovered in a cave, like it was known to cavemen or something. This is kind of the opposite. I really, this is this is. Opposite. I really, this is this is these guys are soldiers from the future. They saw the future, they came up with this idea, and then they really did something magnificent with it. Okay, so this is really good. One plus root root of two is a much better constant. The proof is really amazing, but it might make you a bit worried because what is Cosy's conjecture? Cosy's conjecture is that the norm of theta of t should be at most two. Now, this is a number that is a bit bigger than two. So then you might start thinking to yourself, okay, well, to get this amazing improvement, I, you know, you had to come up with. Amazing improvement. I, you know, you had to come up with this incredible idea. So, what does it mean? To get constant two, does this mean that I'm supposed to come up with an even more clever trick here? Okay, so I'm, you know, so you get worried that you have to go home and try looking at f of t times f of t to the power of 14 or something. But let me reassure you that this is not required here because in some sense, this grouping of term is best possible. So, unless you're using some additional outside information, you can't possibly do better than this. So, you don't need to. Possibly do better than this, so you don't need to try to beat them at this game. Okay, so I will make this a bit more precise on the next slide. What I mean by best possible here. Okay, and this really, really good idea. This brings me to what I consider to be the abstract approach to the conjecture. Okay, so we'll switch gears a little bit here. So here's the setup for this slide. We will take A to be uniform algebra. So what's a uniform algebra? It's a unital norm closed. It's a unital norm-closed subalgebra of continuous functions on some compact metric space. We'll take theta to be a homomorphism from this uniform algebra into the n by n matrices, which we assume is bounded and unital. It sends the identity to the identity. And if you want, you can even assume that this is completely bounded. If you don't know what that means, it's not too important. Just pretend that it's bounded. And then the third piece of data here is this map, this self-map of A, alpha, which we assume. map of A alpha which we assume is contractive and antilinear okay now you make a standing assumption about all of this these goodies you assume that they combine in the following funny way so if you do theta plus theta star combine compose with alpha bar then the norm is at most two so pointwise this means this theta of f plus theta of alpha of f star is at most the norm of two f and then the question is uh what can you say about the norm of theta itself um so just So, just to make sure that everyone's on the same page, how is this connected to the first part of the talk? So, take the uniform algebra to be what I called A of omega, the algebra of continuous functions on the closure of omega that are holomorphic on the interior. Assume that your operator T that we had lying around is a matrix, and then take theta to be the functional calculus. Okay, and then what's the antilinear self-map of A of omega? Well, we saw this in the classical lemma. This is taking the The classical lemma: this is taking the Cauchy transform of the conjugate function. Okay, and then the basic insight of De Lion-Der Lion is exactly this standing assumption. Okay, it was exactly that we had this assumption. And then the conjecture, the question of Crozet is, well, what can you say out of this? What can you say about the norm of theta? Okay, so this is really an abstraction of this setup that we really care about. And this abstract setup, this kind of alien vision again, can... Vision again can say something quite nice. So, this is really what can be proved here: that what Renswood and Schrödinger proved in their paper is that in this context, you always have the number of theta is at most one plus square root of two. And the proof is exactly the same kind of idea that I explained on the previous slide. Not only that, but they show that this bound is sharp. Okay. And now at this point, maybe you get a bit. Now, at this point, maybe you get a bit worried again because what's the goal? Jose's conjecture is that the norm should be at most 2. 2 is less than 1 plus square root of 2. And now these two fellows come about and say that this bound is sharp. So should we lose all hope? And the answer is no, not yet. Okay, there's one last bit of hope that remains, and that is that in principle, you can assume that alpha is unital. Okay, remember what alpha is in the Okay, remember what alpha is in the case of interest, it is the Cauchy transform of the conjugate function. When you take the Cauchy transform of one, you just get one back. Okay, so in principle, in our case of interest, alpha is a unital map. And this kind of saves the day at present, at least, because the example that is constructed in this paper to show this bound is sharp is very much non-unital. Okay, so then this is the kind of rethought conjecture. Okay, same, same. Conjecture. Okay, same, same, seemingly same setup. We have a uniform algebra. We have this bounded homomorphism, at all, bounded homomorphism of it into the n by n matrices. We have this antilinear contractive self-map of the algebra. We make this standing assumption on the norm of this weird combination. And then the conjecture becomes this. Assume in addition that alpha is unital, then that should force theta to have norm at most two. Okay, so this was conjecture by Rensselaer and Schrödinger for. By Ransford and Schrodinger for the algebra A of omega, and then in 2018, and then a few years later by Ostehman and Ransford in the generality that I'm talking about here. All right. And surprisingly, at least for me, this is a bit surprising. You can say some general stuff about such an abstract question. Before I tell you about some positive results, though, I want to point out one thing. So remember that the case of interest for Khusi's conjecture. Um, the case of interest for Cruz's conjecture is when the algebra is A of omega. Okay, well, uh, Ostellman and Ransford observed that actually you don't really need to do it for A of omega for a general omega, you can just do this for the disk. Okay, so they show that if this conjecture holds with A being the disk algebra, then you're good to go. Then closest conjecture will have to hold. Okay, and this is basically just pre-composing with an appropriate conformal map. You have to be careful, however, you're allowed to assume that A is the However, you're allowed to assume that A is a disk algebra, but you're not allowed to assume that theta and alpha are as concrete as they were. Okay, so these will change. So you're allowed to kind of change the algebra, but then the maps get a bit more complicated. Okay, so that's one result of Estellman and Lester that I wanted to mention. Another one is this. Okay, so they actually, out of this completely general setup, they managed to extract some interesting information. They showed that automatically this map beta. Automatically, this map theta will have to send orthogonal projections to orthogonal projections. Now, again, you have to be a bit careful here. A is a uniform algebra. So when I think of a uniform algebra, the first example that comes to mind is the disk algebra. Okay, and then for the disk algebra, things are holomorphic. So you don't expect to see lots and lots of projections in there. There are, you know, beside the constant, the trivial projections, besides zero and one, there will be nothing that is identical in the disk algebra. In the disk algebra. So, what is this saying? Well, this is saying that if you happen to have projections, then they will be mapped to orthogonal projections. Okay. But in view of what I just said, you might think, how is this a useful result? Because I expect there to be no projections in general. Well, that's not quite right. Okay, so there are some uniform algebras that have lots and lots of projections, right? Commutative vonomen algebras, for instance, are uniform algebras and they emit lots and lots of projections, lots of characteristic functions of measurable sets. Measurable sets. Okay. And using the presence of all of these projections, Ostoman and Rensford proved that for this setup. So when A is actually a computative one-leman algebra, then they can prove their conjecture, but they can prove something much nicer. They prove that theta should actually have norm equal to one, which is the least it could have because it's unital. Okay. And there is one more case that Ostama and Lansford managed to tackle here. Oh, okay. Maybe I did. Tackle here. Oh, okay. Maybe before moving on, I should say something about this theorem. I think this is really elegant. I think this general abstract setting is very interesting. It's very elegant. The question itself, I think, independent of, of course, this conjecture, I think, is interesting. So I find this to be a very... Raphael, can I interrupt for a question? Yes, go ahead, John. So in the last theorem about theta, what are you assuming on theta? That is, is any unital completely bounded homomorphism? Yes, I'm assuming the content of the... I'm assuming the content of the conjecture, so the setup that's that's above here. Thank you. Other questions? Okay. So as I was saying, I think this is a really pleasing result, but then you have to, but I don't know how much of this should be viewed as supporting evidence for the Cozy conjecture, of course, because you're really after the disk algebra and commutative element algebras are quite different. Okay, so just keep this in mind. Okay, so just keep this in mind. And there's one more case that Ostalma and Ransford managed to tackle with their approach, which is what I want to discuss here. And this will involve what I call exceptional matrices. So once again, I kind of summarize what we're trying to do here. We have these two maps that combine in this funny way. And then we're trying to extract out of this the fact that the norm of theta is at most two. And there's one more case. Okay, and the first time I saw this question, so here was, here's, here was my naive. Here was my naive approach to this. It's well, you're trying to capture something about the norm of theta. Okay, what if theta were to attain its norm on a part of the space on which the second term does not contribute? Okay, then in that case, you could trivially get this implication. This is very naive and very simple, but in some cases, this actually works. And this is where these exceptional matrices come to the picture. This terminology of exceptional matrices, I took this from a paper of Ransford with a student of his. Ransford with a student of his, Walsh, where they look at these things in detail, but it will not really enter in the rest. Anyway, so the crucial lemma is this. This was proved by Jose, Gilfeather, and Holbrook and seemingly rediscovered by Caldwell, Greenbaum, and Lee. Although I'm not exactly sure, but clear on what the story here is, because in that paper of Caldwell, Greenbaum, and Lee, they say, well, they kind of discovered this lemma purely by Lema purely by numerical experiments. And then they thank José for providing a proof. So I don't know if José himself forgot that he proved this four years earlier, but at any rate. Okay, so this is the Lemma. It's very nice. And it goes like this. You have an n by n matrix T. You assume that the spectrum of that matrix is contained in the closed disk and that the norm of the matrix is strictly bigger than one. And you assume that this matrix is exceptional in a sense. It's kind of extremal. Okay, so whenever you apply an automorphism phi of the disk to the matrix T, then Phi of the disk to the matrix T, then the norm of T decreases. And then the conclusion is something quite nice. So if you pick a unit vector Xi at which the matrix attains its norm, then Xi and the image of Xi under T should be orthogonal vectors. Okay, so this is not a trivial fact. It's not a trivial lemma. The proof is actually quite clever. And then using this, Ostermann and Ransford proved the following kind of special case of the conjecture. Special case of the conjecture. Okay, so assume, in addition to the usual slew of goodies, that your self-map, your antilinear self-map alpha, sends the entire algebra into the constant multiples of the identity. Then in that case, you get what you want. The number of theta should be at most two. So I'm going to make a remark about this, about how reasonable an assumption that is in a minute. Let me just explain to you how the proof works using the lemma. Okay. So I'm going to cheat here. I'm going to assume that theta attains its norm at some. Theta attains its norm at some vector, at some function f, or some, yeah, some function f in a with norm one. Of course, that's not the case in general. You can just approximate your way out of this, but okay, so let me just cheat for the sake of time. So theta thinks it's normal f and the norm is strictly bigger than one. Okay, why do I know this? Well, the goal is to show that the norm of theta is at most two anyway. So might as well assume that the norm is strictly bigger than one to begin with. Okay, now theta of f, remember, theta is a homomorphism into the n by n matrices. A homomorphism into the n-byn matrices. So theta of f is a matrix. Choose a unit vector c at which it attains its norm. Okay, so this is what I'm accomplishing here. And now the claim is that this matrix theta of f is an exceptional matrix. Okay, so the spectrum condition, this follows from the fact that theta is a homomorphism. The norm condition is written right here. We discussed this. And then this kind of this exceptionality thing, this follows from the fact that theta basically commutes with automorphisms. With automorphisms. Okay, so we can just check this. So by this previous lemma, we get orthogonality of c with theta f of c. And now this is good because of the following calculation. So you look at the norm of theta squared. So this is the inner product of theta fc with itself. And now for free, if I want, I can kind of add a term in the first component. I can just add this guy here. Why? Because remember, c and theta of fc are orthogonal. Alpha of f, that's a constant times the identity. Theta is unit. times the identity, theta is unital. So this is just a constant times the identity. So you can pull it out of the inner product and then you will get zero still. Okay, so you're for free you can add this term if you want. And that's actually quite useful because this is a quantity that you know something about. Remember, we're assuming that the norm of that thing is at most two. So whatever that is, it's at most two. And the norm of this inner product will be at most two times the norm of f times the norm of theta of f that I took c, which boils down to two times the norm of theta. Boils down to two times the draw of theta, rearrange, and then you get the statement. Okay, all right. Now, um, how reasonable an assumption is this? This might look like a laughable thing to assume. I mean, come on, you have the self-map of the algebra. Why would you assume that it maps everything into the constants? Well, this is not actually that unreasonable. If you think, for instance, of the concrete cases that we care about, right? Think of the Cauchy transform of the conjugate function on the disk, okay? Okay, when you take the Cauchy transform of the conjugate function on the on the certain, when you think it on the circle, you can just do the calculation. This will always return at any point z in the disk the value of the function at the origin conjugate. Okay, so on this in the special case of the disk, the Cauchy transform of the conjugate function just spits out a constant always. Okay, so this is exactly this kind of condition here. And then, because of this observation, this theorem implies an older result of Okubo and Ando that says that. And undo that says that Causes conjecture actually holds when you're lucky and the numerical range is contained in the closed disk, exactly because of what I mentioned here. Okay, the observation is that the Cauchy transform will satisfy this condition, and then you just involve this theorem and you're done. Okay, so I'm basically done here. I have one last slide. I believe I have five more minutes. Hopefully someone will tell me if that's wrong, but I think I have five more minutes. I have one last slide, and I want to address what I claimed was a heartbreaking. Claimed was a heartbreaking quote by Closet, where he said that he could not find any help in the modern literature on arbitrary theory. And to me, what that really is about is the following question. So where is dilation theory in this whole business, right? So dilation theory has done so much good for operatory theory in general. And here it seemingly does not make an appearance yet, as far as I know, at least. Okay. And I should mention, this is not my observation, but people are aware of this. I've been told that at least two Of this, I've been told that at least two different people that you know, this surely dilation theory should come into the picture here, but it hasn't. So now it's one thing to want to use dilation theory, then it's another thing to know what to dilate. Okay, so what do you want to dilate here? So here's an option. So what, remember the general setup, what it was about? We had these two maps, theta and alpha, and they combine in a funny way. When you do theta plus theta star complex with alpha bar, I told you that the standing assumption was that the That the standing assumption was that the norm of that was at most two. Okay, and if you want, let's assume that the completely bounded norm of that is at most two. So, if you divide this map by two, you get something that's completely contractive. Okay, and moreover, remember that both theta and alpha are unital. So, this kind of convex combination of unital maps will give you a new unital map. So, this actually is a unital, completely contractive map on A. And those words, unitold, completely contracted, this should be music to your ears. Really, what you should be hearing is unital completely positive. Hearing is unital completely positive. And then when you hear completely, unital completely positive, you really should be hearing Steinspring dilation. Okay, so because of this, you can find a unital star homomorphism pi on the C star algebra that A generates. And because A is a uniform algebra, then you get C of X. You can find this star homomorphism with this property here that this map pointwise on A can be dilated to pi. And in joint principle, star homorphisms of C of X. Star homorphisms of C of X, this is pretty well understood, right? So, you know, this might be promising, but still, I mean, but then what? What do you do with this? I don't know. I mean, I don't have a solution here. But this is one thing that you can dilate. I mean, I guess in principle, what you might want to do is kind of take this equation and solve for theta and hope that the formula you get is obviously has at most norm at most two. But yeah, I don't have answers. This is just kind of a final comment. So anyway, I'll stop here. Thank you. So, anyway, I'll stop here. Thank you. Have any questions? Yeah, let me just mention one thing. So, my PhD advisor points out that the drawing was not quite correct, right? So, the purple blob was wild, whereas Wild, whereas, um, it's known that the Nirkling is always convex. So, this is why I said, like, forget about the drawing, it doesn't really matter that it was this shape. But, yes, in principle, it is not as ugly as I drew it. It could have been a nicer set. But thank you, Hari, for not shaming in front of everyone. I do have a question that probably I didn't understand very well. Very nice talk, Rafael. I enjoyed it. So, you have a Cauchy transform involved. You have a Cauchy transform involved, and somehow we are able to estimate Cauchy transform. But what is the problem? You have this theta plus theta star times a Cauchy transformer. So what prevents us from solving the problem by estimating a Cauchy transform? If I understand what you were saying correctly, I guess you could argue that, okay, maybe what you're doing is the Cauchy transform of just a general function, like you're basically doing the Cauchy transform of what, f plus f bar? And then you're saying that maybe you could just estimate this directly? Perhaps this is. I think maybe it's more difficult than that. So you had theta. So you had theta, theta, and then alpha was the Cauchy transform, right? That's right. Okay, so you had theta and then theta star. I think that's the problem. I just missed it. It's fine. Again, like this is these finer things about Cauchy transferring. This is very far from what I know. So it's possible that there's an approach of this type, but yeah, so maybe I shouldn't say more. It's not enough to estimate the quality. To estimate the Cauchy transfers alone. But it sounds to me that Causé's original paper, the very, very complicated argument, this is kind of what's going on. There's nothing kind of too sophisticated about the approach. It's very much tackling the integrals and hoping for the best. Okay, okay. But anyway, very nice. Thank you for the talk. Very nice. Thank you.
