Hi, thank you. My name is Sheting. I'm postdoc at Mark Lipstitch and Bill Hanig's Lab. I normally work on the strap neural caucus, and I've been reading a lot of papers from many of you, so it's really great to see the faces of you all. So today I'm going to present a piece of work in recently done on SARS-CoV-2. This work has been published on This work has been published on New England Journal of Medicine a couple of days ago. If you're interested, feel free to go have a read. They're going to briefly give you the part I've been working on because I'm working on these genomes and try to figure out at the beginning because I don't have two time point of the data, try to figure out whether it's re-infection or evolution. So the patient background is that is a 50-year-old male and has this severe anti-fascilated syndrome being treated with stories. Stories steroids all time for five years. Then at the mid in April of this year, and on April 4th, 10th, he had the first positive, and you can see the viral load been changing, and IgM positive, and IgG positive later. And he also had treatment, antiviral treatment with two episodes. And after the virus cleanup, he went back and then readmitted in June and later in August. In August. Unfortunately, this patient passed away on September 11th with COVID. So I do have all this full-time point with this viral load change and also these four sessions of viral treatment for your information. So we have samples, sequence samples from this, most nasopharyngeal samples from this patient at this different time point. We consider this as the first time point. We have these two samples on the day 18 and then 25 things. 18, then 25 since April 10th. And then we have these following samples as another three-time point. So when you look at these sequences diversity on the different days, you saw a lot of mutations. These blue ones are non-synonymous mutation, which means they change the amino acid. And the red ones are the synonymous change within this patient along this timeline. So majority, you can see they're on the spec protein when you look further on. The SPEC protein, when you look further on these different days, you saw this majority are on the RBD region, the receptive binding region. And studies showing that the receptive binding region, the immune response being the highest, no matter on the title or on the neutralization or even the affinity of this antibody response on the RBV region. And also, this guy wants to look at further on this mutation. It's an I2V mutation. It's actually been. 2V mutation is actually being studied as a T-cell epitope. So it's kind of suspect like this immune pressure in this patient being drives this change in such a short time. But we know that even that one showing here is a consistent sequence, but we know within host evaluation, we want to capture the population diversity in each of this time point. So I did a few things before I generated tree to show you in the next slide. So I checked whether In the next slide, so I checked whether these are artificial sequencing errors or there are real mutations. We look at this, it's an Illumina masaic sequence, and the coverage depths are generally high. We have two separate amplifications for each sample. They're generating consistent results, and some might be sequential, especially the poly T-side, but generally I cannot determine their errors. So, we consider their mutations. And also, the second question asks that whether also second question asks that whether there are minor variants on the first state of on the first sequence date um so i did the variant calling and their majority relate to the primary amplifier and they're not showing on the later samples as so these mutations are new um as as later samples and also these mutations are majority unique in this patient only like a three two or three of them found in other population in the general population so i'm going to show the tree very quick from all this time point Quick from all this time point, you can see with this day one, I mean, the time point one, time point two, three, four, the diversity within the patient support, this evolution within host hypothesis. If you only look at two point at the beginning, I have two time points because we didn't know the patient will come back for later. So that time was trying to figure out whether we infectional evolution, but more data assured that this is an evolution within the host. The evolution within the host, and also with this immune response analysis on the T C D - and C D4 analysis. You can see compared to control, most of this cell prophylation is under SPAC protein. And also this antibody neutralization is compared to positive and negative samples. You can see these patients at these different days are having positive neutralization antibodies. So, generally, it's showing that. Generally, it's showing that within an immunocompromised patient, you can observe the persistent evolution inside the patient, and the majority are changes on the spec genes, may reflect for the immune pressure. And we consider that this type of individuals could serve as a reservoir of infection or a source of rapid viral evolution. One limitation is that I did not have the way to explore the impact of antiviral treatment on the The impact of antiviral treatment on evolution. So, at the end, I would like to acknowledge this patient, his contribution to science is really tremendous and will be remembered. And also the clinician team from Breckham and Wuben Hospital. Thank you. Sorry for the short time. I rushed through.
