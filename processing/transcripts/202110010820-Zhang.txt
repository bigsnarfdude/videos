Thank you for the next instruction. And I would like to thank the organizer for organizing such a wonderful meeting so that we have a chance to talk to each other. And also, thank you for inviting me to attend this conference. And what I would like to talk about is a recent joint work with two of my students. Uh, two of my students, uh, one is graduated. Uh, um, okay. We can uh, I will talk about it uh in three steps. First, I will introduce incompressible Bosonistic equations, and then I will state some of our main results and the construction of block solutions. And finally, if we have time, I will mention some proof of some parts of proof. Proof of some part of proof. Okay, so the system is as following. We consider a three-dimensional Vosnitsky system where U is a velocity vector field. And the first equation, if the right-hand side barrel is standard ovular system, which dynamically free condition, but it's coupled with But it's coupled with thermal, which is theta is temperature, and the temperature satisfies the heat equation, which coupled with U. This term is convection term. And we gave initial data u zero and theta zero, and considering the whole space. And in the following, we will consider the classical solution, which means if Means if all the dirty appeared in the system, the solution is smooth up to this. In fact, we've considered E in the Sioux and Africas and the SETA have more hair regularities. So here pressure and the thermal scalar functions, as we know. And so this is so-called the So-called the incompressible Bosnitska system. And this system models many geophysical flows, such as the ocean circulations. And so when the thermal density of theta is zero, which reduces to Euler system. So which means that when the SETA is Zeta is constant like zero, so we have no disparate. This E3 is the unit vector in X3 direction. So it's closely related to the Euler system. Okay, so we are interested in the classic solution which blows up in finite time. And there are many And there are many famous criteria. So, for example, the first very famous one is due to Bill Gadon Maeda, which is in 1984. They gave an abla criteria for solutions of Euler systems, which means that the vorticity blows up. And if the integral of R-infinity norm of vorticity is in is infinite well in a in a given time interval. So there are a lot of following results that follow such criteria, but I'm not trying to mention related results because we are interested in the constructions of this pull-up solutions. And there are some numeric results, which are very interesting. I think it's due to Luan Ho, which is in 2014 first, and then last month due to Ho. I think he talked about his result in this conference. And the numerical result shows the finite time block of smooth solutions. Smooth solutions and with shape similar type. Wow, that's a very interesting result, numerical result. And our talk very closely related, it's initiated by the result of ERGD and ERGD GO and Masmudi very recently in 2019. They actually constructed a finite table of solutions, which is a classical solution for Euler system, even with finite energy. Here, alpha is some small number, but even though this isn't a classical solution, well, still, the smooth solution, for example, which have more regularity like More regular regularity like C2 as the infinity solution, the finite time block of such smooth solution is still open. Well, I will mention a little bit about the construction because our result is initiated by their recent results. And also recently, Chen Ho, they also constructed the finite time block solution for two. Have a block solution for 2D percentic system without diffusion term. That means the earlier system, if we consider 2D and this coupled with theta without diffusion term, and they constructed the finite block solution, finite envelope solutions. Okay, so um So let me introduce more about our restrictions to the blob solution. So for this incompressible silicon system, we consider the excess symmetric solutions to this system. Moreover, without swerve, which means the velocity satisfies Satisfies if we write down in the axis for the first two coordinates, right down in the polar coordinate, the velocity equals u r u to the r and u to three only there's two directions. You see it in the angle direction disappear because we assume there's no swear. Even in this class, we will try to construct the block solutions that. The block solutions that here are is square root of the first two variables. And in terms of vorticity, the system can reduce to the following one. We let omega be the vorticity. You know, we assume there is no sword. So the omega is time. Is tangent to u angle direction, u theta. Well, the theta, I abuse the notation. This is means angle. Namely, vorticity is only has one vorticity could regard as a scalar function. And in the following, we will always make you let a theta be the thermal, and we draw this. We drop this because it doesn't appear the theta, the angle direction, so we drop this index on the lower index. So falling theta always then the temperature. And we mommy this angle index. So omega is a scalar function in our notation. And also we choose mu equals what? Choose mu equals what? So we have this following. This is a vorticity equation, and this is the summary equation, which is a parabolic type. And in terms of virtual, we consider phi tilde be the string function. And sometimes we make use of phi to be also the string function. And they have the relation up to an R. have the relation up to an R. So with phi tilde, we know R3, I'm sorry, UR is the derivative of phi tilde in X3 direction, and U3 is the minus the derivative of phi tilde in R direction OR. Okay, this is due to the diversion free cognition in extra symmetric class. And the bound equation is due to The bound equation is due to the void-subtle law, and omega with phi tilde has this relation. This is an elliptic type with singular coordinates. So, moreover, we shift our class into the class of function XR in X3 direction. Namely, if we choose omega zeros and the Say omega zeros and theta zero to be in the class of R in X3 direction, then the vorticity, omega, and the temperature always in this class is due to the equation. Okay, so with this restriction, then we have the following like boundary conditions. So for the stream function phi and theta, we have phi is zero at zero at x three equals zero because it's r function the phi on r equals zero is zero we need because of the regularity assumption on this for the for this equation and also this is uh for the derivative of theta this is this relation is due to the assumption of r in x3 direction and this one is also due to uh this one is also due to r in x3 this one is X3, this one is due to our function in X3 direction. This is due to see that it's regular. We have a let me see. We have a Laplacian seat in the polar coordinate, we need this assumption. Okay. So we also have this relation. So we have more restrictions on the solution. Our solution after we consider the x-axis symmetric class and art in the X3 direction. Okay. Moreover, we choose a new independent variable. One is beta, which then denotes the angle. Actually, after the reduction, we consider Reduction, we consider R and the beta. I'm sorry, consider this one. After the reduction, we have two variables, R and X3, small R and X3. So we regard R and X3 as two D things. And then we consider this polar coordinate. And the beta be the independent variable, which then of the angles, and the low is. And the low is the radial direction, but we make use of capital R, which is low to the alpha, be the independent variable. Beta and the capital R be the independent variable. Okay, here alpha is a small constant begin zero. So with beta and r, we consider we let the derivative of capital D. Derivative capital D beta means the derivative in beta direction times sine 2 beta. And capital R F means partial derivative R with a constant with an R. So R is an independent variable. Beta is another independent variable in the following discussion. Okay. Well, the following weighted sobriety space was introduced by LGBT in his Introduced by LG in his earlier work. And HK is weighted solar space with weight given here. And 1 plus R squared over R squared. Again, squared again. And here, 1 over sine 2 beta to the power eta over 2. Eda is a number less than 1. In particular, choose 99 over 100. 99 or 100. And this is only this part is only for high-order derivative in r direction, which derivative including beta direction, r direction is this and k and with this norm, with this weight. Okay, this is the weighted solid norm. And here alpha is equal to rho, and this gamma is one. Is one plus or ten. This gamma is bigger than one, eta is less than one. Okay, with this two norm, LGD is able to prove if he construct, he constructs a solution and in this true norm, he obtained a very good estimate, and then they can prove the existence of several. Existence of self-seminal type finite block solution. Well, this weighted Solief norm has an is unbinded into the normal class. Well here, which means that R2 in beta direction and R infinity in R direction. And this norm is controlled by H1. And if we change to R2 in R direction, R infinity. two in R direction and infinity in a beta direction then is controlled by a gh1 with alpha in in numerator. Okay and our infinity norm is also controlled by H2 and the CF norm is controlled also by H2. This is the embedding theory for this weight so This weighted sublive space. Well, to work with the parabolic part, we need to introduce some new weighted sublip space because the weighted sublive space introduced by RG like H1, H2, H3, etc., it's not so easy to estimate our solutions in Solutions in the parabolic part. So, to deal with the parabolic part, we introduce some new weighted sublife space like WKI equals one to up to three. And the inner product of two functions is going by this, like before the high-order derivative. Well, low bar is the integral variable is. integral variable is that matter but we have a weight here uh and this weight is different from uh before and also for this term we have another weight eta is before as before is uh eta is always choose to be uh less than one like this number okay with this uh weighted uh this is uh w1k and a w2k is given by this all Escape malice okay with a different weight okay and also W3K and with different weight okay so the corresponding norm are given by if WKI squared is the inner product of this okay i equals one two three all right Sorry. All right. So let me mention our main result. So this is a joint work with Gao Chen, or his postdoctoral in Beijing University. And Zhang Xia Lao is graduated this year. The result is there exists an alpha zero bigger than zero. This is a small number. This is a small number. And the initial datum, U node, which is in C1 alpha with compact support, and there's six node, which is in C infinity class, which is compact support. And for alpha, bigger than zero, less than alpha, zero, then the 3D bossinic system. system BE, which this system we have on a diffusion term, the unique solution given by this initial data develops and asymmetrically shelves similar singularity in finite time. And for example, as t due to our construction, when t tends to one, the velocity The velocity blows up. And U and theta is classical solution. And U itself doesn't blow up. Theta is always C2 alpha smooth up to the block point. So the thermal is good, and the block is only the derivative of velocity field. Field. For example, the vorticity blows up. Okay, when time goes to one. All right, this is the finite time block result. So the solution is in a classical solution because all the derivatives appear in the system, we have its regularity. And the honest block is the derivative of velocity. Is the derivative of velocity field? Okay, all the vorticity blows up. Okay, this is the this result. So let me make a few remark. So the construction is due to we follow the construction of the oil for the oil of flow, we follow the construction of RGD and Of LGD and his collaborators. So for Euler flow, this can be written as essential part, which is a shelf similar solution, which will both up and if to extend a regular part. So for the velocity, we write in this right into a singular part, and even we call it. Even we call it the error part. So, where Kappa F is introduced by RGD, and H2 is a lower order term. And also they proved for K bigger than or equal to 4, the following estimate. This is the key estimate in their dot. With this estimate, they can construct finite time block solutions. So with HK norm, the K norm, the derivative in time direction, S is time direction up to an skin. And by the, this is a negative part, which if itself HK norm with HK norm to the power third, with a large coefficient, you know, this is a good part. The second part. This is a good part. The second part can be controlled if epsilon is small. If you small depend on alpha small, but this one, if you small, this is in a high order up to compared to the first one. So this with this inequality, they can control, they can get a good estimate. So they can prove the velocity blows up with a rate of one. rate of one over one minus t. This is the block rate. Before block, the u is nothing alpha solution. And the u itself doesn't block. So in our case, theta is always before blob is in C3 alpha class. Okay, so for the oral part, we follow the construction of LGD. L GD. And for the main work we need to do is to estimate the thermal part. Okay. Well, in their construction, they have some info reductions for the vorticity equation and reduced to a very simple one for this one. And capital Capital L12 omega is the integral operator of omega, and the k is given function. K beta is given by this. And fortunately, this one has an explicit solution, which can be read as capital F. Okay, well, capital F. This is an explicit solution for this, which variable zeta and beta. Oh, sorry. What happened? Okay, so gamma beta is this one, it's a given function. Okay, so we can say kettle f is given explicitly by this, and the say is a concept. Well, in the new independent variable capital R and a beta, our notation can be rewritten. Our notation can be rewrite as the following: small omega as capital omega r beta, and the string function as capital phi omega beta. And we need to estimate the derivative of the thermal. So the derivative in the derivative in our direction we denote by constitutor and And the other direction is by fatu. I mean, in x3 direction, by phi tuit. So, with those notations, the derivatives can be rewrite in partial R can be rewrite as the combination of partial capital R and the partial beta, and also partial X3 derivative. And you are, I'm sorry, this is you, this is the original velocity field in the axisymmetric coordinate, which can be read as this in our notations. And then, so the original equation can be rewrite. Equation can be rewritten as the following. This is the omega equation. This is the coset and the phi tilde are the gradient of theta. So we need to estimate these two guys. Actually, originally, the equation only appeared the set tilde, that is one derivative in theta direction. But But you know, we have to estimate high-order derivatives. So this one will appear. Actually, when we estimate satua, the fatule appear here. So we need to estimate both derivative of zero direction. So we write down this two equations for this. And so the main work is to estimate the following tool guide: fat tilde. Fat Tilda and a cassette tilde, because this is the thermal part. And recall that phi tilde is the derivative of theta in r direction, psi tilde is directly in x3 direction. Okay, so to ask me that is, well, in about okay. Sorry. In this system, capital U, capital V are the velocity field, which in new coordinate. And so the capital Lambda 1, Lambda 2, Lambda 3, Lambda 4 are the combinations of the C's. So well, capital Lambda 1 is. Well, capital lambda one is the derivative in our direction. And then we write in the new coordinate and also a capital lambda two and a capital lambda three and a capital lambda four. And the vorticity omega and the string function then satisfies us. This is after we change to the new independent variable. And then we consider beta is between zero and two pi. beta is between zero and two pi. Actually, because this is exosymmetric in x direction, originally beta is from minus two pi to pi. So we can restrict to the beta in zero to two pi and r is bigger than zero. So to do the estimate, we first say let's say house contract block solutions. So as I mentioned earlier, Kappa F is an Earlier, Kappa F is an explicit solution to the Euler system, to the reduced Euler system. Where we let Z be the capital R is an independent variable, we can fit it a shelf similar type, let Z be equals capital R over equals capital R over capital T minus small t and capital T will be the later chosen to be the block time and with given delta. Delta is a constant. Well, the capital omega is one over t minus capital T times capital F with the similar variable and The shape similar variable and in r direction and also beta is a is an angle. So this is the new verticity. Sorry. Oh, it's so okay. So when omega is scaling, so the string function is given by equation two because omega have an equation. So for me i have an equation so for uh cosine of phi we need to solve the original state uh the summary equation so uh for the for the cosine of phi we choosing to be a perturbation of zero uh i mean um um so w is uh the capital f plus uh this is a singular part plus an error term and also the string function and this Function, this. And for the summer part, we choose to be in a perpetration of zero. And also, we let s be the time variable. And so ds dt s with equals one over lambda and the lambda s and the mu s and we will be truth later to be the scaling variable with y denotes the new independent variable. The new independent variable. And then, so we consider the solution capital omega be less. The psi in the scaling variable in the self similar up to the scaling in time with gratitude, which would be less one. Okay. And well, as before, white white bar. Y bar while we choose different scale time scaling R1 and R2 to deal with fatuita and positilita, because they have they are they need to choose different one to estimate that. Okay, so let me mention the Mentioned the Smith. So then the equation we plug into the original one can be written down as the following is two tier. It's a tedious one. Okay, this we plug in this notation omega into the original one, then we can write down the volume. So. So the linear result operator is given by this. And capital E and N is the error term. Well, let me mention the main estimate. So this is the speech is the main estimate. Okay, I want one minute, right? So for k big than or equal to four, we set. To fall, we set capital S to be cosine with this norm and the phi together. And the Ys be thus, the combination of theta with derivatives, and the capital epsilon to be this one plus the small epsilon with the original norm. Norm. Then we mainly prove the following inequality. So the derivative of capital S less than equal to constant say S, X S, and plus this one minus this. So this one and this one is good term. In the middle, it's when alpha small is a low order term and together with capital equation up this. others so with this two estimates uh with this two inequality we can obtain the key estimate and in the proof of the other theorem uh i i think i have no time to explain uh more about this two estimate uh its need to uh solar uh propositions let me uh excuse that so i i think i stop here thank you Thank you.
