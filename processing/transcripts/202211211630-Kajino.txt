  Okay, so we're right now. So, we're very happy to have now take a leader giving a second call because we're not supposed to. Okay, thank you for the introduction. And I'd always thank the organizers for giving me this very nice opportunity to talk about the approach with GDP work. Well, so this is going to be joint work. Well, this is a joint work in Musk. Well, this is based on joint works with Musk Mullen from the UBC. And let's say, well, yeah, so except for the result about the Shelpinski carpet, the results. Basically carpet, well, the results are going to be based on the paper which just appeared 10 days ago, well, two weeks ago, or something in image. So it concerns the walk dimension refers to, as Fabrizi mentioned, well, it refers to the symmetric diffusion processes on many of the setting is going to be a symmetric diffusion. So the setting is like this. So, it's a setting like this. So, we consider strongly local regular symmetric delivery states on some local compact separate metric space. So, basically, we are concerned with diffusion process whose associated Markov semigroup is zero-farjoint with respect to some first-prime measure on the state phase. And we assume that the state space is metal equipped with a metric D, so that. method D so that the well any well well any bounded closed set is compact okay so this kind of setting is well used for well for heat kind well this kind of setting is usual for heat bias okay and we talk well we call such a well quintic major deep space so we always rationalize that well it's strongly local okay and the same idea well constituent The theme I'd like to consider in this talk is the following. So, for our state of space, well, we have mainly something like fractal in mind. So, the behavior of the original diffusion process is going to be kind of entirely far away from being Gaussian. So, we are concerned with such exchange. So, that there is no associate differential kind of structure or anything. So, it's going to be just entirely single. So, yeah, the original. And so yeah, the original geometry D and M, well, will be something like that. But so maybe, well, there might well, for a given energy form, there might be some way of, well, let's say, well, parameterize the time clue for the diffusion process and also different ways of looking at the geometry of your state space, so that after changing suitably the metric and measure which corresponds, which, well, which Which calls well, which well, which determines the evolution of the time group for the different process. Well, under a new pair of metric can measure, then we might well get some heat kinetic estimate with exponent which is closer to the Gaussian. So that the behavior of the diffusion process might look somewhat nicer than original by changing the metal gun measure. And well, let's say, well, without such an operation it's possible, Whether such an operation is possible, and if possible, well, how much you can decrease the exponent? Okay, that's the basic question. So, since we are concerned with as small value of beta as possible, so we are taking the infimal. And the in-female is going to be called the conformal wall image. And here, so I'm writing the Bohemian Dublin and Filipino estimates. So, well, as well, the previous talks introduced, but the Boring-Dublin condition is just the usual one. Is just the usual one for the comparability of volume of the concentric holes. And the heat cut estimates with exponent beta is of the same form as well as Fabius mentioned. For the upper bound, it's the same. But for lower bound, actually, it's slightly, well, let's say, it's weaker, actually. For the lower bound, for various natural reasons, well, we require the bound to be true only in the so-called near-dynamology. only in the so-called near dynamology. So when the distance is, well, let's say, well, greater than some constant times the t to the one over beta, then well, let's say this lower bound is just empty, right? So for various natural reasons, well we require this one instead of the matching lower bound. Well one well one natural one well one natural explanation for this formulation is actually Well, formulation is actually this conjunction volume doubling and heat can estimate is known to be equivalent to the parabolic Hannah inequality with exponent beta. And this is due to in this framework in 2012. So this can be, well, let's say, this can be replaced by parallel kind of inequality beta. That's probably one explanation. Okay, so yeah, so this is our heat kind of estimate. And we'd like to get this kind of estimate with as small value of beta as possible by changing the pair of metal and to the measure while keeping the energy mean, well, the irregular form essentially the same. That's the question. And the origin of this kind of question is given by Great jungle is given by, well, if well, this result due to Zheng. So, yeah, so the original gaussi is fine, but yeah, this is too small to be readable. Okay, so this is the shifting figure state. And here, by the result of, well, yeah, by the resulting 80s by Baro Patience, told science about Professor Kusuka. So there's a well, well, there's a community called Guaburanyang Mushong. Well, they're the canonical Berlin motion on the shift-based gas kit. And well, the usual Berlin motion under the geometry of the Euclidean metric and the uniform measure on the gas kit, well, the diffusion satisfies the heat final estimate with exponent given by this log phi 1 row 2, so that is greater than 2, due to bars and partings. So in the original diffusion, the exponent is greater than 2, but well, in this result of June. He proved that some completely new geometry of the frequency gasket can be introduced by considering some suitable harmonic function on the frequency gas kit. And the image is going to look like this. And with this new geometry, together with the energy measures of these harmonic functions, well, Functions, well, what he proved that the new, well, the Dirac space satisfies the Gaussian estimate, the Hillburn estimate with exponent 2. So, in the case of the shift in Casket, by choosing this kind of way of the change of the geometry and the change of the underlying measure, well, well, one can achieve the heat condition, well the Gaussian heat condition. So that, let's say, well, But let's say, well, topologically, it's still rather fractal, but still, well, let's say, in terms of the behavior of the diffusion process, it adds kind of other things, of course. And our first concern was, well, how, let's say, to what extent we can reach this kind of phenomenon for general network-metal data. That was our first problem. Okay? Okay, so the main result, well, our first main result is going to be the set of possible values is actually, well, let's say, well, we can reach, well, arbitrarily close to 2. That's going to be our first main result. Before going for that, well, let me first specify the setting, the previous definition of this. So I haven't just specified. So I haven't just specified the class of measures and the class of metrics we are arranging in this change. So let me first specify those. So the class of measures is something which is kind of very natural for intersecting degree spaces. So it's yeah, so it's a set of random measures or Borel measure finite of Borrell measure finite on compact sets on our state space, and such that it doesn't charge sets of capacity zero, so that subsets which cannot be seen from the vision process are not charged by this measurement. So that's a natural kind of condition. But it's also required to be of full support, but not just topologically full support, but we have to take care of. Support, but we have to take care of sets of capacity zero. So there's a final notion of support called the quadry support for such a measure. Well, well, well, for measures for charging sets of capacity zero. And it's required, well, so the, yeah, even if we count the sets of capacity zero, well, it's required to satisfy, well, have the full support. So this is the final notion of having full support. Yeah. And well, this set of conditions basically well corresponds to the following property. So if you consider this measure mu, such a measure mu, and we'll try to regard our Dirac space as a, well, well, well, we'll try to regard our energy form as a Dirac form on L2 K mu. Okay, here the major defect. So that well, we are thinking of well not. Well we are thinking of well not L to Km, but L to K mu. And under this set of conditions, under this set of conditions, we can regard E as a regular symmetric delivery form on L2K mu with the core the same as this. So basically, well replacing the measure m by mu doesn't doesn't Well, doesn't change the structure of our energy form. The domain is slightly changing, but the core is well still kept the same. So the resulting form is going to be essentially the same. And in terms of the diffusion process term, well, this corresponds to a change of the time clock, well, which are slightly increasing. So, yeah, so that the th this the after the time change of the time clock, well, there will The time group, well, the resulting process is going to be a stereo diffusion process. That's the meaning of this condition. So it's a natural thing. And the other set, well, the set of metrics is that introduced by Massaf. So it's just a set of metrics, quasi-symmetric, to the original metric D. So D is a process first-trained metric. And well, this is the set of metrics, well, which are quasi-symmetric. Well, which are toward the symmetric to the ordinary metric. Okay? So it's definition to this one. And well, maybe I should mention that. Well, this relation, okay, after our state, well, forgetting about the details of the data, is going to be a, well, is going to be an equivalent distribution among the metrics on our set. And well it can be well characterized well, it can be characterized in this kind of way by using the inclusions of both into different components. Into differential matrix. And one important feature of this notion, well, this class of metrics is it preserves the validity of the scaling variance elliptic kernel inequality. And that's because this guarantees this kind of comparability of the structure of the algorithm. So as long as we have quite a similar metrics, then the scaling variable. Then, well, the scaling variant, well, the well, and if we have the scaling variant elliptic kind of inequality in one metric, then it automatically implies the electric kind of inequality in the other metric as well. So, that's the yeah, that's one nice thing about this class of metrics. Okay, so this is our setting. And well, let me, well, now what I'm saying, well, now I'm about to state the first main result, but well, before that, My result, but well, before that, well, let me state some general facts about this exponent. So, well, first thing is this condition is the volume double-and heat under estimate is actually invariant under the operation of raising the distance to some power. So, if our original space satisfies this set of conditions, then after raising d to this some power, well, in order for this to be Where, well, in order for this to be a metric, alpha is required to be at most one, but otherwise this may not be a metric anymore. So, well, here, alpha needs to be atomous one. And after this operation, well, this new metric measure delivery space satisfies the doubling and heat van estimate. And the only difference is the exponent changes, obviously. So the exponent beta is now going to be replaced by beta divided by. Going to be replaced by beta divided by alpha. And since alpha is atmospheric one, well, by this operation, the exponent here can be increased in an arbitrary way, whereas decreasing the value here is highly non-together. Increasing this part is always possible by this way, but decreasing it is an alternative thing. On the other hand, On the other hand, well, why is it well, sorry, well, okay, so the yeah, uh yeah, so the heat current estimate is this one. Okay, so the heat current estimate is this one, so that's, well, this makes sense as long as beta is greater than one, but yeah, but actually, well, once beta becomes strictly less than two, then actually it will become 2, then actually it becomes impossible. And that's a consequence of the requirement of the symmetry of the symmetry. So when beta is less than 2, well, such a heat grand estimate is not possible. So the set of pairs of network measure is going to be n. So, well, when we try to decrease the value of beta, the best possible value would be 2. And what since that's basically And but since that base association would be the case where it's 2, so well, yeah, so from now on, well, from the notation g2, well, we drop 2. So g dimension is just d2. And our first main result is that the set if we consider the set of possible values or beta, then actually it contains, well, all the values greater than two. Values greater than 2, or otherwise, well, it's empty. Well, so there are only two possibilities. Well, okay, well, three possibilities. So the infimum over the possible values of beta is always either 2 or just infinity, so that with no beta heat candle estimate is possible. There are only these two possibilities. There are only these two possibilities. So the value of the infinite is always two. That's the first thing. And in other words, we can increase this value in this way always. Well, any value, well, let's say the upper part is always contained. So the set of possible values of data is going to be either one of these three possibilities. So any value, well, either. Okay, so any value well either it's empty or otherwise any value greater than two is incommitted. Okay, these are the only possibilities. And well I'm not planning to well let's say explain the detail of the proof, but well so yeah but well yeah so but well roughly speaking, the yeah for the proof, well we adopt well classical theoretics well method well must be described. Well Well, Masco described, well, to well, in order to create a pair of metric measure C dam, well, other this requirement instead of the Alpha's regularity. So in Carlos Copier's original work, his aim was to construct alpha's regular matrix, well alpha's regular measures and matrix, so that his requirement was what this value is going to be comparable to R to the beta. To R to the beta, where beta is greater than R to the component dimension for the critical exponent. And instead of that, we require this measure and metric to satisfy this kind of condition, which is actually a common condition in heat current estimates. And once we get this condition, then by this characterization of the heat current estimate due to blue-volume fluorine route, well, we get the heat current estimate by, well, under the estimate of the estimate. By under the presence of this collection. So, yes, what we do is actually, well, instead of just r to the sum power, we consider r to the beta times some function, which comes from the capacity under our delivery space for the capacity in the annual. And what science is dependent upon in body? Well, we have, well, Well, we have sufficiently nice control over this value as a function of x and r. And that's enough to construct a pair of W and C that satisfies this. So that's roughly the time. Okay, and in the remaining minute well time, well I'd like to address the following well question. Well, question. So, if you look at this result, the set of positive values is, let's say, let's forget about the case where it's empty. As long as it's not empty, it's either this, 2 infinity, well, without 2 or with 2. Okay? And then, well, in what kind of case 2 is inclusive and in what kind of case 2 is not included? That's the question. That's the question. Well, I'd like to address in the rest of the time. So, in other words, well, well, for what space, well, the G of the degree spaces is no empty or empty. That's the question. Okay, and well, since I presented this result first, and the street gasket is one of the most canonical choices of your similar fluctuation, naively one might think. Well, one might think, well, let's say, well, no empty, well, being no empty of this, well, might be a generic kind of situation. As actually, that was people's naive thought in the past years. But it turns out that that doesn't seem to be the case. So we don't have a proof of this being empty for a large class of sexual. For a large class of sexual sets. But at least for these factors, we already observed that they are empty. So this is a big set which appears in Fabian stroke. And this is the higher dimensional analog of the Shelpinski gasket. So for the higher dimensional analog of the Shelipinski gasket, this property is broken. So in 2D, this is no empty. But in higher dimensions, well, this becomes Higher dimensions, well, this becomes empty. I will explain why this is happening. So, there is a crucial difference between 2D and higher dimensions. So, that's our area for our work. And now comes the second main result from this talk. So, the natural question is: what about the infinity large flat balance? And well, let's consider the standard shift discount. Then, there's an inservation notion was. But there's an inservation notion, well, standard Branium notion on this. And what we proved is: well, again, for the deliberate space associated with the natural canonical diffusion of the shield-c carpet, this is empty. So that the Gaussian estimate is not possible. This is the main result. And I think if the result for the standard should be counted, and well, well, And well, well we well, well we have been able to extend this to slightly larger class of Shrekninsky carpets, but it's still rather concrete kind of ones only. So the class of carpets we have been able to treat are just this class. So for any well oath well ot integer a greater than well at least three well we can construct such an example CP carpet in two Example significant carpet in 2D. And for those, well, we have been able to prove the same result, but that is the only class so far. So for only for these, but the particular cell structure of these carpets, as well as the two-dimensionality of these carpets, are extremely important in our analysis. And at the moment, we have no idea how to extend this to the other carpet. To the other topics. Well, a natural case would be for any natural kind of generalization shift-missing copies, the same kind of result would be true. Well, that would be my naive guess, but we don't know how. Well, we have no idea how to well, how we would implement. And here's the side to me. Well, for that kind of some suitable generalization of Shakinsky carte, well, the notion of canonical Branian motion. Well, the notion of canonical Branch motion is an established notion. And it's an established framework. And the existence was proved by Martin and Vitzbaus in, well, let's say, well, around 90 and threatened around 90, and also by Kosuke and Zo in also 90. And the but the uniqueness of such a canonical one was also well was also proved by Martin, uh it's about pickle. So Akassian such a so that there's a reservation notion Branja notion here. Okay, and well, in the remaining time, I'd like to explain why this kind of phenomena are going to be true. Well, first, well, let me state some general necessary condition which has to be satisfied by any pay. Be satisfied by any pair of the metric and measure rather than the Gaussian. So at this stage, well, the metric measure degree space is just general. For any space in our framework and for any situation mu realized to the Gaussian estimate, the following is true. So basically, in this kind of setting, in a sense, we have to have a different kind of differential structure, in a sense. So, first, the absolute continuity class of the measure mu is uniquely identified as the absolute continuity class of the harmony of energy measures. So, the set of energy measures, which are canonically defined through the Dirique form, is the same as the absolute continuity class of this measurement. Measurement. So the right-hand side is uniquely determined by our delivery space. And well, μ has to be mutually absolutely continuous with respect to the family of energy meters. So there is no choice of the absolute continuity of the measure absolute continuity class of the measure mean. That's the first thing. So it's basically given by, well, let's say, well, well, Say, well, well, some well, well, some energy measure, well, together with possibly some density function or something like that. That's the first thing. And also, for the metric CDA, essentially there is no choice once the measure mu is given. So once the measure mu is given, well, as Teo introduced, well well there is a natural well well known notion of interlinked method, but determined through the measure mu. But determined through the measure on the depressed space in this kind of manner. So by requiring this kind of condition, heuristically, this is kind of requiring the gradient square to be atom of one, something like that. And we usually use this as a definition of a metric. And in the presence of the Gaussian estimate, actually, well, this becomes a genuine metric. This becomes a genuine metric, and it has to be equivalent to the metric C da. So, when the Gaussian estimate is realized, the metric has to be essentially just the intrinsic metric. So, and there is no choice. But this is not the measure M, but the measure mu, which realizes the Gaussian. So, that's a first general thing. And now let's move to the And now let's move to the setting of a self-similar set, self-similar direct form of self-similar set. So, well, let's suppose, let's suppose either our space is this kind of finite kind of fractal, well, together with some, let's say, very long kind of setting, or well, the class of generators well some suitably generated class of chili thinking copies. Well, for example, like this. For example, like this. Until some moment, the higher dimensional carpets can also be included. In this similar kind of setting, we have the, well, we direct the state some necessary sufficient condition for the possibility of Gaussian estimate. So, yeah, to state that, well, I need some notion, some definition. Notion, some definition. So let me see that. Okay, so first, well, let V0 denote the set, well, the canonical self-boundary set in the initial scale for your fluctuate self-similar set. So roughly speaking, for finite non-final fluctuations, well, this just denotes the set of well the outermost vertices. So in this example it's like this. That well, for this three-dimensional one, this is Well, for this three-dimensional one, this is just a four point. And for this, well, pen double one, this is just there, but this was pen double. And for two-dimensional carpets, well, this is going to be the usual boundary of the unit square. And for higher-dimensional carpets, it's going to be the intersection of the carpet with the boundary of the nth-dimensional unit cube, where n is the Euclidean space, the dimension of the Euclidean space. The dimension of the Euclidean space which you are using. So that's this set. And what we consider is: well, the central object for this study is the set of harmonic functions on the complement of this boundary set. So H0 denotes the set of functions which are harmonic on the component of the boundary set. So in well on the interior it's going to be harmonic. Is going to be harmonic, that we said. And well, let Hg denote the set of harmonic functions whose energy measures together with their intrinsic metric. Well, realized the Gaussian estimate. So in order to make it a suitable metric space, I'm taking the quotient while the constant, but please don't worry about this. Okay, so this is the test. Okay, so this is the set of harmonic functions whose energy measures are nice in the sense that the energy measures realize the Gaussian estimate. That's the thing. And the necessary condition is, well, suppose you have some measure which realizes the Gaussian estimate, then actually you can find some harmonic function whose energy measure satisfies the Gaussian estimate. So at this stage, This stage, the measure realizing the Gaussian estimate is just some measure whose nature is not very clear. But once, well, supposing that there is at least one such measure, well, you can replace that one by the energy measure of some harmonic function. So in order to know whether this is empty or not, well, you can just restrict your attention to the set of energy measures over how many functions. Well, you don't have to worry about. Functions. Well, you don't have to worry about general measures, but just the harmonic functions and their energy measures. And moreover, actually, well, there's a nice, well, this set of harmonic functions satisfy some nice compactness property in this way. Well, scaling invariance on compactness property in this way. So let H be realized in the, well, harmonic function realizing the Gaussian. Then, Estimate. Then, well, we consider the following. So, where h is the harmonic function, and well, and we consider the distribution of h to each cell and take those values back to the initial scale by the composition with the control. So, basically, this is a restriction of age to each of the cells, but it's taken back to the initial scale. Initial scale. And then, well, those rescale harmonic functions again satisfy the Gaussian estimate. And moreover, if we normalize those so that they have energy, total energy to be one, then the closure of in the energy also realizes the Gaussian. So the taking the closure in the delivery form do not break the Gaussian. Form does not break the Gaussian realizing property. And moreover, actually, this form is a compact state in the energy. So scaling variance and taking closure doesn't break the Gaussian property and it's compact. So for any sequence here, well you can take some sequence. So what are in terms of six? Um is it more general? I I mean you in this tribe you are saying that In this tribe, you assume that the space is either can hold or down. There might be some way, but at the moment I don't really go this one might be the case, but we need some suitable formulation, so I don't really know. Yeah, actually, yeah, so yeah, the roof of this. So yeah, the proof of this one heavily uses self-similarity, so it's not very good yet. Yeah, but actually, for this, the proof of this one, well, actually, the set of, well, just the original this set of measures realizing the Gaussian estimate, well, also has similar scaling variance and components property. And that can be used together with the differentials and theorem of the Financials and theorem of the function and theoretical. Well, to, well, for the density of the energy measure, together with the self-similarity, well, we can obtain some human function. Well, through the energy measure is nice in this. Well, the proof is not reliable. At this stage, well, we can already give proof for the big sex state and the higher dimensional cascade. And for the big sex state, And for the DSX set, well, because of the 2D structure, for any harmonic function, its energy measure actually cannot have full support. The boundary set is these four vertices, so that the support is just limited to this, the union of two diagonals. So that it cannot satisfy the full support property, which means HG is empty. That's it. For the higher-dimensional shape is the gasket, it's a Higher dimension shift is kit, it's a bit more subtle, but you can do as false. Let's take any non-constant harmonic function and take its scaled image at one of the vertices. So j denotes the choice of one of the vertices, and they take the nth level scaled version of it and normalize it and state the length. Then, well, with suitable choice of j, but you can always get But you can always get this kind of function in the limit. That's just a direct computation. So this is a harmonic function with boundary values, some non-zero, just at one of the vertices, and the other boundary values are all zero. But you can always achieve such a harmonic function in this case. And then, well, if the internal values can be computed in this kind of way, so if the value here is So if the value here is n plus 2 times c, then the value here is 2c, and the values here and here turn out to be c. And after subtracting c from this picture, what do you get is this one, c minus c and 0, 0. And as you see, well, the boundary values are anti-symmetric in this case. So by the anti-symmetric So, by the anti-symmetry of the whole picture, well, this harmonic function is going to have values on this edge, exactly zero. So, it completely vanishes on group line for on this edge. And this is already, well, this property is basically already enough. And you can also see that around this edge, this function decays faster than linearly. And that property is enough to show that the intrinsic matrix. To show that the intrinsic metric is vanishing on this edge. So for this H0, the intrinsic metric vanishes here. And now if H is belongs to H of Gaussian, then H0 would be also belonging to the H of Gaussian. But but that's not possible because this is valid, okay? So that proves the yeah the well this, okay. The well, this time. Okay? So that's the case of the cheapest gate. And now, well, okay, so well, I started a bit later, so I suppose next day I should have four minutes or something. Yeah, so yeah, now comes the simplistic carpet. Yeah, also for the seminal carpet, let's say, the all our strategic well storing well strategy of the proof is going to be essentially the same. Is going to be essentially the same. So, yeah, for, let's say, for some harmonic function, well, we have vanishing interlinked metric. That's one thing. And the other thing is, well, starting from a generic harmonic function, you can suitably take some limit of this kind to well, obtain a limit with vanishing to a single limit. And then that would be a contradiction. So the true structure of the proof is like that, and that's the second. Proof is like that, I'm not the same. But the detail of that is going to be extremely important. So, first, how many functions is vanishing with intonation metric is given by this kind of thing. So, let's consider H0, which is a harmonic function with this kind of picture. So, it's one at the top and zero at the bottom. And on the complement of those two edges, it's harmonic. Let's consider such a harmonic function. Then, Such a harmony function. Then, by utilizing the specific cell structure of the carpet, we can show that there is a alpha less than one-third, so that only one-third bottom of the carpet is at most alpha. And this together with the strong mark of implies that this H0 is again decaying, well, decaying Well, decaying along the bottom edge were faster than linear. And well, that's enough to prove that against the incolus metric validation. And well, actually, well, we need this property also for a general harmonic function with delivery boundary condition. But well, that can be verified. Well, because in this domain, we have the our boundary. Well, we have the boundary harmonic case indicating. So, the boundary behavior of positive harmonic functions are essentially always the same, so that any such harmonic function decays faster than linearly, so that the infinite method vanishes. And yeah, the second ingredient is, well, let's say, taking some kind of minute at some vertices. And, okay, well, let's say that can be done. That can be done by considering this kind of self-similar type positive harmonic function. But I'm sorry. Well, yeah, basically this message is, well, for ternary point in the silicon carpet, well, we can consider some version of the first order theta expansion for a given generic harmonic function to take the limit. Take the limit and take the limit to obtain some concrete harmonic functions. Yeah, that's the thing. And yeah, and we can identify the set of harmonic functions with the slowest decay at primary points. Well, we can identify those kind of harmonic functions. So, yeah, well, I don't have much time, but sorry, let me skip this. Yeah, here, here I'm using the two-dimensional. Yeah, here, here I'm using the two-dimensional ABD. And well, by taking this kind of limit, well, starting with generic harmonic function, you can still, well, you get some function which is rather concrete rather than some abstract. So, but by this kind of limit procedure, well, you get some concrete harmonic function which is would be still Gaussian here, I think. And then after taking taking similar kind of limits actually twice more twice more well actually you can actually the function h1 so h1 is the one which was written there and that that satisfies the debris boundary condition so that's the quantum condition that's the okay okay well so sorry i'm over i'm almost over time Sorry, I'm almost over time. But let me just briefly mention some open problems. So the first one is about our first main result, about the conformal work dimension B2 or infinity. So here, here, we require the heat current lower bound, well, only in the near-diagonal region. And well, that was basically because it's equivalent to the parabolic current. Because it's equivalent to the paramodic conduct. But actually, we could consider a stronger version, which is lower bound, is also required in the fuel rate. So if we replace this condition by this band, then actually it's going to be stronger. But it's not very clear whether the same kind of result is true if the condition, this condition replaced by this two. Condition replaced by these two-size estimates. But I must have recent results, but actually, this is essentially equivalent to requiring our new metrics data to be geodesic metric. But yeah, so yeah, so it well it's a well so this is due to Musa well showing that this two-size estimates imply that the the distance D is comparable to a geodistance D. Comparable to a geodesic matrix. So replacing this one by this two-size estimate is the same as thinking just the geodesic matrix. But constructing geodesic matrix, well, by using the colours of PR2 method, doesn't seem to be known. So we have no idea how to manage this. And the other thing is, sorry, well, well, so I mentioned briefly some properties of the harmonic function of the carpet, but well. Carpet, but let's say any finite properties of the harmonic functions would be very nice. But now this, I have no idea. Okay, I don't know what I'm sorry. Thank you very much. So, any questions? I'm not quite sure if this is complete nonsense, but isn't it impossible to construct geodesic metrics with the To construct geodesic metrics with the Karasko-Fiagio machine, because if you have the hyperbolicity inside, then the boundary you don't get geodesic, you have to be above the dimension, above the control dimension. You have to snowflake a little bit. So directly, the character beyond change relies on having hyperbolicity inside and having a type of visual metric boundary cannot be geographic. If you take rho to be identical, so if you use alpha, I guess he uses A for the scaling. So if you use rho is constant 1 over A and the space you started out with already a geodesic space or a classical convex space, you end up here because it's bilingualist in a book. Yeah, well we can discuss it there. So why is the C Pinski Gasket so special? Well, so yeah, so yeah, so yeah, in a sense, let's say, well, well, well, let's say, what well, what I I'm about to say might sound weird, but the yeah, in a sense, the CPS industry well, let's say. Well, let's say, well, doesn't have a singular point, in a sense. Yeah, but in a sense, well, yeah, so the symbolic gasket has the special feature that at any of the internal vertices, well, something like the local tangent space is actually straight line. I mean, in the sense of the local behavioral harmonic functions. It's just, well, let's say. Yeah, so for example. So for example so if you consider as an analog this kind of construction of the single factor for example then well let's say you might think well this would be similar to this one but it's not. The reason is the presence of such points. And if you well and if you look Well if you look at the geometric well geometric property of this space locally at this point, then well it's in a sense a singular point because the local direction there are three local directions so that it's a singular kind of tangent space it has at this point. Actually this kind of property well let's say well makes this kind of result impossible also in this case. In this case. So, but so yeah, so this kind of singularity also prevents you from getting this kind of result. And let's say, and well, let's say, but this chicken C basket doesn't have such a point. That's one important feature. Well, but well, maybe that's just a necessary condition, maybe not sufficient condition, but yeah, and well, and as we saw, well, let's say, another feature is well, if they were they, let's say, Well, let's say the dimension of the space of how many functions is too large, then again, that would likely cause some degeneracy of the space of the harmonic functions. And that's it that's what is exactly happening for the well, higher dimensional dust case. Yeah, so that yeah, yeah, that's another let's say. Yeah, yeah, that's another, let's say, kind of mystery function, let's say. Yeah, so yeah, so I don't really have a, let's say, good faith of explanation for this, but let's say, yeah, yeah, so yeah, my analysis. I guess a just a warning that the program for tomorrow has Warning that the program for tomorrow has changed. There's more. If you haven't looked at the schedule for a while, take a look at it again. We have some extra sessions tomorrow afternoon. Okay.
