Our next speaker is Jose Van Rios. He's going to speak about Gaussian states via wide moments. Thank you, Jorge, to introduce me. Thank you, everybody, for coming. The gratitude also to the organizer. Thank you so much for the space for this talk. I don't know if it is convenient to be in the last part of the Part of the event, but I'm gonna try to be a little bit fast overall because most of the notions that we saw in that we see in the presentation, we saw them throughout the week. So, this work is in collaboration with Professor Jorge Hola√±os and Roberto Quesada on the outline of the presentation. First part, we are going to see the space. The space that we are going to work, and then we define the byte operator and the infinitesimal generator, which is called the field operator. We need to resolve the Yossidas approximation because we need the trace of the field operator, which is unbounded. So, in that representation, we address the We address the n row bile moments and row integrable operator or unbounded operator. And then we are going to see fundamental Gaussian state. We are going to show an open question here in this part. And at the end of the presentation, we are going to give some basic example. So what is the space? Take the space. Take the space of square subamo sequence L2 and a vacuum vector in this space and take those vectors in which the entries have many but finally elements different for the vacuum state and then the complexion with the norm induced by this inner product and we Product and we in this form we form the space which is called the vacuum instabilized infinite tensor product. The inner product here is the infinite product of the inner product H and stabilizes, you mean what stabilize with the incom incomplete with respect to the sequence of vector one. Of vector one, but what is this vector one? The vacuum vector of the space L2, you take this element. So the vacuum means one in zero and zero. What is the button for you? Just one in zero and everywhere. So take the vacuum vector in H and those entry the tail of the element. So the exponential vector are defined as the exponential vector in H and three and stabilized with vacuum vector. Take the limit and this is the exponential vector in this space. So taking the linear envelope. So taking the linear envelope of the exponential vector, we obtain that this is a total asset on the space, the stabilized space. Moreover, if we take the correspondence which map the exponential vector onto the exponential vector, which is given with this correspondence. Correspondence, we have that this has an isometry in the exponential vectors, which can be extended to the unitary operator, which is called the by operator. Some properties that we saw during the week, we have the composition. You just add the parameters with certain scalar coefficients. Moreover, we can Moreover, we can commute the value operator. For certain other coefficients, the adjoint of the value operator, you just change the sign in its parameter. And due to this property, one has that the by operator thus the set is strongly continued unitary group, and then there exists the infinitesimal generator. The infinitesimal generator, which is called, of course, the field operator. Take the exponential in L L L to what does it mean is that J is that J in L to E the J, what is the exponential. is the exponential vector in L in H entry we have the exponential vector so aligned with the vacuum vector take the limit and e to the power z j this exponential of z j We have this A commutation relation due to partassarity, and it's not an introduction to quantum stochastic calculus. And if we take a canonical basis of the space L2, we have the position and momentum operator for which we replace this operator in this commutation relation, we obtain the usual canonical commutation relation. So we have here the byte operator and the field operator and some properties. The next is the non-commutative Pourier transform, which is called also the characteristic function, which is a complex value function, not the phase L2, which is a usual phrase the value operator weighted with the state. Weighted with the state row. If we take the L2 as a real Hebert space, taking the real part of the usual inner problem, we can extend the canonical basis to just add the elements with the Gaussian minus I. So in this fashion, we can define a Gaussian state. What is a Gaussian state? Well, it has two components. Well, has two components, an element in L2 and a self-ion operator, which real entries, and the state satisfies this condition. The not commutative free transform is the exponential power this expression. So every Gaussian state has two components, the mean value vector and the covariance operate this space. So, also, we need the Jossidas approximation because we need to work with the phrase of the field operator which is unbounded. So, the Jossida approximation is taking the resolvent belongs to the space of bounded operator defined in the whole space, and the lambda epsilon is the composition of the rest of bandwidth, the lambda operator. bandwidth the lambda operator also belongs to the space vh addition we take if we take the limit through of the epsilon tends to zero of the resonance behaves as the identity operator the limit taken over the epsilon of the exponential power minus t the lambda epsilon behaves as the exponential power minus t Power minus t lambda and through of the domain of the lambda operator, we have that the resolvent and the operator commutes and the limited behaves as the lambda operator. So, this fashion we can define the moments of an observable what is what what is this. What is this when the row moment of an operator is defined, weighted with a state as the limit with the trace of this Joshida approximation power n weighted with a row? If this exists, then we call this the row moment of A. In such a case, we can show that this is equivalent to the end. This is equivalent to take the n-derivative of the trace of the exponential power I dA, weighted with the row state. So in the case we take a state, Gaussian state, here we have this representation with the characteristic function we can replace the characteristic function here. Characteristic function here. And we have that is always finite. Then the moments always exist for Gaussian state. So we can compute the recurrence relation, which is given by this relation, is zero for natural numbers and is the quadratic form of the covariance operator power n over 2. n over 2 times n minus 1 double factorial which runs over of the given numbers. Of course we can use the binomial formula to express this representation as the sum of this boogie. This fashion we can take the first moment, the second moment to obtain another one. Moment to obtain another one. Also, the converse assertion holds in the sense that if we have a state for which there exists W and a self-ion operator which satisfies this regular relation, then one can ensure that the state is Gaussian, Gaussian state. So we have here the moments of the Gaussian state, and the row integrable for conbonded operator is defined as follows. Every normal operator can be decomposed into the four positive operators, the positive part of the real part and the positive part of the imaginary part. If we take the limit of the trace of this and the limit. trace of this and the limit of trace of this it exists when well we can define here the trace of the normal operator in this sense when age is bounded we can recover the usual trace expression to give the representation as an integral and to use the spectral theorem We work with the multiplication, the left multiplication of the operator given by this expression. It is normal when the operator is normal. It is self-adjoint when the operator is self-agointed and positive when the operator is positive. And our results here, a positive self-agoint operator is integrable in this sense, if and only if the composition of the raw power. The rho power one over two and the square root of the observable belongs to the space L2 in the space H. In such a case, we have the NOR coincide with the trace of the conbonded operator. So, properties appear here. For normal operator, we have the trace of Have the trace of any normal operator can be represented as the quadratic form in the Hilbert space held and behaves, the trace of this operator behaves as a linear function. Moreover, the absolute value of the normal operator is row integrable whenever the operator is row integrable and vice versa. integrable and vice versa and if the powers of the normal operator is row integrable then so is the lower powers if we don't know by this expression the commutative unit star algebra generated by the operator one can endow this algebra with this norm which is the trace of the absolute value Of the absolute value of these elements and also behaves the trace as a linear function. So if we have that the power n of the normal operator is rho integrable, then the trace is equivalent to take the n derivative of the exponential power t A weighted with TA weighted with this state. So, in this fashion, we have that any row integra is at the moment exists. Though the converse assertion not necessarily holds in the sense that if we have that the existence of the raw moment, this not necessarily implies that the existence of the raw integrable operator. integrable operator the case that the state is gaussian is an open question thanks to pagnola any gaussian state implies that is raw integrable for every n internal numbers we don't have the proof neither and a counter example so this case with it is plausible to define amenable amenable states what is an amenable Amenable state. What is an amenable state? Well, if the composition of the field operator is row integrable. And we say it's amenable and bonded. It also satisfies that there exists a positive and non-negative numbers for which this inequality holds for any u and zeta in the space else. In this fashion, we have that if rho is a If rho is a bonded amenable state, then it's also Gaussian. This is due to this representation. We have the existence of double u in the space L2 and a self-agent operator. Sorry for the type of mistake here. Self-adjoint operator for which the trace is the inner product, real inner product of W and Zeta and the trace. W and zeta, and the trace of this expression is the quadratic form of the self-eigen operator. So any bond determinable state is also Gaussian state. Taking the position of the momentum operator, we have a River's formula for the mean value vector on a Gaussian state. This is bonded available and then rho is Gaussian. And then rho is Gaussian, there exists the mean value vector. And we can decompose this mean value vector into two vectors, which is called the mean momentum and position vector, in which its coefficients, the Fourier coefficients, has a momentum and position, the trace of momentum and position operator. Moreover, we take the covariance operator, we can Recover this expression as the real part of the trace or composition of the field operator minus the product of the trace of the field operator. This fashion we have described the entries of the covariance operator because it's bounded, defining the whole space as a matrix representation, and then we have the entries of the operator which is given. Operator, which is given by this expression. In particular, if we take the quadratic form, we can calculate the principal diagonal of the matrix representation given by this expression. If we work with the variance of a square row integrable normal operator defined by the difference of the traces of A. Of a to the square minus the trace of a to the square, we can obtain for a bonded and measurable state. The variance is equivalent to the norm in the space L2 of this observable weighted with this state. Besides, we have the principle, which is given by this expression. Generalize the use of Generalize the usual one. And taking the variance, we can compute that this is equivalent to the quadratic form of the covariance operator. And replacing the next expression, we compute this inequality. The operator S, well, we have already mentioned that is bounded, but it is also positive. But it is also positive, invertible, and the inverse is also bounded, defined in the whole space, and satisfies this inequality, S minus I times J, where J is the multiplication operator by minus I on the space L2. We have this non-negative operator. The norm satisfies this relation, the norm of the inverse. The norm of the inverse is, of course, strictly positive, or is less equal at one, and the norm of the covariance operator is greater than equal at one. To conclude, we compute some basic examples. The vacuum state is bonded amenable state, and hence is Gaussian. Yeah, we'll know. Gauss. Yeah, we know already know this, but this is using the before theory. So we only compute the trace of the composition of the field operator. This is the inner usual product, inner product of zeta and u. And taking the trace of the field operator, this is equal to zero, and we can deduce that the vacuum state is Gaussian with P-m value vector zero and the PM value vector zero and the covariance operator, the identity operator. Another example, if we take this map, which is a quantum channel, it's a complete positive map preceiver. You just make a sandwich of any state in this form. So this results at quantum bonded amenable charge. Quantum bonded amenable channel. Of course, we take a bounded amail state, we have these qualities, this representation, the existence of W and the covariance operator, and then taking some computes in this form, we can compute that the first trace is the inner product of this expression, and the second phase is equal to the first one of. So the first one of the input trace of the state. Hence, we can deduce that the output state is bounded and mearable and so is Gauss with mean value vector w minus 2i times u and covariance operator the same and the input is the so thank you for watching Thank you for your attention. So are there any questions from the audience? Yes, please. Thank you for the talk. Looking at what you did, essentially you are using this amenable garbage. Amenable. Yeah. I wonder probably if you would have been far better to ask you a question, but there's an article from Bat and I characterizing possible covariant matrices of infinite mode of authority states. Some of the conditions you already obtained, I wonder if your amenability condition actually checks out with what they obtained, which is sort of a Yeah, they are related. We saw this article. They are related in the but the way that they use is that in this article is that the space is an extended space like the real part and the imaginary part complicate make a complication of the space. A completification of the space and characterize this state. Yeah, which is actually what you do with S minus IJ. Exactly. But I wonder if the other conditions they obtain, which are on being S minus I, for example, to be trace class, I think, if I recall correctly, and other things like that, maybe those two conditions will yield something about the amenability condition in graph. Maybe they are related in some sense. Maybe they are related in some sense. Okay. I just wonder if you would like to providing this. No. Okay. Thank you. Yes. This approach, I think it's so right now we don't know what's the relationship between our condition and the ones from that article from TU and Radia. One can only wonder, probably there is a connection. Only wonder, probably there is a connection, but uh as of now we only know that for us it's a different path to define the same thing and to obtain the same conditions in the end. You could yeah, you could wonder probably there's a connection, but we haven't found it. Are there any other questions? More of a linguistic question, but what's the meanable about meanable thing? Amenable. Yeah, they are amenable Gaussian state amenable because it's flexible to compute the trace of the column bond that operates. I don't think I think we were thinking more of rituals. Do we have any other question? I want to ask Bolkuk. You want, if I understand well, your main goal is to give a meaning of moments with respect to a given. With respect to a given normal state of operators which are not a normal. Because if they are normal, you can use the spectral theorem, then the standard definition of moments. Yeah, but if they are not normal, I see the problem. But have you some example of a operator that you concrete that you want to deal with? want to deal, which are not normal operators, but to which to which your theory applies. Do you agree that if the operator is normal, no problem? Because you use the spectral theorem. If it is normal, even when the operator is very well defined, even for any Borel function, not even polynomials, the trace of bond operator is not well defined. Is not well defined even when the delta is well defined the spectral measure of any normal operator. Yeah, for you, by the usual spectral theorem, you define integrability of a Borel function of a normal operator as integrability with respect to this spectral measure. What is wrong? Is it probability measure if you have a state? Termination is always verified for any normal state. But the trace of for a bonded operator. Normal, normal. I mean, you take of age, so you take density matrix. Okay, we discussed the I just wanted to make it not quite thank you any other comments, any other question? Do we have anything uh online Jose? Can you check? We have there's any questions. Okay. Well, that's Okay. Well, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you.
