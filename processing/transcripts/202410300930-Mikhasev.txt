My topic probably is not so close to the general topic of your workshop, but I will try to share my results, which has been obtained in collaboration with my friend Viktor Gienmir from Kagliari University. We collaborate during about five years and we conducted researches on this topic or very close to. Researches on this topic, or very close to this topic, dedicated to anti-plane waves in half-space plates, and so on. Okay. Somewhat about theory of surface elasticity. Numerous experiments and atomic simulations. Show you know that it's impossible to describe correctly behavior, mechanical behavior of nanocyte bodies, plate shells, nanoplate nanoshells in a neighborhood of surface-free surface. So the appropriate theories which allow to capture similar effects has been proposed by Gurtz Nurtek. I hope you know. Guten Nurtek, I hope you know these papers, seminal papers by Guten Nurtek and Steigman and Ognon. Here you can see some of these papers and application of this theory in numerous researches allowed obtaining novel effects. And I will try to outline some areas where these results have been obtained. For instance, For instance, this is an estimation of the chief properties of nanostructured markups. You can see here some of our colleagues, Mogilowski, for instance, in Zemyanmo, which are here. Then this is problem on nano-indentation that could be very useful for estimation of social stylistic model line. Again, you can see some. I list here only some papers, maybe more. Maybe more important for me for our investigation. Leon Mi, Zemlianova, White, and so on. Surface energy results in the essential change of stress singularity in the sinkout effects, such as cracked tips. And I'd like to pay your attention on the following area: this is wave propagation in models, accountant for surface effects. Counting for surface effects. In particular, it was discovered a new class of ancient plane waves. I propose here the paper of Hugh Eton and Jeremy, but first I'd like to explain what is the anti-plane shape. They may be excited by some load applied to the half-space free surface if we apply the load along. The load along the very long stride and perform a periodical loading. Then we can incite surface waves running in the direction perpendicular to the load of application of the force with exponential decay of waves in the transverse direction. I like to To I'd like to pay your attention on the paper by Yeremil, which had been published journey with Ross here this year, where they considered anti-plane waves in the framework of the continuum theory, and they compared their result discussion cursor with curves with similar curves obtained on the base of on the base of might be atomistic simulation but discrete system they consider the discrete systems and they obtain obtained good comparison a good agreement of their result so after this paper we considered a new class of Considered a new class of papers. For instance, in this year 22nd, we considered anti-plane waves running over the roughness surface. And we considered highly localized waves running in this direction. And studying the profile, the changing profile of these waves, we can say something about the profile. About their profile or these sources. Later, we studied another class of waves with harmonic variation of amplitude in the thickness direction. If the plate have one surface free, then it should, it may be excited. It may be excited waves which have sine or cosine variation of amplitude in this direction. This is a new class of anti-plane waves. And motivated by our previous researches, we set the problem on wave propagation, anti-plane waves in a thin plate, which imperfectly attach to half space. And now I'd like to pay your attention to the paper published recently in the journal. We're going to study the effect of interfacial sliding on anti-plane waste in an elastic plate and perfectly attached to an elastic house waste. Here we consider interface conditions, which may be very close to conditions considered before. Two conditions considered before in papers by Michuris, Mauchant, and other researchers. Okay, now let's consider the following statement of the problem. We consider thin plate with constant mu1 rho one for the plate. The parameters with subscripts s correspond to Correspond to nanofield or free surface, and this is constant for half space. We assume the possible slip in this direction, in the X3 direction, and we introduce the Ks as bonding stiffness. In this statement, the displacement vector is the framework of the Guernsey Nordic theory. We have only one. We have only one component for the vector displacement, both for plate and half space. And the Garvin equation describing wave motion for both parts are the following, very well known. So now we consider the condition for free surface. These compatibility conditions Conditions in the framework of the Guten-MÃ¼rbeck theory, they are the following. Where at the right-hand side, this part looks like membrane equations. This is a membrane forces already in the pre-sources of number theorem. And this is This is shear stress arising from the bulk. At the interface, we assume a slip with the following bonding stiffness, Ks. In the E3 direction, this is the equality of shear straces in the plate and in the half space at the interface. And this shear force is introduced as follows. So we assume the jump and displacement. Displacement at the interface for the plate and half space. And for the half space, we consider the wave attenuation. So you can see this is very simple statement, but this statement allowed obtaining very interesting results. So now I'd like to say some words about possible modes. The classic Possible modes. The classical solution for this problem, which has been obtained by Viktor Yeremev and other researchers assumes the following answers. Oh, sorry, the following answers were amplitude, decay following to exponential function in the thickness direction. And this paper, we propose another. We propose another variation of amplitude in the thickness direction following two sine or cosine. Okay, now we are going to study dispersion curves corresponding to these possible modes. Let's consider the dispersion equation for TE regime for the plate and therefore For the plate and therefore half space. And thus is the following, it's very simple. Substituting this representation in the Gauvin equation and boundary condition, we get the following relation for this parameter. C is the quiet first velocity and are the shear wave speeds in the upper plate and in the half space. And it's important to say that C, the phi. C, the fight velocity should be less than speed for shear waves in both parts of the plate. And what is very important to mention, similar waves is possible if the pre-surface or nanalthem is softer than the half-space or the plate. For instance, if we consider material alien. If we consider material aluminium, this direction one, so we can to excite similar antiplane waves, but for aluminum with direction, crystallographic direction one zero zero, it's possible. Or for instance, for iron nanofilm having thickness about 100 nanometers. Nanometers deposited on the glass, it's also possible to excite similar anti-plane waves. So it's very important to consider some materials which emit similar anti-plane waves. Okay. The corresponding dispersion equation for these type of waves is the following. This is normal dispersion equation. Dispersion equations term where C as is the speed in the field or free surface, and we introduce the internal characteristic length. This equation can be written in the dimensionless form. We introduce the following dimensionless parameters. This is thickness of the plate. Not the plate. K is the bonding stiffness. And we scale the velocities in the dimensionless form above. Dispersion equations can be written in the following form. Above equation allows obtaining all possible particular cases which have been targeted above. Target above. But we can get a novel dispersion equation. For instance, if we sorry, if we assume this parameter equal to infinity, we get the normal dispersion relation for the plate and perfectly attached to the non-deformable half space with an elastic constraints for shear on the bottom. I didn't write down this equation because you can see it's easily obtained from this equation. Okay, if bonding stiffness goes to infinity, then we get the equation for the plate initially attached to the elastic half space. This equation has been derived in this paper and studied in detail. Studied in detail and some other particular cases. Here you can see equations for the plate with the free bottom surface without considering the surface effects. And this is the special equation for the plate, single layer with bottom surface officially claimed in the extreme direction. These equations were also investigated. We also investigated and the special case for these equations were investigated in this previously published papers. And the more interesting particular cases here, this is equation studied by Jerry Meier for half-space visual modulus. And if we assume thickness to be equal to zero, To be equal to zero, then we arrive at the normal dispersion equation, which describes anti-plane shear waves in the half phase potentially by the sleeping membrane. Okay, now I propose to consider another regime of anti-plane wave. This is TH and TE regime. With sine and cosine variation of amplitude in the thickness directions and exponential direction in the half space. The answer is very simple here. Here, velocity should be between velocities for the plate and half space. The corresponding dispersion. This person relation is the following, and in dimensionless form, it can be written in the following form, where kappa is the inverse value for bonding stiffness. And now I propose to analyze the dispersion relation, dispersion curves. Let's consider the following regime. Let's consider the following regime, the E to E regime. There are two absolutely different cases. The first case, when we are, we are is larger than unity. We are, this is ratio, this velocity in the half space and in the plate. In this case, all curves lie between the red curve corresponding to perfect attachment. Perfect attachment and between this brown line corresponding to three lower sources. These curves can be used in what follows, I will explain, we can use these curves for estimating their bonding stiffness, crop patterns. And the next picture, you can see the dispersion curves for the case when this relative velocity is less than unity. So here you can see that our curves merges when they approach this value, which is the we sorry, yes. Yes, we are. We are here is 0.92. Unfortunately, this is not very good situation because all curves merges. Yes, it's very difficult to use this picture for estimated this parameter. And the next picture, we can see. We can see both cases where these curves correspond to the first case, and here we are is equal to unity, and here we are is a relative velocity is always at unity. So you can see that a very interesting behavior of dispersion curves for both cases. And let us consider another regime of Regime of anti-plane wave THTE regime. You can see the infinite number of branches. These branches, this branch corresponds to TETE regime. This continuation of dispersion curves or TETE regime. But here we have additional. Have additional branches for THTE regime. But this picture is wetted for the case when velocity VS, this is velocity in the film divided by velocity in the plate, is less than unity. So the speech is weighted only for this case. If we consider another case when V S is larger than unity and Is larger than unity and less than we are, we have only these branches. Okay, and now we consider the dispersion curves for half space coated with this slipping nanofilm. This equation is the following. Is the following and with the new dimensionless parameters this equation is written in new dimensional parameters, these parameters, and let us consider the dispersion curves for this situation. Here you can see all curves are between this line for perfect attachment and this stripe line corresponding to de bonding. Correspondent to demanded fill. So, this picture also can be used for assessment of bonding stiffness if we consider membranes flipping over half space. And now, I propose the procedure for assessment of the bone stiffness. I propose to Uh, I propose to consider the case of Te T E regime. Here we can use this picture when we are larger than unity. That is the plate is here softer than the half space. It may be seen that each curve begins from the point we start. The point K with star and unity and falls down, goes down. So it's possible to approximate behavior of this curve in neighborhood of this point. We assume the following asymptotic approximation, and we see into this point and substituting this relation into the displacement. The equations, dispersion equations, and considering here two approximations, we can obtain the following coefficients, k, this wave number, dimensions wave number, k with star. We obtain the relation in the explicit form, and we propose the following two-step procedure for estimating the bond state. Procedure for estimating the bone stiffness. First, we have to perform the series of experiments exciting anti-plane waves to obtain the velocity as close to unity as possible. If we excite similar these waves, we assign the We assign the corresponding wave number as Kv star. Then, knowing all input parameters for the plate in half space and this wave number, we can estimate approximately this bonding stiffness or inverse variable bonding stiffness. So, this is more simple case. But if we consider another situation when the plate Situation when the plate is stiffer than the half space. Here we propose the four-step procedure. Behavior of these curves near this point can be approximated by the following asymptotic series. Substituting this correlation in the dispersion equations, we get the following equations for K V star. is tar and can here we should consider three approximations from the third approximation we derive the following equation for amplitude a but this procedure is very complicated because the first we can find having known op input parameters we can find kv star then we have to excite waves with wave number k d A wave number Kd being close to Kv star, and then using this equation 23, we can calculate approximately A, and then using this equation, we can find the bonding stiffness capacitors. So Conclusion. So you can see that we studied antiplane waves in nanoplate imperfectly attached to the elastic half space. And we found very interesting effects. These effects can be used for evaluating the elastic bone stiffness, and I think we can use this. I think we can use this research in our following researches and consider more interesting problems. Here, I'd like to show some papers where we considered, for instance, this paper, we consider unciplay localized vibrations near the half space having the following profile with some here. So we considered vibrations localized near. Vibrations localized near this profile. And I think that we can consider a similar problem to estimate the weakest point where it's possible the bonding. If we consider the bonding stiffness as some function having minimum or zero value, yes? We can estimate. We can estimate, we can find the weak point where it's possible the bonding. Thank you very much for your attention.
