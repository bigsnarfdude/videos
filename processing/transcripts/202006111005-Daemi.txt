Thanks for the invitation to give a talk here. It's been a great conference with so many interesting thoughts. When I got invited to this conference, I was very excited. My in-laws are from Edmonton, so I was looking forward to visiting them and meeting up with friends and colleagues in beautiful bands. That's a shame that it didn't happen. That's a shame that it didn't happen. Because, in compared to other problems going on in the world, it's a very negligible problem, but hopefully, we'll see progress on all fronts and we'll have some in-person conference sometime soon. So, what I'm going to talk about today is based on a joint work with Kenji Fukaya and Max Leviansky. First, I'm going to make sure that this is working correct. Sure, that this is working correctly. Let me start by the definition of some simple objects from low-demission topology. So, if you have a close-oriented three-manifold like Y, associated to this guy, you can talk about two types of representation varieties. You can firstly look at a space of all homomorphisms from your fundamental group to SU2. Maybe I should have said that, should have sent the link to this slide. So I'm going to send the link to the slides in chat. So the first representation variety, which is character for y, is the space of R homomorphisms from your fundamental group to SU2. So the Lie group here, which is SU2, Use the notation G acts on this representation variety, so you would have action conjugation action. So you can construct another representation variety, which is the quotient by this action. It's useful to look at some geometrical interpretation for this character variety. So let's first start with the second character variety, chi of y, where we took the quotient by the conjugation action. By the conjugation action, we can fix the trivial bundle on our three-manifold and look at the trivial SU2 bundle. We look at the space of all connections and this guy and require our connections to be flat. And whenever you have two flat connections which are related by some bundle automorphisms, we're going to regard them as the same. So we modify the automorphisms of our bundle. So, by taking monodromy along loops inside our three manifolds, this space can be identified with the character y. Next, we're going to look at the second one, the second character right, the chi-sharp of y. So, in this case, we have to take a connected sum of our three-manifold with the three-dimensional torus. So, this is the So, this is the schematic picture you should think about as going in the circle direction as one of the S1 factors. Inside this, we have some embedded loop, which is just one point inside T2 times the circular direction as 1. So, this way we would get some loop which is completely inside the Turus sum end. And now we're going to look at the And now we're going to look at the flat connections on these three manifolds that I'm going to call it Y sharp. So instead of Y, we're going to look at flat connections on this guy. Another place that we have to modify the definition is that instead of looking at SU2 connections, we're going to look at SO3 connections. And whenever you have an SO3 connection, the topological type of the bundle, underlying bundle is determined by some choice of ZMA2 homology class. Zma2 homology class. In this case, we require that this homology class, which is the second ancient holy class, to be the Poincar√© dual of our closed curve omega. Great, so now again, by taking monadromia along the loops inside y, we can inside the whole specs we can identify this with chi-sharp or y. The advantage, I mean, when you work with this geometrical interpretation, you would get some advantages. One of them is some function which you would get once you have this interpretation in terms of connections. You can define a functional and our character varieties, which is called a transience functional. So, in the case that, for example, you work with chi or y, so any connection. So any connection in this space can be identified, any connection on our three manifold y can be identified with the one form and then with the one form with values in the adjoint in the in the Lie group of your in the Lie algebra of your Lie group SU2. So here A is a one-form, you can think about it as a one-form with values in the Lie algebra SU2. You look You form this free form, A which D A plus two thirds of the triple or product of A. You take the trace of this guy to kill the matrix vector, and now you have a three form and you integrate it over your z manifold y. So the outcome would be this German-Simmons functional, but it turns out that whenever you have two connections which are related by an automorphism, the resulting values could differ by an integer. Could differ by an integer. So instead of a function in R, you would get an S1 valid function. But there is a, you know, whenever you have such a function, you can go to some Z cover of your character variety here. I'm going to call it chi-tild, and then you have an R-valued function. You can do something. Okay, so maybe I should also say that here we're not really using the flatness condition, so you can also define this for the space of all connections. For the space of all connections, for the configuration space of connections. And there's a similar story for chi-sharp, an S1 valued function, and then you would get an R valued function over some Z cover. And finally, you can even work with arbitrary connections, not necessarily flat connections. So, frame floor homology is a morsel homology of this transcendence functional in the case that we work with. In the case that we work with the three-manifold Y-sharp and the character variety Y sharp. So we look at the term Simon's functional defined on the space of all connections which are defined on Y sharp. So that's roughly speaking the definition of frame floor homology which was defined by, I mean, floor defined some general construction for defining a floor homology instead of four homology for three manifolds with For three manifolds with choices of SO3 bundle, or this specific choice of SO3 bundle, this version was defined by Kornhana and Morovka. And like any other version of flow homology, it's the homology of a chain complex. So there's a chain group, C sharp, and a differential D sharp. There is a quasi-fact about this chain complex, which is going to be useful for us. Useful for us. And this cause effect is that the Chern-Simons, like any other version of morphemology, the value of your function, in this case, the Chern-Simons function, provides a filtration on your chain complex. And the associated graded part of the homology. When you have a filter chain complex, you can look at the part of the differential which preserves that filtration. And the associated graded homology through the homology of the Graded homology theory, the homology of this part is going to be the homology of the character by ID. So it's at least this part of instant and floor homology, the frame floor homology is supposed to be some classical object. So this is not quite correct just because of degeneracy. Sometimes your character write, it would be degenerate. So you have to perturb perturb Simon's functional and you would lose the connection to character write. To calculate. But sometimes there are ways to go around this issue and get things that a filtration will give you otherwise. So if you work hard, sometimes you should be able to do that. But at least this part probably doesn't hold in general. Maybe just in general, this one maybe should be replaced by some sort of common index type invariant associated to the character variety. To the character variety. So, this is like, as I say, it's a quasi-fact, so you should treat it with some code. There's also an equivariant type theory whenever we want to work with chi-o-y as opposed to chi-sharp of y. This is not going to be very relevant for this talk, so I'm going to go over this part very quickly. The story here is richer, but at the same time, it's much. Same time is much less developed. So, for example, perhaps the most satisfactory case is for integer homologous spheres developed by Florin Donaldson in the case of rational homologous spheres, Austin Brown. They had some earlier work and recent work of Mark Mueller, Pulsar and that. And so, in the case that the first betting number is greater than zero, there is much Than zero, there is much less known, but there are some old work about the case of circle bundles, which would go back to Topps, Morgan, Ruberman, Murovka, and Kronheimer-Morovka as a part of their structure theorem. They also have to develop some floor theory for circle bundles. Perhaps a lot of people in the audience are more comfortable with Higgar floor homology than instant floor homology. So let me make a comparison. Homology. So let me make a comparison between these stories. So this I-sharp or why the frame floor homology is supposed to be the analog of HF hat. And this equivariant type theory is supposed to be the analog of HF minus, HF plus, H of infinity, and H of red. There's a little bit of more construction that you can get in the instantum side just because you know how the reducible works out. Like for example, you can. Works out, like for example, you can get some invariant which categorifies the casino invariant. But as I said, this part is not so much relevant for the talk. Today, I'm going to mostly focus on frame floor etymology. So, as I said, there is this filtration, and one can ask, what is this filtration good for? So, you know, one thing that you might want to do with this is to construct some topological invariants. Construct some topological invariance, and again, you can do it both on the frame floor homology side or the equivariant side. Although there are some obvious things to try, I'm not aware of anything on the frame floor homology side, but on the equivariant side, there are some works in the three-manifold direction. And also, you know, in the case of NAS, you know, Chris and I have been working on. Chris and I have been working on something related to the Nod case, which is coming from the equivariant side, combining with the filtration. But another thing that you might want to do using your filtration, which is again the more relevant part for today's talk, is to construct isomorphisms. Let me just remind you some elementary fact about filter chain complexes that whenever you have a filter Whenever you have a pair of filter chain complexes and maybe a chain map between them, we're going to assume that we're going to look at the graded part of the homology of the graded part of these chain complexes and our filter chain map would also induce a map at this level. So, another assumption that we're going to make is that this map is an isomorphism. So, if we know this, then we can, under some appropriate convergence condition, we can say that the map induced by our chain map F is an isomorphism at the level of homology of C and C prime. And in the context of incentive theories, really any three-manifold floor homology. Really, any three-manifold fluoro homology, because you know, you can the chain maps are coming from cobodism maps. But if you're also interested in the filtration, the cobordism maps in incentive theory are somewhat behaving well with respect to these cobordism maps. There is a similar headache with degenerate solutions on cobordisms. But sometimes you can I can sometimes you can get around that, and if you can do that, then the greater part of the cobordism of the part which doesn't increase the filtration are related to the index zero elements of the character variety of your cobordism. So again, it's something very topological. You really don't need to solve any PDE here to see what that part says. Okay, that's as much as I want to say about frame floor homes. About frame floor homology. Now, I'm gonna look at symplectic frame floor homology, which is the symplectic variant of floor homology. To do that, we have to fix the Higgard diagram for our three-manifold. So we have a genus G Higgard surface, which decomposes our three manifolds into two handle bodies of genus G. And this would induce a decomposition of the three manifolds. A decomposition of the three-manifold Y-sharp. Remember that Y-sharp is just a connected sum of y and T3. And we're going to take basically the connected sum of the Higgard decomposition of Y and the decomposition of T3 into the union of T2 times intervals. So this way we would get a decomposition of our three-manifold Orchestra along the disconnected Riemann surface, which is a genus, a union of a genus. Which is a genus, a union of a genus G1 Roman surface and a Taurus. And we also have this two, you know, handle body type objects, which are the connected sum of handle bodies with T2, boundary sum of handle bodies with T2 times an interval. And now we're going to look at, you know, just, you know, everything is defined in terms of character rate. Now we're going to also look at the character rate is associated. At the character varieties associated to this. So, the character variety of sigma, once you fix a good choice of representatives for the fundamental group of sigma g plus one, you know, the interesting connected component of sigma, it can be identified with the two g plus two tuples of elements of SU2, which satisfy this relation. So, the product of the commutators is supposed to be negative identity. And you have to model. Identity. And you have to model by the conjugation action. Now you want to also see what we would get as the character variety of these objects H1 sharp and H2 sharp. So in the case that the choice of generators for the fundamental group of this surface is compatible with the choice of generators of the fundamental group of Of the fundamental group of handlebody, you would get this description for chi of H sharpening particle. You should notice that it can be identified, you know, it can be identified with a subset of chi of sigma, where you should get this additional relations that most of these generators, A1 up to Ag plus one, except one of them, are supposed to be identity. Again, you have to model by the conjugation action. It's a well-known fact about this character right is that in the case of the Riemann surface, this is a symplectic manifold of dimension 6g. And for H sharp, H1 sharp, and H2 sharp, we would get two Lagrangians. So dimension 3G, but in fact, you can say more. So these Lagrangians are if you're morphic to copy and 2G copies of Copy and 2G copies of the three-dimensional sphere. And Warheim and Woodward define three-manifold invariant as the Log-Range and floor homology of this guy. So the version of Logan-Jamfloor homology, which is used here, is just a slight variant of the version that Kirsten talked about in her talk at the beginning. So here you're working in a monotone case as opposed to the exact case. But at the end, you would get a three-manifold invariant, and I'm going to use Manifold invariant, and I'm going to use a non-standard notation for that. I'm going to call it SI sharp of RCT manifold Y. So the main theorem that we have is that this gauge theoretical invariant I sharp of Y is isomorphic to this simple active type invariant, which is S I sharp of Y. If you interpret everything Everything correctly, you can also leave this isomorphism as the isomorphism of filtered invariant. In fact, thinking about filtration is also helpful with your proof here. I'm going to say a little bit about the proof. So, okay, so remember that the frame floor homology is the homology of the chain complex. C C sharp, where C sharp is freely generated by, I mean, at least if you if you don't make if you don't have to make any perturbation, which is not quite correct in general, some freely generated by some character variety. And there was some similar interpretation, and there is a similar interpretation for the symplectic version. The key point that you should notice here is that. You should notice here is that the chain groups can be identified with each other, but the differentials are potentially different. And you would like to, so now you would like, as I said, so this guy is filtered and there's also a similar filtration on this guy. And what you would like is to get some sort of chain map between these two guys, which would give you the isomorphism. You the isomorphism. Using the basic homologous algebra lemma that I said before, it would be great if you can get such a chain map which is filtered. And also at the level of chain complexes that we already know that the chain groups can be identified with each other. But if you can also say that your map phi is an isomorphism, then it would be exactly what you need. Be exactly what you need. So that would give us some isomorphisms between these two symplectic and cage theoretical invariants. At the geometrical level, so the differential D is defined by some sort of P D, which is the ASD equation, and the other and D prime is defined by another P D which is the Cauchy. Another PD, which is the Cushy-Liman equation. So, if you want to define a chain map phi, you need to define it by some sort of mixing of ASCI equation and the Cushy-Riemann equation. So, I'm going to talk about, I'm going to spend two slides talking about how this mixture is defined. So, I'm not sure, this is probably, this is. This is more on the analytical side. So, for those of you who are not that much interested, so feel free to zone up for two slides. In any case, the key tool for us is a PDE, which is called mixed equation, was developed by Max Lipiensky. So, what is this PDE? So, this is defined for any, you know, close. For any close-oriented, so you start with a close-oriented surface, possibly disconnected, and associated to this guy, we have some symplectic manifold of dimension three times the Euler class of our immense surface. We consider these regions inside the complex plane and a solution, the mixed equation is an equation for a pair of for a pair where Of for a pair where A is a connection, A is a connection and the product of this region omega minus times sigma. And again, you should also have to fix some appropriate choice of, I should call it in class. And here, the map here is supposed to be a map from omega plus to your character, right? And this pair is supposed to satisfy a pair of equations. So, A is supposed to be an AST equation, and U is supposed to be a holomorphic curve equation. And the only place that these two curves are interacting with each other is along this interface line, the y-axis, and they're supposed to satisfy some matching conditions. So, for any point on the y-axis, the restriction of A to The restriction of A to that point in time sigma has to be flat. And it should represent, so whenever it's flat, it represents an element of the character variety, and that element is equal to the value of our function at their point 0 and y. Just very, you know, roughly speaking, the main reason that this is a good condition is that because it's a combination of the Lagrangian matching condition. Of the Logan Jam matching condition from simple psychiatry during Neumann boundary conditions. So, in some sense, it's a mixture of three different type of boundary conditions. All of them come together and would give us a nicely hate in a modular problem. In particular, what we can do, I mean, there are a bunch of analytical things that one can say about this mixed equation. One can say about this mixed equation. Most of these things are proved by Max. So, firstly, this mixed equation defines the Fredhom problem. And the moduli of solutions for this mixed equation satisfies a certain compactness property, which is a mixture of Gromov compactness in simple active topology and Ulambeck compactness in gauge theory. And finally, Um and finally, the modular solution satisfies some elliptic regularity conditions. So the solutions of these equations are too less smooth. In the definition of phi, you have to use some global version of this map phi. Just going to go over that very quickly. That again, you have a region inside the complex plane, union of omega minus and omega plus. So out of this. So, out of this, you form a four-manifold, which is the union of omega minus times sigma. So, like the last slide, but now we're going to also put two, three manifolds to this guy. So, we're going to put here it should be H1 sharp. So, there is a type, or H1 sharp times R to this boundary component of omega minus times sigma, which is R times sigma, and you're going to do something. Time signal, and you're going to do something similar along this other boundary component. So now, so this now we're going to look at again at a pair of a connection and a map. So here the connection is defined on this four manifold. So A is a connection, this four manifold X, and U is a map from this other region omega plus to the character variety. And then they should satisfy the mixed equations, which means that it satisfies the Satisfies the AST equation and use a Holomorphic curve equation. Along this boundary component eta1 and eta two of omega plus, we have some Lagrangian boundary conditions. And limit of, so we also have some limiting conditions. So as you go in this direction, and yeah, you know, I said I guess I mean. I said I guess I mixed up the x and y direction here, but as you know, in the way that I draw x and y here, if y goes to negative infinity, then we're supposed to converge to some element of our character right here. And there's something similar for the limit of u as we go as y goes to infinity. And finally, there is some energy condition on this pair A and U. So the alternum of the curvature plus the L to norm of the curvature. Curvature plus the altar norm of the gradient of u is supposed to be some finite number. Okay, so that's as much as I want to say about the proof. But there's a slight generalization of this, which is going to be useful later for us. So let me go over that generalization. So let's take a three-manifold edge with boundary sigma as this schematic. Boundary sigma, as this schematic picture suggests, this is going to be a disconnected boundary. So we're also going to fix some Zma2 homology class as a relative Zma2 homology class represented by this path, omega, which is the restriction of its boundary to each boundary component, to each component. Component to each connected component of sigma is non-trivial. So, this is just a slight variation. I mean, this is a variation of the picture H1 chart that we had before. So, for example, you can start with the handle body and glue I times T2 to this handlebody to get this picture. There's a theorem which is due to Harold, which says that if you look at the character variety of H and you can Of h, and you can perturb this time into an immersed log dimension. To be more precise, Harrel's original theorem is treating some harder version of this problem when there is no omega and you have to think about singularities. But this is basically, I mean, this theorem follows easily from its work. And so, what we can say about this log. And so, what we can say about these Lagrangians is that, in the case that if this Lagrangian is embedded as opposed to some immersed Lagrangian, which Hurl's theorem would guarantee that, then we know that this is a monotone Lagrangian with minimal Maslow number four. So, if you don't know what these guys are as fine, I mean, you should just think about these conditions as some. just think about these conditions as something which would give you you know which would let you to define floor homology so now we're gonna consider the case that we have two such three manifolds h1 and h2 with the same boundary so here both of these guys have boundary sigma so what we can do is that again we can associate to each of these three manifolds h1 and h2 two characters H1 and H2, two character varieties, chi of H1 and chi of H2. And the assumption that we're going to make is that these are both embedded. So whenever they're embedded using this theorem, we can define the Lagrangian floor homology. And this Lagrangian floor homology is supposed to be isomorphic with the version of incentive floor homology. The version which is given by pulling these two three manifolds together to get a closed manifold. Three manifolds together to get a closed manifold, and with a choice of some homology class, which is given by gluing omega 1 and omega 2. So, the expectation for the inverse case for the extension of this result to the case that your three manifold is inverse is that That you know, your Lagrangian floor homology for H1 and H2 has to be modified with some bounding co-chains. And once you do that, once you do this thing, whatever this means, once you insert this into the picture, then the isomorphism should hold. But unlike the stuff that I talked about so far, this seems to be. But so far, this seems to be much more technical thing. If you wanna, if it holds it, probably the proof would be much more technical, especially it's, I would expect that this would require some virtual techniques, which is a really scary thing for me. Okay, so this is probably at the end of the first half of my talk. Next, I'm going to talk about something which I should say that is a work very much in progress. So, you know, whatever that I'm going to talk about might break up in a week, break apart in a week, or maybe in a year I can say that this is a work in progress. Maybe before I retire, we'll have something written on this. Not that I'm making. This. Now that I'm making an apology, I should also make an apology for the first part of the talk. I guess both to the audience and my collaborators that, you know, the main reason that the papers are not there for the first part of the talk is that I'm slowing down the writing process. Okay, so I'm going to switch to the second part of the talk, but are there any questions up to this point? Okay, so if there are no questions, um let me start with a question. So, I guess a natural question at this point is that why, I mean, what, so what? So, what so what is it good for? So, if whenever you have this sort of relation between some invariant and gauge theory and Gauge theory and symplectic topology, what can you do with that? I mean, personally, I find it interesting because it would give you an interaction between gauge theory and symplectic topology. At the very least, it's a thing that you can talk about in a conference and interactions between gauge theory and symplectic topology. But I guess better reason is that maybe you can use simplectic topology to learn about frame floor homology in this special case, which is In this special case, which is an invariant defined in the context of gauge theory. So, frame floor homology as a three-manifold invariant is supposed to be a more natural invariant. I don't want to spend time on making that more precise, but some manifestations of this point is that, for example, the cobordism maps are defined in an easier way for the context of frame floor homology. On the other hand, On the other hand, symplectic instantaneous homology should be a more computable invariant. I mean, we already have seen this phenomena in the context of cybergut and gauge theory as a relation between genomic fluorhomology is supposed to be a more natural invariant, but Hagar fluorhomology is the more complete open. And basically, And basically, I guess the main reason, or one of the reasons, is that there are many much more developed techniques to study Lagrangian floridomology, and even more generally, for a collection of Lagrangian floromology and the Foucault category that you would form out of them. So maybe it's good to elaborate on this. Maybe it's good to just look at some special values of this. Some special values of these character varieties for small values of genus. So we're looking at chi of sigma g for some small values of genus. So in the case that genus is zero, this character variety is empty. Something which was already implicit in my talk is that in the case that genus is one, we're not getting anything interesting. The character ratio is just a point. The first interest. The first interesting case is when we look at the Genes2 case, which is supposed to be a six-dimensional syntactic manifold. In fact, this was already completely characterized as a complete intersection by a new state. So there's a theorem due to Newstead which says that this chi of sigma due to the genus2 case is equivalent, it's simple automorphic. Want is simply isomorphic or even more general. It's as a KL manifold is isomorphic to the intersection of these two quadrics. So here you just have to pick lambda i's to be some distinct sequence of six numbers and then you would get this equivalent complete intersection and this complete complete intersection can be identified with this character right. Let me also give you some block definition of some block functions in this character variety. Because most of these Lagrangians are already defined, but just to go over them again. So if you look at this Genus2 human surface and look embedded inside this Genus2 surface, then what you can do is that you can Then, what you can do is that you can glue a two-handle along this genus to surface. So, this way you would get a three-manifold, just following the same notation as before. I'm going to call it edge. But this time, this three-manifold edge has two boundary components. One of them is a genus2 surface and a genus1 surface. So, the character variety of this three-manifold would give us a Lagrangian S3 inside the character variety of the surface. The character variety of the surface sigma2. They can be using the fact that the character variety of gene S1 surface is just of one. More generally, we can look at a knot in S3, or maybe even just a frame knot inside some arbitrary three manifold. Look at the NOT complement, take the boundary sum of the NOT complement and T2 times an interval, and look at this category. In this special case, that are not. That our naught is the unknown inside S3, this would give us this log bunch and skew. So an important assumption from now on is to work over complex numbers, not like ZMOC or any other cyclic group. So let's look at these five simple closed curves inside the Genus2 surface. To the surface. There is a theorem which is due to Smith. So Ivan and Smith shows that if you look at the five Lagrangian spheres, which is associated to this five simple closed curve, then it would generate the Foucault category of our genus to surface, at least the summand of this Foucault category. Again, this is not so important. I'm not gonna, I don't want. important I'm not gonna I don't want to get into that too much what exactly I mean by some n here but in in a monotone setup you know the Foucault category decomposes into some you know some n depending on the eigenvalues of the action of the first two class of your symplectic manifold but the key point here is that this is the most interesting stomach of the Fouquet category of chi of sigma 2 And just to say a little bit about, just say some, throwing out some keywords related to the proof, the proof relies on Chikarlevschev's theory, Seido's exact triangle, and a generation criterion, which is due to Sido. But I guess the question is that what does this mean for a topology? So let me instead Let me instead of just reminding you what the generation part of this theorem is, talk about some consequence here. So if you take your Lagrangian, so you have five Lagrangians, take any pair of these guys and look at the Lagrangian floor homology of these guys. And just take the drag sum. Then the A infinity products of your Foucault category would turn this to Category would turn this guy into an A-infinity algebra. So we have an A-infinity algebra constructed out of these five Lagrangians. Given any other Lagrangian like L, we can do something similar. We can take the floor homology of any of these Lagrangian spheres with this Lagrangian L and take the direct sum. So this way we would get M L, which also has some A infinity structure. This one is Structure. This one is supposed to be an A-infinity module. And what the generation part implies is that for any two such Lagrangians, if you look at the Lagrangian floor homology, it can be computed as the homology of as the infinity module homomorphisms of these two modules. So this would give us some out. So this would give us some algebraic recipe to compute this Lagrangian floor homology once you have a good grasp and these two infinity modules and more importantly, I guess the infinite algebra. So you should think about this as some sort of Bullen theorem. So maybe I just repeat this in the context of three-manifold Lagman Gens. Remember that this holds for any Lagwan Gen inside this, but we already have. Inside this, but we already have just some Larvinians which are coming from low-dimensional topology. So, in particular, if you fix a pair of three-manifolds with the choice of a homology class in it, this, I'm just going to first copy this, what we had from the previous slide, that's that the Lagrangian floor homology of Lagrangians associated to this guy is this algebraic guy, but using this. But using this ITF floor type result, we know that this can be also identified with some instant on floor homology. So this gives us, I mean, like, you know, for one of the challenges for instant on floor homology is to do computations. And this gives, you know, at least maybe a recipe to see if we can get some out, you know, some output. Some out some algebraic tools to compute instantoval homology. So, to be maybe again to be a little bit more concrete here, I'm going to assume that the Lagrangian that we're working with is the Lagrangian which is associated to a knot complement. And I want to see how the module associated to this guy looks like. I mean, I cannot say too much about this module. Not say too much about this module, but at least one thing that we can see is at least the underlying group structure here. So remember that this was just a direct sum of five floor homology groups? Say that again? Was that a question? Okay, I think that. Okay. So we take the floor homology of L, gamma. floor homology of L gamma i with our Lagrangian gem which is associated to a naught. So and there was this infinite modular structure but at least for this the vector spaces here what we we can basically determine this guy so for example the first one can be identified with some version of incentive floor homology I sharp avoid the frank floor homology that we talked about. That we talked about. The second one is R sharp of the zero surgery on R naught. And perhaps the most interesting one is this third one, which can be identified with some sutured invariant and then some isomorphism, which is again due to Kronheimeromorphic. You can get relation to a not invariant I natural or y and k. And in this case, these two last sum ends are zero. Sum answer is zero. So this is basically telling us that if once you know, you know, something, once you know enough about the not invariant, and you know, this, you know, your three manifold and zeros there, but plus some more important information, which is the infinity module structure, then you have a you basically know everything about this Lagrangian as far as fluoromology is concerned. Flora homology is concerned. So, in some sense, this would give a border picture for manifolds with torso-boundary. And everything is just the immediate consequence of Ivan Smith's work. So, I mean, sometimes if you just work with simple active floor homology as opposed to instant frame floor homology, sorry, simple active frame floor homology as opposed to frame floor homology, you really don't need any. You really don't need any at your floor type result. But I guess an important question here is that what is this algebra, A? What is this A-infinity algebra? And that's the main challenge that Irvin Smith doesn't tell you what this guy is. But there is a variation of this A infinite algebra that he basically characterizes as the A infinite algebra. Acquired as the aim of the algebra. So, to describe his second result, I have to give a different description of a genus II surface. So, think about the genus II surface as the branch double cover of P1 branch along six points, which are this P0, P1 up to P5. So, by taking branch double cover, we would get a genus to remain surface. Surface. And now we're going to look at five line segments here. When you go to the branch double cover, you would get five loops inside the genus II remet surface. And what Iron tells you, maybe both Iron and Paul, is that the Foucault category of this character variety, again, in the interesting summit here, is generated by Generated by five log 1 gens which are associated to this guy. There's a typo here. I should have written L of A to 1, L of Ata2 up to L of A to 5. And more importantly, they also characterize what the aim quinta algebra associated to these five Lagrangians are. Okay, so to be a little bit more specific, I should say. More specific, I should say that Iron tells you how to identify this Foucault category with the Foucault category of Genes II surface, just the surface, not any categories. And you should think about this as some instance of Donaldson and Paul's cyberquin at the categorical level. Then, Saido basically is a part of his proof of homological mirror symmetry for a gene. Of homological mirrors symmetrical for a genus to human surface characterizes the A infinity algebra associated to these five curves, and you know the infinity algebra associated to the Lagrangian script associated to these isomorphics using the work of is isomorphic to the algebra determined by Seido using the work of Smith. Okay, so let's see how much time I have. Let's see how much time I have, so I don't have that much time left. So I just want to say briefly that one might wonder how, I mean, like using the actual flow type result, you can transfer this into the frame floor homology part, into the world of instant engage theory part. And it's, I mean, I guess it's reasonable to ask how much of these things can be done independent of doing something on the symplectic side and going back there. It seems that at least the generation It seems that at least the generation part can be done on the gate theory side. Again, I don't want to make any concrete statement in this very much progress part of the talk, so I'm not going to say too much about this. But the part about characterization of the A-infinity algebra, it worked, I mean, at least Smith's work, you know, goes through some symplectic manifolds, more specifically Lefschwiber. Falls more specifically, leftist vibrations, which are not coming from any sort of gauge theory. So, I'm not, I don't have any idea that if you know, at least you know, the characterization part can be done directly on the gauge theory. So, let me end the talk by some questions, which are sort of maybe related to the talks tomorrow. So, the first question that one can ask is that If you look at, as I said, there are objects of this Foucault category which are coming from not complement. So if you look at that part of Foucault category, is it possible to get some immersed curve picture for this guy? Is it possible to get some sort of order theory which is governed by immersed curves in a surface? And the rationale for this question is that if you look at the character variety of the two-dimensional Taurus, but you know, this time you're looking at the SU2 character variety. So far, we've been looking at a different one. We would get a similar space, which is known as pillow case. And you might hope that, you know, maybe, you know, something related, if you work with an appropriate version of floor homology in this floor case, maybe you can say something about that part of the category. Part of the category. I mean, similar results in different theories would appear in the work of Jan F. Jake and Liam, so in Higar floor homology and also more recently in the work of Artem, Liam, and Claudius in the context of choanophomology. And I mean, this is my understanding that both of these results. Both of these results are, they rely on a work of Hayden, Katsarkov, and Kansa, which maybe would be, I mean, assuming that what I said before would work out, it would be interesting to maybe compare this with this work and see if you can see any immersed, any surface and immersed curve in that picture or not. Another thing which is missing in Another thing which is missing in this story is the transimus filtration. I guess it's a natural question to ask what can be said about the transimens filtration. And finally, there have been some interesting recent progresses and frame fluoro homology of surgeries on NAS. In one direction, Thai. In one direction, Thai, Juanitya, and Chris had some work, and more recently, John and Stephen also have some work. Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to say anything interesting about their work, but it would be interesting to see if there's any, how this history would compare with their works. Okay, I think I'm running out of time, so I should stop here. All right, thank you very much. All right, thank you very much. Let's have a nice round of applause for Ali. And rather than going straight to the breakout rooms, I've sent the meeting information for the breakout rooms, but I think there's time for a couple questions, should there be any. So can you see the surface operator? Is a surface operator in the Lagrangian flow homology? That's an excellent question. You mean like surface operators, you mean like new classes in frame flow model and down? Yeah, that's a great question. There are actually related to how do you want to answer this question? So there's an action of so. Of so in general, there's an action of the quantum cohomology of the underlying symplectic manifold and your Lagrangian floor homology. I'm not sure if I can write down here or not. Yeah, okay, sorry. It doesn't seem that I have maybe I tried to write down here. So in general, if you if you have log binds in If you have Lagrangian L1 and L2, there's an action of the quantum cohomology and a Lagrangian floor homology of this guy. And in this case, the surface operators are coming from the action of some elements of quantum cohomology of the character variety. There are some interesting. Some interesting Komoji classes in context of the character variety, which goes back, I guess, to Mumford and maybe even also Atti about that you can use, look at the image of those guys and they would give you the surface operators and you know and the gauge to the side. Any uh further questions? Any further questions for Ali? Can you use your understanding of this sort of L1, L2, and L3 inside of the character variety for the genus 2 surface to prove an exact triangle for I hat under Dane surgery or I sharp under Dane surgery or Or also, can you see, for example, that there'd be a relationship between the sort of not floor homology or the instanton knot homology and the I sharp of the manifold using this picture? Yeah, well, I guess so. The first part of the question, do you mean? Question: Do you mean the surgery exact angle? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I mean, like, yeah, like on the so on the symplectic side, you know, there's this sidelines exact, there are the sidelines exact triangles, which are supposed to be the analogues of fluorosurger exact triangle. I think historically, maybe they were even motivated by a fluorosurgeric triangle. By a floor surgery exact triangle. I mean, like, yeah, you already have the surgery exact triangle, but you should also, I mean, if you like, you can also do it and you know, just see it as some analog of in the genus to case as, you know, as a special case of side of the exact triangle. For a higher genus, you have to, yeah, I mean, there's a work of whereheim and Woodward related to that. Related to that. But for the second part of your question, yeah, I mean, the hope is that, like, I mean, like, I mean, the bad thing about this picture, at least the thing that I don't know about this picture, is that you know this underlying space. So, you know, you see as a part of the Lagrangian, as a part of the, you know, the module associated to a node complement. You know, to a NOT complement, you see something which is supposed to be analog of HFK of your NOT. But here, the missing part is what is the A-infinity algebra. And honestly, I don't know how to compute this. And I suspect that Iron also doesn't know how to compute this A-infinity algebra. But I mean, this one, Irvin tells you how to compute the A-infinity. You, how to compute the infinite algebra, and some of them, you know, you would see some things related to the knot. I mean, you have a freedom to pick, you know, this 801 up to 805. And if you pick them nicely, you know, you would see also something related to the floor homology of your not floor homology. But I probably shouldn't make any concrete statement here because I'm Any concrete statement here because I'm sure that I would make a wrong statement. But I think that if one looks at these things long enough and understand Iron's work, there should be some relation also to, one should be able to see some relation to I natural of you're not. I'm not sure if I answered your question. If I answered your question, not but partly. Yeah, yeah, I think yes. Okay, good. All right, if there are no more questions, let's thank the speaker one more time. And we'll all move on to the various chat rooms. It's a little bit sad that we're split into three groups.
