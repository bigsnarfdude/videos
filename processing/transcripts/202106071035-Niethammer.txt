I'm recording in trouble. Hi, everybody. I'm going to present our work on the velocity jump discontinuity for single bubbles rising in a visible elastic fluid. And this is a joint work with Professor Brent from Theo Kraz and Professor Boete from Theo Darmstadt. First, I would like to introduce a few characteristic phenomena of rising bubbles in viscoelastic fluids. And the first one is the velocity-jump discontinuity. And you can see it in the if you plot the thermal rise velocity over the critical bubble over the bubble volume. Then, for example, if you take a look at the black curve, you can see that at You can see that at some critical volume, the velocity jumps by about one order of magnitude. And this jump discontinuity can be observed when the polymer concentration is sufficiently large. For example, for 0.3 weight percent or smaller concentrations, it cannot be observed. And the next thing. And the next phenomenon is related to the bubble shape. It's sometimes called a caspidal shape. And so the shape of the bubble in this type of flow is very particular. And the third phenomenon is the negative wake. And this has been first observed by Hassager and later confirmed by And later confirmed by PIV measurements. And the negative weight can be observed from an external fixed observer. And it means that the velocity in the wake points in the opposite direction of that in a Newtonian flow. And if you take a look at the PIB measurements, you can see. measurements you can see that the negative wake is approximately the region is approximately a cone so to summarize the effects there is a velocity jump the caspidal shape and the negative wake and all of this phenomena have been studied extensively in both experiments and numerical Numerical simulations. However, the physical mechanism is not completely understood, and also the correlation between these phenomena. And the present work, we would like to get further insights by means of transient three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. When working with Working with viscoelastic fluids or when simulating such flows, we have to deal with the high Weisenberg number problem. I think that this problem is well known in this audience. And so I just would like to mention that we need to stabilize the numerical method and to demonstrate. And to demonstrate this, why this is necessary, I just show a simulation of 4-1 contraction flow. And you can see the solution of a standard method compared to a stabilized method. In the flow field, you can see that both in the beginning of this animation, the flow has already almost reached a steady state. Almost reached the steady state solution, but if we continue just a little further, then the standard method blows up and the simulation stops. And for this reason, we use the stabilization approach and we use some stabilization approaches which are based on a change of the constitutive variable. And there have been There have been several methods proposed in the literature. For example, the log confirmation approach or the root confirmation approach or some more general form which do not depend on a particular function. And we use the following framework: the polymer that's a strong. The polymer, the stress is split into a solvent and a polymer part. And for the polymer part, we solve the constitutive equations for the conformation tensor. This is a model-independent form where the model can be introduced by specification of the green function. And to stabilize this equation, we introduce the Equation: We introduced some function of the conformation tensor, and as you can see in the table, this falls back to the root confirmation or the logarithm confirmation, depending on which function you introduce. And the rheological models are introduced by this representation functions where we specify some scalar coefficients. Specify some scalar coefficients that depend on the invariance of the conformation tensor. We have implemented this framework in a modular C ‚Åá  library and with this library we can we are very flexible to combine the different representation functions with different virological models and we did And we did some validation and testing in standard benchmark cases. For example, the 4.1 contraction benchmark. And this benchmark is used with the standard setting Oldroid B fluid and viscosity ratio one to nine. And we simulate we do mesh convergence study with different stabilization approaches. With different stabilization approaches. On the right, you can see a sketch of the geometry and also of the flow structure. What's usually compared in this benchmark is the corner vortex and the lip vortex at the re-entrant corner. And the next slide shows some results. The next slide shows some results of the streamlines. Here you can see the corner vortex decreases with increasing Weisenberg number and the lip vortex increases in size and at some point it becomes so large that it touches the top wall. Here you can see Here you can see the results for the corner vortex length over the Weisenberg number. And one finding is that for higher Weisenberg numbers, we need more mesh resolution to achieve mesh convergence. And with the meshes used in the study, at some point we cannot achieve a unique solution. A unique solution with different stabilization approaches. And there are some more findings. For example, if we compare the vortex length over the mesh resolution, then we see that there's a convergence of different stabilization approaches when the mesh is refined. And what we also see is that for What we also see is that for under-resolved meshes, the small root function is more accurate than the log conformation. Let's now continue with the two-phase flow and we employ a method which is based on the algebraic volume of fluid method, and we use the interface. Use the interform solver in open form. We have extended this solver for viscoelastic fluids. The idea, the basic idea is that the interface is implicitly captured by a phase indicator function, which is one in one phase and zero in the other phase. And the interface is represented by values between zero and one. 0 and 1. And in this approach, it's very important to use some special schemes for the transport of this volume fraction field because it needs to the scheme needs to keep the field sharp and the volume fraction bounded between 0 and 1 at the same time. And for this, there are some approaches. There are some approaches, for example, the flux corrected transport algorithm, and an implementation of this is called Mules in Open Form. The model equations can be derived from volume averaging of the local instantaneous equations for the bulk and the interface Trump conditions. This requires. This requires a closure, and for the closure, we have applied the homogeneous mixture model. You can see that the equations are formulated by means of mixture quantities, and the polymer terms are shown in blue. There's an a bulk term and an interphase term, and the details. And the details of these terms and the implementation can be found in our publication. Let's now take a look at the setup, case setup. We initialize the simulation by placing a spherical bubble in the center of a cubic box, and the dimension is large enough. Is large enough such that the boundary conditions have no effect on the rise velocity. And if you take a look at the computational mesh, then you see that we use some adaptive refinement towards the interface such that we can save some computational costs. Computational costs and the setup is based on the experiments by Pils and Bren. We use the fluid properties of the 0.8 weight percent prestol solution and we employ the Fante Tanner model with the stabilization of root approach root conformation. Root confirmation. And we use a moving reference frame, which means that the computational frame is moved with the bubble such that the bubble always remains in the center. On the next slide, you can see some transient results. The bubble rise velocities. Rise velocities over time, and at some point, the shape of the bubbles. And there's some dynamic in the beginning of the simulation. It goes through a local maximum, and at this point, there's almost no deformation. But if we continue the simulation, then the bubble. The bubble deforms, and this is more pronounced for the supercritical bubbles. And then there's a second acceleration of the bubble until we reach the steady state rise velocity. And this is significantly higher for the supercritical bubbles. The supercritical bubbles. Here you can see the flow field around a supercritical bubble. And as you can see, the negative wake is captured by this model. And on the next slide, we Shows a comparison of the terminal rise velocities over the bubble volume. And if we compare the data between simulation and experiments, we can show some good quantitative agreement. We can now analyze the stress profiles of the Stress profiles of the subcritical and supercritical bubbles. And what it is shown here in polar coordinates. For the subcritical state, the distribution is different to the supercritical state. Supercritical state. Here we have higher maxima, stress maxima, but also on a larger region in the northern hemisphere of the bubble. The next slide shows some transient results, but yeah, this is just Yeah, this just shows how the how the stress is and the bubble shape are inter are connected. But for this talk, I would like to go deeper into the analysis of the conformation tensor. Conformation tensor. And what you can see here is a plot of the trace of the conformation tensor. And the conformation tensor represents the deformation of the polymer molecules. So if the trace is high, then the The molecules deform to a greater degree, and this can be seen in this when we compare the sub-critical and the supercritical state. From the diagram, we see that there is almost no deformation below the equator, and while for the supercritical state, there is a consistent. Critical state: there is a considerable amount of deformation in the northern hemisphere, but also at the equator and at some part below the equator. And now we would like to go deeper into the confirmation tensor analysis. We can also take a look at the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. eigenvectors and if you take a look at the eigenvalues then a value larger than one means that the polymer is stretched and this is shown on the next slide for some horizontal cutting planes through the bubble It's an animation of the simulation and what you can see if we start, if the bubble starts rising, then there's an alignment in circumferential direction around the fluid interface and. And moreover, if you take a look at the scale of the eigenvalues, then you can see that there's a stretching and relaxation of the polymers. And we now like to compare the results from the subcritical state to the supercritical state. The supercritical state. In the beginning, it's quite similar, but if we run the simulation a little further, then we see some differences in this data. So, first of all, there's a high First of all, there's a higher stretching in the northern hemisphere, and the stretching goes down to the equator. And the relaxation takes place in the southern hemisphere of the bubble. And this is one of the major differences because in the subcritical bubble, all the relaxation took place in the northern part. Took place in the northern part of the bubble. And this is. One minute, please. Yeah, this to conclude, this observation is this interplay between kinematic stretching and relaxation is the main is the main Yeah, i is the is the main um reason for for the velocity jump. If it takes place in the northern hemisphere, then um there is no jump. But depending on the ratio of the advective to the relaxation time scale, if the relaxation takes place in the southern hemisphere, then there's this pushes the bubble upwards and The bubble upwards, and we see some increase in the velocity or the velocity jump. And yeah, this observation and the mechanism for the velocity jump is presented in an upcoming manuscript. And I would like to thank To thank the financial support of BSF, Bundenberg, CRC 1194, and the DFG. Thank you for your attention. Thank you. Thanks very much. Very interesting talk. I've got a question. I don't know if I missed it, but what capillary numbers, what is the effect of interfacial tension here? What capillary numbers are you dealing with? You say you're using mule, for example. So, how much modification did you have to apply? Can you go to? To apply, that you can go to? Um, I have to check the uh capillary numbers. I don't know. Uh, so you haven't you haven't looked at changing the effect of capillary number interfacial tension on the problem? No. So I guess probably want to stay away from very low capillary numbers because of problems with the method, right? Yes. Yes, well, I don't know. I haven't checked the capillary numbers for this simulation, but what I can say is that the effects are dependent on the polymer distribution around the bubble. And so I'm not I'm not completely sure about the Kabul number, but it doesn't depend very much on the surface tension or on the on okay. Thank you. Thank you, Matto. It's okay. There was a question, maybe one question from Mestevan. He has a couple of questions. Yeah. Thanks, Maria. Yeah, thanks, Monica. We'll be quick. I may have missed this information in your 421 geometry. Is this axisymmetric or planar? And what solvent reactions are you analyzing? This is a planar simulation. And we are using a standard setup for this benchmark. I don't know if there's some information missing. Information missing, or yes, I was just asking if it was the geometry was 2D or if it was actually it is a 2D geometry, yes. And planar and beta is it beta one nine as a benchmark or what you took? Yes, one nine. I saw in your presentations that you have many establishations strategies. Did you do any study on what? Study on what was the best for your model for your problems? Well, from this study, we have good experience with some small root functions of the root confirmation approach, but it depends, I think, on the problem. For the rising bubbles, we probably We probably wouldn't need to use the stabilization approach with the PTT model, but if we change the model, for example, to Ultroid B or some different models, it might be necessary. Okay, good. Thanks very much. Great talk. Thank you very much. I think we'll leave all the other questions for the discussion. All the other questions for the discussion, and there's a few of them. If you want to have, well, Matthias, if you want to have a look at the chat as well.
