And some recent developments in the field, and which is very active. But I mean, CISO said we mentioned before some free boundary problems. I would like to make a connection with the diffusion processes, but I'm not an expert, so I will not try. And I try to make a talk which starts a bit from the beginning and gives some glimpse on the new stuff. And I apologize in advance for those of you in the. In advance, for those of you in the audience who are more expert, because it might be a bit too introductory, maybe, but let's see. So, let's start. I will talk a bit about the obstacle problem, then I will explore Caparallis breakthrough in the 70s, which is known as Caparalis dichotomy, which was one of the things that were mentioned in the Abel Prize award. And then I will give you plenty of examples, hopefully, and some plots. So, that we have a bunch of. So that we have a bunch of images in mind. And then I will talk about a result obtained now almost two years ago with a fellow student, Victoria. And yeah, so let's start. So the obstacle problem. Well, basically, the obstacle problem, solutions of the obstacle problem have three properties are functions in n variables which are non-negative. And then as soon as they get positive, they have a prescribed Laplacian which is strictly positive. A prescribed Laplacian which is strictly positive, you can think it to be equal to plus one. And of course, these two conditions are not very much to ask, but then there's a crucial condition, which is the transmission condition, which tells you that the gradient across the boundary of the positivity set vanishes continuously. Okay, and this boundary is called the free boundary. And you can check that this picture is more or less consistent because here you see it's a C1. Because here you see it's a C1 joint and here is zero, and it looks kind of positive. Let me mention that it's custom to also have, I mean, it's not necessary to have exactly plus one on the right-hand side. And we will think and I will present theorems that work in this infinity world. So I'm thinking that it can be a smooth perturbation of one. And actually, in the case in which you have a true analytic function, things might be a bit different and better. Might be a bit different and better, and this was understood by Sakai in the 90s. So it's uh, it's a bit uh uh, but it's a bit restricted to the 2D world and analytic setup, and everything we'll be talking about or not specified, but f is more or less one smooth. Okay, so why obstacle? Uh, for those of you that have never seen it, this is a picture. You present a boundary condition, you minimize the delta energy while lying above a concave function psi, I mean a superharmonic function psi. Then, if you look at the difference between this V and the psi, it solves the equation of the same. I will have to be a bit fast. So, concerning existence, you can use the variational method. You can minimize the declarative energy you see with another term where the activation function with so many is there, right? The positive part of U. So, your function U pays in gradient and wants to go to zero, but you prescribe a boundary condition phi, which is kind of phi. Which is kind of high, and the path. Long story short, it's been known since quite some time ago, I think Stan Pak, yeah, that solution star C11 satisfies the three properties before, so they are non-negative. As soon as they get positive, Laplacian equals F and they're C1, so gradient range continuously. And they're weak solutions of this equation where they, of course, is continuous. So this is an open set, and on this open set, we solve, I mean, we solve the. On this open set, we solve. I mean, we solve this equation in the weak sense. The free boundary, that is the boundary of this set, is free from this perspective because we are thinking that we assign the boundary data, and then we don't know how to control where this boundary will happen, okay, inside. But this is because we take this boundary point of view. If you want, from the point of view of Koshiko-Valeskaya theorem, if you prescribe an analytic curve, you can solve the ODE because you prescribe zero. The idea because you prescribe zero and derivative zero and Laplacian one. So, locally, you can provide many examples just in this way. But I mean, the problem, the perspective usually people have is this one. But it's useful to know that we can generate many examples in this way. Okay, so the big question people have been trying to understand is, is this free boundary smooth? So, or if not, is something is going wrong, what is going wrong? And the picture people have in mind is something like that. So, I would hope to be zero, then a detachment has moved bound. Then a detachment, a smooth boundary. Of course, this is not, I mean, since we are here today, it's not what happens, it's not that easy. So, this is a bit of the story. I mean, it's almost 50 years now since the term of Caffarelli, which was the first major breakthrough, I'd say. And here I'm just recording papers from which things I will be talking about today come into play. But I will just talk about Caffarati's result and then I will present my results, which heavily depends on. Represent my results, which heavily based on the work my advisors. So, this is the most relevant stuff. Okay, so let's explain Caffarelli dichotomy. Basically, Caffarelli realized that our functions are not C11. They're actually twice differentiable. And so, if you pick a point in the free boundary, you can compute the action. That is to say, that if you take a quadratic reserving of u around that point, so you vanish. Around that point, so you vanish, the gradient is zero, so the next order should be quadratic. I do get a profile in the limit which is true-mogeneous. Okay, and already the fact that I get something which is, I get a limit is non-trivial. And Caffari was able to prove that there is a true dichotomy. So either Q is this exactly this type of function, so the positive part squared, and it has this graph, you see, in some direction, or Q is exactly a quadratic polynomial. Is exactly a quadratic polynomial, which, since the scaling is at least the equation invariant, must be itself a solution of the problem, so it's non-negative, and as Laplacian says, one. Let me just mention that, of course, in this case, we would be differentiable because the blow-up is a polynomial. In the other case, we're not technically speaking differentiable because the blow-up is not a polynomial function, but this is a bit more graphical definition. We have a definition, and we have a blow-up. We have a problem. Points of the first type are called regular, and the other ones are called singular, even if in this total, we try to convince you that it is a bit reductive terminology. And they're practically sigmas, n minus k being the expected dimension, the number of non-directions of the polynomial. Okay, so for example, the polynomial is positive definite, so as no non-direction, this is a point sigma zero. This is a point sigma one. Okay, so. Okay, so uh regular points deserve this name because they're regular, and something very nice happens. You can prove a true improvement of flatness. That is to say that a regular point is only surrounded by other regular points, which are arranged tightly around a codimension one manifold, which is smooth, on side of which you are zero, on the other side of which you solve Laplacian equal one. So this picture is 100% correct as soon as you zoom in and out. zoom in and out so regular points basically uh there's nothing more to say they're perfect uh so what about singular points what is the geometric i mean this is the geometrical interpretation of the previous result after all or what comes from the proof what's the geometrical interpretation or the picture in the case of singular points so this is a bit uh scary but i mean basically the equation above is what we prove you're proving that at a point x zero is you send r to zero you are close to a social To zero, we are close to a certain p2 at zero, which is a quadratic polynomial, and that omega thing over there is a modulus of continuity which breaks the critical scaling, which will be equadratic. It's just a restatement of the block. But if you interpret it from the point of view of Whitney data, what you're doing is giving between each points in the closed set sigma, assigning a quadratic polynomial. And if you do a triangular inequality, which are comparable to the distance of the two centers, you find that what you're assigning is. You find that what we're assigning is a continuous map x0 to p to x0 in the world of polynomials. So, this is a jet of a function up to order true. So, it's a value zero, a gradient zero, and a quadratic polynomial. Then you know by Whitney's theorem that you can find a capital F function which extends, which is defined everywhere, which on sigma has exactly this as a gender. So, the value is zero, the gradient is zero, and the point over is this one. And now, if you think about how we define things, If you think about how we define things, well, C minus K is simply contained in the set where the action of this function has a certain rank. The action is p2 and just restating things. But now you can use the classical implicit function theorem to find a geometric interpretation. The geometric interpretation means that sigma is contained at least locally, okay, with the second of all, in a smooth manifold, which is as regular as the gradient of F. Okay, so this is the geometric information you can extract from a Taylor expansion for singular points. From a Taylor expansion for similar points. It's exactly what Caffarelli do. So, locally, sigma is contained in M as in one manifold. Okay, the analysis of the similar set is something which is pretty open. In this talk, I will not talk about all the lower start, but you can get sure that at least by this result, they are small. So, they are packed inside co-dimensional, at least two things. And since the free boundary, if it is a boundary, it should be dimensional n minus one, at least they're a bit exceptional. But what is bothering me is this. But what is bothering me is this C minus minus one, which can be large. In today's talk, I will try to explain how this C minus minus one is itself as a nice structure. So it can be split in a regular part and in a singular part, which is small, drops a dimension. And it has a regular part, which is nicely packed into a smooth manifold. This is the end point. Now I will make examples that I make things a bit more clear. I hope make things a bit more clear. If there are questions, please do interrupt me, even if I run a bit. So, okay. Examples. These are simple plots. It's completely analytic. So you have a nice round free boundary. And you can think about lifting the boundary data. Okay, if you lift it, then the context will shrink and a circle will eventually become a point. This point will become a singular. All those points. Becomes singular. All those points, according to our fanal classification, are regular, but in the limit, you get a singular point. So, this is how they arise. Another example is, I mean, the chomogeneous, of course, blow-ups, the bigger pictures. Let me just point out that in this case, that line is entirely made of regular points. But with our definitions, the very same line, if you take not the positive part, but simply x squared, is made of singular points of dimension n minus one. So, this is the first. So, this is the first. This is the thing that is a bit fake about the sigma minus one, that we have many of them here, but they're very nicely arranged and they don't look similar at all. Of course, you can make these pictures bend. Okay, so if you take a perturbation of x and you square it on the positive part, you get this curve. And of course, in this case, f will not be exactly one, but I told you that we don't, whichever theorem we were hoping to prove, we want it to be stable with reflection. Europe into probe, we want it to be stable with reflected perturbations. So we must deal with this. And so keep in mind the picture on the left, because it's important. Okay. Why in this statement, I told you we can cover this set. You might get suspicious and say, we might want to prove that actually we are a manifold. Again, if we live in this infinity world, there's no hope. World, there's no hope if you pick xm squared and you add a small sinfinity perturbation which is non-negative and has a situation which is smaller. Then I have to be a bit fast, but you can check that all these sets are empty and that the only context n is exactly the intersection of the level set of h equals zero and xn equals zero. h is a function of the other variables. Now, a single function can vanish wherever it wants in any closed prescribed set. Close the prescribed set. So basically, you get a picture like this: right, you get a nice hyperplane inside of which everything is happening, so the theorem is true. But inside of that, you can always generate whichever madness you want. So this is why there is no escape, and we will cover stuff and not prove that the signal set is itself manifold. Okay. Okay, this is another example. I simply add two guys, right? I add two guys with different curvatures, perhaps. With different curvatures, perhaps, and then I can make this transcollide into a new singular point, which is there. Okay. This is another key example. And the singular point that arrives in the touching point over there is again this top stratum. But in some sense, I would say it's more genuine, let's say, because things really do break after. Okay, so here are our Here are our three examples. What I claim is that I want to give a statement to separate these two situations and break the state as sigma minus one into a regular piece where more or less this is happening and another residual part where this is happening, but at least is happening in a co-dimensional true cell. And this is true. Not prove it, but I will show you. Okay. So the Okay, so the before going on, let me just mention that how I construct this plot. So basically, I took x plus an analytic function and I squared it. It's very simple to generate these examples. And then I can add a s infinity perturbation to get any arbitrary closed set inside, but this is how you generate it. Well, here I had to tweak these non-linear positive parts and make them polite, it's a bit more complicated. So the information we're looking for to discriminate is which is this. To discriminate these two situations is to be found in an announcement of Cafaradi's theorem. Basically, you want to try to do a third-order blow-up and try to see what happens. So, you take u, you subtract the first-order blow-up, you scale correctly the thing, and you divide by epsilon cube, and you hope to get something. And here, somehow it might be the same, it will be the same game because this is something you will have a sort of. Something, you will have a sort of a dichotomy, either if something bad or something good. And what I claim is that if here I get a polynomial which is homogeneous and vanished on this x equal to zero, then I can rearrange this expression simply in this way, just a rewriting. But this becomes a polynomial, and I'm recovering, I'm seeing this structure I was telling you about one-half function squared as eigen terms. So Let's see what I can say. This is what is happening. And so, in this case, here, it's a simple manipulation to see that if you expand u, you indeed have a third-order second order and then a third-order expansion, which is a polynomial. This is the simple computation I just did. But what is more interesting is that for the two-tangent fronts, this is exactly what is failing. This blow-up, this third blow-up, is not a polynomial, but it's something different. Something different. What is that then? So, this is the formula, and you can do the computation, or you can plot it, which is even better. So, you take u order, you subtract the p2, which is the one half x squared, and then you zoom in and divide by a factor r and divide by our cube, and end up with this real profile here. Okay, this real profile cannot be a polynomial because it has an angle. And basically, what we will see now. Basically, what I'm uh we will see now is that, okay, this q, of course, has an odd part, which you can compute as a polynomial, and an even part, which is responsible for this angle, which is at modulus of x in the second formula there. And in front of you, this is k1 plus k2, which were the two curvatures of the front. So, basically, if the two curvatures are not the same, are not matching, you will see an angle here. This is the thing. And so, we are onto something. Basically, this is what was proved by Ephraim. Basically, this is what was proved by Val and Serie 19. Is this first step from this third-order analysis? Because they found that they were able to carry out this computation in general to show that u minus p2, at least if you're sitting in this top stratum, has a blower. So you see, you call this function wr, you rescale it by its own size, and it reconverts to something which they were able to say what it is. What is q? Turns out that it is an homogeneous solution of the thin out. Of the thin obstacle problem, which is another pre-boundary problem, which is basically the obstacle problem when you let the lower barrier to be just a blade, okay, a very, very, very sharp blade. So you minimize the declare energy, but the constraint that you are non-negative on a co-dimensional one space. Of course, you can prescribe this because, by capacitory reason, you have a trace on a co-dimensional one space, so you can minimize it. So, the point is that. So, the point is that not homogeneous solutions of the thin obstacle, whichever lambda is, are polynomials. But, okay, so before going on, let me make sure that I made myself clear. So, what I'm claiming is that it was shown that you can perform this blow up. Accordingly to whether this Q is of a certain is a polynomial solution or a non-polynomial solution, you are essentially seeing the. You are essentially seeing the difference between these two setups. And if it is a polynomial solution, you can correct the polynomial expansion and be here and construct exactly the solution as it was constructing there. Otherwise, you are here, but you see it. You see it because you have the curvatures, which are different. Okay, so now I'll give you a precise theorem, at least one. So this is the theorem we prove that elaborating the techniques which are blocked. The techniques which are blocked at order three or four, let's say, technically, but they're very robust. So at the end of the day, one can make them work for the order. And so we prove that there is a sigma infinity in sigma, which first of all consists of the n minus one dimensional part. So it's very large. So the difference has dimension n minus two. And at those points, I do have an expansion of every order. Okay? Okay, but I have an expansion of a very peculiar kind. This expansion is with a polynomial, which is a perfect square of an alternation of an analytic function. We don't get analytic, we get CK. So it's a polynomial square. And it's consistent. So PK plus one is the concrete of PK. And of course, by the Whitney statement I was telling you about before, you can turn this into a geometrical statement, which is uncommon. A geometric statement which is uncovered by a C infinity upper surface, if you want, but this doesn't look so amazing because, okay, you're not a C1 surface, you're a C infinity, but maybe I think it from the point of view of the polynomials is more complex. Anyway, let me just, in the last five minutes, give you an idea about how the proof goes. But okay, just a thing: if you want to pack everything in one sentence, you can see that the whole free boundary has a Free boundary as an N-manuel dimensional regular part and a part of four-dimensional most true, which is singular. And we know what happens at singular points. At singular points, we see a blow-up, which is a truly genuine solution of the thin obstacle problem, which is not just a normal. Okay, so concerning you with the proof, let me tell you a couple of things. So basically, you study the diff there are a first part of which you study a bit a priori the difference between a solution and a polynomial answer. Between a solution and a polynomial answer. A polynomial answer is exactly the most general truncated solution that arises if you prescribed in the Koshito-Walesky problem the first k terms in the expansion of the free boundary. So you give a free boundary up to order k, which is analytic. You construct this polynomial Anzats. You notice that it has a certain non-negativity properties. So you have to do a bit of work. And you parameterize it in the most general way. Okay, so it depends. General way, okay, so it depends on a number of polynomials. Then you study the difference, and basically, one has a sort of compactness estimate. So, for example, the w option w is negative, the gradient is controlled with a reminder, which is of order k plus two. So, if you want to go from k to k plus one, an error of k plus two is good. And then finally, you generalize the crucial observation of Ganymede Seller, which was that the difference between you and the blow-up. And the blow-up has a powerful monotonicity formula, which is the ambulance frequency function. This is a tool that comes from minimal surfaces, and it's quite powerful, but okay, and it was already noticed by Caffarelli again and others that in the thin obstacle problem you could use it, but here in the obstacle problem it was a breakthrough. And you have to generalize it to order k, but it is more or less like that. This is a truncated version because the Because the standard frequency wouldn't have these guys, but here, since we have errors around, it's useful to know that there are modifications which are rather neat that have the same monotonicity properties or algebraic properties. So, once you have a bit this toolbox concerning the general solution minus an answer, you can try to go inductively and say, okay, let's assume that up to order k, things were good. I can prove a general blow-up, which is again the same thing that more. Which is again the same thing that Morales that Caffarelli did. He proved a blow-up, he did a blow-up procedure, but here you do it from order K, so you minus PK divided by its own size. It's a bit complicated, but that's what it means. And then in the end, you get a Q. And you run a dichotomy. Either the Q was of a particular kind, so a homogeneous polynomial, either it is not. In the first case, it can be reabsorbed on the left-hand side as an answer of the next. The left-hand side as an answer of the next order where you feed the last argument to the Q itself, and this essentially means that you were in the next order, so you can go on your expansion. Otherwise, it doesn't matter. Otherwise, it doesn't matter. So you are in the different set, your expansion is broken, but essentially fixed order. And here, I mean, here one has to go a bit in the... So you have a true solution of this thin obstacle, which has an angle. This is an important thing. So if you plot it, So, if you plot it, you have a truly singular Laplacian. And now, there is a lot of properties of the thin obstacle. It's known, there are many things known. So, you can run a dimensional reduction and take care of every case. Let me just give you a model for why these points cannot pack together too much. So, I show you that you got the angle when you made the two fronts with different curvatures collide. Okay, here you got. Okay, here you got a blow-up which looks like this. Well, basically, if you want to create many points of this type, you have to allow these two different curvatures. So, you can, if you put, if you want to put another point very, very close, you have a limit because you have to create some space. So, okay, you can create a sequence, but you cannot create an higher dimensional set because it's like you reach an open condition. It's an open condition, so of course, I mean, it's very odd for the but but this uh was initiated by the Fialis Arga and the arguments here carry on smoothly to be to be fair also to the K case. It's a bit less complicated. And I think I'll stop here because it's Thank you very much. Number of questions. First of all, I'm a bit ignorant about these particularities, but suppose you replace the location by some similar operator. How much does it just work? Okay, so to be honest, I'm pretty irritated. But this has been a child for sure because I know Chavi Ross was working on this. But to be honest, I don't know. The short answer. I don't know. The short answer is I don't know. What I think is true is that this is still the regular set is stable. But maybe. This is, I think, are available. Yeah, many things are. Yeah, I mean, in some sense, monotonic formulas play a huge role in all these results. What is the Figalita result? The previous monotony. Galicia result, the previous monomonotonicity and the bise monotonicity, I mean, if not directly, are also there. So, yeah, but they are robust. I mean, they can be other errors can be added to this formula. And maybe Charlie Fernandez can call out my lies. Yeah, right, sure. No, this is important, right? This is the work of. No, this is important, right? This is important, right? Savin and Huiu were able essentially to retail these results with viscosity methods, with an improvement of convexity methods. And this generalized to fully non-linear operators, but local. That's later. Okay. They avoid the use of this monotony C formulas. Thank you.
