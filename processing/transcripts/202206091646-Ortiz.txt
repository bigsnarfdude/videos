Speak here in person after two years attending conference online. This is joint work with my PhD student Fabrizio Valencia from the University of Sao Paulo. And so let me motivate a problem that we want to address here. So in classical theory, out of a manifold with a function, Out of a manifold with a function whose critical points are on the generator, you can extract topological and geometric information of the manifold. For instance, you can understand the topologies of the sub-critical levels, and out of this you can understand the topology of the manifold. So there is also a complex, the Morse complex, who's that recovers the homology of the manifold. The homology of the manifold. But in general, when a manifold comes with symmetries, classical Morse theory is not the right setting to apply in that situation. And the right setting to work with equivalent Morse theory is something called Moore's Plot theory. And you can also, so in the case of Moore's plot theory, you have a manifold Uh not with uh critical isolated critical points, but you have uh critical sub-manifolds on the generated critical sub-manifolds. And out of this data you can again extract information of the manifold and also you can apply this tool to understand problems in other uh areas of of geometry. Of geometry. So, for instance, you can apply Morse plot theory to understand moment maps, or you can apply Morse Plot theory to show the convexity results in symplectic geometry. So, in this talk, I want to understand a manifold with a function, have a function which is manifold m. Of this manifold M. This manifold comes with non-degenerate critical sub-manifolds, but these non-degenerate critical sub-manifolds are orbits of a group wave of this critical sub-manifolds. These are orbits of a lead group orbit with base n. M and we would like to understand how you can how you can understand more sphere in this setting. So I'm going to explain the main ingredients, the main basic definitions of Morse theory only group points. And hopefully if I have time I want to show some applications of this. Some applications of this. So I want to tell you the main ingredients of Morse groupoid complex. And out of this complex, we will see that one can recover the groupoid termology, meaning the Meaning, Paul Schulman knowledge of the group point. And then I will study symmetries on group points, and I will try to show you how you can understand equivariant homology of Hamiltonian zero. Zero syntactic group weights. Okay? So at this point I should say something. So the idea of studying Morse theory on the group points is an attempt to study Morse theory on differentiable stacks. So this should be think rather as a model for Morse theory. Morse theory on the differentiable stack associated to the group point. And I should say that there is a previous work by Hepworth in which he defines or she studies Moore's theory on differentiable Denny-Mannforce tags. So she's a particular Which is a particular case of what we are going to see today. Right? So let me start by saying which kind of functions on a group width we are going to study. So I'm going to fix a group point G over M and we will look at real valued functions on G but these real valued functions on G are seen as group point maps to the unit group point determined by R or group point morphism And one can see that this is equivalent to having the following fact. So F has to be given by the pullback of the map dumpsters. And also this coincides with the pullback of F by the source. So this says that this function f is basic. So So this means that f is a smooth function in n, which is invariant by the action of the group point. And you can see now these basic functions as a zero degree cohomology of G. And we know that this cohomology is merit invariant. Invariant. So the way we should think of these functions is as functions on the differentiable stacks associated to G. Alright, so this is the type of functions that I want to understand. Can I just choose a lead group or the group point? Very general talk. Yes. Alright, some let me mention some examples. Of course, when this group width is the unit group with a manifold, you just recover the usual notion of. Just recover the usual notion of a smooth map on a manifold. If this group void is an action groupoid, then this data coincides with G invariant functions. Suppose now that this guy is a submersion group boy, so then you are dealing with functions which are constant along the fibers of that submersion. And so this thing recovers what we So this thing recovers what we expect to recover and uh a remark that if G is proper proper, then you can always find such a map by the averaging process. Always. So, any on any group we have such a map. Alright, so another remark that I want to mention now is if you take an arrow G from X to Y and suppose that this element G is a critical point of F. So we are going to say, in that case, we are going to speak of critical arrows. Suppose that this guy is a critical arrow of F, and we immediately observe that You observe that the source and target of this arrow are critical points of the map downstairs. And actually, if you collect critical arrows, you will see that you have a subgroupoid formed by critical points. So the set of critical points of pass. The set of critical points of F is actually a cohort of all the critical points at the level of objects. Right, so that's the first observation. Do you have any question? Sorry? Sorry? Is this an if and only? It is an if and only if because uh because f is given by this pullback and these guys are subjective submissions. Okay. In particular that's the first observation. That's the first observation. The second one is that critical points at the level of objects come in families. The whole orbit of this guy is the critical sub-manifold. And actually, if you restrict now the group point G to the orbit, the restriction to the orbit is a critical submanifold of F so Though more precisely, the restriction to the orbit is a critical subgroup of G. Okay, so this is more or less the structure of critical points. And now I want to make sense of what is a non-degenerate critical subgroup. So for that, let me remember the definition. So we are going to say that a sub-manifold S in M is non-degenerate critical sub-manifold critical sub-manifold of Critical submanifold of F. If, of course, S is contained in the set of critical points of F and for every point in S, tungsten space to S at this point coincides with the kernel of the hash and Of the hash of f at the point S. So this allows you to define now a quadratic form on the normal bundle of S such that one has a quadratic form. QF, defined on the normal bundle of S with values of R given by the normal Hessian. Then you are picking a metric or something like that to define it? Uh no I need a metric for that. And this condition automatically implies that you can restrict the Hessian to the normal bundle, and then you look at the quadratic form associated to that thing by the wise. So now let me introduce some terminology. So definition, we're going to say that a critical arrow of f let's say that this critical arrow goes from x to y. We're going to say that this is a non-degenerate critical arrow. This is a non-degenerate critical error if the orbit of x in M is a non-degenerate critical submanifold. And this is the only thing that's going to be a very good thing. In this sense. So, this automatically implies that the restriction to the orbit is also a non-degenerate critical submanifold of F. And we can talk about now of non-degenerate critical subgroups. So we are going to say that F is a Morse group morphism. Morse groupoid morphism if every critical error was non-degenerate. Okay. All right, so that's the main definition. Alright, so that's the main definition. Let me mention some examples. That gives me more or less and it's a horse function on the link space. Yes, exactly. More functional space, yes. Every proper group that makes such a more point. Yeah, I'm gonna discuss now about the existence of such a thing. So examples and systems Suppose that we have a group, a D group, compact D group K at another manifold, then the action group points, the action group point associated to this data always admits a Morse group with Morse resident. So this follows from a result of Blashermann, which says that if you look at the space of all k-invariant functions in M, k invariant functions in m and the space of those inverted functions which are Morse stands in here. So you can always find this kind of object and in terms of group width means that you always have a Morse function in here. On G is proper and tau then or scruple morphisms always exist. And answering Rui's question, we believe if we remove this etal condition and you just look at proper group points, you can always find a group point, more screw point maps. But the idea here is that locally you have this picture and you show that And you show that this Morris group away morphisms forms a dense subspace between the space of gene-invariant functions, which are Morse is dense in the space of all gene invariant functions on the negative. G-in-variant functions on the manifold. I would like to say that this is true on any property group point, but the proof that we did need some. Sorry, I don't quite understand this plasma result. Do you mean more spot or with isolated critical sub-manifolds, yes? Critical sub-manifolds, yes. More spot. Orbits, yes, or yes, sorry. It's it's given by the action of orbits. In the sense of this definition. In the sense of that definition. Definition is also inherited to the volume trips too. I will say that in a minute. Thanks. There's a question? You're saying that for proper improvement? Uh you I'm not sure about the group, but you don't have Sure about the truth, but you don't have any calculus on that. So we believe that it's true or not. We believe it's true. Yes. Alright, so the third example is that this notion is morally invariant. Suppose that we have two groups of the majority of the m Have two group weights together with the Morritian variance between them. Sorry, Morrit equivalents. So we know that this induces an isomorphism between the homology for all the group weights. But these guys are precisely basic functions on m, on m prime. And the way you map a function here, defined on here, to a function defined on here by this isomorphism is compatible with the Morse condition. So this isomorphism preserves, preserves. Morse functions, Morse conditions. So, in particular, if one of these groupoids has a Morse groupoid morphism, so does the other. Good. So, let me tell you another example of Another example of such a thing, and this comes from the notion of Hamiltonian actions on zeros inflected group points. This notion appeared in a paper by Hoffman. By Hoffman and Shamar. And let me mention the main ingredients of those Hamiltonian spaces. So the data is this. We start with a group with G, which is 40. Which is a foliation groupoid. And this groupoid comes with a pair of two forms. We have a form omega on G, a form omega zero on the space of objects satisfying the following conditions. So omega zero and And it's closed, it's a presymplectiform, meaning that it is closed and has constant rank. But you control the kernel of this form. So this kernel is given by the image of the anger of the group. And the second condition is that omega is a basic two-fourth. Omega is given by the pullback of omega zero by the target, but also by the pullback of omega zero by the source band. So that is zero sympathic group work. And now we are going to study actions on these guys. Now we are going to consider a V2 group. So we also require that this is a foliation two group. And this guy comes with an action on this person on this zip variation group point. This zip variation group point. And this action satisfies the following conditions. So we are going to assume that K0 preserves omega 0, recent background. And I will write a moment of transition. Write a moment map condition and then I will tell you what this means. So there is also a moment map from gene, from the group point to the following. So let me write this down. K0, eight, dual, zero, eight, dual. So here Dual. So here, this d2 group has an associated d2 algebra, which I denote by k1 over k0. And any d2 algebra can be described in terms of a cross-module of the algebras. So that's a cross-module. You are in the strict case. Sorry? In the strict case, yes. Unstrict case, yes. So this is a strict two group. Okay, so this is the cross module. So this is the H and K0 that appear in here. And since we are in the foliation case, one can see that actually this D2 algebra is equivalent to a D algebra, seen as a D2 algebra. It's equivalent to this one. It's equivalent to this one. So now you look at such this kind of maps, mu1, mu0, and the lead2 group acts on its lead2 algebra by the adjoint representation. And you can see now that this adjoint representation passes to induces an action on this V algebra, and you can dualize this action, and the dual action. And the dual action will be called the co-adjoint action of this foliation group on this dual V algebra. So we have this moment map, and we require that this is a group with morphism satisfying the moment map condition. actually equivariant group of morphism with respect to the action of this V2 group and it satisfies moment-map condition. So for every psi I mean this V algebra We have this property where here, yeah, I mean, I have to explain something. So this guy, which lives in here, always induces a basic vector field on the group. A basic vector field on the group, on this foliation group way, and this basic vector field is this one that appears here, which is the fundamental vector field associated to the action. And we require this moment condition. Okay, so that is a Hamiltonian action on a zero-symplectic groupoid. And the point now is that if you assume some extra condition that... Some extra condition that appeared in a paper by Lynn and Jamar. So if the action of k0 on m something called clean, then the psi component of the moment map psi component of the moment Side component at the moment is most bot okay small spot and because this mu zero is is in du uh comes comes with uh together with mu one, you can see that actually this That actually this new zero side here is also gene invariant. In particular, this guy determines a more scrupulous morphism. Okay, all right, so these are the examples that I wanted to discuss with you. So let me quickly mention some results that we managed to prove with Calvizio. So, the first thing is that so now start with the group point equipped with With uh Morse group with morphism. And uh we are going to assume that this group width has a two metric. We have a two metric so two metric in the sense of materials and And Rui. So this two metric is a metric on the space of composable arrows of G. So this automatically induce a metric on the space of arrows, making the multiplication and projections Riemannian submersions. And then this one metric goes down to a zero metric on displays of objects, making source and target Riemannian submersions as well. And target reminding submergence as well. So that's the main property that I want to use of a two-metric. And the proposition is that if you look at the gradient vector field of F and the gradient vector field of F downstairs with respect to the metric induced on G and with respect to the metric The metric induced in G and with respect to the metric induced in M is a multiplicative vector field. Right? So I think I will skip the details of what I wanted to say, but as in usual Morse theory, you use the flows of the gradient vector field to understand the sub-level sets. So if you look at those So if you look at those results and now you put the group point on them, you will see that all the proofs carry over because this guy is a multiplicative vector field. So let me state another proposition, which is this. So suppose that we have Suppose that we have O inside M. We have a critical orbit. So I'm assuming that we're always in the case with this guy, so Morse group with Morphist. So critical orbit. Then at this orbit, you can look at the restriction of G to this orbit. Friction of G to this orbit, and you can always find a group of tubular neighborhood around the orbit u tilde, which is a group point, group point two plural neighborhood. So here we have O seen as the zero section of the normal bundle, G O seen as the zero section. Seen as the zero section of the normal bundle. We can find here also neighborhoods of the zero section, V and tilde, together with a group with isomorphism preserving the zero section in such a way that phi. phi pullback F is equal to a constant plus quadratic form induced by the Hessian. And you can see that in this case this quadratic form QF goes from the normal bundle of GO to R and QF goes to the normal bundle of the original. goes to the normal of the orbit. To R is actually a group with math. So this is our version of the Morse lemma in this setting. Does this use that G is proper or not? Yes, uh well you can assume that G is proper. Yeah. Yeah. G is proper. U? You you only use that it has a multipublic thing? Or it just works? I mean, no, it it used that it has a two metric. That's enough for this purpose, it's in the problem. Yes. It's actually a bit weaker, no? Because uh what it uses is this property that multiplication of the geodesic by two. Like two tangent factors that you can multiply and take your geodesics, then the product of the geodesics is the geodesics that the exponential map is probably working from the normal to the yeah, I mean from this neighborhood. Yeah, I mean from these neighborhoods to those ones. Yeah, but then it's just that from this is not just exponential, but you can use it here. No, no, no. I mean you have to use the group with exponential, but you have to make this compatible with the with the property. Exactly. Alright, so I think I don't have I think I don't have time, but let me tell you a few words of how one can use this machinery to recover the bot-schuman harmony of a group. So I think I will explain first what is the Morse bot complex. This is, this was done. I'm using a result by Austin and Brown. And we are going to start with the MorseBot function and an info, MorseBot. And we are going to group together Group together all the critical sub-manifolds of F with index I. Okay? So Austin and Brown, they define following. So you can look at forms, J forms on this Forms on this dies, and these forms come with some maps. So there are some maps here. So I'm going to tell you in a minute how do you define those maps? Define those maps? So here you look at the following set, following thing, which is the unstable manifold of Pi intersection with the stable manifold of PJ. Of course Manifold of PJ. Of course, for this to make sense, we need some transversality assumptions. We are going to assume that both manifolds intersect transversally. And on this guy, there is an action by R, just translating the time on each integral curve. And the quotient, the quotient of this intersection by this Intersection by this action of R is actually a manifold, and this guy comes with two projections to Bj and to Bi, which takes a guy here and you send it to its limit to minus infinity. So this stands here, and the same here with the limit to plus infinity. And it can be shown that this. It can be shown that these two maps are locally trivial vibrations. So then this map here, which takes a J form on VI, is just given by pulling back by these locally trivial subversions and then do integrate all the fibers. So that's this map. And what Austin and Brown show is that Show is that if you define now CPF as the sum of those things, and delta is the sum of the delta R, then this defines a co-chain complex co-chain complex. Whose cohomology is isomorphic to the round cohomology of the manifold. Okay? So uh take five minutes really. So now the idea is that one can apply this result by Austin and Brown, this construction by Austin and Brown, to the group weight setting. So let me tell you what picture. I suppose that we have a more simple We have a more smooth morphism. So here there are some conditions that we have to assume to guarantee that the flow is defined for every time. So usually one requires compactness. So I'm not sure if requiring compactness of a group way is a very restrictive condition. Condition, but it's the way we did it. But so what's the idea here? You start with a group point. I'm gonna use the simplicial notation for a group point. I have here a map. Like this, which is a Morse group polymorphism. Now, you can apply the nerve functor to this, and you will end up with a bunch of real valid maps on the nerve. All of them will be Morse, because this one is Morse, and this condition. And this condition goes up to the nerve. And in particular, you can apply now the Austin and Brown construction at every level of the nerve. So I think I will summarize, but if you want to see the details, I can explain that afterwards. Now you apply Austin and Brown. And brown to each level of the nerve. So we are going to have this picture for each of these maps. And so we are going to have something like this complexes given by Austin and Braun, but each of these points here are forms on a group point. Are forms on a group point. So you are going to have also rows here, and so here you have the differential by Austin and Braun, and you have another differential here, which is the simplicial differential coming from the group point. And you can see that actually this construction is a double complex, which comes with a natural map from the Got-Schulman complex. From the Botschulman complex of the group weight. And this map, this natural map from the Hotschulman complex to this double complex induces an isomorphism in cohomology. So that's why that's how you uh recover the control metal model in terms of most data. terms of most data. So to finish, you can also consider now here for instance a group, K acting by group with automorphisms and preserving this function. And you can make this story compatible with this action. And what you recover here is on this side, what you recover is the When you recover, is the equivariant cohomology of a group boy by the action of a group. So, this was something defined by Alejandro Marabosa and Frank Neumann. But you can also consider more general symmetries. So, instead of a group, you consider an action of a two-group. You can also make this story compatible with the action of a two-group. And in particular, you can compare. And in particular, you can compute the equivalent cohomology of a group weight by the action of a two group in terms of Morse theoretical information. And in a preprint that hopefully will appear next week or something, we use these ideas to compute the tomology of Hamiltonian syntactic zero groups. So I think. So I think I will stop here, so thank you very much. Oh, questions? Thank you for a very nice job. Um can you explain the problem with the existence of the copper rubles? What what's the issue? The issue is that the issue is that at some point we used that, in the proof of the proper metal thing, we used that the isotropy groups are finite. And out of that, we can see that some space of functions is paired. It has a bird property. So that? It's a pair space. So you need to look at So you need to look at the intersection of open and dense subsets, and you need to show that that guy is dense. So that's how you write down Morse functions. That's the intersection of open and dense subset, and then you want to show that that guy is dense. And in that procedure, we use that the isotropy groups are finite. But yeah, but the problem. But probably that assumption can be removed and we can try to adapt the proof to the proper setting for proper reports. If they were countable, I know that they need to be compact. Because we only can take a damn subset of the group. I mean, I wonder, I mean, there is Mars theory for small stratified spaces and there is existence of Mark functions for not all stratifications, but you probably know this better than me. For some anomaly points or something. So I think the the the art space of a proper tarpaulin has such a nice stratification that we should be able to use most functions. Most functions there. There are most functions here. I mean, we try, I mean, in a very, very good case in which the orbit space is smooth, there is a result by Ostuma, Flamman Tang, which says that this orbit space comes always with a triangulation. And out of a triangulation, you can construct Morse functions, but you need that the orbit space has to be small. That the orbit space has to be smooth. And we didn't look at this stratification perspective, but I think we construct this Morse functions on proper rootworks. Just one question. So, you mentioned a proper Italian workbook case. Yes. So yeah, Do you have an example? Nice modular space, maybe? You mean art for art teams tags? Don't know. So here you are always considering functions on H0 of the global On H0 of what you call thermal. Yes. What happens if you pick a multiplicative function? Yeah, the problem is that if you pick up a multiplicative function, then the gradient with respect to a two-metric is not multiplicative. And we're not able to use. It would be nice to find a notion of a metric in such a way that the gradient of those morphisms. The gradient of those morphisms is multiplicative, but yeah, because it seems to me that you are able to do the pseudo-shift that's complex because you are just putting in the functions of the zero homology because I have homology comes with the human beings. You also don't have that many multiplicative colours. Yeah, um what what assumptions do you have on G for that last theorem about isomorphism and chromology? Yeah, uh uh strong assumption. Yeah, you need to assume that the base is compact to run this machinery of Austin and Bra, because you need the gradient vector field to be complete. Then For that, for instance, if this group would be proper, then you can promote those conditions to the whole nerve. So you need properness and there's some completeness of the objective. Exactly. Because in order to to talk about these manifolds, you need the the integral curves, gradient integral curves have to be defined for for every time. For every time. And it's not enough to assume just like the orbit space is compact. Orbit space is compact. Because the flow should. If the group is proper, the group combines in the street. But in street one, right? Yeah. Not in the flow zero.
