In this talk, I have to apologize, there's no much physics, there is no geometry, but there will be plenty of quantum toilet algebra, so hopefully that will compensate a bit. So this is a work with Misha Bernstein and Juni Shirashi that is still in progress, as you will see. I have to say that most of the ideas that are related to cluster algebra in these talks are due. Cluster algebra in these talks are due to Michael. No, unfortunately, he couldn't come, so you'll have to do with me today. So, if I say something that seems incorrect, please interrupt me and interrupt me anytime if you have questions. Just don't tell anything to Michelle. So, let me start by giving you a few motivations for this. So, as you probably all know, in 2009, Aldai Gayoto and Tachikawa proposed a correspondence between a class Correspondence between a class of supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions and these two-dimensional conformal field theories. This is known as the AGT correspondence, so a special type of BPS-CFT correspondence. Now, mathematically, this correspondence implies a relations between three field representations of a quantum group, so in this case, the affine Jungian of GL1, and Wn algebra. And W n algebras that have an extra free field. So this was shown by Schiffmann and Eric Vassiro some time ago. Now in this talk, I will mostly focus on the trigonometric deformation, this Q AGT correspondence, because it's a bit easier to study from a representation theory point of view. And also because we know less about Q-deformed W algebra, so this is our chance to learn more about. Is our chance to learn more about them? So, in this case, you have a relation between a free-field representation of the quantum toeidal GL1 algebra at level n, 0, so with n bosons, and Q-deformed WN algebras with also this extra phi field. So, I kind of insist on this extra free field because it's really important if you want to build a co-product structure. And this puzzled people for a bit after the introduction of QD form. After the introduction of QD form W algebras. So, what's the point of all this? Well, the representation theory of quantum groups is somewhat easier than W algebras or better developed. And this can be exploited to better understand them. So, one of the examples is the work of Awata-san and Keno-san using a corner vertex operator algebras and quantum toiletal GL1 to build this W. These W algebras. So, so far, most of the discussion on this correspondence has been done for principal W algebras of type A, B, C, D. If you include the commodular construction of Fagin, Jimbo, Mukin, and Vilkovsky. And also the supersymmetric cases as well. But the case of The case of non-principal W algebras has not been discussed much. So these are associated to a different choice of embedding of SL2 in SLN, our choice of nilpotent. So in this talk, I will restrict myself to type A. Already there's a lot of things to say. And in this case, the embedding are labeled by Young diagrams. So these W algebras can be obtained by this. W algebras can be obtained by this quantum Hamiltonian reduction, starting from a cat's Buddhi algebra, and you associate some kind of Young diagram like this, and all the way down to the W n algebra. I should probably keep the same number of boxes. And in between here, you have a world zoo of W algebras that are labeled by different Young diagrams. So, in the Q D form case, this has been a bit less studied. There are papers of Sebastianov that claim to have this quantum Hamiltonian reduction starting from quantum affine SLN algebra, but this is not very explicit, it's very formal, so I'm not quite sure of the status of this at the moment. But it's expected to work in the same way. So, the question I'd ask to ask. So the question I'd like to ask today is, what is the relations between these non-principal W algebras and quantum groups? If you want, I can send you my slides. You don't have to take photos. No worries. All right. So with this project, we are going to answer this question for the trivial embedding, so just the first line of this diagram. First line of this diagram here. So the remaining here is still a bit of a mystery. We're just starting to think about this, but I will have nothing to say about this. So in this case, this is a relation between the free field representation or wacky-motor representation of quantum affine SLN and a toroidal quantum group representation. So in this LGT spirit. GT spirit. Now, for this purpose, we need to consider deformation of quantum toroidal SLN, which we will call the surface defect algebra. The name might change, actually. Misha is not so happy about this name, and I understand why. So, well, maybe we'll change the name later, but for this talk, it will be called surface defect algebra. So, why do we call it surface defect algebra? So, this is where the talk that we This is where the work that we did with Sebiok is relevant. Some work that we did back in 2019. So this is the physics part of the talk. That won't be too long. So I apologize for the mathematicians here. So in this paper, we studied instanton partition functions of phi dn equal 1 gauge theory on this particular space-time that is given by an orbifold. So you quotient by the action of this discrete group Zn. Action of this discrete group Zn that is given here, and this action depends on two integer parameters, ν1 and ν2. So, this context led us to introduce new class of quantum tooidal algebras that play the same role as quantum athoidal GL1 when you don't have any R before. So, Duncan was present. Yeah, Duncan was presenting this untwisted BCD type quantum toroidal algebra, they would presumably be obtained by considering OBFold, but for other discrete groups here. So there are two particularly interesting cases. The first one is when these two group elements are inverse of each other, so this nu1, nu2 are 1 minus 1. Are one minus one, and this corresponds to ALE instant tons. They are associated to the undeformed quantum toilet and sell an algebra. And this was studied by Ahuetas and Keno, Jäger as well, and other people, a bit before our work. And this was actually a very big inspiration for our work. Now, the case we are interested in today is this case where ν2 is 0 and ν is 1. So in this case, one of the complex plane Of the complex plane remains invariant, and that corresponds to the introduction of this surface defect that will be associated to the spatial deformation of quantum toroidal SLN. So that's why we call it surface defect algebra. All right, so that's the algebra that we need in order to obtain this Waikimoto representation. So a little more about this work. So in this work, we actually About this work. So, in this work, we actually reuse this algebra to generalize the construction of Aywata, Fagin, and Shiraishi of vertex operators and sort of conformal blocks for topological string amplitudes or 5D Necrosov functions. So, in this way, we obtain an algebraic construction of Necrosov partition functions and QQ character in presence of this surface defect. And this turns out to be something that is quite important, in particular in the context of the In particular, in the context of the beta gauge correspondence, because this surface defect is used to build wave functions and the corresponding QQ character to derive the Hamiltonian of the integrable system. So this appears in papers of Necrosoft and Sebiok and Norton Lee, in particular the paper of Norton Lee last year on Q-Toda in the Qdeform context. That's also relevant for the study of QPANOVA equations. Of Kupanova equations and the non-stationary Reichnar functions. So, fortunately, Jägor presented this yesterday, so I don't have to talk about it. So, roughly speaking, it's some kind of affinization of McDonald's symmetric functions. So, actually, to address this paper, I believe we would have to consider the surface defect version of Konostan elliptic quantum toroidal algebra. So, that would be something, I think, very interesting to do. Very interesting to do, but all this is a different story. I'm not going to talk about this today. Let's focus on the connection with W algebras. So that's all for the physics today. Now we'll be back to representation theory. Is there any questions on the motivations? So that's the plan of the talk. So unfortunately, in this particular So unfortunately in this particular case of Wakimoto, the correspondence is a little confusing because you have a quantum group on both sides. So I'm still going to refer to W algebra side and quantum group side for this to try to avoid a bit of confusion. And I'll start here with the finite case that is better understood. So in this case, on the W algebra side, you will have a finite quantum. You will have a finite quantum group, so UQ of SLN, and on the quantum group side, you will have the surface defect deformation of quantum affine SLN. Then we will lift everything to the affine case, and now on the W algebra side, you have quantum affine SLN, and on the quantum group side, we will use a quantum surface defect quantum toroidal SLN. So let's uh start with the uh finite case. Start with the finite case. So, as I said on the W algebra side, we have this finite quantum group, UQ of SLN, generated by E, F, and K. So, hopefully, everybody here knows about this quantum group. Otherwise, you're probably in the wrong workshop, I guess. So, here are the relations. Beta is my Carton matrix. Q is the quantum group parameters. This Ki plus minus are the Plus minus are the powers of the carton. And since I'm lazy, I'm not going to write down cell relations, but you can imagine that they are there. So we'll consider a particular type of representation, this Heisenberg representation that was introduced by Ayweta, Asanaumi, and Odake in 93, so quite some time ago. And this is defined using. ago and this is defined using n n minus 1 over two pairs of q oscillators that i will denote x and q to the theta indexed by i and j where i is smaller than j and they obey the usual q commutation relation so when the indices don't match this is just commuting and if they match you have a q commutation with an extra factor q here so that's the explicit form of So that's the explicit form of the representation that they have found. As you can see, it is already quite a bit complicated, and this will get much worse in the affine case. So the first thing that we need to do is to try to simplify this a little bit. And for this, we will use methods that was developed by Schrader and Shapiro that they use for a different type of representation, but this also applies to what we do here. To what we do here. So, the first step is to rewrite all this using this telescopic sum. So, this is my notation. So, this will depend on an argument. And you just take the product, the monomial, then the product of the first two, product of the first three, all the way to all the product. I'm not going to say anything about normal ordering, that's a bit technical, but in short, this will only work if you have a QVIL normal ordering for some obscure. Ordering for some obscure reason. Anyway, so this is the expression of the generators using this telescopic sum, and you introduce these monomials here of x and q to the theta that I will call quantum y variables. So the e and f are written as certain telescopic sum, and the k plus k minus are just product of these y's. Of these y's. So this already looks a little better, but there's still a lot of structure here. And so here comes the idea of Chadeau and Shapiro to encode all the algebraic relations between the y variables and so the EFK generators as well using a quiver. So we'll call this quiver here the Kashikojima quiver. I'll show it in the next slide. Awatasan, do you remember the name Kashikojima? Remember the name Kashikojima? Yes. So that's in reference to the island on which a conference was held and during which they introduced this type of representations. So the idea is that you associate to each node one of these quantum variables. We will distinguish unfrozen and frozen nodes. This will be a bit more clear in the fine case, so I won't explain that much. So the unfrozen will be circled. So the unfrozen will be circled, the frozen note boxed. And then plain arrows encode this commutation relation with q to the power minus 2. Dashed arrow will encode the relation with the power q to the minus 1. And if there is no arrows, the corresponding y variables, they just commute. So just by looking at the Q commutation relation between the Y's, we will be able to draw the quivers. And then in order to build our generator, In order to build our generators, we'll follow a path between frozen arrows, frozen nodes, going in the direction against the arrows. So that's a bit of a convention issue, but so we'll go against the arrows, like from Y0 to Ym. And to this path, we associate a telescopic sum that will be used to build E or F, and the product will be used for the carton here. So let's start with the simplest case of The simplest case of SL2. So SL2, you have four nodes. The horizontal path here corresponds to E generators. This kind of zigzag path going down and up is associated to the F generators. That is SL3, so it starts to be a bit more complicated. Again, the two horizontal paths here are E1 and E2. So E1 will be a sum of two monomials, E2. Of two monomials, E2 will be a sum of four, and then you have certain zigzag paths that correspond to the F generators and the associated cartoon. Last one, SR4, and you start to see a bit of a pattern emerging after that. Now, to draw it in a more beautiful way, I've actually doubled some of the nodes. So, nodes that have Some of the nodes, so nodes that have the same label, like this one and this one, they should be identified, right? So you should glue them now. So that's how we encode this Heisenberg presentation on the W algebra side. Questions now? Yes? Oh, you'll see. So this is. So this looks a bit like a ship, a sailing ship, no? You'll see that if you have an extra, if you go to the higher rank, rank n plus one, so you will have an extra line and this kind of zigzag here between them. So if you avoid the blue nodes and arrow, this is the so-called equivalence. And then you can find some rules for the extra zero nodes here and here. So, yeah, so you. Yeah so the blue stop is in the bottom or top if you want and in the middle you also have these kind of copies of the nodes that so you can actually program all this and ask Python to give you the TKZ code for this and computing all the relations. That's pretty fast. Okay, so that was the W algebra side in the family. So, that was the W algebra side in the finite case. Now, what about the quantum good side? So, as I said, we need to introduce deformation of quantum affine SLN. I will use here the Drinfeld-Jimbo presentation. So, we have these generators with indices from 0 to n, so indexed by the affine Linking diagram. You have the extra affine node omega equals 0 here. Beta is still my Carton matrix. I still don't want to write the Metrics. I still don't want to write the circulations because they are not deformed. And you see that the deformation parameter here enters as a shift of the indices here and there. So I'll be a bit more precise. Soon you can add a Hop algebra structure with this co-product here, again with a bit of deformations. Okay. So a few remarks. So first when C is 0 mod N, you recover the algebraic relations of quantum affine SLN, provided you quotient by these extra relations. We omit this here, but it's a bit technical. Then this algebra can actually be built as a Drinfeld double using a twist by an abelian group that is written here. That is just rotation of this. Rotation of these indices in the cyclic thinking diagram. So, this is why you can see that the relations inside the same Borel algebra are not modified. Like if you look at K plus F or K minus E, there is no shift. But K plus E, so this one happens to have no shift, but this one does, and then all the others. So K plus, K minus no longer commute. Instead, we have this shift, and also this shift in the commutator E F. Yeah, I was a bit sketchy defining the coproduct. You have to define it as a homomorphism between this algebra and this tensor product. It's very much like how it works for shifted quantum groups. So that's just maybe a remark for the expert. And this double construction also is inspired by this shifted quantum group construction. By this shifted quantum group construction. Okay, so here's the main idea for this talk. So we'll start with the representation level C equal 1, and we will take, so no, first we, sorry, we take n minus 1 coproduct, and we evaluate this in this representation of level c equal 1. So I call the level the value of this deformation parameter c. So at the end, we end up with a representation with c equal n. The representation with C equals n, and this is a presentation of undeformed quantum affine SLN algebra, right? Because this is zero mod n. And next, to get to the finite quantum group, we just forget this generator is associated to the affine node. This is the vertical subalgebra, and this will give us a representation of this quantum group. So I'll show how it works in practice. In practice. So, this is my representation of level C qual one. It has n pairs of Q oscillators that are written here. And so they have a slightly different commutation relations. It's more convenient like this. And this is just a Kronecker delta defined modulo N. So everything is cyclic in this indices omega. So this is the expression of the generators. It's maybe not so important. It's maybe not so important here, but it's fairly simple. And then, using the coproduct, so you can take m minus one coproduct if you want, you don't have to take n, and you will end up with a representation that involves n times n qator pairs. And from the coproduct, this telescopic sum structures appear very naturally. Also, the coproduct gives you something that is factorized for the count on. So, next is to look at the relations between these x variables and draw the corresponding quiver. And you end up with these rectangular quivers that is periodic in this horizontal direction here. Yeah, you don't have to. I mean, you can disregard the coloration of the arrows at the at the moment. Uh actually, no, you don't have to. I mean, um I mean, um yeah, so actually the the E generators they are built from the paths that are obtained from following uh blue arrows and the F generators from paths corresponding to the red arrows. The color indicates something else, but turns out that this is true. Okay, um all right, so that's the story in the quantum group side. Quantum group side. Now, the next step is to try to compare these two representations. For this, I will restrict myself to SL3, but this should work for any n. It's not completely written yet, but it should follow the same procedure. So we'll start with this rectangular quiver and I will remove the frozen nodes associated to these generators. Associated to these generators E0, F0, and K0. I've also rotated the diagram by 90 degrees to make things a bit easier to compare. So now my frozen nodes are on the left and right instead of top and bottom. And I've removed these nodes here. And again, you should identify these nodes on the top and bottom. So first let's So first let's compare the the number of Q oscillator pairs. So in the Heisenberg representation of Wetna-san you have n n minus 1 over 2 oscillators. But with this construction of the rectangular representation you have n squared, right, since it's n times m. So you need to somehow eliminate nn plus 1 over 2 q oscillators. And this can be done by using certain monomials that commute Monomials that commute with the other x-variable, so that's what we call Casimir here. So it's a bit technical, and I'm trying to avoid all these technicalities. Also, because we're working at the level of Q oscillators, and maybe you're more familiar to proper representations, so you can represent these Q oscillators on a certain module. And what you will see that since you have too many Q oscillator, this representation will be highly radio. Representation will be highly irreducible. And what we want to do is to define this Casimir that will be a constant on each reducible sub-modules. And that's how we, so they will somehow label the representation you're looking for. Okay, so that's the first part. And then what we need to do is to compare the quiver. And you'll see that they don't look the same, but they're actually equivalent under this. Equivalent under this quiver mutation that is a tool from cluster algebra. So there's a way to deform the quiver by the so-called quiver mutation. Not going to explain it exactly, but it's somehow you have to flip the direction of arrows that goes or leave from a certain node and then complete certain circles and so on. So you have rules to build another quiver. And you also have rules for the transformation. And you also have rules for the transformation of this quantum variables x. So you have new variable x prime that are defined in such a way that the commutation relation of the x prime will be encoded in the new equiver. So I have an explicit expression of this x prime in terms of the x. It's a very nonlinear, but you can do this. No, it's the same because here I this one is doubled. And here for, I don't know, not a very smart reason, this one I didn't double it, but I could have. And this should, yeah, yeah, yeah. So this should be the same. Yes, and this is also the same as in the Kashikoji Mac we have. Yes. Yes? Yeah, so all the variables that are directly connected to this vertex are also replaced. So it's a single mutation, but the mutation implies changing all the vertices that are connected to the vertex you mutate. Yeah, I can show it, write it down, but that is a rule, and yes. Rule and yes. Yeah, I mean the expressions are a bit complicated, so I don't want, but I can show it to you later. All right, so then we just compare the expression of the generators in the new variables, and we find that the representations are indeed the same. So what you have to show in particular is that the generators, so the So, the generators associated to a certain path now becomes associated to a new path in this mutated quiver, and this has to be the same path as in the Kechikojima quiver, basically. So, that's what we did. So, here we need to eliminate three, I think. Yes, three. I think other questions. So there's actually a bit of a bonus here. So you don't have to remove these frozen nodes. You can keep them. And after mutation, you will find, and also reduction of this extra oscillator, you will find this evaluation representation of quantum affine SLN. So you will have the same number of Q oscillators. You have one more commutative variables that correspond. One more commutative variable that corresponds to the spectral parameters. So you can also get a presentation of quantum affinity. So this works very well for SL3. For higher rank, we still need to find a systematic procedure to find this CASIMIR. So we still have a bit of work to do, but it should be possible. We have a conjecture for the sequence of mutation. It's not a proof yet, but again, in progress. Right. So question on the on the finite case? So if not, I move to the affine case. So in the affine case on the W algebra side, you consider the Drinfeld presentation of quantum affine SLN. So it's the same algebra as before, but now we are in the Druinfeld presentation. So you don't Greenfield presentation. So you don't have this index omega equals zero, but you trade it for an infinite tower of modes for each node of the Young diagram, of the Dinkin diagram. So this is defined in terms of this current. So X plus X minus will play the role of E and F and Psi plus minus of the current on K plus K minus. I'm not going to give explicit. I'm not going to give explicit relations. I guess most of you the audience know them anyway, but I'm going to give some on the toroidal case a bit later. Right, so now that we have our algebra, let's look at the representation, this free field representation that was derived by again Awata-san, now with Odaki and Shirashi in 93. So let's have a look at their paper. Right, so that's their representation they found. Well, as you can see, this is fairly complicated. So, this depends on n square minus one three fields, A, B, and C, that are written here. This involve cudiform vertex operators with shift of the argument. That's pretty amazing. I don't know how they managed to derive this, but it's really impressive. Anyways, but the good news. Anyways, but the good news is that we can simplify all this using this cluster algebra techniques. And this is where Michael's great idea comes from, which appears, which is this QRization of the quiver. So in this affine case, we will associate to each node of the quiver a vertex operator instead of just a quantum variable. We will distinguish unfrozen and frozen nodes according to the type. And frozen nodes according to the type of self-OPE of these vertex operators. So I use this shortcut notation quite a lot. So what I mean by this in this talk, I should have written it. This is just the OPE. So this just tells you that this product is this function times the normal ordering of the operator that, as usual, consists of As usual, consists of putting the positive modes to the right. So it's just a way to encode this factor here that appears when you normal order. So this is just the self-OPE defined in terms of this function phi n. That's not too important. And now the arrows will encode a non-trivial OPE between the vertex operators. So we will have plane arrows. So that we'll have plane arrows that corresponds to this function phi1, phi minus one, and these dashed arrows of type plus or minus. And you have the property that if you have two dashed arrows of different signs, this is equivalent to a plain dashed arrow. Now the main difference is that your arrows carry a label alpha that somehow twists That somehow twist this LPE this way. Now, if you look at the zero modes of this vertex operator, you will recover the rules that we had in the finite quiver. So that's a way to check that what we're doing is legit. So I'll focus on n equals three for the talks, but we can do this for any rank. So in this way, you can rewrite a Wetenster's representation. Representation using this telescopic sum here, introducing these vertex operators y that will be associated to the nodes of my quiva. Then once we've rewritten this in this form, we can look at the OPE of this y vertex operators and we recover this Kashikojima quiver here. So with some decoration, so here you have some double arrows that cancel. Some double arrows that cancel each other in the final case, so they were not there, and now all arrows have certain decorations, certain label. But again, there is a pattern here. So, and yes, the zero modes reproduce what we have in the finite case. So, that's the W algebra side. Now, we move to the Quantum group side. And for this, we need to introduce this surface defect algebra. That is the deformation of quantum toroidal SLN by this parameter C, an integer. So this has the quantum toroidal algebra. This will depend on two quantum group parameters, Q1 and Q2. So in Jago's talk, this was Q and T inverse. And we introduce an extra parameter, Q3. An extra parameter q3, such that the product of the three is one, to make everything look more symmetric. Then we'll need to define this structure functions that play the same role as the Carton metrics, but in this Drinfeld presentation. And this algebra will be again defined in terms of modes of the currents here, where the currents are now indexed by the affine Lincoln diagram. Dinkin diagram. So here are the algebraic relations for the currents. So it looks again like quantum Toidal SLN, but with this shift of the indices that also come with a rescaling of the spectral parameters at the same time. Also, cell relations that are undeformed. The Drinfer coproduct can be also deformed in the same way, and that you have this additive property for this central element. So, a few remarks again similar to the finite case. So, when C is zero mod N, you recover the algebraic relation of quantum toilet or SLN. Quantum toilet or SLN. You can also define a GLN version, but it's not so important for the store. You have a certain product of zero modes that are central, again not so important for today. We have a Dreamfeld double construction using again the twist by this abelian group action. Now the difference is that you shift the spectral parameter at the same time, you rescale it. Same time, you rescale it. You can look at the algebra of zero modes, and very not surprisingly, they define this surface defect version of quantum affine SLN that I've shown you before. This is the horizontal algebra, sub-algebra. So, the strategy will be the same. We'll start with representation with C equal one. We will take coproduct to build. will take coproduct to build something that has C equal n then we will discard the nodes corresponding to the affinization to get the representation of quantum affine SRN. So we need to start with this SQL representation that we call horizontal fork representation. This is defined using the modes Find using the modes of n bosons that satisfy this Heisenberg algebra. So I call them j omega k. You have also certain zero modes. So I've been a bit more explicit here. I wrote also the Fox space on which they act. So this is standard. You just create states with negative modes, and you have this particular states for the zero modes here. So this representation as level C equals one in general depends. C equal one in general depends on n complex weight, u and n integer weights. If you include also the, yeah, I didn't say that, but you can also define shifted version of this surface defect algebra. And in that case, you will have all this extra integer weight as well. But yeah, to keep things simple, here I will keep u equal 1 and n equals 0 and And what you find is that the Druinfeld current are expressed as single vertex operators acting on this fork space. So this is the expression. It's not as bad as it looks, actually. So the zero modes, so this is what I call Q omega before, and this is P omega inverse, I think. So this is a way to rewrite them. So zero modes, oh, So zero modes satisfy the relations of the finite algebra. And yes, so when n equals one, the shift that you have for your nodes has no effect because you have only one node and you recover the usual horizontal fork representation of quantum toyology one. So now we're in business, we can apply the coproduct and find a representation with C equals M and when M is C equals m and when m is equal to n you get a representation of a genuine quantum toid or sln and then you restrict yourself to this vertical subalgebra removing the generators with omega equals zero. So I skip all the details doing computing this with the co-product and looking at the OPE. We end up with this rectangular quiver that looks very much like what we had before. Now the color of the arrows Now the color of the arrows encode the label of these arrows somehow. E and F are built in the X plus and X minus are built in the same way, following either blue or red arrows. So it's very much like in the finite case. So that's more or less where we are now. This is also in progress, but we know how to define this mutation on the vertex operators. Operators. So it just remains to compare the two representations. And hopefully, we will finish this pretty soon. Now, the good news in the affine case is you have only to remove one boson, because I water sign had also n square minus one, free field, and we know which one it is, so that's going to simplify a bit our life. Uh yeah, that's just what I said. Thank you. Now I'd like to make contact with the work of Mukin, with Fegin, Jimbo, Vilkovitsky and Miwa for all your work by looking at the principal case. And also this will answer Weile's question that she asked me last time in June. So what's the connection with the So, what's the connection with all the other quiver, like the one in Go Stock? So, if you look at n equal 1 on the quantum group side, the shift C here will disappear because you have only one node and you end up with quantum toidal GL1 at level m, 0. And in this case, the rectangular quiver that we had will degenerate into this particular quiver here. And this is the quiver that is associated to this. Quiver that is associated to this principle cudiform WM algebra. So that's the quiver that will appear in Muchin's work. But we have extra frozen nodes at the end, otherwise you recover the M minus 1 quiver. We have extra loop, we have double the arrows here with different labels. So somehow our rules are different, but the quiver is the same. Yes, so to each node here correspond screenings. So when you have a loop here, you have this bosonic screening. So you have two screening actually for each node, each unfrozen nodes. And in the previous quiver, we had no loop for each of these nodes. So this corresponds to the fermionic case. So we have only one screening, one fermionic screening for each node. For each note. So there should be also a BCD extension to our construction. So this X vertex operator is what they call a root current, I think, in their paper. Any question on the find case? So let me oh, yeah, too. Let me summarize. So here are the main results. First, so we rewrite this Q oscillator representation of quantum, so finite quantum group SLN, and the free-field representation of quantum affine SLN in the form of telescopic sum associated to. Sum associated to paths in this Cashikojima quiver. Now, on the quantum group side, we introduced this surface defect deformation of quantum affine and quantum Toidal SLN algebra. We define Q-Oscillators and free field representations for this new algebra, so this C equal one. We construct new representations of undeformed algebra using this coproduct technique, and this representation. And these representations are now associated to the rectangular quivers. Now, if you remove the generators associated to the affine root, we find a new representation for the subalgebra by quantum affine, I mean the finite quantum group and the quantum affine algebra. And finally, we relate this representation using this technique of quival. Representation using this technique of quiver mutations and the corresponding transformation of either quantum variables or vertex operators. Now, I have many questions about this. As you notice, maybe in the workshop, I have a lot of questions. So, first, so we have this rectangular quiver of size n times m, and you recover curiform W algebras associated to trivial embeddings, so Wakimoto for. trivial embedding so Wakimoto for m equal n and principal embedding for n equal one right so what happens in between what happens if m is not equal to n we have no idea at the moment could this be related to the other non-principle W algebra this was zoo that we have in between here I don't know so we just starting to think about it I think the the construction of Harada will be very helpful Will be very helpful for this is using corner vertex operator algebra to build BP and what he calls Fegin-Semiketov. So the algebra, the something what corresponds to some sub-principle W algebras. So it would be nice to understand this in our language, but yeah, we have begging of an idea, but a lot of work to do. There should be also a BCD type that a B C D type version of what we do here using maybe this co-module construction of Fengin Jimbo Mukin Vikovitsky yeah I mentioned at the beginning the application to the Peter gauge correspondence and the role that this surface defect plays in derivation of Hamiltonian and construction of Huygens function even lax matrices of Qt Lax matrices of Q-Toda were constructed in this way by Norton Lee last year. And so, this, I think, is the proper algebraic framework to study this correspondence, and we are not far from understanding the Necrosoft Shattuge-V limit in this context. Other questions? Connection with symmetric functions. So, we all know that McDonald's symmetric function plays a special role for quantum toidal GL1. What is the GL1. What is the analog here for our horizontal representation? We don't know. What happens to fiber-based duality when you have this surface defect? Is there an analog of Mickey's automorphism? So I don't know if Duncan's method can apply for deformation. That would be great to understand this better. There's also interesting. There's also an interesting possible application to the construction of this t-tradron R metric. So this T-tridron equation is the 3D version of Young-Baxter equation. And in this recent series of papers, Cuniba collaborator is using certain cluster mutation of the Falkon Scharoff quiver to build the T-tridron R matrix. And so with Misha's affinization. Misha's affinization technique or colorization technique of the quiver, we should maybe be able to build an R matrix that now depends on the spectral parameters. So that would be really nice. And then a bit of advertisement. There should also be some connection to this other work on QT deformation of integrable hierarchies that we did last year with Sasha. So I have in mind here. Sasha. So I have in mind here maybe some kind of cudiform version of cat sweat humato construction. That's all for my equations. No yours.
