Okay, so our next uh speaker is uh Lucas Schiebar, uh who will uh present uh his results on the short complement and the situation to distinguish self-adjoint extension as well as variational principles for gap or introduction. Thank you very much, and thank you to the organizers for organizing this wonderful workshop. And as it says, in the overly long title, I will talk about the should complement, and this is. Talk about the SUC complement and this is joint work with January Solovey and Sabiotopos from a few years ago. And to be honest, maybe the result that I will talk about is maybe not the interesting part, especially in the context of this workshop. But I want to highlight that in our work, we faced some issues with the show complement. We found some ways to circumvent these issues. And I think what we learned can maybe be applicable in some of your research. And especially what I'll touch upon today is somehow related. One today is somehow related to what Roberto, for example, talked about yesterday. Somehow, make my talk relevant. Of course, the true compliment you could think about it as a rational operator pencil or in some cases 15 and paper scales also have a value. Okay, so I'll quickly present the problem that we considered in our research. And we were concerned with finding self-attrained extensions of operators. In quantum mechanics, as you all know, we normally want to find self-atrond operators. Normally, we want to define self-age operators, but in practice, that's not how it works. They're given a symmetric operator on some density-defined domain, and we have to find an extension. For a certain class of operators, that's especially easy, and those are semi-bounded operators. So you have an operator A, denser-defined coupled space, symmetric, and it's assumed one property that's bounded from below, then of course this operator will have self-attron extensions simply because the deficiency in it has broken. But there can be many self-atron extensions. But there can be many self-ageron extensions, and you have to somehow find the correct one. And there's one particularly nice self-ageron extension of such an operator. That's what we call the Friedlix extension. And this Friedlands extension has many nice properties, and I'm only going to mention two of them. One of the nice properties of the Friedlins extension is that this extension is still going to be semi-bounded from below at the same number lambda one as the symmetric optic. And that's also somewhat sharp in the sense that. Somewhat sharp in the sense that lambda one is now either going to be an eigenvalue of the extension or it's going to be the bottom of the essential screen. So generally you may have this picture here, lambda one is one eigenvalue of the extension, then the more eigenvalues, maybe they converge as an essential scatter. And all these eigenvalues here, now you can compute them in terms of a variational principle. And again, that's nothing special because we have a semi-bounded self-internal operator, a variational principle. But what's so special about the three-dimensional? But what's so special about the three-drags extension is that in the variation translation, we only need to know the domain of this match property. So you actually never need to compute necessarily the domain of the extension. So what does this look like? Well, if you want to know the case diagonal value, you look at subspaces of the domain of the symmetric operator, k, you try to make the paradigm as large as possible on the space, and then you minimize with respect to the possible space. So in many cases, this is some of the physically relevant extensions, some of the most stable. Relevant extensions, some of the most stable extensions of the spin trajectory. A very quick word about the proof, or how you prove it. Assume, for example, that lambda one is strictly larger than zero, and then you immediately recognize that the paradigm form is simply a norm. What you do is you take the domain of a symmetric operator and you complete it with extractives. That's a very abstract procedure, and theoretically, you know. And theoretically, you know, looking at a completion, you could leave the original robot space. But because your norm is of this nice form, x, ax, you can easily check that the completion of the domain with respect to this norm does not leave the original protocol. That's why such correct forms are always loadable. And then we have, well, of course, you can then extend A to this, now where you call it form domain, this completion, and it's going to be a close quadratic form. And it's going to be a closed quadratic form, and we know that closed quadratic forms one-to-one correspond to self-regular operators. And in that way, you get the further distortion. Of course, not every operator that we're interested in in mathematical physics is semi-valid, and I'm particularly interested in the Grack operator. So it makes sense to look at a larger class of operators. And we looked at gap operators. So I've written down here a gap condition, I look at a symmetric operator that satisfies this condition. It's now calculated. It's now characterized by two parameters. And what it means, well, if A is salvage right, this just means there's no spectrum between lambda naught and lambda one. It's just a result. If you let lambda naught go to minus infinity, then formally this condition will exactly turn into a lower semi-boundedness by. So this is really a more general condition than. And again, you could ask yourself two questions. Can we define a service on expansion? Define a self-age on extension of the symmetric object that leaves the gap open, and this is somewhat distinguished self-age on extension. And once we have that, well, maybe the spectrum that looks as follows, I have lambda naught, and there's no spectrum now between lambda naught and lambda one, we can then define all the eigenvalues above the gap in terms of a nice variation principle. Maybe a variation principle that only needs the domain of the symmetrical. This is a similar question as the symphony expansion. And in the literature, these two problems have been discussed for a long time, but mostly separately. There are results about subtraction extensions, distinguished subjoining extensions of gapped operators. Of course, there are variation principles for gapped operators. What we wanted to do is we wanted to somehow combine these two problems, as you've seen for the Friedlis extension. I'll quickly show you what our result is, and then I'll talk about the experiment. So, our result. So, our result starts with a densely defined symmetric operator. We have three assumptions. The first assumption is that our Hilbert space and importantly, the domain of the operator can be decomposed into two performance sums, from BA plus, plus B minus, and similarly, H plus, etc. And that just means that we can write our operator in a block matrix. So, we start with a block, each operator. Then we have what I call Then we have what I call the gap condition, and we'll look into this on the next slide, but it simply says that a certain value down the north has to be strictly smaller than another value down the one. That's called the second condition. The third condition of technical line says that the bottom right component here has to be essentially sulfatron. And if all these three conditions are satisfied, well, first of all, you can prove that there is a sulphatron extension. It's not a trick. Extension. It's not a tricky part, but this is a somewhat distinguished self-attron extension. And you can see it somehow as a generalization of heatless construction. And in particular, this self-atrune extension, it keeps this gap condition, even though it's not the extension. So in general, there will be now no spectrum between lambda lambda 1. And lambda 1, just like for the freeze extension, will be the first eigenvalue, or it will be the bottom of the central spectrum. Similarly, all the higher I value above the depth, you can have a variation as well. And it's not the main topic of the talk to talk about this variation principle. This is where most of our work went into. But I just wanted to realize that in the variation principle again, you see you only need to know the domain of the symmetrical. P of A plus here, T of A plus. So you never need to actually compute inhibit the domain of the expansion operation principle, you only See, there are several similarities to results. But what I want to talk briefly about now is this gap condition because it looks so different to what I had on the previous slide. So what does the gap condition actually say? It says that, first of all, we have to compute this number here. We look at the largest energy or the largest quadratic form you can build on B of A minus. It's just literally, you look at the lowest. Just literally, you look at the lowest upper bounds of humans. That's what the long number is. Then we compute a number one, which is this more difficult-looking number. And it's kind of exactly the number we need to want to have in the variation when it's not. It looks a bit like what we expect in the next principle. We take an x plus, d of a plus, and then we go through all the y minuses, d of v minus, and we try to make the ferric form as large as possible. And after that, we move. And after that, we minimize with respect to the choice flexible. And you can easily check that this number here, this number one, will always be larger or equal to number zero. But what we asked for in our results is that this is strict inequality. So that's a subtle thing. That's why our evaluation wants a strict inequality between these two things. And if you play around a little bit, you can convince yourself that this strict inequality actually implies that the standard gap conditions is fine. Operate will then satisfy a gap condition with exactly the parameters lambda naught. Where does this gap condition come from? This looks a bit arbitrary. This is related to something that's maybe a bit more familiar to all of you. Maybe to a Shulka. You can prove that this strict inequality here between these two numbers is equivalent to the existence of an E which is larger than number, such that this would try to. Or not, such that this quadratic form here is non-negative. And then once you have it for one E, we actually have the disquadratic form that's non-negative for all E's between up to the as I said what we have here on this contract form that's exactly a tracked form of the true level. So some of the other gap conditions forces at the truck. So if I now talk about the proof of this result, you'll probably immediately Proof of this result, you probably immediately know how we're going to construct our extension because we know that the sure complement is a non-negative operator, so, likely, we want to extend the sure complement or something. Okay, so let's go a little bit fuller construct, and I want to now highlight how difficult it is to actually define the shoe complement in the strict segment. I've written down here the shoe decomposition, just assuming for the moment that we have a founded operator, so I've convinced everything down but in Ashes. Done, but an issue. And there's a somewhat a notation that has been established for 20 years now in this problem. And I'm not sure how familiar some of you are with this, so I'm not going to use this notation. It's maybe a bit strange at first. So I decompose A minus E into transfer matrix, up diagonal matrix, and a transfer matrix. And it's customary, well, I'm doing short decomposition in the first component. So in the second component, nothing will actually happen. Nothing will actually happen. So what I have here in the diagonal is actually A minus minus minus B. And I just write it somehow a bit more difficult. I introduce B, which is minus A minus minus. So here I have just minus A instead of B. Okay, it's just to save me writing a few minuses. This has been instead which has some nice notation. Then I have, of course, the transfer operators, and now I need to make sure I'm not doing a spectrum of whatever I have here. Whatever I have here, and then I can define L E as the inverse of this operator. So I have here in the transfer matrices. And then in the bottom left component, top left component, I have the true content for the first component consists of A plus plus minus E, and of course the next term, which is the plus as of the same. Okay, all we do now in our construction is we start with a symmetric operator and we will try. And we will try to look at the corresponding elements on the right-hand side. We will try to extend them, put them back together, and in that way we get an extension of the left-hand side. It's very briefly go through how we construct all these three objects and then we get to the next one. So, how do we do what do we do with B? Given from the semantic operator, we are given already A minus minus. So, now So now we want to construct a self-adjoint extension, so it makes sense to maybe start by extending A minus sectors. And we're in a good position here because if you remember, we know that A minus minus is bounded from above. It's a mismatch operator. So we can easily extend A minus minus to a salvation operator because it's a semi-bound operator. We could look, for example, at the Felix extension. Extension. And then this finish extension will still be bounded from below and not. So, in particular, we can always make sense of these inverse operators as long as E is above the bottom of the spectral gap. It's honestly larger than. Now, if you remember on the previous slide, I said we need this technical assumption that A minus minus is essentially a subjoint. That just means that there's actually only one subjoint extension here of this. The phase extension is the only subjoint extension. Self-transtension. So, how it's not clear, why do we even need this? And this will only become clear on the next slide when I talk about how to construct the object. So, LE, of course, you could now define just as B plus E inverse times A minus positive. And now I will tell you, well, that's not a good idea. We want to define this operator as a closed operator. And again, I can't justify it until we get to the next slide, but at least now I can justify. But at least now I can justify why we needed the assumption that A minus minus is essentially salvage. Because this operator here, it doesn't need to be closable unless you assume that A minus minus is essentially salvage. So that's where I now can justify why we need this technical assumption. So we can close this operator. Koja corresponds to the operator. What is also nice is that the domain of the closure is independent of each other. is independent of E. Even though the operators are look different for E, but the domain of each operator is the same. Okay, and now we get to the Schur complement. And it looks like we're already in a great situation. I told you that the gap condition implies that the target form corresponding to a Schur complement is non-negative, at least for east in the gap. There's a very subtle issue here, no, actually, two issues. First of all, this quotatic form shows This quadratic form is not necessarily closable. At least the closability is not true. Because if you see this operator here on the left-hand side, the unit bottom. And the very first second slide or something I said that magic forms of form x, ax, they always go to block. But here we have the issue that this operator is on the wrong side of it. And we don't have any condition that allows us to move this to the right-hand side. If you have in mind what the draw. If you have in mind what the Dirac operator looks like, for example, then you will notice that, well, this one will be a differential operator. You have some type of one over potential. We don't want to assume anything about the potential being differentiable or anything like that. So there's nothing there in case that this one can be taken over here. So it's not so clear that this is even closer. And there's another issue, namely that, well, we have the positivity in the gap. And of course, that would be good enough to construct an extension because we all. Would be good enough to construct an extension because we only need to do this for one here, sort of extension. But that wasn't our aim, we wanted to prove a variational principle. And as you can imagine, to prove the variational principle, we will somehow use some spectral equivalence between the extension and the shoe complement. So we really need to be able to define the SHU complement for all E's large. And it also, your extension in the end, it shouldn't depend on what you choose for A E. It should be able to do this construct. You should be able to do this construction for any right-hand side of the gap. We need to get the same self-atron extension. Otherwise, there can't be a very distinguished sulfatron extension. Right, so what do we do? Well, now it becomes important when I said before that LE is a closed operator. And this was already mentioned yesterday by Bob Allah in her talk, and she said she introduces this space. I think on the last slide, it was called D. I think on the last slide it was called D1. It's a smaller Hilbert space on which we can close the shoot. So this smaller Hilbert space is exactly the domain of the operator LE, now with the graph node. And you can check that on this domain, this quadratic form is actually bounded from below for all E's larger than number one. And because you know this is basically LE, you can easily convince yourself that the platform is not even closable on this little butt space. Is not even closable on this new hilt space. We don't have a problem with closable. Maybe just the model, it seems arbitrary. Why do I suddenly close the hydrophone with respect to this new norm? Well, this all comes from the idea that you want to have spectra. You probably know that in the end, but you want to have some statement that if q of e of x plus is equal to zero, you want to be able to compute that q of minus e applied to the vector x plus cell e x plus. Don't have some statement along those lines. So it makes sense to find the Shur complement only on a space where you have some notion of x, of this vector. So that's why it's not arbitrary to chose with the spectrum. Right, so we close with vector norm, and then of course there's a we have a more chosen form just from this funny hill button. Form just from this funny Hilbert space, and there's a unique self-age that corresponds to this, which I call R E, which is not the School complement, but some other operator. And you can now show spectral equivalence in the sense that the lambda k is defined in the variation principle, they are exactly the numbers such that the k sign value of R lambda k is equal to. So exactly as you would expect from shape. All we need to do then is now we need to put all these operators together and construct our extension. Start the extension. And what's a bit, I put a few things under the carpet here. Of course, in reality, you will not look at the operator, for example, B, but B hat, just as Papala called it yesterday and I thought these distribution operators there. And the variation principle then simply follows from this spectral correspondence. It's a very problem. So we were pretty happy we got this result, but now it's been applied to several draft operators, for example, it has. Dirac operators, for example, it helps people to construct extensions of Dirac operators with smear.com potential variation for instance for its operators. And it was really important for us to begin with the new one. And recently, Gobo, Estiman Zeré, they published an erratum to one of their 20-year-old papers where they acknowledged that the causability issue of the true complement form is not trivial. One is not trivial, and that in the literature some things happen overlook. But at the same time, we also published this beautiful result here from last year, which yet again improves on what we've done. And it's exactly the same result as we have, but they don't meet the assumption that A minus minus is essentially self-adjoint. How much time do we have left? It's really just move one side of it. So, what do they do? Well, to define B, they just look at the freelance extension of minus A minus ones. That's fine. It's not a unique extension, but that's fine. Then they look at L E to be this operator here, which is not necessarily closable now, but they don't care about it. They don't close the operator. The path, the closure of the path will not correspond to an operator, will be a linear relation, but they don't even close the operator. Up. Next, they have the same issue as we have. They look at the contract form. Very form is positive, but it's not necessarily closable. You don't know anything about B larger than lambda 1. They can't use our trick. So what they observe is that we actually can think about the quathic form as defined on the graph of LE. So then we see the LE already shows up here. You can easily see that we as well define Q as actually matrix of the form X plus L E. And then here, the first component acts as A plus minus E. In the second component, now just put a B plus E inverse here and by it, and you get it acts in the second component at B plus E. So on the graph of LE, this is actually exactly a filsable target form. It is of the form operate on the right hand side, operate on the right hand side. So all so what does it correspond to? It corresponds to this symmetric operate here. Once it is symmetric object here, A plus B and here on the off. So, of course, this looks a lot like a linear pencil, but it's a bit more difficult because we only look at this on the graph of E, so the main of this operator depends on E. That's very difficult because. But still, you now see that this diform is closable. In particular, if you just look at the closure of the graph, that's a Hilbert space. It doesn't correspond to an operator. We don't mind, or they don't mind. You can still look at the Hilbert space. You can still look at the silver space, you can chose the catalytic form with respect to the path norm on this silver space, and you will get a new operator SC. It's uniquely self-agined, self-agined and uniquely associated with this. And then again, you can improve that there's spectral correspondence between the aberration principle values and the highlights here. I'll skip maybe the last slide in the interest of time because I'm pushing. Last slide in the interest of time, because I'm pushing time. I just want to say to summarize. So, we've seen that some of in our work we need to define the right form of the shoe component. And ideally, we wanted to define somehow as an inner product with a salvage and optimum. And in some cases, in ideal cases, of course, you can just write it with matic form in this way, x plus x plus. But under some weak assumptions, that's not necessarily possible. And then you can maybe write it with. And then you can maybe write it with respect to a different inner product, which I call the E. That means general assumptions. And maybe even generally you can write it as an inner product on the graph of a certain operator. And I'm not arguing that these are the operators you should look at instead of the shoot operator. For us, this was more a technical tool in order to define the extension. I think what's, if you compute this, for example, for the Pool and Rock operator, what the RE really is, it's not a nice operator. It's not an ice operator. So it's really more of a technical tool, I think. What's more important, I think, is that these results tell you something about the catalytic form of the way. And after all, that's the thing you're actually interested in. You're actually more interested in the catalytic form here rather than the operator. And closing it with respect to E just tells you what is the correct catalytic form domain in which you want to look at your shoe complement in order to find all the eigenvalues of your operator. So I would conjecture, for example, that even though in our case we've hardly find That even though in our case we can't define QE by closing our form, you can probably just take the form domain here, restrict it to the adjoint domain of the adjoint of QE, and you can probably still define QE in a meaningful way on this domain. And you may even have spectral understanding. And how this is related to Pabala's talk, I think in her talk she had some results about the damped weight equation and she needed some assumptions on the damping A that guaranteed that it's. Banking A that guaranteed that a certain talent form was actually possible. And I will conjecture you can probably weaken the assumptions on A by using similar objects. That's all I wanted to say. Thank you.
