Everybody, my name is Xin Jingling. I'm a PhD student from the University of Sydney, and today I'm going to present integrative analysis of breast cancer survival based on spatial features. Complex cancer progression, such as tumor growth and evasion, is known to be impacted by the immune system and its spatial interaction with tumors. With tumors. Some extreme conditions of tumor microenvironment may support cancer stem cells and amplify tumor cell heterogeneity and therefore affect the cancer development and clinical outcome. While in most of the clinical survival studies, people usually start from using different clinical features to predict the survival outcomes, such as age and tumor stage. Some other non-clinical features that can be derived from non-spatial That can be derived from non-spatial transmutomics, like single-cell RNA-seq, are becoming popular to be used to predict survival outcomes. These features include cell states, cell-type compositions, and marker expressions. However, as mentioned before, the tumor progression is closely associated with the cell-type interaction within the tumor microenvironment. Some spatial features like the actual physical location and interaction between the tumor and emotion. Interaction between the tumor and immune cells, therefore, may be useful in survival prediction. Currently, however, it is unknown which categories of the features are the most predictive in patient survival outcome. There are two recent mass automation imaging data in breast cancer allows us to integratively explore the potential predictive feature in breast cancer survival. One is generated from imaging mass cytometry, the one just preceded. Cytometry, the one just presented by our keynote speaker, and the other one is generated by Mivitov. Both technologies start from staying the tissue with up to only 40 antibodies simultaneously, and then different systems are used to determine the epitome expression. The final product of these two technologies are some high-dimensional images, which will then be combined and virtualized. And virtualize. As two datasets are both imaging data in breast cancers, people may be wondering whether we can integrately analysis the two datasets and find common clinical insights. However, integratively analysing these two datasets are not trivial at all. First of all, since limited proteins will be imaged at the same time, each study tends to be very cautious to select the epitodes according to the questions they want to answer. They want to answer. Therefore, two imaging data only have 13 common proteins in total, with one mainly focusing on profiling the immune-related proteins and the other one focusing on profiling tumor cell subtypes and tumor cell states. This therefore links to a very different cell type annotation resolution between two studies. In the MIBITWORK data, more immune cells are able to be identified, such as CDAs for CD4. CDA for CD4 and CDA T cells. While in the imaging mass cytometry data, the tumor cells are able to be further split to different subtypes according to different cell states and tumor proteins marker, therefore linked to different survival outcomes. Furthermore, the clinical types between the two data sets are only partially overlapped. MIBITOP data only has 40 triple negative breast cancer patients, while the imaging mass are While the imaging mass cytometry data had patients from four different clinical subtypes of breast cancers, including 49 triple negative breast cancers. We start from exploring whether the commonly used clinical features are predictive to patient survival. Here, we fit a univariate cost model for each clinical features and evaluate the performance of the model using C-index while cost-validation. A higher C-index here. A higher C index here indicates a better performance of the survival model. We found that in the imaging mass side atomology data, grays plus tumor size is the most predictive clinical features, while on the other hand, the non-spatial features such as cell type composition are not as predictive as classical clinical features. While if we only look at the triple D-necked breast cancer in this cohort, the subtypes The subtitles of breast cancer with our poorer survival, we found that most of the clinical features no longer have the predictive power. This makes us wondering whether some spatial features will potentially help with the survival prediction. With all these challenges in the integrated analysis and patient survival analysis, in this talk, I would like to address three challenges by trying Challenges by trying to answer the following three questions: Are the spatial features extracted from the images predictive in patient survival? And second, while integrating the two imaging data in the metrics is challenges, are there common predictive spatial features shared between the two data sets? And is it possible to integrate the data at the spatial feature level? And finally, will other types of the Will other types of single-cell data information further improve the prediction in patient survival? To answer these questions, in this talk, I will first introduce some spatial discriminant features that could be identified from the images. And next, I will evaluate different features via survival analysis. And finally, I will explore the possibility to use Cytop to impute the imaging protein expression. Expression. So, first, I will introduce four different spatial features. The first one is Moran Sci, which measures the spatial autocorrelation. It evaluates whether the pattern expressed is cluster, dispersed, or random. The images here show the two pertains expressions from the same image. On the left-hand side, the MPO expressions are spatially distributed as a cluster. Therefore, it has a relatively high morality. Therefore it has a relatively high models eye values. On the right hand side, the CD8 values randomly spread in the images. Therefore, it has a low model I values. Nearest neighbors correlation is another matrix to estimate the spatial association of a protein. It essentially just calculates the correlations of the protein expression between the cells with their nearest neighbors. So taking the same previous example, the X acid here indicates The X-acid here indicates the expression of a cell, and the Y-asset here indicates the protein expression of this cell's nearest neighbors. From the figure, we can see that the ambient expression of cells are more correlated with its neighbors than the RCDA expression. Next, let's take a look at how these spatial autocorrelation features could be used to characterize the patient. Here is the heat map of the nearest neighbor's correlations of the mibital. Neighbors correlation of the MIBITOF data. The rows are the protained and annotated by different categories of this protain belong to, and the columns are the patients annotated by the patient group classified from the original paper. We can clearly see that there are two subgroups in both patients and the proteins. One is the compartmentalized group, which has high nearest neighbors correlation in tumor and immune relationships. Correlation in tumor and immune-related proteins. And another group is the misgroup, which has nearest neighbor's correlation in the immune-related protein. Similarly, we could observe such pattern in the triple negative breast cancer from the imaging mass cytometry data as one group with higher correlation in the tumor and endothelial markers, and the other with relatively low. And the other with relatively low correlation. So, next, I will introduce two spatial features to measure the cell-type interaction. One is the cell-type interaction composition. We calculate the nearest neighbors of each cell and then calculate the pairs of cell type based on the nearest neighbors. This allows us to summarize it into a cell-type interaction composition. Another way to look at it is to consider it as a point process analysis. An outbound Analysis. An L-function can be used to assess the significance of cell-side interaction by calculating the density of a cell type with other cell types within a certain radius. The observed L-functions being above the gray area generated by bootstrapping indicate the cell types are spatially associated with each other, like the neutral fields here. While if the observed L-function is below the gray area, it indicates the two cell types. It indicates the two cell types are being avoidant with each other, like the neutral fields and tumor cells here. Now we have all these features, we are wondering how they can help with the survival conditions. To evaluate each spatial measure, we will first select the features based on univariate cost model performance and then fit the mutivary cost model. And finally, we will evaluate the survival model using C-index viral cost validation. Fire cost validation. Here are the results for the Mivitov data. We can see that although the spatial features are not as good as using the stage to predict the survival, the spatial features are generally performing better than the non-spatial features, especially for the cell-time interaction spatial features. A similar observation is shown in the triple-negative breast cancer cohort of the imaging mass semiotometry data. Most of the space Data. Most of the spatial features are able to achieve a higher C-index performance than the clinical features, especially using the spatial association of the proteins. So let's take an example to look at the Morrison features performance in details. The boss cross here indicates the C index of a univariate cost model fitting by Morris I values for each potente. And the top features here are actually from different Here are actually from different categories of the proteins, including the markers of mesenchemos, immune cell markers, cell states markers, tumor markers, and immunoregulation markers. Therefore, it suggests a multivariate model of these top variables captures very diverse information of the spatial association for each patient. Here are the coefficients of two cost-multivarious models. The common protects are. Model. The common protects are very limited in these two datasets, and therefore the common selected features are further limited. Two models only have one common features, which is Ki67, a cell-proliferating tumor marker. Both models indicate a higher spatial association of Ki67 linked to a poorer survival outcome of the patients. As the spatial features are predictive in survival outcomes, Predictive in survival outcomes, we would like to look for more commonality of the spatial features between the two datasets other than the limited common proteins. One possible solution here is to impute the additional protein expression from the other dataset. So, lastly, I would like to explore the possibility of integration between imaging data and site-off data. Recently, there are multiple studies as well as in the yesterday's presentations focusing on integrating spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-seq. One of them is using optimal transport. The optimal transport method is to formulate the integration as an optimization problem and try to minimize the cost to look for an optimal transport math between the two modalities. The gamma can be considered as the lightly. Gamma can be considered as the likelihood of cell I inside of data mapped to cell J in imaging data. We can therefore use the optimal gamma to calculate the additional protein expression for imaging data. However, unlike the single-cell analysis and spatial transmutments, which have hundreds of or thousands of common features between two modalities, the stytop data and imaging data only have 14 pertains in common. This therefore makes the dissimilarity This therefore makes the dissimilarity measurement very sensitive. So more investigation and evaluations are required in this work, but we have found that the preliminary results look promising. Here are some results of comparing the original protein expression with the predictive expression. We can see that optimal transport is able to recover the spatial pattern of the two markers with very high correlation with With very high correlation with the original expression. If we perform the customer on the imputed matrix, we found that firstly, the different immune cell types are still be able to group into different clusters. Moreover, there is one distinct tumor cluster are clearly separated from the other tumor cells. If we zoom into this tumor cluster, we found that this cluster is uniquely highly expressed chaos. Uniquely highly expressed Ki67 markers, which means that this is a cluster including the tumor cells that are actively repairing to divide into new cells. So finally, we divided the patients into two groups, one with high Ki67 cell proportion and the other one with low Ki67 cell proportion. And we have found that within the same stage of the breast cancer, the patients with higher proportion. The patients with a higher proportion of KICT7 tumor tend to have poorer survival probability. This atries is consistent with multiple findings in the literature. So, in conclusion, spatial features improve the survival position in both imaging datasets. Limited consistency is shown between the survival model due to the limited common proteins measured in the two datasets. This may be solved by This may be solved by imputations of additional protein expressions, and this has been shown to improve the cell-type identification and have potential to increase the commonality between two datasets and further improve the survival conditions. So lastly, I would like to thank Sydney Precision Bioinformatics Research Group, especially my supervisor Jean and also Alice for the contributions of this project. The contributions of this project, and also I would like to thank Lawrence and Edine for providing the processed MIVITOP data and Cypop data. Thank you. Thank you. Questions? Please post on the chat. I'll ask a quick question, which is. Ask a quick question, which is looking at the nearest neighbors or the Moran, did you think that there was a difference between the platforms? I think it could be the difference between the platform. And yeah. And also the proteins that are selected are a bit different. So because not many common proteins are shared, so I'm not sure whether this is the perfect. I'm not sure whether this is the platform or the different things that I have been selected. Vera Panaldi wants to know if you could speak a little bit more about the Moran Index analysis. So, this is um measurements of Measurements of is actually like a spatial correlation, but taking into account both the values, the protein expression values, and also the weight matches. So the weight matches is basically the similarities between the cells. So if the cells are more, so it will give more weights to the cells that close to each other. So it's actually quite similar to the nearest neighbor's correlation. Similar to the nearest neighbors correlation, but the nearest neighbor's correlation only accounts for the first nearest neighbors. But this basically accounts for the whole images, as long as you give the weights for it. So the spatial weight matrix is based on a K and M? So here I use distance matrix. So it's basically the spatial distance. So it's a spatial distance, it's the distance rate. Spatial distance is the distance weight. Cool. Alex, Alexis Coombs wants to know what's the principle of optimal transport imputation? That looks very interesting. I'm wondering what the principle refers to. Alexis, do you want to speak a little bit about that? Yeah, so just how does it work? So just how does it work? I mean you used optimal transport to infer other variables, right? So what's the principle, what's the mechanism? Is it related to some sort of NMF or so it is an actually an optimization problem. So it's trying to solve the cause is actually a similarity like this similarity. Like dissimilarities between the two data sets, and you try to find a mapping that minimizes this cost. So it actually is the output is a map between the two data sets. So one, so it's a gamma. So it's like gamma ij indicates the likelihood of the cell i mapped to the cell j. Cool. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. And we can thank you so much. That was really cool. Can we move on to Chen's talk?
