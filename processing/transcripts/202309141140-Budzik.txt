And then later we will be interested in the Z3R default case and the K-free surfaces which are obtained from this R default are called human-like surfaces. So the main tools that we use to study the symmetry groups are lattice techniques. So I will try to explain what glowing lattices means and also what are numerous lattices, which appear when we study the symmetry groups. Which appear when we study the symmetry groups. So, using these lattice techniques, we will be able to connect symmetric groups from different points of the moduli state. So, this is the idea of symmetry tramping introduced by Anand. And at the end, I will mention some of our results for the C3RB4 case. So, let's start with the common construction. So, the common construction produces a gain with humans by ensolving. Is a case with humans by resolving similarities of the digital orbital of a four-dimensional forest. So we start with a four-dimensional torus. So here I do an example which is a product of two two-dimensional torus toroid. So this forest is defined by this lattice with lattice sectors lambda one, lambda two. And we identify the points on the plane which differ by some integral combination of these lattice sectors. Combination of these lattice sectors. So, for example, we identify these points. So, you can see that this lattice, the storus has a C2 action, which acts by reflecting with respect to the origin. So, for example, the origin is a fixed point, the T2 action. But because of the lattice identifications, these three points are also fixed points of these T2 actions. So, the four-dimensional forest. So, the four-dimensional product is a product of these two. So, together there are 16 fixed points under this interaction. So, this RB fault has 16 singularities. So, in order to obtain a smooth, complex structure, we have to resolve the singularities. So, these singularities happen to be of type 1, type A1, which means that to minimally resolve them, we replace singular points by We replace similar points by CP1, which I will also call exceptional dilators, in such a way to get a smooth complex surface. So doing this procedure, minimally resolving the singularities, produces a K-3 surface, which is called a Commerce. The Comer surface carries over the complex and killer structures from the underlying torrent. Underlying storage. So the storage we're defining in this lattice. So if we pick in equivalent lattices, then we will most likely end up with different commercial surfaces, which might have different symmetry groups. So in general, the symmetry group of a Kumar surface looks like this. So there is this dark group, which comes from, which is induced by the translations on the original forest. The original taurus. So these are the remaining translations which remain after we do the Z2R default. So for example, this will act on an exceptional divisor and market to a different exceptional divisor. So this price is retained for every commercial turf. And then this price is induced from the remaining symmetries of the torus, which are not translations. So this will depend on the choice of the torus. So if we pick a torus, So, if we pick a torus with more underlying symmetries, then this part will be bigger. So, this is what these symmetry groups look like in general for a commercial surface. Now, the important part is that the geometric action of the symmetric group is fully captured by its action on the integral homology lattice. So, this is why the lattices are so important to us. This is the gral homology lattice. Homology lattice. So it's an even unimodular lattice of signatures in common 19. And what's important is that we can understand this lattice geometry geometrically using a lattice using gluing lattices. So we can recover this lattice from two sub-lattices, K and B, using gluing. So the lattice K contain contributions from the underlying, from the Underlying from the two cycles of the underlying parts. And then the letter C contains contributions from the know that of Him lines. If you remember, we replaced the singularities by want, so the opto contributions to this H2 homology. Okay, so now I want to try to explain what that glue lattice disease on an easier example. So let's consider a hyperbolic latif, which is generated by two vectors, V0 and V1. So, like I just said, this has signature one, one actually. So, this is just a representation of this lattice on a plane. So, we can build two sub-lattices, which are generated by either a sum of these vectors or a difference. So, A plus. So A plus is a one-dimensional lattice which is generated by the sum. And then N minus is a one-dimensional lattice which is generated by this distance. And then the red dots are the lattice points which belong to this direct sum. So you can see that this sum contains some points of the original hyperbolic lattice, but not all of them. Lattice, but not all of them. So, in order to recover the entire hyperbolic lattice, we have to add some glue vectors. Okay, so let's consider these two blue vectors, W minus, W plus. Now, if we added blue vectors to the sublattices A plus and A minus, then this whole sum recovers the entire hyperbolic lattice. Okay, so we can recover the hyperbolic lattice. Okay, so we can recover the hyperbolic lattice from these sub lattices and also from some glow vectors. Why you say that? Oh, this is just an example, like the easiest example of blowing. And it's not, it's just like a plain representation of the hyperbolic lattice. Of the hyperbolic lattice because it actually has much one, ones that come to the control. This is just an example of the cooling field. Okay, so similarly, this integral homogenity lattice can also be recovered from two sub-lattices plus a bunch of blue vectors. This is the all-black star 24. This one is a rank 22. So Ida was considering a little bigger lattice, but we can fix an embedding of this lattice in the bigger lattice in such a way that this symmetry is acting in a trivial way on the crest of the I think so. You start with rank 22. Yes, I took some level rank 24. Yeah, I took a bit of a smaller level. Drop one of the hyperbolic buttons and four buttons. Because the action of that is now that second important That second important lattice technique that we use is that it turns out that this lattice, which is actually called a pomer lattice, can be converted into a NEMA lattice with the following tinting diagram. So NEMA lattices are even unimodular for the detective lattices in 24 dimensions. So there's 24 of them. They are labeled by thinking diagrams. Built by thinking diagons, either of Yank 0 or Yank 24. And they can also be built by gluing. So, for example, this first one, that in diagram, so we built by. So, you can think about it as having 24 components. And then we add a bunch of vectors to that, which form a group. And how does the Morphic group show up? So, if you look at the subgroup of lattice automorphisms, which only Lattice automorphisms, which only permutes the components, then we end up with M24. And then another minimal lattice we will need later, the one with the label. So it has 12 components. We add a bunch of blue vectors. And then the subgroup of the lattice automorphisms, which came with the components, is M plus, which is also a subgroup of M okay. Okay, so like I said, the spumer lattice can be embedded into the enemy lattice with this following linking label. So thanks to that, we can actually realize the action of the symmetric group on P as can subgroup of the automortisms of the numeral lattice, which indicated in 24. So thanks to this embedding of lattices, we can realize the symmetry groups as subgroups of Groups as subgroups of M24. So we can do this embedding for different commercial surfaces. Yeah, so now I will give you some examples of that. So for example, let's consider a square commerce surface. So this is a commercial surface, which comes from the following platides. So again, the torrent is a product of two. The toroid is a product of two-dimensional toroids, which looks like this. Okay, so the symmetry group of this has the first part is this residual translational symmetric, which is the same for every commercial surface. And then from the choice of this particular lattice, we get that the remaining symmetries are C2 square. Then we can look at another example of a Hummer surface which is generated by this lattice. So, in this case, the symmetry group is again C2 to the 4, and the remaining symmetries that come from this choice of the lattice is the alternating group A4. So, both of these symmetry groups are very small, so the order is 64 and 192. And 192. So it is not surprising that there are tap groups of 224. But thanks to the embedding of the lattices, the acumeral lattice into the numeral lattice, we get like a geometric interpretation of these embeddings. And because of that, we can combine them. So combining these two symmetry groups, they can be combined into a so-called overarching symmetric group, which is already Arching symmetric group, which is already of a way bigger order. Yes, so this the Z2R default case has been studied extensively by Anne and Catherine. And in our project, in Anne, Catherine, Mara and Ida, we focus on the Z3R default case. So we consider the Z-free R default of the four-dimensional lattice. So we need to So we need to, sorry, of a four-dimensional torus. So we need to pick a torus which has a Z-free symmetry. So the torus is a product of two-dimensional torrent defined by these lattices. So it has an action of C3 and there's actually nine fixed points under the action of the footprint. And the nine resulting singularities in this case happen to be of type A2. So that means that. So that means that in order to minimally resolve them, we have to blow them up to a sum of two CP1s which intersect at a point. So each singularity contributes to CP1 in this case. And the K-free surface, which we obtain by minimally resolving the similarities, is called a Kumar-like surface. Okay, so one of our main results is that for the cummer-like surface, we were also able to describe the integral homology lattice using glowing techniques. So for the cumer-like surface, the integral homology lattice again can be described, can be recovered from these two sub-lattices. K contains the contributions from the sideboards of the underlying forest, and C contains contributions from the flow. And it contains contributions from the blow-up of this nice singularity. Another important result is that we were also able to embed this commercial-like lattice into a numeral lattice, despite the numeral lattice with the following dimension label. And we also were able to rule out that this is the only numeral lattice in which it can be embedded. Okay, so thanks to the tributing, we were able to realize the symmetric group of the cumulative surface as a subgroup of the lattice automorphisms of this numeral lattice. In this case, the automorphisms which permute the components are M12. Okay, so we get this embedding. So again, this group is much smaller than M12, so it is not surprising that. So, it is not surprising that it's a subgroup. However, thanks to this lattice embedding, we have a geometric meaning of that. So, one of the obvious future directions that we would like to study is that it would be very interesting to combine the symmetry groups that come from the ZQ case that was studied by Anukatri, and the symmetry groups that come from the That's the metric groups that come from the Z3 case. So, in the C2R default case, Anne-Kathan arrives at the overarching symmetry group, which is formed, which is a subgroup of M24. So, from the C2 case, we get this embedding of the symmetry group into M12, which is also a subgroup of M24. So, it would be interesting to really combine these symmetries into an even bigger These symmetries into an even bigger overarching symmetry group, and actually, turns out that this is a maximal subgroup of M24, so it would be really nice to add in the symmetries already give us that full concept. Okay, and now connecting with Ida's motivations, it will be even more interesting to realize the symmetry surfing idea on the PDF spectrum of the sigma models with these two targets. Okay, thank you. I have questions? Yes, I do have questions. Just curious. So what is this connection to vertex super algebra or grand? Super algebra of brand of center chart 24 that it just was classified or was forced by Jaro on and motor that it's you know classified. I don't actually know the place that you're referring to and other people probably know so Jura and Mover are saying classify super VOL center shot 24 by the width with the condition that the weight one That they'll weight one. This one. So you have to. No, this is central charge six. So it's still sampled six. And they're working in a case where you virtually don't have a modelized space. So that's why classification gives you such a rich, you know, colorful, I don't know, 400 or whatever models that you have here. So here we are, in some sense, more restricted than we want K3 series from the start. And we have an H-dimensional moduli space, so there's still. An 80-dimensional moduli space, so there's still enough colour in there to take stop. Yeah, I see this.
