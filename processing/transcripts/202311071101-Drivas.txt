Welcome to the last talk at our morning session and it will be given by Peru Davis. He will tell us about irreversible features of the two-dimensional Euler equation. Thank you very much, Boris. Just one second. So I'll be talking about some joint work with Professor Tara Kong Jingi and Jingji Kong. But before I start, I want to say a happy birthday to Gerard and say I'm very grateful to him because, I mean, he was essentially my person to talk to about all these geometric things. All these geometric things, and I feel like it's very generous of these titles. Thank you for that. Okay, so just to begin where essentially everybody's begun, a fluid flow, or an ideal fluid flow, I mean, we'll consider it as one that preserves measure. So you can't take the little volume of fluid and swish it into a smaller space. Into a smaller space. And a flow then is a one-parameter family of measure-preserving diffeomorphisms from some, say, compact space M to itself. Actually, most of the time in this talk, I'm going to be restricting myself to two dimensions and considering annular domains. But for the moment, it is not important. Okay, so this is, let's call this. Let's call the configuration space of fluids measure-preserving diffeomorphisms. I'll just call it du of M. We can put a metric on this space of configurations of fluid using L2 in a product of the tangents. And so this is the standard thing. In particular, you might. Thing. In particular, you measure distances, say between the identity diffeomorphism and phi, which is just the infimum, over all paths in this group such that at time zero, the path is the identity. At time one, the path is phi. And the thing you're taking the infimum of is the cumulative calculus. Is the cumulative kinetic energy along the path. So del two norm of the time derivative ds. So essentially this distance can be thought of as the amount of work that it would take, the amount of energy you have to expend to bring some diffeomorphism back to the identity. So then we can use this to give a definition, which is essentially Give a definition, which is essentially the one that was given by Arnold, of Euler fluid motion. So an Euler flow is, first of all, a path through a group of body-preserving diffomorphisms. Such that that path is a critical point of this distance functional among all paths with equal endpoints to their given one. I use equal point of the distance such that the other paths considered at time zero at five. At time zero and phi at time zero and at time one or or phi at time whatever. Do we have square in the integral? No, it actually doesn't matter. So square would be the kinetic energy, which I said, but the critical points are the same, of the distance and putting the square there. But the parameter could change. Well, okay, but on the critical point, it's a constant parameter, so the energy doesn't change. So I think. Doesn't change. So, this is geodesic motion on the group of volume-preserving picomorphisms. How does the optimetric? And in particular, if you drop the volume-preserving constraint, then the Euler-Lagrange equations would just read that the acceleration of your path is zero. This is the invisibility. Is zero. This is the inviscid Bergers equation. And Euler is just that the acceleration of this path is the gradient of some function composed with your state. This is Euler. And this gradient of the function is just the minimal force required to keep you measure-preserving whatever your state happens to be. Okay, so I'm not going to speak too much about the Eulerian formulation of the equations, but just to connect it, if you introduce the velocity vector field, which is the time derivative of the flow composed of the inverse, then that object satisfies the usual flow level. This divergence frequency And in particular, there are some special properties of this vector field, which in dimension two, which is where I'm going to mainly work, if you look at the curl of u, the vorticity, then at every time t, it's on the orbit of the initial data. In particular, it's the initial vorticity composed at the inverse. Morticity composed at the inverse level at that time. We'll come back to these things at the end of the talk. So the question that I'd like to discuss generally are: what are the characteristics of these equations for large data and for large times? Okay, so large data. Large data and time behavior. And in particular, I'm going to focus on form of Lagrangian stability. Lagrangian meaning that it's dealing with flow maps. So if a vector, if the velocity generating a flow is Generating a flow is close to some given one. Is the flow map generated by that velocity close to the one generated by the given one? The answer to this question, depending on how you ask it, can be never or sometimes. Actually, Gerard worked on a form of this conjugate point business that's related to Point business is related to sort of a transient form of Lagrangian stability, which is extremely interesting. I'm going to be talking about a weaker notion of stability that holds for all time. And really, it's a stability of some qualitative feature of the flow rather than any proximity of the flows in particular. Okay. So So before I get into what the particular statement is, I want to return to this distance and describe some of its properties. In particular, you can use it to introduce a diameter of the volume-preserving diffeomorphism group, say of a compact manifold, which is just the supremum overall paths. All paths of the overall configurations of the distance between the identity and that configuration. And there are some remarkable results about this object. In particular, if M is 2D, it was conjectured by Schnierlman and then proved by Lyashberg and Ratu. By Liasberg and Ratu, that the diameter is infinite. And if M is 3D and simply connected or higher, that Schneerlman proved that it's final. And the way, at least, I think about this result is that, and I'll explain this very shortly. And I'll explain this very shortly. Getting far in the diffeomorphism group, so having infinite diameter means you can get arbitrarily far. That's a measure of the complexity of your diffeomorphism. In 2D, diffeomorphisms can become arbitrarily complex. In 3D, not so, because no matter where you get to, no matter how much effort you took to get there, there's always a path that returns you to where you started with a finite amount of energy. With a finite amount of energy in time one. So, in a sense, it says 3D states are less complex than they can be in 2D. These are some cartoon statement. Okay. So, what's this complexity thing? So, there was a beautiful open problem paper by Boris, Gerrard, and Schneerelman. Came out in Europe two ago, something like that. Where they introduced a certain notion of complexity for a dipomorphism, C of phi, which is just the Limsup epsilon to zero of epsilon m epsilon phi. Okay, so what is m epsilon phi? Any diffeomorphism, it turns out, can be written as a composition of time one flows of Euler starting with velocity fields whose initial Sobolev norm, Sobolev high enough, is less than or equal to epsilon. And n epsilon is the minimal number of those that you require to You require to make up your diffeomorphism phi. And then this complexity is just telling you how that number scales with epsilon, so as epsilon goes to zero. So how many building blocks you need to build your particular different morphosis. And a very simple lemma is that the complexity of phi is bounded Of phi is bounded below by the L2 distance. So, in particular, if you get far in the group, it means that your diffeomorphism is getting complex in its own sense. It also means other things. For example, it means gradients of the map have to grow. But gradients of the map growing don't imply the distance. For example, you could have some sort of Some sort of pinching of a single point in space leading to gradients of the flow map in L infinity growing to infinity. That can happen all while staying in some bounded neighborhood of the identity in this L2 distance sense. So distance getting large is a much stronger condition than some irregularities of the flow appearing. And really, as I'll try to explain today, this distance Explain today, this distance thing is related to twisting up of the space. So if the fluid is undergoing some real twisting, then distance grows. And as such, in order to describe a twisted state, you need many, many building blocks. The more distant it becomes, the more building blocks you need. And so that's the intuition for why complexity is growing. Moreover, you can't get back to the identity in any efficient way other than Efficient way other than to undo whatever twisting you did. So it takes just as long. There's no shortcut. That's a question. So I could just clarify, the etas are solutions of the Euler equation. Yeah, this is the time-worn solution of Euler starting from an initial velocity with small sub-electronic. And each one has their own. So Sir Vick, can you give me a comment why this implies the lower bound of the dist by the distance? Of the disk by the distance. I mean, maybe I'll save it till after the talk, but it's a very short, like one line here. A couple things more about the intuition for this distance. If you're on the disk, say m is the disk, then you could take the vector field x per, which is just solid body rotation of the disk. Disk that starts at the identity. If you start at the identity and flow with that, then of course you come back to the identity after some period. And so the distance grows and then decreases. Okay, so you can have flow maps for which the distance doesn't grow at all, the clicks it doesn't grow at all. But if you consider instead some function of the Function of the distance to the origin times x part, this is non-constant, then the period of revolution of, say, this streamline exceeds the one of that streamline, say. And so if you put a little line connecting these two, then over time, you find that this line is growing in height. It's twisting up space. In that case, the distance does grow. And in fact, this is the picture that Ely Ashberg and Ratu used. Ashberg and Ratu used to show this distance goes to infinity, together with an argument about certain invariant on the group of diffeomorphisms related to this twisting called Calabi. Okay, so all of this motivates certain definition. So let's define unbounded distortion. So we'll say that a flow, namely a path of Erica value preserving diffimorphisms, becomes unbearable. Unboundedly distorted if the distance between the thing, that state, and the identity goes to infinity as time goes to infinity. In particular, this means that the state is becoming more complex. And I've dealt along with other things. The theorem The theorem I'd like to eventually present is that in a neighborhood of certain stable, Eulerian stable steady states of Euler, you could think of them as shear flows on a periodic channel or circular flows on a disk with non-constant period. And in fact, it applies to any annular domain, doesn't have to be symmetric like that. For that entire class of state. For that entire class of stable Eulerian steady states, for which there's many, all the nearby solutions of Euler have this unbounded distortion property. And moreover, that has many implications, even for the Eulerian picture, having to do with, via this formula, filamentation of vorticity and other Eulerian properties like wandering and phase space with vorticity. And phase space with vorticity and so on that were discussed before. So the rest of the talk will be devoted only to domains, like annular domains like that. And in particular, I'm going to work on the periodic channel. So let's say M is the torus cross zero. Cross 0, 1. So here's my torus. Here's 1, 0. These are solid boundaries. These dashed ones are periodic. And I've drawn it long like this because in order to discuss this distance, I'm going to talk about lifted dynamics on the universal cover of the torus. So we just have copies. This is the fundamental domain. Okay. So the first lemma connects separating, so what happens if you take the fundamental domain and you move it by a shear flow? Say sine of y, something like that. Of why, something like that. Well, this piece in the domain is going to go that way, this piece is going to go that way. Of course, if you map everything back to the original torus, it's going to become striped. But that striping is just described as moving far on the universal cover of the fundamental domain. And so there's a very simple lemma which relates how a bipeomorphism moves masses and the fundamental. Of moves masses and the fundamental domain to get a large distance. So lemma so consider a path, there would be a few morphisms on M that M and consider the And consider the unique lift of that pet to the universal cover that satisfies that it maps at time zero m to f. So you fix the location of the fundamental domain. And now say you have two positive measure sets, A T and B T. And Bt, whose measure is bigger than some constant independent of t. And these are contained in the image of the fundamental domain by the lifted flow. So contained in that set. Then the distance Of the original flow map to the identity is equal to, or is bounded below by some constant times the Euclidean distance as sets of, sorry, the Euclidean distance as sets on the universal cover of A and B up to, say, some 2 pi. Say some 2π, the diameter, the horizontal diameter of the domain. So, in particular, if you're in a setting where you have some mass here, this is like A of T, and you have some mass here, this is B of T. And all of this came from moving the fundamental domain over time. This one is going this way, this one is going this way. If you're in that situation, then In that situation, then just by getting far on the cover, you're getting far in the different models of the group. It's going to be some to the proof of this. You measure the energy you expend along your path. Now, that's the Now, that's the same as the energy expended on the lifted dynamics because you don't change the tangent vector when you lift. But now the L2 is still over the fundamental domain. But then by some triangle inequality, this is lower bounded by L1. Bring the absolute values outside and just do L1. L1. This is a total derivative, so this is just L1 of the state at time 1, say, minus the state at time 0, which is the identity. And that, in particular, just the distance now as maps. Just to distance now as maps of the lifted flow at time one. That in particular is bounded below by how far that map took these sets A and B. This is bounded by this constant times the distance between A and B minus some 2π. Okay, so it's just that simple. So what this says is if you separate two positive measures. If you separate two positive measure sets of time indefinitely, you get indefinitely far in the diffeomorphism group. Okay, so what's the theorem? So this theorem is, we could call it global We could call that global stability of twisting. So suppose that you have a given velocity field, u star, which is, let's just say, of shear type. This is actually not essential. So it's, I'm working on the channel, and it's some function whose height determines the, well, it's always. Determines the, well, it's always moving down the channel, and the height determines the speed. So, suppose you have some velocity like that, where the derivative of the shear is not equal to zero. And moreover, that you have a velocity field u given by the symplectic gradient of the stream function c on that domain such that Such that in L2 you're close to this shear flow. Then a couple of statements. So the first statement is that the first component of the flow map times some function. Some function of the second component, this function, let's say your shear flow has y1 and y2, where the velocities are different. This function localizes you to, say, a neighborhood of y1. So the first component of the flow map, lifted, generated by this velocity here, this is equal to the shear. is equal to the shear velocity at y1 times t plus an epsilon t correction. And if you localize around a different line, y2, which has a different period, this is now v of y2 plus epsilon t. It's the same statement. The left-hand side is saying the following thing. It's asking, Saying the following thing. It's asking: in the universal cover, is the lifted flow, where are the particles located horizontally if at that time they can be found in a small neighborhood of this streamline, of the background velocity. This is saying the same thing, asking where are they if they're in a neighborhood of that streamline. And what the theorem says is that they're close to where they would have been if you were just moving things by the shear flow. Just moving things by the shear flow up to some epsilon t correction. And the point is that this statement actually doesn't require that you're globally close to a shear. Away from this region, it could do anything. U is not stationary. It could do anything also. It's non-autonomous. As long as it's close in L2, which is sort of rather weak topology, it says that on the cover, things are moving roughly like the background shear moves down. And as a result, You immediately, because of this lemma, will tell that diffeomorphism is getting far in this distance sense. How much time do I have? Fifteen minutes. Okay, it's gone. No, no, not a bike in the soul. So, another consequence. So another consequence of the proof is that the gradient of the flow map for any of these things grows in L1, at least linearly in time. And I'll try to explain the proof in a minute or something, but let me first say some implications of it. This stability, I mean, this proximity of the velocity field to a given one, this is implied by an even stronger form of stability, Arnold stability, which applies at the level of a derivative. Which applies at the level of a derivative of this, actually, for the vorticity in L2. And things like shear flows, convex shear flows, Poisson, these type of things are Eulerians to built the stable at the level of vorticity, and so they provide examples, like nearby solutions to them, provide examples of exactly such non-autonomous velocity field that satisfy these hypotheses. There's an infinite dimensional family of such stable steady states, they exist off. It doesn't matter. Stable steady states, they exist up. It doesn't matter if they're down here being symmetric, they're always there. And generically, they have the property that the period of revolution on your streamlines is non-constant. So essentially, near any armed stable steady state on any annular domain, nearby flow maps become arbitrarily complex. Some consequences of that is that generic vorticity undergoes indefinite. Undergoes indefinite filamentation. So, in particular, in C alpha, you put a bound below like T to the alpha. You also have wandering, so nearby any Arnold stable steady state, there's a vorticity function such that an L infinity neighborhood of that vorticity function leaves that same neighborhood for all later time if you flow it by Euler. So that's one. By Euler. So that's wandering statement. And also, we give examples using this vortex patch, which is nearly circular, so it's a perturbation of a stable vortex patch, a Rankin vortex. It has some tendrils, tiny tendrils, and little bubbles out here. These are all small. Most of the mass is here. These are all like hollow. Kind of funny thing. But the point is that the perimeter of this patch grows at least like t as time goes to infinity. So all of these are applications of this Lagrangian twisting stability. And I guess I don't really have time to give you the proof, but it's really simple. I mean, the point is, you just consider this function. Let me just maybe say two words about it. So you consider this function. So you consider this function, lambda of t, the lifted first component, the localized second component, and you differentiate it in time. And when you differentiate, you get two terms. One term hits the first component, you get the velocity of phi 1. But the velocity is a periodic function. In particular, you can bring everything. Particular, you can bring everything back to the fundamental domain and replace these tildes by the original diffeomorphism. So that contribution turns out to be exactly something that's close to this term, according to our hypotheses. This term is coming from when the derivative hits there. The dangerous term, that's that term, the dangerous term is when the derivative hits The F. Why is this dangerous? Because if you integrate, if you now change variables, that term becomes the image of the fundamental domain in the universal cover of x1 u2 x1 x2 f prime of x2. Of x2, dx1, dx2. I want to show that this term is small, because I want to say that the dynamics is close to the shear flow. That's going to be my order epsilon term. Why is it dangerous? Well, my fundamental domain is getting really far on the cover. It's really stretching out. And here I have x1, the location of where that domain is. And so, in principle, this could accrue huge errors. But for a topological reason, it turns out there's a lot of cancellation here. Of cancellation here, and you end up bounding it just by something even weaker than recommending an L2. Okay, but I'll leave it there. Thanks. Nice talk, but so the U prime not equal to zero, of course, rules out Couette flow. No, no, no, no. Couette flow. No, no, no, no. Couette flow is okay. Couette flow is linear, so. Well, I mean the quadweight flow. Yeah. No, no, no, sorry. I didn't mean not equal to zero everywhere is all I need. Just that there's a region where the derivative is not zero. It can have critical points. I don't care about that. Yeah, because that's a. Yeah, no, no. If you look at the particle orbits, this is a very interesting case because that amounts to Moser's twist condition. Exactly. And it turns out that if you violate Moser's twist condition, It turns out that if you violate Moser's twist condition, there are all sorts of, you lose the Poincaré-Birkhoff theorem, and all sorts of things happen. And there's a whole phenomenology of how a narrative torrent break in that kind of assumption at that particular point. And this was worked out by Delkus, Deal, Green, and some other guidance. Yeah, thank you for the comment. Yeah, so I'm wondering if that plays into this picture in any way. Because it turns out that the invariant tori. The invariant tori, the shearless invariant tori, are very hard to break. They're resilient to strong perturbations. Exactly. So in fact, I didn't say this, but we have another result about Arnold's diffusion. So we say that basically this result is saying that if you look at the horizontal component, you look like the shear perturbatively. But if you look now at where the particles go up and down, say we want to see how long it takes a particle to go from here. To see how long it takes a particle to go from here to here, then because of this type of rigidity you're talking about, it takes logarithmically long. So there's like this. So we also have a statement like that for vertical rotation of particles is related to that. Yeah, so that's a very important transport issue. Can you hear me? Yes. Oh, thank you. So uh is um something similar. Something similar true, like your result here, which is in the 2D case, right? For a swirl-free axisymmetric QV? I think so. I think it should be. What kind of picture of the flow that we imagine in the neighborhood of such swirl-free isymmetric flows? What's happening? In terms of What's happening in terms of the complexity? I would say, I mean, my picture of it is sort of no different with the 2D case. In the sense things get twisted up, it becomes complex. I haven't thought deeply about it, so I can't really comment too much. But generally speaking, the properties of the different members of groups seem parallel in the axis of metric no-squirrel case. Yeah, but you see, if you take a representation in, say, one functional to the swirl freedom. Through the off to the swell 3 or something like this, away from swell 3. Oh, yeah, and then that then breaks it, yeah. So I would only maintain those conditions. So Mike, just one more question. It's any thoughts on the... So you mentioned Arnold's criterion, right? We know that Arnold's criterion is related to healthcare funds. Yeah. I mean, we have. I mean, we have an explicit expression for this. These have no conjugate points, the shear flow is. Correct. Any thoughts on possible role from conjugate points in this case? That's a good question. To be honest, I don't off the top of my head. So far, they're not sort of conceptually. So far, they're not sort of conceptually connected for me, but I would like to think of a nice question. I'd just like to comment that in principle, if you have the axisymmetric flow, then you could actually untwist it via not axisymmetric, and it would be a finite diameter. This would be a short path. Absolutely, I think it would be a kind of different type of result in that case. Yeah, uh my statement was only if you maintain the fact that all the velocities when you perturb keep axis symmetrical as well, in which case it's uh all the same curves. More slow, in which case it's all the same course. Yeah, when you break it, it's all gone. So, you have you mentioned that if you have a rigid location, then obviously the distance to identity remains bounded. Are there any other 2D examples about that? I think no. So, I would conjecture, and I think it really should be, that for all Euler solutions except for those that return to the identity, which are like periodic Lagrangian flow, they all get arbitrarily far in terms of. Get arbitrarily far in terms of distance. I don't even know any other periodic ones. I mean, no. I mean, you could, well, for any domain close to the disk, say, there is a periodic or there's solution that does that. There's a theorem that says that. But then, more generally, I don't know. But far from the disk, I don't know if those even exist. There are flows like, by the way, I should say this: like, if you're on the Taurus, There's a funny point here. Consider sine y. Okay, that doesn't have that property. But if you add a small perturbation up epsilon, add a small vertical velocity to this, that's adding a mean flow. Now the flow map is time periodic because you've pushed. So in fact, the period is something like one over epsilon. A particle here, it gets really far here, but then it experiences. Really far here, but then it experiences when it goes on the other side the reverse. It's periodic. This type of perturbation is not allowed by our theorem. We're looking only for these kind of, but if you, so there are fluid flows that have that property, but I think they're very special. They're all essentially the same example. And at least in the neighborhood of stable, steady states, everything goes far. But other than that, I don't know. So, I mean it's a bit related to this. So, you like the lemma gave you a nice lower bound for the geodesic distance. Do you have any kind of nice upper bounds of such a path at least for that at some point and I didn't find a good upper bound? Yeah, because I would I mean moreover, I would expect that things really behave linear in time in the neighborhood of these shears. You don't get Time and then they're going to be shears. You don't get much faster. You don't have like an exponential. I don't know, but I expect the distance to really be linear.
