Well, we can see you're very quiet. Once again. And being we cannot really hear you. You need to do something with your microphone. How about this? It's better. Okay. Okay. Once again, hello everyone. I would like to express my gratitude also to the organizer of this workshop and this special. And this special session. It's a very great event. I really enjoyed it so much. So, in my talk today, I will be focused on the dimension dependence in the Log-Soberlev inequalities on isotropic heising groups. So, to start with, I would still recall some classic results on Rn, as we have already seen in several talks before. The log server left inequality on Rn. The Log-Sovolev inequality on Rn has a dimension independence constant C. But note here, the measure we choose is the Gaussian measure on Rn and the choice of the measure really influences the dimension independence of the constant. And also in some in this case, the generator is the elliptic operator, Laplacian. Operator Laplacian Rm. What's more, in general, curved Riemannian spaces, the constant itself also depends on the Richelauer bound. So now let's turn to our setting, a simplest non-trivial example of the hyperelliptic settings, non-isotropic Heisenberg groups, Hn omega. Hn omega can be identified with R2n plus one. R2n plus one equipped with a non-commutative law, while you take the first two n copies of R still commutative with the Euclidean law and make the last copy of R1 non-commutative by taking a symplectic bilinear form omega on R2n. And linear algebra tells us we can write this omega out explicitly as a sum. A sum of n different symplectic bilinear forms on R2. So actually what you can see here is that inside the parenthesis, this is just a standard symplectic bilinear form on R2. And alpha i is a non-positive, non-negative real numbers. So this means the simplicity. Symplectic form omega can be characterized by all such n different alpha i's. And when all those alpha i's are equal to one, this is what we call a standard Heisman group, as we also see from several talks before. So actually in our setting, what we are considering is a family of non-isotropic isomer groups labeled by this symplectic form. By this symplectic form, omega. And again, you can take left-invariant vector fields x, i, omega, y, omega, and z on this Lie group. Then, the only non-zero Lie bracket is the Lie bracket between orders xi omega and yi omega. This means at every point on this Lie group, the tangent space can be generated by all those xi omega and yi omega. all those x i omega and y i omega under their r brackets so homonous condition is also satisfied in this non-isotropic case the consequence is that when you consider this operator sub-Laplacian that's the sum of the squares of all those xi omega and yi omega this operator is again hypoelliptic that means we are actually considering a We are actually considering a situation much weaker than the classic elliptic case. One more small remark. As in the standard case, the non-isotropic Heisenberg group also has a natural sub-Riemannian structure. What it means for sub-Riemannian is that at every point on your group, we will just take a look at a subspace of the tangent space. In this concrete setting, this subspace is... Concrete setting: This subspace is just spanned by vector fields xi omega and y omega. The metric is equipped on this subspace. And similarly, this Hn omega can also be considered as the zero curvature case in sub-Riemannian geometry. So now with all those structures defined, it's natural to consider a hypoelectic log. Consider a hypoelectic log-servoletic inequality of a very similar form as in Rn. So, still, we want the entropy is bounded by a constant times the feature information in this case. But here, we choose the heat kernel measure whose rather nicotine derivative with respect to the hard measure is the heat kernel for that sub-Laplacian. And these are. And this measure can be regarded as an analog of the Gaussian measure on Rn. So now we will ask ourselves, does such a Log-Sobolev inequality still hold? If it does, is the constant capital C of omega nt still independent of the dimension as in the elliptic case? A lot of people have done People have done a lot of interesting work in this setting. Here are just some selected works that are more relevant, but most of them are actually in the standard Heisma group case. The first, second, and fourth result I listed here, they used the hit kernel measure, and the third one chose the hard measure instead. The harm measure instead. However, not so much has been known about the dimension dependence of the constant, even in the standard case, let alone the non-isotropic case. And that's what we have studied so far. So we showed that the non-isotropic Heisman group Hn omega does satisfy a Loch-Sobolev inequality. Life inequality. Also, we have studied the independence of this constant capital C of omega and t and its independence or dependence on the symplectic bilinear form omega. From what we know before, it seems that we need to track the dependence of this constant on all those n different alpha i's. But fortunately, But fortunately, in this concrete case, we can choose the constant to be the same constant to be the same Loch-Sovolev constant on the three-dimensional standard isomer group. So this means your Log-Sovolev constant actually can get rid of the information on the omega and N as well. You don't see any omega or any M. Omega or any m. And what's more, you can make actually the constant explicit by taking it to be the time t multiplied by the constant in the driver melture gradient estimate little c of omega zero squared. So from all this above, we can show that the Locksoberlev constant in this setting. Sober left constant in this setting is indeed independent of both the symplectic form omega and of the dimension as well. So let me mention briefly about the idea of the proof. Our argument basically relies on the cancerization techniques in the sub Riemannia setting. So still, we will restrict n to be equal to one and just And just look on H1 omega. Omega is a symplectic form on R2. To do so, we can compare the three-dimensional non-isotropic Heisenberg group, H1, omega, and the standard three-dimensional Heisenberg groups, H1, omega, 0. And this enables us to show that actually, when n equals 1, the log-soberlev constant on H The Log-Sorbolev constant on H1 omega can be taken as the same as the constant on H1 omega 0, the standard case. So when n equals 1, you don't see the influence of the symplectic form already. And also, Hong Chen Li in 2006 tells us in the standard case, you can make the constant itself explicit by itself explicit by taking little c omega zero squared times t and actually the comparison can be done by building such a Lie group isomorphism between H1 omega 0 and H1 omega you just scale the Z direction by the alpha that appeared in your group law the second step is to consider the To consider the cancerization of log subolefnic colours in this setting. So you consider a product of n copies of different three-dimensional non-isotropic Heisenberg groups. You can take all those omega to be different. It's fine. So the tensorial property of log-sobolev inequality enables us to track the dependence of the constant. Dependence of the constant on the product group. And again, in this concrete setting, the Luxovolev constant on the product group will remain the same as the one on the three-dimensional standard Heisenberg group. So already here on the product group, you don't see any information on the parameter n or all those symplectic forms, omega j's. Omega j's and finally we will connect the product group with the non-isotropic ismbo groups H and omega by taking a lifting map from AJ Fraser in 2001. So this map pi actually enables us to identify the to identify at every point of this group the The horizontal space as a product space of n copies like this. And finally, this map can push the Log-Soberlev inequality on the product group to the Hn omega with the same constant preserved. Now, by putting everything together, you realize the constant the log sober. the constant the log-sobolev constant on h and omega will be the same as the log-sobolev constant on three-dimensional standard isomber group so that means um omega is gone and n is gone in this case and this tells us the independence of the constant of both the omega and the dimension Dimension. And finally, here are some further directions we would like to consider. So we will extend to some more general bilinear forms, omega. And what I listed here are three examples. Thank you very much.
