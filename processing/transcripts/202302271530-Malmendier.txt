I wanted to thank the organizers for putting together such a nice conference. Really excited for the upcoming week. Also, want to thank for giving me the opportunity to talk. I want to talk about some work on two elementary K3 surfaces and how they provide a mathematical framework to understand some of the geometric. Understand some of the geometric aspects underlying string dualities. The talk will be based on some completed joint work with Adrian and also some ongoing joint work with Adrian Klinger and Sadi Oro. All right, I want to start with a motivational example that might give you an idea of what we were trying to do. So consider algebraic K3 surface, complex algebraic K3 surfaces. Algebraic K3 surface with the neon-several letters H plus E8 plus E8, where H is the rank two neonimodular letters and E8 is the E8 letters, then it's well known that X emits a geodienosis structure, that is, a symplectic fixed point free involution, such that the minimal resolution of the quotient is isomorphic to the Kuma surface associated with two elliptic curves. It's also well. Occurs. It's also well known that these K3 surfaces admit by rational models as quadrative hypersurfaces here written in homogeneous coordinates X, Y, Z, W and with two parameters A and B. This quadratic is known as innocent quadric. And due to the work of Schioda and Klinger and Turin, we also can give precisely the relation between those parameters A and B. Between those parameters A and B and the moduli of the elliptic curves. What is also well known is that the general member of this family has an automorphism group of 0 by 2 squared. Now, you can look at the classification by Nikulin and Winberg of lattices for K3s such that the general automorphism group is finite, and you can look at condos work. And you can look at Kondo's work who computed those automorphism groups. And you can ask: can you give me a list of all the lattices L such that the general L polarized K3 has automorphism group Z for 2 squared? And it's a short list. It's a short list of 11 lattices that starts with the lattice that I just talked about, H plus E8 plus E8. In rank 10, you have two lattices. H plus N is N is the rank 10 lettuce, where n is the including lattice, and then one lattice in rank 9. You can check that all those lattices are two-elementary, meaning the discriminant group of those lattices, of each of those lattices, is a finite two-elementary abelian group. And I denote the minimal number of generators for the discriminant group by script L, the discriminatory. Now, the result I want to talk about is the following. If for a moment I take out the last two lattices in the list, what you can produce is a family of projective moment forms, really generalizing the inner state quadric that I showed you on the first slide, such that every L-polar rise K3 is isomorphic to. Isomorphic to one of those quadrics. And if you actually want to develop some normal forms for all the lattices, you will see that in those cases of PCAR rank bigger than 10, those projective normal forms are really closely connected to certain double sextics. And the notion of a normal form double sexting actually generalizes to all the lattices. System. And a part of that I actually want to explain to you today. But to make maybe the exposition a little easier, I want to take out the last three lattices. I actually only want to look at the lattices of rank bigger or equal 11. And then we have a little bit more structure. The structure that we then have is that those lattices from the list with rank bigger or equal to 11, we all are isolated. 11, they all are isometric to H plus K, where K is of ADE type. And that will be most important for us, and I'll explain it as we go along, those lattices admit a canonical lattice embedded of H plus N into the lattice. And from that information, you can, in a very nice form, construct those projective normal forms and exactly explain when two of those K3s are isolated. Two of those K3s are isomorphic. And if I get to it in the end, I also want to show that this rich geometric structure is exactly what seems to be needed to describe some geometric aspects underlying dualities in string theory. So the setting of the talk will be the usual, we are considering complex algebraic K3 surfaces, and we will consider families. And we will consider families, in those cases, trees, polarized by an even hyperbolic lattice of rank R. For us, this rank R, as I say, said, will vary between 11 and 18. And it is well known that those families of lattice polarized K3s admit porous moduli spaces of dimension 20 minus R, where R is the rank of the polarizing lattice. The polarizing lattice. You can also construct classifying spaces for the periods from Hermitian symmetric space of type 4. And the period map provides an analytic isomorphism between the cross-moduli space and those period domains. Now, I want to start with two very basic polarizations that will play a recurring role throughout this talk. First, I want to talk about First, I want to talk about the very simple case of an H polarization, a polarization by the hyperbolic rank II lattice. And it's known that an H polarization is equivalent to the existence of the Jacobian elliptic fibration with section on the K3. So you can think of the K3 as an elliptically fibered K3 with section, just as we saw in the previous. In the previous very nice talk. Now, the other case that I want to look at is the case of a polarization by the rank 10 lattice, H plus N, where H is the hyperbolic rank 2 lattice and N is the nicouling lattice, the rank 8 negative definite lattice generated by 8. Generated by eight disjoint minus two curves, one additional curve that has intersection minus one with each of them. And this situation was famously studied by van Giemen and Sarke. And here it is known that the presence of an H polarization gives you more than just a Jacobian elliptic vibration. It actually gives you a Jacobian elliptic vibration plus an additional section of order two. Section of order 2. If you want, what that means is you can rewrite the Weierstrass equation in that form which makes the existence of the two-torsion section in each loose fiber apparent. And just a little bit about the nomenclature. So, if we have a Jacobian elliptic vibration corresponding to an H polarization, it is Polarization, it is often referred to as a standard vibration. In the presence of an HN polarization, the Jacobian elliptic vibration with the contrastion section, we often refer to such an elliptic vibration in contrast to the standard vibration as an alternate vibration. Now, the existence of that two-torsion section gives you some very cool geometric structure. Cool geometric structure, it defines for you a canonical symplectic evolution that you always have on your K3 that you obtain from doing translation by two-turging in each news fiber. That canonical symplectic involution coming from the Turgen section is often referred to as fungi-Mansari involution. Now, in the context of the niculine involution that I already mentioned in my Mentioned in my introductory example, you can take the quotient and compute the minimal resolution, and you will get, because this was a Nicoolin involution, another K3. It turns out this K3 is again H plus N polarized, admits an alternate vibration, and now you have this really nice picture of two K3s, both with an H plus N polarization, that are connected. That are connected by dual isogenies. That is often referred to as geometric two-isogeny in contrast to the very well-known elliptic curve picture of two isogeny. Now, this structure of an H plus N polarization and the existence of a Vanguard-Sortian volution in the presence of an alternate vibration is quite important. Is quite important, and honestly, I think the importance in particular for string dualities and understanding string dualities is quite big. So now I want to talk about polarization by higher-ranked lattices, the lattices that appeared on my second slide, the lattices where the K three's, the generic K three's have automorphism group z over two squared. C over 2 squared. But before I do that, I want to talk a little bit more about two elementary lattices. So in the beginning, I mentioned that all those lattices that appeared in my list were two elementary. So let me skip this. Two elementary lattices that primitively embed in the K3 lattice were classified by Newcooling. They are classified by three invariants, two of them you already Variants, two of them you already saw in my talk: the rank of the lattice, the length, the minimal number of generators of the discriminant group, and the third invariant called the parity, which can only be zero or one, which essentially says whether the induced quadratic form of the discriminant group, on the discriminant group, only takes values zero to z or not. Or not. And now you can make a list, Nicole made a list of all the two elementary lattices that appear as K3 lattices based on those invariants. And you get the following picture here, where each point or cross represents one of those two elementary lattices. If you take the black and the blue items, And the blue items, those are actually lattices where the generic K3 admits at least one elliptic vibration resection. And if you take the red and the black dots, those correspond to lattices where the associated K3 has finite automorphism. Now, the lattices I showed you in the beginning, the ones where the automorphism The ones where the automorphism group is 0 by 2 square are exactly the lattices that you get when you go down the diagonal. Well, there's this one exception. This is the H plus N lattice. This is the rank 9 lattice. And what I want to show you is how you can produce birational models for those K3s. But as I said, But as I said, to make it a little bit less messy, I'll only take those points here. Now, as I said, the structure that I'll be using that will be really helpful for us in our construction is the existence of certain elliptic vibrations with sections. So, the important information you now want to know if you are If you are in the realm of lattice polarized K3s, where the lattice is two elementary, let's say where the K3 emits an elliptic vibration with section, and where the output morphism group is finite, what are all the possible different elliptic vibrations with section that you can have? And those have been classified by Gabonati and Zaira. By Gabernati and Saigardo, I show you here the list. I'll explain a little bit more about the list in each case. So, for example, if you pick out the letters, let's say H plus E8 plus 4 copies of A1, here I'm giving you information about the length and the parity. And you see that isometric manifestation of the lattice mean that you can have different standard vibrations. Different standard vibrations, and then you can also have elliptic vibrations where you have non where you have torsion model-Weil group. You see an example here. Because we are in the finite automorphism group case, we can't have elliptic vibrations with section and positive for Del Wayrank. So, those are really all the elliptic vibrations with section, types of elliptic. With section, types of elliptic vibrations with section that you can have. Now, you see for an elliptic vibration, what I specified here is the types of reducible fibers and the torsion model value. This is often called the framing or the frame of the elliptic vibration. But if you analyze elliptic vibrations with section, it's actually much more delicate because you might Delicate because you might also want to know: given a fixed frame of an elliptic vibration, how many different types of that elliptic vibration exist on your K3? In other words, if I consider the complement of my H polarization in my polarizing lattice, is that unique or are there inequivalent ways of embedding the complement in my polarizing lattice? My polarizing lattice, which are not isomorphic by the action of the automorphism. And the machinery to investigate this was carried out by Feski and Vignani. They from the notion of the multiplicity of an elliptic vibration dissection, and that notion carefully investigates essentially the The action of the isometries of the discriminant group, the orthogonal complement of the H-polarization, and how that is acted upon by isometries that are induced by isometries of the lattice and isometries of the transcendental lattice that leave the Hodge decomposition intact. The point is, in all those lattice, The point is, in all those lattices that I showed you between rank 18 and 11 that I want to focus on, it's not only true that there is a unique frame for an alternate vibration, meaning a vibration with Vodelval Z over 2. This alternate vibration is also unique in all those cases. So on all Cases. So on all those lattice polarized K3s, you have a unique alternate vibration, and that's exactly what also happens in the H plus N polarized case. All right, so as you go down the list of finite automorphism group type lattices, you see all of those lattices that I wrote down. Of those lattices that I wrote down here in Picarbank 18, 17, 16, and 15 are lattices where the automorphism group is z over 2z squared. And those are all, in each ring, all the finite automatic, the lattices of finite automorphism type. And then the first point where you actually encounter more than one lattice is rank 14. Rank 14. And this rank is really the case where I want to talk a little bit more about the details. So in this situation, you have three distinct lattices, which I denote P, P prime, P double prime. They are all two elementary, but only two of them, those two, come with an automorphism group of z over two squared. This one, as the generic member has automorphism. The generic member has automorphism group C over 2. Now, this family that I circled in yellow was considered by Winberg really as the restriction of a rank 13, a family polarized by a lattice of rank 13 given by H plus E8 plus A3. So you see that lattice is not even too elementary. And in And in this instance here, he produced family, birational family of projective hypersurfaces. However, if I went down a slide, you can see that in those cases, 14 and 13 here, you do not have an alternate vibration, but you do have actually a unique standard vibration, as I introduced. Standard vibration as I introduced it earlier on. So the construction of Winberg's quartic model can really be carried out in the same way I show you how we produced the quartic surface models for the other cases, except instead of using the alternate vibration, you use the standard vibration. All right, so We are looking at those cases of two elementary lattices where the automorphism group is z over 2 squared. And as I explained to you, in all of those cases, we have a unique alternate vibration. And what that actually means in lattice theoretic terms is that you have canonical lattice. have a canonical lattice embedding of the lattice H plus N into your polarizing lattice. And in turn, that means that the moduli space of those lambda polarized K3s embeds into the bigger moduli space of H plus N polarized K3s. Now we'll use the alternate vibration to construct our quartic projective hypersurface. Hypersurface models. And the uniqueness of the alternate vibration will come in very handy because it will allow us to say exactly when two of those projective hypersurfaces are isomorphic. But this structure that you have that comes from the canonical embedding of H plus N into your lattice, the existence of a von Gehmann-Sorti involution, is extremely useful in particular. Extremely useful, in particular in the realm of string theory. So you see in the H plus n polarized case, if you employ the picture of geometric 2 isogeny, what you get out of your net tooling construction is again an H plus N polarized K3. For those other lattices that I showed you between rank 11 and 18, in most cases that's not the case. You get a K3 of different type. In fact, in the introductory example, In fact, in the introductory example, I showed you the geodienose and its partner that was a Puma of E1 cross E2. So in particular, not of finite automorphism. Now, Idien and I started talking the three surfaces that you get by employing that Van Diemen-Sorty involution in the Nicooling construction, the Van Diemen-Sorty-Nicoling tool. The van Diemen-Sorty-Nikoulin dual. And all of those K3s that we are considering have very nice description in terms of that dual side. All those dual K3 can be represented as double sextics. And maybe from the purpose of understanding the geometric setting for string dualities, those double sextic normal forms are of equal importance. Of equal importance. Okay, so before I tell you more about the rank 14 case, I wanted to comment on the higher rank cases, because a lot of the situations that you encountered there have been studied intensely, mostly by people in the audience, probably. So, I already mentioned the Parrot 18 case, where you have your shield. Case where you have your Shioda innocent and the Kumar of E1 pro C2. This picture was generalized by Kumar and Elkis, Adrian and Chuck Duran in PCA rank 17, where the van Geemen-Sortining cooling dual would be just the Kumar of a Jacobian of a genus two-turf. In rank seventeen, the Van Gehman-Sortining cooling site is actually quite famous. Site is actually quite famous. It's the double sexting that you obtain as a double cover of P2 branched on six general lines in P2. And that four-parameter family was studied in all different aspects by Matsumoto from its geometry, from the point of view of modular forms that describe the period domain. And the quadic projective hypersurface model in this A hypersurface model, in this case, Adrian and my student Thomas Hill and I computed in 2019. But now, what I want to talk about is really this pre-current 14 case, the p-polarized case as I referred to it earlier on. And in this case, the van Giemann-14 cooling dual K3 also has a very beautiful description as double sex. Description as double-sextic, where the branch locus are three congruent lines and a smooth qubit. And what I will show you in this, in the next few slides, is maybe what the family of quadic projective hypersurfaces is, and how, in this case, you can develop modular-like invariant that can serve as coordinates on a weighted projective. Your weight on a weighted projective space that allows you to construct an explicit model for the moduli space. Wanted to point out that Adrian then also completed the case 13, 12, 11, but maybe those equations are not the best to show in a talk. All right, before I go on, I also wanted to mention some other great work that has been done. So often in the context of physics, people ask me, well, People ask me, well, has lattice polarization by other lattices, which might also be interesting in string theory being considered? Lattice polarizations by H plus E plus E6, H plus E7 plus E6. And you see, in those cases, you are not in the two-elementary, leaf-alone finite automotive group case. But nevertheless, there's great work that has been done by Nagano, Ueda, and Shiga. I also wanted to mention I also wanted to mention that Pondo studied a subfamily of the van Gemen-Sarti family, where the K3s admit an additional automorphism of order 4, and Matsumoto and collaborators analyzed the modular forms that are in play in this case. I also want to mention the great work of Xavier, who Xavier, who developed, he called it an atlas of K3 surfaces. So, what he did is he went through the entire Nicole in Winberg list of finite automorphism group lattices and in each instance computed the finite set of minus two curves, the intersection properties, essentially all the data that you might want to know about the neon severity. All right. So let's get started on the P-polarized case. Let me check on the time. As I said, this lattice has four isometric manifestation that correspond to four different kind of standard vibrations. It also has one primitive embedding that corresponds to the unique alternate vibration. Unique alternate vibration, as I said earlier on. And what we then did in this case from the alternate vibration, we constructed an explicit family of quadric projective hypersurfaces. And here it is. So take 10 complex parameters where the last eight satisfy some genericity condition and write down the following quadric again in projective coordinates x, y, z, w. That's X, Y, Z, W. And I circled the module, the parameters of the quadric. And what you can then prove is that this quadrat has only rational double points. It has exactly two singular points. And the minimal resolution gives you a K3 with p-polarization. Now, before we move on, just maybe to make the connection to the introductory. The connection to the introductory slide. I wanted to say if you turn all those pairs of parameters to one zero, you only get two terms from the second line, and the quadric you write down is exactly the innovative I showed you on the first slide. So this is really a multi-parameter, if you like, generalization of the innovative. In this instance, you can actually construct the dual graph of minus Construct the dual graph of minus two curves explicitly. So, as I said, they are two singular points of type A3 and A7. So, the minimal resolution gives you 10 minus two curves. You also find five lines on the quadric. One you see is special because it runs through both singular points and four other ones, and that they are actually five lines. that there are actually five lines and five types of vibration. It's no accident because the pencil of planes through the lines give you the different types of vibration. So those give you five additional minus two curves and then Adrian and I developed a method how we can write down the remaining 12 curves as complete intersection. So all together you get 3 plus 7 plus 5 plus 12 26 Plus 12, 27 minus 2 curves. And those are all minus 2 curves you get. And now from the model, you can actually compute explicitly how they intersect and put it all in a diagram. This is what I did here. That's the dual graph. And you see, the colors are just here so that you can maybe understand the diagram easier. Here, I only put single and double intersections. Double intersections. There are also some multifold intersections that are put separately just to make the picture not too crowded. And now what you can do is you can maybe go back to the elliptic vibrations and embed the reducible fibers into the diagram. Let me maybe just do one. This is how the alternate fibration embeds. Alternate vibration embeds into the dual graph. The orange point nodes correspond to an extended Dinkin diagram of D8. The red, yellow, green, blue correspond to the A1 fibers. And the red dots correspond to the section and the two torsion section. And that picture also now might give you an idea how the van Giemann-Soti involution acts. Involution acts on the dual graph, it acts exactly as a flip symmetry interchanging section and two torsion section. Okay, so now what you can do is, well, because we actually derived that quadric explicitly from the alternate vibration, you can actually see that every p-polarized K3 is by Is by rational to such a tortic hypersurface. But because the alternate vibration is unique, you can do even more. You can say exactly when two of those tortics are isomorphic. And what you see is there are a few discrete symmetries that you can have in the parameters, which give you isomorphic K3s, which essentially come from interchanging pairs of parameters. Pairs of parameters of those last eight parameters. And then you have one continuous scaling symmetry that rescales your parameter with a certain weight. Now, what that means is that you can really compute modular type invariants, invariants that detect just isomorphism classes of P3s. How do you do that? Well, you write down certain Write down certain combinations of those parameters which are invariant under those discrete symmetries and that just scale with a certain weight. So you get those seven parameters and one scaling symmetry, and the number right here denotes the weight of that scaling symmetry. Now you actually see that those parameters Those parameters label points on a weighted projective space. Weighted projective space, because I still have that continuous symmetry that rescales the parameters. And those points in weighted projective space classify those p-polarized K3 up to isomorphism. And if you trace back this genericity condition that I had in the beginning, I had in the beginning, ensuring that your singularities were only rational double points to those invariants. What you get is you get an open variety in that weighted projective space that then really gives you a model for the coarse modular space of those peopleized case space. Where do you have some finite identifications? Have they already been ordered out by the side? Yes, they are. So, see, um, I take combinations here. Let's see. For example, you can interchange the pair C D with the F exactly, and then maybe I got the symmetry wrong. I might just. So, what we did is exactly what you said. We wrote down only combinations which are invariant under those discrete symmetries, and I just must have messed up either with the symmetries or when I wrote down the combinations. I I think maybe just the before is is wrong. I'll double check from our paper. Okay, now let me skip over the van Giemen-Sortini cooling dual. I already mentioned how you can describe as double-sex, describe it as double-sexting. You can now also explain how the lattice polarization extends and recovers. And we covers maybe well-known cases in rank 15 and 16. I just wanted to mention that this procedure that I showed you generalizes also to Pitar rank 13, 12, 11. And in all those cases, you produce a quadratic projective hypersurface with exactly two rational double points. The singularity gets milder and milder. However, the number of rational curves. However, the number of rational curves gets bigger and bigger. And that's why it's so great to have Xavier's independent lattice theoretic check of the number of rational curves and their intersection properties, because that gives us some certainty that we got the picture right. In all of those cases, you can write down a quartic hypersurface that generalizes the That generalizes the innocent quadratic. And maybe the equation I showed you a few slides ago, you weren't able to see it, but all those quadrics arise in a very similar fashion, because the quadratic that I've written down arises like this. It's y squared times a conic equals a quadic in those remaining variables. And actually, if you go down to Picar. Actually, if you go down to Picar rank 11, it's not even a conic, it's actually two lines. And now for such a quadric, if you actually look at the corresponding double sextic, just move the conic part on the other side, you actually can see explicitly how that unique alternate vibration arises, because this quadrature isn't just a general quartic. Just a general cordic, it's actually a cordic with one note, and the pencils of lines through the notes on that double sextic gives you the alternate vibration. Now, you can generalize this picture even further to include that one, two elementary letters of rank 10. And that's work we did with Xavier, and yet again. And yet again, you can write down a normal form as a quartic projective hypersurface, where now this tonic isn't reducible anymore. But in this instance, you still have the situation where you have two rational double points. That was a very special feature of that quadric. And what that means is that in all those instances where you have this quadric, you can actually. This quadratic, you can actually take the projection of your quartic from any from either of those two points, and what you get is a double sexting, just as you maybe have seen in a class for the commercial. And these double sextics are actually quite interesting. For example, one of the double sextics that you get from this projection Projection has a very symmetric and invariant form with respect to the action of the automorphism group itself. And the divisor, whose linear system gives you that double sextic, has very nice properties with respect to the action of the automorphism boo on the dual graph. And what we did then is that. It then is that in terms of that square two divisor that defined that very symmetric, nice double sexting, and the exceptional curves that arise in the resolution of the singular points from which we project it give you a very simple description of the polarizing divisor for the quadric. So in all ranks you can now write down the quadrick, the polarizing divisor. The polarizing divisor, those double sex sticks. And then, as you try to go to those two exceptional cases in rank 9 and the H plus N polarized case itself, such a quadric model doesn't work anymore. The reason is simply, that's a very nice result of Bart, that if you take a double sex stick branched on a Branched on a conic into generic quadric, the exceptional curves of the eight singularities give you an even A. And if you compute the polarizing lattice, it's actually not that rank 9 lattice that was the first lattice on my list. It's a different lattice, it's two elementary, but it's not a lattice where the L polarized K three would have automorphism group Z over two square. Automorphism group z over 2 square. However, this construction of the symmetric double sextic does generalize both to Picaring 9 and to this H plus N polarized case in Picaring 10. And so I hope I explained to you up to this point how we manage to construct those birational quartic hypersurface models for those cases where the For those cases where the automorphism group is zero to squared. Now, when I'm 10 minutes or so, in the remaining 10 minutes, maybe I want to hint at how this rich geometric structure is actually quite useful to explain some puzzling remarks related to K3 surfaces. Related to K3 surfaces that you might have read in the physics literature. All right, so in string theory, and I won't go over the details, there's something called F-theory heterotic duality, one of those crazy string dualities. And in the simplest non-trivial case, what it does is it relates two kinds of physical objects, something which is something which is called heterotic strings on an elliptic curve, and something else which are called F-theory backgrounds. Now with the F-theory backgrounds, it's actually quite straightforward to find a translation into the language that we like. An F-theory background is simply an element of the mH polarized moduli space. It's just a Jacobian elliptic vibration on a K3. Now on that Now, on the halootic side, it's much more difficult to explain what the moduli space of heterotic strings is. But the important thing I want to say is when physicists say duality, what they mean is that the moduli spaces of two objects have, you can construct an analytic isomorphism between them. So, in its basic form, that F-theory. That F-theory heterodic string duality simply says that the moduli space of heterodic strings, whatever that might be, is isomorphic to the moduli space of H-polarized case X. It's a little bit more complicated, of course, but that's kind of the brutally abbreviated version of it. Now, often when you are in such a situation, what you try in physics is go to a situation Go to a situation that encompasses more symmetries in the hope that restricting to some natural subspaces, you might be able to explicitly identify objects on the left and right-hand side. And one of those situations is where you impose on one side, on the heterotic string side, more symmetry or the existence of a certain involution. And just looking by physical. First looking at physical arguments, computing what is called partition functions, you then read: well, in this case, the moduli space of heterodic strings should be isomorphic to the moduli space of H plus E8 V scaled by minus 2 polarized K3 or H plus D4 plus D4 polarized K3s. Now the fact that I write OR already tells you some of those statements. Tells you some of those statements need to be taken with a grain of salt, right? Should be only one. But often, what happens in physics that you fix different kind of additional structure? And as I'll show you, the disambiguity between or the discrepancy between these two can simply be explained by saying what kind of involutions you are looking at. However, on the other side, what However, on the other side, what used to be the modular space of H polarized K3s, you get another prediction. You actually get the prediction that imposing the same kind of symmetry, you should end up with the moduli space of H plus n polarized K3, so exactly the Funge-Sorty film. Now, what I just want to explain to you how, in the context of In the context of those beautiful polarized families of polarized K3s, that discrepancy is easily resolved, and maybe in the very end how the P-polarized family comes into play again. All right, so that discrepancy between that, so first about the moduli space of H plus E8 minus 2 polarized K3s. If you actually look at how those K3s arrive, Those K3s arise, it beautifully matches how they are constructed in Camille and Gabonati, where you take, and I think Elicio referred to it at the end of his talk, you just take double covers of rational elliptic surfaces. And when you do that, in the generic case, you get an H plus E8 minus rescaled by two polarized K three. By two polarized K3. And as I said, that matches actually quite nicely the description on how those moduli, how this moduli space arises in the context of string dualities. Let me move to the other side, the H plus N polarized family. So I'm coming back to that picture of geometric 2-isogeny in the van Giemen-Sorty Van Giemen-Sorty situation. So the fact that we have two H plus N polarized K3s mutually obtained by the Nicoolin construction can also be rephrased in the following way. So on X I have the von Giemann-Sortini-Cooling involution, quotienting and resolving gives me the van Giemann-Sortini-Couling involved. Me the von Giemen-Sortini Boolean portrait. On the other hand, I can also consider a branched double cover of my X branched on an even A that gives me the same H plus N polarized K3, that gives me the dual two isology. And what is the even A that I use to construct this branch double cover? Well, the existence of an alternate vibration means that generic Vibration means that generically I have an elliptic vibration with 8i2 and 8i1s. And if I look at the reducible fiber, you see there's a very natural candidate for an even name. In the reducible fibers, I take exactly the components which are not met by the zero section. So those give me a curves that are even in neon severity. And then if I take the branch double cover, you get a K3. You get a K3. You also see that the branch locus doesn't meet the section. So the pre-image of the section gives you the two sections on the double cover, the new zero section and the new two torsion section. Now, Adrian and I investigate in earlier work some variant of this construction where instead Where instead of taking your even aid to consist of the components in your reducible fiber which are not met by the zero section, often they're called non-neutral components. Instead, you mix up the situation. You take some of the components which are met by the zero section, some of the components which are met by the two torsion section, and because we want the double cover to be a double quadric in P1. double quadric in P1 cross P1, what we actually did is we took four components where you take the neutral components and four components where you take the non-neutral component. You can, that forms an even 8. You can construct the double cover. That gives you a K3. But the K3 is of different type. It's in particular not H plus N polarized. Of course, its Jacobian elliptic surface returns. Klobian elliptic surface returns you the Fangeman-Swairty Nikuel dual, but in the process of taking the double cover, because now both the section and the two torsion section intersect the branch locus, none of the sections lift to the double cover and you get an elliptically fibered K3 without section. When I say elliptically fibered K3 without section, Typically, 5 by K3 without section, what I mean is, of course, with respect to the projection onto one of the P1s. We have two rulings. We constructed a double quadric over P1 cross P1. And one of the rulings, the P1 corresponds to the base of your H plus N polarized case field. And What you can now check is that with respect to projection onto the first P1, that K3 doesn't admit an elliptic vibration, however, without section. But with respect to the other projection, onto the other P1, it does emit sections. And you can easily see that as follows. If you take the pre-image of the section and the two tussian. Of the section and the two torsion section. This corresponds to elements of the smooth fiber class with respect to that second projection. And the pre-images of the eight components in the reducible fiber that were not part of the ET8 actually give you eight pairs of sections with respect to the elliptic vibration that comes from the projection on. That comes from the projection on the second floor. And in this way, you can actually see that what that Z prime is. It's actually an H plus D8 V scale by minus 2 polarized K3. And the data that you fix in physics when you mark one of those H plus N polarized K3s to work out the duality to a CHL stream. Duality to a CHS strip is exactly corresponds exactly to the geometric construction, right? We had the unique alternate fibration. What I actually had to do to construct this non-standard double cover is group the eight fibers of type I2 into groups of four and four, and then construct the double cover, and that gave you an H plus E8 polarized, H plus E8 minus two polarized K3. To polarize K3, and that exactly corresponds to the geometric construction we see. The other point I was saying is that in physics, there is some discrepancy between looking at H plus E8 minus 2 polarized K3s and H plus 2 copies of the 4 polarized K3s is easily explained from what Elite said in her talk. If I consider the double cover of a Consider the double cover of a rational elliptic surface to give me a K3, I have an additional anti-symplectic involution that covers that double cover. Now, if that K3 is also elliptically fibered reception, I can take the composition with my hyperelliptic involution and get a symplectic involution, use the Nicouling construction, and that exactly gives me the family of H plus 2. Family of H plus two copies of the four polar by scales. So this framework of taking double covers, maybe with non-standard even aids, looking at the number of anti-symplectic and symplectic involutions that you have, matches exactly the construction of the CHL F-theory duality that you find in physics. Also, if you ask yourself what is actually Ask yourself what is actually needed to go back, let's say, from such a bipolarized K3 to a double quadrat model of my H plus and polarized K3s. What you are trying to fix is you try to build from an elliptically fibered K3 with section, elliptically fibered fibration without section, whose transcendental lattice is an index two. Lattice is an index 2 sub-lattice of y. And what is needed to fix such data is pairs of elements of a certain Brouwer group. And interestingly, that's exactly what people use in physics when they try to construct that map from CHL back to F. Last minute, I wanted to say the following. This was in P carming 10, right? H plus H. 10, right? H plus n polarized, h plus e8 minus 2 polarized. You could go even further and try to look at the picture with even more symmetry. What does even more symmetry mean? Even more symmetry means, for example, that you have an additional commuting anti-symplectic involution on your Y, or, in terms of X, that you have a second Vungeman-Sorting involution acting on that. 14 involution acting on X. If you do that, the rank jumps up to 14. You get certain families of lattice polarized K3s. And the family that pops up here in place of the Y is the family of H plus 3 copies of the four polarized K3s. That's exactly the van Gemin-Sortimi-Pooling dual family of the P polarized family that we constructed as quadric hypersones. Constructed as quadratic hypotheses. And in this way, kind of a sequence of dualities that you have observed in physics, predicted in physics, coming from p-polarized K3s, going through CHL strings, returning to certain F-theoretic backgrounds. We actually see the geometric underpinning. It's that beautiful picture of K3 surfaces emitting alternate vibrations and some Given-Saulting contributions. And some even starting contributions. Thank you. Other questions? Going back to your following with the set two by set two symmetry, you said in each case you have a canonical description, a canonical presentation of these surfaces. Of these spaces for rank big or equal in every. So that presumably means that all these modules bases are unknown. Yes, that's actually one of the consequences. And there are a few cases where that wasn't known. So it was actually Xavier who alerted us to the fact that between rank 11 and 18, there are some cases where it wasn't known that. Cases where it wasn't known that the modular spaces were unirational, and that kind of follows as a problem. In some cases, you actually prove rationality because of somebody projected space. Well, I'm if it's an open subscription if you projected space. Okay. I think you're right. I've just very okay, so leave but rationality is not something you consider. We haven't considered that. We haven't considered that. We were just as a croollary obtaining that those modular space are universal. So a long time ago, you had a picture of, or we talked about, what was it, 27 minus 2 curves, minus 2 curves in how many dimensions? So that was the dual graph of the minus 2. Of the minus two curves. So I guess my question is: the reflections in those generate all the isometries in the lattice, or is there something else about them that's making one more person to be quite so the group of automorphism for K3 polarized by the lattice is z over two square and you can write down explicitly the generators and how Explicitly the generators and how they act. And the action of one of the generators I showed you, that was the flip symmetry V. Yeah, but so what I'm saying is the isometries on the lattice is some sort of compute group, right? And I'm wondering whether it's generated by reflections in those minus two curves. Is that enough? So a different way of asking it is: do the minus two curves produce planes that are? That are form a part metric. I think you're asking which of these lattices are reflected. That's another way to ask. I think there is a classification. So if you have two H plus V A plus one plus minus two, you've got certain group effects. But I think the reflections don't generate the entire group, but that they generate the up to finite groups. TMAT2 is the finite index thing. And then the CMAT cap. Yeah, Zimat2 squared, excuse me. I think that's act. That's pretty much the acting on your graph, right? The Z2 square, yes. Yes, exactly. And one of the actions I showed you, that's the flip side. Yes, I think that's, I'm not sure whether this answers your question. It's a famous theorem that automorphisms on K3s can be understood as automorphisms of the neon several. Automorphisms of the neon several lattice modular reflections. So you have the Hetroi heterotic duality, right? And F-3 CHL heterotic duality. I didn't understand like how much should be expected in this kind of duality between multiple spaces. Is this like an isomorphism of Spaces is this like an isomorphism locally or completely globally for these things? And what additional does one now osprey geometrically about those? So all I was saying is how generic objects of those polarized K3s are related to one another and what kind of dis data you have to fix to go in between those. Between those. And I think as usual, you're asking a much deeper question that we didn't ask. But you had this choice of polarization on the right-hand side. No, no, no, no. Like you had like a month, you had a moduli space, then you have two things. I didn't understand. I didn't understand why you had worked to have the work. Oh, so I think in the description of those CHL string backgrounds, sometimes people talk about H plus E8 minus 2 polarized K3s versus H plus 2 copies of the 4 polarized K3s. And they kind of throw these things interchangeably together. Together. But I think the point here is: if I take the double cover of a rational elliptic surface, I get an H C8 minus 2 polarized K3. And there is always guaranteed to be a Nicooling involution on it that relates it to an H plus D4 minus 2 polarized K3. Conversely, if I start with an H plus D4 minus 2 polarized K3, I can, there's an even eight. And even eight, that you almost see that you can, you know, it's like the four non-central components of the reducible fiber, of the two big reducible fibers, and you can construct the double cover, and you get an H plus d8 minus two to the rise k3. And so, in that sense, the question just becomes how many involutions are acting on your theory. Acting on your theory. We see here I have this additional anti-symphactic inclusion that covers the double covering to the rational elliptic surface. And I think that resolves that conflict. So it's really whether you talk about the double cover or the protein. Not a case of things.
