Let me take the opportunity, I guess, on behalf of all the speakers and participants, to thank the organizers for all their efforts and putting all their thoughts into organizing this conference, especially managing the different time zones, which I think is extremely challenging. Okay, thank you. Okay, so also thanks personally. So also thanks personally thanks to the organizers for their invitation to speak here in the BIOS conference. Of course, it is an honor and a privilege to be able to do so. So the title of our talk is Automorphic Discrete Spectrum of Classical Groups. So I must say that there's very little overlap with the title of this conference. I am definitely not going to talk about basic functions, neither will I. Functions. Neither will I mention orbital integrals and perhaps not even beyond endoscopy. But I can assure you that the talk is online. So at least I hit one of the four main themes in the official title of this conference. Okay. Now, I think, like many people in my generation or younger, we know these results before we met the person. And for me, I actually. And for me, I actually met Bill, I think, relatively late in my career. I don't exactly remember where, but I know it's sort of quite a number of years after I finished my graduate school. And I think throughout this conference, you know, actually, I have not really attended so many talks. I attended Inshi's talk on Wednesday and Yanni's talk earlier, because the rest of the talks were like between midnight and 6 a.m. at my time. Between midnight and 6 a.m., at my time. But I presume that many of the speakers must have alluded to many amazing results of Bill throughout his career. So I will not do that. Instead, let's see. I'm going to pay tribute to Bill from another angle. And I guess all of you would recognize this cover of this book. This is the famous Kovali's Proceedings. Kovali's proceedings, which was held almost 45 years ago between July 11th and August 5th, 1977. And of course, together with Armand Borrell, Bill Kasselman was the, they were the two, I guess, co-chairs of the organizing committee and the editor of this volume, which I think many of us will regard as the Bible for the sub-Jewel Language program. Since I'm talking about that, okay, so I will use the opportunity to advertise for a similar summer school, which has been planned, is supposed to happen in IHES next summer. A summer school that unashamedly calls itself the new Kovalis. Okay, so I'll read for you just this short paragraph that was taken from the website for this conference for this summer school. This conference for this summer school. It has been almost 45 years since the influential summer school held in Kovalis, Oregon in 1977, brought together the leading experts of the Lenglands program and defined the research agenda in this area for subsequent decades, at the same time inspiring and enabling several generations of young researchers to join in this exciting journey. This three-week IHES summer school aims to do the same for the next phase of development in the LangLands program. Okay, so So, well, I think one thing that's interesting to notice is that when this summer school actually happens, it will be exactly 45 years to the day that Kovalis begins. You recall, it was July 11th to August 5th. So four weeks in Kovalis. But for this particular summer school, it will just be three weeks. As you know, As you know, working in August is like a sacrilege for the French. So we are not going to commit this cardinal sin of doing this extra week in the first week of August. So anyway, this summer school is jointly organized by Tasho Kaleta, Yanni Saka Loritis, Pyeong Rishio Doa, and myself. And well, hopefully it lives up to his. Well, hopefully it lives up to its billing as the as you know as what it claims to do. Okay now okay so let's get on to the subject matter of my talk. So I was very happy at Shibin's talk on Wednesday because he spent a half an hour giving this beautiful presentation of artists. Presentation of Arthur's conjecture. Okay, so I'm not, I won't repeat that. So I just summarize quickly in one slide Arthur's conjecture in the setting of a classical group over a number field F. So for me, I just think of it as two statements. The first statement was, so I guess maybe here I've missed the subscript discrete, should be L2 discrete, the discrete spectrum of the automorphic space. Of course, as a GA module, you can decompose it into a direct sum of submodules. Of submodules where each given submodule is a full near equivalence class. So, of course, you can always make such a decomposition by putting things in the same near equivalence class together. But the content of this first statement is that the indexing set for this equivalence class is given by elliptic global A parameters or G. Okay, and then the second statement concerns the explicit description of each of these submodules, L2 psi. Each of these submodules L2 psi. Okay, and the description is given as you see in the sheet print talk in terms of local and global A packets and also a certain R term multiplicity formula. So when one talks about A parameters, I guess it's usually one sort of evokes the use of this hypothetical Langlands group. So if we want something that doesn't depend on a conjectural object, Depend on a conjectural object. This can be done. So the role of A parameters will be played by certain isobaric sums or caspital representations of GLs with some symmetry condition depending on the group G in question. So in statement A, so what you actually have to show, the contents of statement A amounts to showing that, you know, say discrete representations in L2 has a weak lift due. Uh, has a weak lift to automorphic representations of GL, and that one would like to say precisely what the image of that weak lift is. Okay, so roughly that is the contents of part A. So, for Causi split G, as mentioned in Bin's talk, this conjecture has been shown by Arter for the symplectic and orthogonal groups and by Mock for unitary groups. And this was shown using the stable trace form. Shown using the stable trace formula in this usual and twisted versions. When G is not quasi-split, of course, the stable trace formula for G can also be used to deduce Arthur's conjecture via comparison into quasi-split form. And this has been carried out to some extent for unitary groups in the work of Kalita Menge, Shin White, and Olivia Taibi also have some papers for certain cases of orthogonal. Certain cases of orthogonal groups and inner forms of symplectic groups, for example. Okay, so the goal of this talk, in this talk, I'm going to discuss the thesis work of two of my students. So not my own work, although I did suggest the problem to them. So Ray Chen and Tia Liang Zhou. This is Ray Chen, this is Tia Liang. And in fact, they kind of have graduated. So Ri Chen defended his thesis earlier. Then he defended his thesis earlier this year. And in fact, yesterday he left Singapore to he's moving to the IAS at Hangzhou, this new institute there that Jen Shu Li is heading. And Jia Liangzhou actually defended his thesis earlier this month. And so he's still here, but he's on the job market. So if any of you have looking for a good, a strong postdoc, certainly I'll be very happy if you consider him. Consider here. So, what did they do in their thesis work? Well, what they did was they show how one can deduce Arthur's conjecture for non-quasi-split classical groups using data correspondence to move the results on the quasi-split case. And the point was that you can do this in a rather efficient manner. So, I wanted to describe how this goes. So, about data correspondence, more than 20 years ago, when I You know, more than 20 years ago, when I finished my PhD and I moved to, or just before I moved to Princeton, as a postdoc, I was told by who I forgot that Langlands is not a fan of Vita correspondence. Of course, I asked why, but I never checked with Langlands himself. And the reason it was given was that somehow it was a rather ad hoc tool. Rather, ad hoc tool, which does not really fit into the language program. For example, it evoked, you know, it involves the use of the metaplectic groups, right? And also, it is called a limited scope of application. It will not give full functoriality, for example, for arbitrary groups. So it's quite clear from the beginning what is the scope of applicability. So perhaps that is because of this reason. So it is curious that in the Covalis proceedings, there are actually four articles. Four articles devoted to this topic, beginning with Hao's paper on data series, then Galoba Raleigh's, and finally accumulating in this paper of Hao and Pioteski-Shapiro that Bing also mentioned in his talk about using data correspondence to construct counter-examples to the generalized Romanojan conjecture. So, in fact, in the ISGS summer school that I alluded to, somehow one of the Somehow, one of the purposes was to discuss the relative Langlands program. Okay, so how expansion of the Langlands program to the relative setting that, say, of spherical varieties that Yannis mentioned just now, and then to explain how data correspondence actually fits into this broader framework. And so, hopefully, with that, we'll see that data correspondence is not, you know, sort of can be properly reined into this framework. Into this framework. So, just briefly, let me briefly remind you the setting, be very brief here. So, we work with a pair of groups, dual reductive pairs, which could be one of these examples. Then, there's a certain module of this product, G cross H, called a V representation. And the DA correspondence basically studies the spectral decomposition of this G cross H module. And in the local setting, you can consider this problem either in the This problem, uh, either in the world of smooth representation theory or in the L2 world, for example. So, in the smooth setting, you will be asking, you know, which irreducible representations, pi tensor, sigma, or g cross h appears as a quotient of omega. Okay, so you would like to, you know, enumerate those or say precisely what they are. But also, maybe you ask what is the dimension of the space of equivariant homomorphisms from omega to pi tensor sigma. From omega to pi-tensor sigma. In the L2 version, it's more straightforward. You just want to decompose omega, write it as a direct integral of irreducible representations. And frequently, we can write it in this way. We just decompose as a representation of G. There's a multiplicity space for each irreducible unitary representation. So this is a unitary dual. And of course, this multiplicity space, that's an action of H, and then the points to describe this H module. In the global setting, it will involve usually a transfer of caspetal automorphic representations from one of the group, say G, to H. Okay, then what are the main questions? So, for example, a question could be non-vanishing. If you give me pi, right, and E reduced the representation of G, you can ask, is it a quotient of omega? And then there's this how duality theorem that says that suppose pi tensor sigma is a quotient, pi and sigma are irreducible representations, then the how duality theorem. Then the whole duality theorem states that pi and sigma determine each other. In other words, given pi, there's a unique either that does not exist or there's a unique sigma such that pi tensor sigma is a quotient of omega. So we sort of we call this sigma since since sigma is determined by pi, we'll call it d d pi. And as mentioned, it could be zero. So that is the non vanishing or non-vanishing issue. Issue. But if it is not zero, then it is irreducible by the How duality theorem. So the point is that, in view of the two-bullet point above, we have a well-defined function from a subset of the irreducible representation of G to the irreducible representations of H. Which subset? Namely, the subset where theta is not zero. Okay, so that's my mum, by the way. I'm just using dining table right now. So, well, the point, I mean, I guess the ultimate question is to describe this map concretely. Okay. So, if you give me an element in the domain, I want to know what the image is. And of course, then you need some language to describe that. And one possibility is that if you have a classification of the irreducible representations of this group, which is what the local language correspondence is about, you can try to describe this map in terms of that classification. But okay, there are other Classification, but okay, there are other means, right? You could have this, you can describe representations, you can characterize the representation without using the language parameters, for example. So, as far as description in terms of LLC goes, this has been achieved for P-A-DIC F in my work with Savin, Ichino, Atobe, as well as the recent work of Bakic and Hansa. Hansa. Of course, this builds upon a lot of previous work, but this but for the purpose of this talk, however, these results are not relevant. The reason is because, remember, our goal was somehow to prove Arthur's conjecture, you know, local and global aspects, right, by using data correspondence. So, for example, I'm not going to assume that for the non-quasi-split G, we know what the local Langlands correspondence is. Okay, so in fact, our goal is to detail. Okay, so in fact, our goal is to deduce that somehow by using data correspondence. So, in some sense, turning the tables around on these results. However, in this work, in these papers, there are, of course, results about data correspondence that are shown that are independent of the LLC. So, of course, those results will be used to some extent. Okay, so in fact, for the purpose of this talk, I will just need to. I would just need to, in some sense, results about data correspondence in the so-called stable range. What is that? That is when one of the groups is much larger than the other. So for instance, let's just use the example of O2N and SP2R. So we want the SP, the sympathetic group, to be much larger than the orthogonal group, roughly twice the size. So 2R is at least 4N, basically. Okay, so in this case, several simplification happens. So firstly, Simplification happens. So, firstly, the data leaf is non-zero on all irreducible representations. So, I don't have to put this subscript data not zero as in the previous slide. So, it's a well-defined map from irreducible representation of G to irreducible representations of H. Moreover, it was shown by Chen Shu Li in his thesis in 1987 that when you restrict this map data to the unitary dual, the subset of unitary representations, then the output. Of unitary representations, then the output is also unitary. So, in fact, you can restrict this to a map from the unity rule of G to that of H. Moreover, Jenshu characterizes the image of this map, namely, it consists of those representations, unitary representations of H, which are of rank 2n. Okay, so I will not define the notion of rank, but let me just say that it's due to how, okay, Roger Howe, and for sp2r, for example. For sp2r, for example, an irreducible representation can have rank between one and r, or actually zero, maybe the trivial representation as rank zero. So r is the biggest possible. And so here we are getting representations of rank 2n. And recall that 2n is less than r. So for representations of rank less than r, they are called low-rank representations. So we are getting some low-rank representations here. And you should think of the rank as a measure. Here. And you should think of the rank as a measure of the size of the representation, something like Gelfan Kira Law of Dimension. Okay, so the smaller the rank, the smaller the representation. So in 1989, in the same asterisk volume where Arthur's paper on unipotent automorphic representations appear, Jeff Adams has a paper that suggests that. That it might be more natural to describe the data correspondence in terms of A parameters rather than L parameters. Okay, so let me illustrate this in this context of orthogonal group and symplectic group. In this case, the dual groups are as shown. And now one has a map. So the G check cross SL2 maps to O2N cross SO2R minus 2N plus 1. So of course the G-Check itself is O2N. So the first map is just identity. So the first map is just identity, and SL2 is mapping to this odd orthogonal group via its unique irreducible representation of that dimension. It is an odd dimension, so it's an orthogonal representation. And then to get, you take this product and you map it into O2R plus one in the obvious way, i.e., by using a direct sum. Okay, the dimension, the sum of these two numbers is 2r plus 1. And Jeff's conjecture is that. And Jeff's conjecture is that it's basically as follows. So, if you take an other parameter, A parameter psi for g, there's an associated A packet, you can take representations in this A packet and consider their data leaf. So let's say assume we are in the stable range k, so that the data leaf is non-zero for any element in this a packet. You will get some unitary representations on this very big sympathetic group H, and you can, you know, and the conjecture is that it belongs to a Is that it belongs to a particular a packet? And what is the a parameter? It's so let's ignore this quadratic character, just just okay, just ignore it. It's basically built from the original one by just adding a big irreducible representation of the SL2. In other words, it's a composite of, no, so if you have, so what is structure? So, what is psi? Psi is a map from something like the Vader-Lin group across SL2 to G, right? And you can, by this projection, map to SL2 and then compose with this back. So basically, what is written here? So, S2R minus 2n plus 1 just stands for the irreducible representation of SL2 with that of that dimension. So, in other words, it just. In other words, it just factors through this map. Now, if you look at this arrow here, work with SO instead of O, then this is basically an endoscopic lifting, okay? Because this is the dual group of SP2R, right? And here we have a dual group of, say, SO2N and dual group of SP of 2R minus 2N. So this map of dual groups is the one giving the endoscope. Is the one giving the endoscopic lifting from SO2N times SP2R minus 2N to SP2R. So what another way to think of this parameter, deta psi, is that you take the parameter psi on here, and then you take the parameter of the trivial representation, the A parameter of the trivial representation, and then you apply endoscopic leaves to this packet cross the A packet of the trivial representation. Okay, so this anyway, this conjecture will be relevant very soon. Now, so on this slide, I recall the analogous global results about stable range data lifting. So, this is also a result of Jen Shu Li from maybe 1997. Okay. So, it says the following: so, if you have a dual pair in stable range with G small and H large. stable range with G small and h large. Let's suppose you write down the spectral decomposition of L to G A mod G F. Okay, so this is just an abstract statement because it's write it down for some measure d mu on the unitary dual, some multiplicity m pi. Then L2 of H A mod H F will contain as a sub module the following direct integral. So this direct integral here is inherited from the So, this direct integration is inherited from the one above. And the only difference is I put a deta in front of pi. Okay. So, deta pi is an irreducible unitary representation of H. So, I'm writing a direct integral over the unitary dual of G. And you can think of this as the global analog of the local theorem just now. And so, now this is somehow not the usual way one thinks. Not the usual way one thinks about global data correspondence. Usually, when we think about global data correspondence, we take the data function as a kernel and we integrate against automorphic form on G and we put output is some function on H. But when you do this integral, you have to ensure it converge, right? It converges. So usually you assume that the input is a caspital function. So it's rapidly decreasing. So there's no problem considering this integral. Now, this sort of statement is. Is it's at the same time softer, but at the same time more powerful because it allows you to lift a representation pi. For example, you have a pi that occurs in the discrete spectrum. So that this measure is a point mass there. And this pi need not be Caspital, right? But this theorem allows you to lift it to the discrete spectrum of L2 of H. Okay, some So, do you mean that the sita pi occurs in the L2 spectrum H has bigger multiplicity? Yeah, so this statement allows for that possibility. Yeah, this means at least you have this pipe, right? Correct, correct. So, this deta pi is just an abstract representation. Okay, deta was the same map as before and locally, but of course that's a tensor product. Okay, it's just an abstract representation, and this. Representation and this is a containment, right? I mean, yeah, I mean, contain or equal as okay, I don't who knows, okay? But uh, as Tihua pointed out, as a corollary, we get the following inequalities. So, for a unitary representation pi, let's define the discrete multiplicity, the multiplicity in the space of discrete automorphic forms, and also the automorphic multiplicity, which is just its multiplicity as a sub-module in the space of all automorphic forms. forms certainly the first number is less than or equal to the second number okay because a2 is contained in a okay and as a corollary of the previous the theorem or the previous slide we have the following inequalities okay this first one is what Dihua just mentioned that the discrete multiplicity of theta pi is at least as large as the discrete multiplicity of pi okay the second inequality The second inequality is just a triviality. It's just, as I said, the first number is less than or equal to the second. The third one, I did not, you know, it doesn't follow from what I draw on the previous slide, okay? But it's and it's, I mean, I didn't state all his Jen Shu's results on the previous slide. Okay, so some further results give this one. Okay. All right. And I think this is now, so I have. And I think this is now, so I have recalled certain results about data correspondence, and the primarily in the slabel range. And that's where we are going to use this result. As you see, these results are quite old. They're basically results of Hao and Jian Shu Li from the 80s and the 90s. Okay, and then here's the main idea, okay, of the work of my students, Ray Chen and Jia Langzhou. So suppose you have a non-quasi-spirit classical group, okay, say over a local field, right? And you give me an A parameter size. And you give me an a parameter psi. And I would like to construct the local a packet of g associated to psi. And so the idea is that you can consider a dual pair G cross H. So pick your H, but you pick H to be quasi-split and sufficiently large. So if G is O2N, you pick H to be SP2R, where R is bigger than 2n, for example. And maybe you can pick it larger, for example. And then motivated by Adam's conjecture, okay, so you can take this. Okay, so you can take this local A packet on H associated to detasi. So detasi is defined the same way as the Adams conjecture. This A packet, of course, you know it exists. This is what Arthur and Mock's result gives you, right? Because H is quasi-split. And then you just take the pre-image under detail. You get a set of unitary representations on the G hat, on G. Okay. And And right, so of course, here you may ask, right, if you take an element, arbitrary element in this A packet, does it in fact lie in the image of beta? And in fact, the answer is yes. So firstly, if you take an element sigma in this A packet, it is unitary. And one has to check that it is of the appropriate rank. So in the O2N, SP2R, it is a rank 2N. And once you know that, then by the local results. You know that, then by the local results, so generally, you know that it is of the form deta pi for some pi. So, what I'm saying is that, uh, you know, if you if you this a packet has 10 elements in it, then this pre-image by deta also has 10 elements in it. You don't lose things, okay, because of this. So, one, the thing you have to check is that everything in this set has the right rank. And this is actually checked by a global argument because a result of Hao and Janshu Li says the following: suppose you have Lee says the following: Suppose you have a say unitary automorphic sub-representation pi of a group G, for example, or H. Okay, and suppose you know that at some place V, pi V, the local component pi V is a low rank, say rank K less than the maximum one, right? Then, in fact, for all places V, the local components are of low rank, of that rank. Okay, so this is a rigidity. Okay, so this is a rigidity statement for low rank, global rigidity statement for low rank representation. So now you with that, you can imagine how you can check this statement that everything inside this local A packet has the appropriate rank. You use a global argument and you have to know that at almost all places, the unramified representation has that certain rank. We tech. Yes. Several times when you've talked about lifting, it Lifting, it feels like there must be several. Well, for example, you said that any low-rank representation of the big group comes from the small group. That's not the small group. It says you have to use several correct, correct, yeah, that's right, that's right, yeah. So, yeah, so pardon the imprecision here. Yeah, so I guess same thing here, yeah. Same thing here, same thing here, yeah. So, some of them will. Same thing here, same thing here. Yeah, so some of them will go to the split. So, for example, if you take a sp2r, you consider representation, you need to representation sp2r of some low rank, right? They should come from orthogonal group of a certain size, and you have to take all the forms. Yeah, so yes, please for clarifying that. Yeah, that yeah, so so of course here, I'm we'll yeah, so we have to uh move it to the to the to the uh To the so so so maybe to to to to correct myself a bit uh so if you if this a packet has size 10 for example maybe five of them comes from uh you know the the split o to n and the other five comes from the pure inner form right and and um so of course uh you know some of them will then be leaved to zero if you take g to be that pure inner form okay um okay so that's uh um So that's okay. So, for example, right, let's just say suppose you want to prove the local language correspondence for G, this non-quasi-split group. So, you give yourself a local A parameter, which is tempered, in other words, a tempered L parameter. And the above construction will produce the candidate L packet. Okay, but of course, there are things to check. Okay, so you have defined your representation by using data leak to pull back from a certain non-tempered A packet. A certain non-tempered A packet on a big symplectic group. Of course, you have to check that these elements in this set that you have constructed are tempered if psi is tempered or they are discrete series if the parameter is a discrete series parameter. You have to show there's this natural inclusion from this set of elements to the irreducible characters of the component group with expected image. So I'm just listing down some things you have to check, okay? Because we just define a set of representations. You have to check that. You have to check that, you know, as size varies, for example, these different sets are disjoint. You want to show that the union of them exhausts the whole tempered spectrum. Also, the definition of this set involves the choice of some large symplectic group H. You would like to show that it is independent of this choice. So, there are things to check. And I won't go through this. These are the work that you have to do, but I have explained how this is the main idea of getting this set. Of getting this set at your candidate set. And after that, it's a matter of checking. In addition, you like to check that, you know, to check that these are really the local L packets, you want to check that it has certain properties known as the Desiderata of the LLC, right? Like local intertwining relation, comparability of local L factors, for example. And so once you've done all this, you would have. This you would have obtained a version of the LLC. And also, these properties are enough to characterize this particular version that you have shown. So, what goes into proving these properties? Well, see, the whole process was that you use an input. The input is the local A packets for quasi-sprint groups that Arthur or Moore has produced. The process of taking this input and converting to the final product is the data lifting, right? The data lifting, right? So, certainly, to have good control of the output, you must have very good control of the inputs and the process. So, in their work, they need to know rather detailed knowledge of local A packets, for COSI split groups, in some sense, more detailed than what that was provided by the work of Arto and Mock. Okay, so the one the knowledge that's relevant for them are those supplied by the work of Moglan, Bing Shi, and The world Moglen, Bing Shi, and Hiraku Atobe about explicit construction of these local A packets and especially Jake module information of the representations. You also need to have good control of local data correspondence. So the results of some, so I have mentioned results of Hao at Jenshu, right? But also the more recent results in my work with Ichino and Atobe and so on, the part that doesn't involve LLC. So those results. LLC. So those results are also used. And then, of course, there are global arguments. So as an example, just as a schematic, so we know the, you know, let's say the LLC or we know the, you know, everything we want to know about split SO2 and plus one, okay, not just LLC, but also A packets, right? Then by using this process, you can transport this information to the metaplectic group. Information to the metaplectic group MP2N by using a very large split orthogonal group. By the process outlined on the previous two or three slides, you can get information about LLC and also about some A packets. Okay, and then after that, you can redo this trick again. So to move to the non-split SO2M plus one, where now you use MP2R, where R is super big. So sorry, the three different ends are very different. Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right. So Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right. So I guess this means for all n or something like that. Yeah, so we are not using just the equal rank data leaf. So here the n is like a W variable. We need this information. We know this information for all n. This is what Artel supplies. From this, we can infer this for all N, for MP2, for the metaplectic group. And then from that, we can infer, for example, the LLC for North. We can infer, for example, the LLC for non-speed SO2N plus one for all n. So, we take how about units of the group? Yeah, you do the same. You can do the same. I just give this as an example. Okay, so for unit group, it's also proved? Yes, yes. Okay, good. So, this is, I want to say, this approach is a bit different from, for example, I had a paper in Gordon Sevin proving the LLC for MP2N, right? By using equal rank. By using equal rank data correspondence to transport the result for SO2M plus one. So here the ends are the same. But of course, that results presupposes or supposes that the LLC for non-sprit SO2M plus one was known. And in some sense, it was known, but to Moglen and Reynard, it was mentioned in their paper. So this approach is different in the sense that it doesn't assume that. It just starts with the split case. Okay, so next, maybe I just explain the, come to the global setting. And as I mentioned, there were two statements in Arthur's conjecture. Let me just explain the first one, which is this decomposition into near-equivalence clusters and the indexing of the near-equivalence clusters by elliptic A parameters of the right type. As I mentioned, this amounts to showing that for any pi in the discrete spectrum, it has a weak lift to GL and the image is given by the expected. And the image is given by the expected type of A parameters. So that was what they showed. And the proof basically used this Genshu Li's inequalities. So here I recall the inequality. So we have our G, a non-quasi-split group. We pick an H, quasi-split and large. Okay. And then we have Jenshu's inequalities here. Okay. Where you take an arbitrary unitary representation pi of GA. Okay, just using the Okay, just using the first inequality, it tells you that if pi occurs in the discrete spectrum of G, then deta pi occurs in the discrete spectrum of H. Okay, so we had used this. And this is good because, you know, on H, H is quasi-split, so you know if you have something in the discrete spectrum, it has an associated A parameter, which I call this capital Psi. Okay, now this capital Psi, of course, this dimension is very big, right? It's related. Dimension is very big, right? It's related to the dimension of H. And what you need to show next is to show that this capital Psi contains within it as a component a certain irreducible representation of SL2, the R SL2, of the right dimension. So that when you peel off this summan, what is left is an elliptic A parameter for G. So to do that, you use knowledge of a post of standard L functions, and as well as knowledge of how unramified representation. Of how unramified representation behaves under the detail. So I will go to the details here. So this is how you can attach a parameter to a pi that occurs in the discrete spectrum of G. So doing this will prove the weaklifting of the represent the discrete, the square degree automorphic forms to the appropriate GL. G L. And so that would be the first statement. The second statement involves explicating this L2 side. Okay, so I want to explain what goes into that. So in fact, Chen Chu's result implies, so here's a reformulation, that if you look at this particular near equivalence class, you break it up in some way. And then the same submodule, but with a deta affixed to the beginning of pi, occurs inside this relevant near equivalence class on H. New equivalence class on H. Okay, now the point here is that this is contained in there. That's what Jen Shu's results imply. Okay, now, however, suppose you are in the fortunate situation where this containment is an equality, then you'll be very good because L2 of deta psi is something completely known by Arthur and Mob. This is the quasi-speak for quasi-speak groups. Split for quasi-split groups. If this were an equality, we will be able to transport whatever structure here back to there, back to G. In particular, we will be able to deduce the Artem multiplicity formula. Already, you see the A packets are defined by taking pre-image of theta leaf. So that's why it's okay. But then now, what is the multiplicity formula? If this were equality, you'd be like, whatever is on this side. Okay, you just transport it back. So, in order to prove this second statement, it comes down to showing that this is. It comes down to showing that this is an equality. And more precisely, so for every sigma in here, you want to show that the discrete multiplicity of sigma is the same as the discrete multiplicity of its pre-image under the detail. Okay, so let's consider again. I repeat here, Chen Shu's inequalities. So, I mean, somehow we want to show that this first inequality is an equality. That this first inequality is an equality. Okay, so if I take, if I let sigma be theta pi, so then this I'm trying to show that m discrete of sigma is equal to m discrete of deta inverse sigma. Okay, I want to show this first one is an equality. But of course, in view of this sequence, it would be okay if I can show that equality holds throughout, right? Like the first term and the last term are the same, okay? Okay, so this they haven't been able to show completely. So it is not true that they have completely. So, it is not true that they have completely proven Arthur's conjecture for non-quasi-spit groups. Rather, so they could show it under one of the following two conditions. So, first was if pi belongs to a generic or tempered A packet, so if this psi is a generic A parameter, then this equality holds. In fact, one can show that the caspetal multiplicity of pi is the same as the automorphic multiplicity of pi. So, for all G, the tempered part, Arthur's conjecture holds. Artist's conjecture holds. What about the non-tempered parts? Well, when G has F rank less than or equals to one, this holds. Okay, so when G is anisotropic, certainly this holds because there's no difference between square integrable automorphic forms and automorphic forms because GA mod GF is compact. So that is for free. But when the F rank is one, they were able to show this as well. Sure. And so maybe so now let me maybe allude to a result of Cassaman. So how can one try to show the equality holes in general? And so here's what they stumble upon. So in local representation theory, we have Kasselman's criteria for square integrability and temperedness, right? They look at Caspian exponents along constant term, or if you wish, asymptotics or matrix coefficients, as alluded to in Yanni. Alluded to in Yanni's talk earlier. So we can, in a global, right, we have an analogous criteria for square indicability. Like automorphic form lies in actually here, the discrete spectrum, L2 discrete, if and only if the Caspian exponents are like strictly negative linear combination of simple roots. Okay, so here's a question that my student asked me, and I didn't know the answer, which is that, is there a global analog of Casimir's tempered? A global analog of Casimir's temperedness criterion, which detects if, for example, an automorphic sub-representation is weakly contained in the L2GA mod GF by looking at its cospital exponents. I don't know the answer. I'm afraid. I don't know if someone here knows the answer. I'll be very happy to hear about it. So one thing that come to my mind was there was a recent paper of Jonathan Wang, which defines a certain Which defines a certain invariant inner product on the space of automorphic forms by using asymptotics. I don't know if that might be relevant to this question. But the point you're asking this question is that if the answer is yes, then it can actually go a long way towards establishing equality in the issue of the previous slide. Okay, so what is missing? Well, in all this approach to data correspondence, what is missing is the endoscope. Is missing is the endoscopic character identities. How data correspondence treats character is still quite mysterious. And certainly this way of proving artist condition does not address these character identities. To prove it, one would still need to resort to the stable trace formula. But one is in a much better situation because after you've done those results, you would have known, for example, the spectral decomposition of the tempered part completely. Completely. So you can use a simple stable trace formula and with full control of the spectra side. And so it should not be so bad to deduce the twisted endoscopic character identities for MP2. And this was done in the thesis of another of my students. I mean, this is as opposed to in Arthur's work where he has to prove these character identities in the course of deriving LLC and the global results. Okay, so here you already have those things, and so you just try to use a trace form, simple trace formula. Try to use a trace form, simple trace formula to prove these identities. About characters, well, let me mention a work of Braspinda that actually shows how characters of beta pi and pi are related in the stable range via what he calls Cauchy-Harris Chandra integral. So the comment I want to make is that this type of character identity is somehow different from that coming from endoscopy. Okay, as I mentioned, this data leaf is kind of an example of endoscopic leaf, right? But in endoscopic character identities, you have to take a stable sum of characters, and then before you can Sum of characters, and then before you can transfer back, but this one, this character then relates individual representations. Uh, perhaps one can say that it goes beyond endoscopy. I don't know if it is fair to say that. Okay, so this is anyhow, this is my last slide. Let me finish by returning to the IHGS summer school. So, as you know, we have three weeks, and the schedule, we are trying to make the schedule up now, it's really packed. It's like four talks a day, and just actual work. And so, we are thinking of whether we could. So we are thinking of whether we could make it more interesting. And one idea that has been floating around was to actually have somehow maybe an evening where we have a panel discussion where we assemble a number of participants or panelists who were actually at COVID. So for example, it could be one of the organizers and someone who was a graduate student at that time, someone who was a postdoc at that time, and just let them share their experience of how COVAL is, how they feel when they were. Buddies, how they feel when they were felt when they were there for four weeks, and how it had impacted their subsequent development. So, we are still toying with this idea. We are not sure if we can assemble the sufficient number of panelists, but certainly one person comes to mind. So, happy birthday to you.
