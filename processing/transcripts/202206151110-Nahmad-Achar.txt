Today, we will have Eduardo Nakmar from Ice Neumann, and he's going to tell us about finite matter radiation systems. Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here once again at this meeting. And the work I'm going to present is in collaboration with Octavio Castaños, Ramón Lopezpeña, and Sergio Cordero. Espeña and Sergio Cordero, also at the Institute for Nuclear Sciences. And what I'm going to do is to present a study of the structure of phase diagrams for phase for finite matter radiation systems, which is based on the use of coherent states and the catastrophe formalism. I'm going to emphasize two and three level systems, and then I'm going to generalize it to any number. Any number of levels, any number of levels, and any number of electromagnetic modes. And I'm also going to show how one can have a method for reduction in the number of levels briefly at the end. So, last meeting, I talked about Bell's theorem in a deterministic scenario. And today, And today I'm going to talk about field-matter interactions, which seems completely different. So, why did I choose to talk about this? Well, we nowadays have lasers that can generate light of extremely good quality. And we also have optical devices which can process light with great precision. Precision. And we also have very efficient detectors. On the other hand, classical optics is very well established. So it's very interesting to see what are the non-classical effects of light. And it appears that quantum optics has much to offer with regards to fundamental quantum principles. It is also true that light is the most likely candidate for practical applications of state measurements. State measurements. And when light interacts with matter, there's an important feature which is the presence of phase transitions. Phase transitions from what is called a normal regime to a collective regime. The normal regime is when the atoms act independently. So the decay rate is just proportional to the number of atoms. And then there's a collective regime, a collective behavior in which atoms Which atoms decay with the proportionality of the square of the number of atoms. So the study of these phase transitions is of interest because it appears in many areas of physics and it has potential applications in the design of quantum technologies. So, in the end, we have good sources of light. Good sources of light. Light is a very good candidate for state measurements and other practical applications. And when light interacts with matter, then we can see that we can study fundamental quantum aspects of systems. And this is why this would be related to what I was doing in the first place. So in a main So, in a many body system, we have for matter interacting with electromagnetic radiation the following Hamiltonian. We have the field Hamiltonian, which is just the frequency of the field times. These are the creation and annihilation operators. We have the atomic Hamiltonian, which omega A here is the frequency separation between the levels. Frequency separation between the levels. I'm talking about a two-level system right here, right now. And JZ will essentially measure the difference in populations between one and the other level. And then we have an interaction Hamiltonian. This interaction Hamiltonian is just the creation of one photon when the atom has a transition between the upper level and the lower level, or the annihilation of a photon. Or the annihilation of a photon when the atom is raised from the lower level to the upper level. This is called the rotating term. Gamma one is just the coupling constant between the atom and the dipolar approximation to the field. We have a counter-rotating term, which we just exchange here the A and A dagger. So here we create. And A dagger. So, here we create a photon and the atom is excited. Here we annihilate the photon and the atom is de-excited. So, this term does not conserve the number of excitations. And then we have a squared term in the electromagnetic vector potential, which is called the diamagnetic term. So, this term here, this kappa, can always be brought to zero using this gauge. Using this gauge transformation, where here A is the electromagnetic vector potential. And when this is done, and when the two coupling constants are the same, then we have the Dickey Hamiltonian. And if we neglect the counter-rotating term, then we have what is called the Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian. And throughout, I'm going to take h-bar equals one. So we do that, and we also take that Dick Hamiltonian and we measure everything in terms of the field frequency. So we take omega f equals one and we divide everything by omega f. And then all the quantities are dimensionless. And we also divide by the number of atoms. So the Hamiltonian expresses really the energy per atom. Expresses really the energy per atom of the system. And this system is not solvable analytically. One has to do numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in specific scenarios. However, another approach is to use catastrophe formalism. So one takes a test state and one finds the critical. And one finds the critical points of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in this test phase. And then one analyzes the singular points from the Hessian operator. So here we're taking as a test state, a direct product of the coherent states for the field. So that's this part here. And alpha to the nu over square. alpha to the nu over square root of u factorial and then nu here is the state of the field so nu would be the number of photons and we sum from nu equals zero to infinity and that product with the coherent SU2 states so the for the coherent su2 states this is just a normalization factor and we have these states acting on These states acting on j m where m is summed from minus j to plus j. This theta here is just the tangent of theta over two times this phase, where theta and phi are the angles on the block sphere. And this alpha here is just this combination of the quadratures of the field. So, sorry, the so Sorry, the um so we take the uh expectation value of the Hamiltonian in this uh coherent state, it takes this form, and this gives us an energy surface in in parameter space. The parameters are just the coupling constant between the matter and the field and the separation of atomic levels. So, and the variables, of course, are p, q, theta, and phi. And when we find the critical points of this energy surface, we find that there are two regions. One when gamma is less than a certain critical value, and another one when it's above that critical value. And we have these quantities all equal zero here in the first case, and then these expressions for theta and These expressions for theta and q critical. And you can see that when gamma reaches a certain value, then the behavior for both these field variable and the matter variable changes considerably. These critical points determine three regions. The first region is when theta is zero, and then we have this energy. And then we have this energy for the for the ground state. And this lambda is just the number of excitations. So this is the eigenvalue of this operator, which is just the total excitation number operator. And we have zero excitations and this energy. So it means we have zero photons and all the atoms are in their lower level. When theta equals pi. When theta equals pi, then we have this energy for the ground level and excitations, which means we again have no photons, but all the atoms are in their upper level. And then in the region in between, we have theta critical having this expression. And this is the energy and the number of excitations. So the state becomes when theta equals zero, as I said, it's just zero photons and all the atoms in the lower level. And this happens when omega A is greater than gamma squared. Theta is zero. So this is usually referred to as the North Pole, if you think of the Block sphere. block sphere. When theta equals pi, we have zero photons, all the atoms are excited. This happens in this region, and this is referred commonly as the South Pole. And then in between, we have the parallels, and we have this complicated superposition of excited atoms and a different number of photons. And this gives us. And this gives us in parameter space this kind of behavior. We have a separatrix given by these two parabola. This would be the North Pole with zero photons. This would be the South Pole again with zero photons. Here all the atoms are in their lower level. Here all the atoms in their upper level. And over here, we have superpositions of photons and different levels. Photons and different levels, different occupation levels for the atoms. And one can look at trajectories that cross this separatrix and find out what the order of the transitions are. And it's easy to show that along these paths, one, two, three, and four, when we cross the separatrix, the phase transition is of second order. Transition is of second order, and we only have a transition of first order along this path, which does not cross the parallel region, it just goes between the South Pole and North Pole. One can calculate the expectation value of all the interesting quantities of the system, and one can see that in most cases, they agree very, very well with the exact. They agree very, very well with the exact solution obtained when one diagonalizes the Hamiltonian. However, it's not the case for all the quantities. In this graph, I show you the fluctuation in the number of photons. And this red line is the expectation value as a function of gamma obtained from the variational coherent states. And this blue line would be. And this blue line would be that of the quantum solution. So we can see that coherent states completely overestimate the fluctuation in the number of photons. So one can ask oneself why this difference comes about. And it's because the coherent states have contributions from absolutely all the eigenvalues of the excitation number operators. Operators. And so it does not reflect the symmetry of the Hamiltonian that this operator here is really a constant of motion. If one takes an arbitrary unitary, sorry, if one takes an arbitrary unitary operator with chi here an arbitrary parameter. And one applies this to the Hamiltonian, one gets almost the exact form that one had, except for these two exponential factors. And one can see that when chi equals zero or pi, then this reduces to the original Hamiltonian. So for zero or pi, the Hamiltonian is invariant under the action of this transformation. Of this transformation. So we have a C2 point symmetry, the identity and e to the i pi lambda. So this parity symmetry allows one to classify the eigenstates in terms of the parity of the eigenvalues of the excitation number operator. Excitation number operator. But the coherent states, as I said before, do not have the symmetry because they contain absolutely all the values of this lambda. So what one can do is just project the coherent states using this operator in order for the states to acquire that Hamiltonian symmetry. And one arrives to these projected symmetry-adapted states. And in these symmetry-adapted states, And in these symmetry adapted states, the expectation value of the Hamiltonian takes a more complicated form, but which is still amiable to analytic calculations. So one can have the expectation value in these symmetry adapted states in terms of these associated Laguerre functions, except for the lambda equals zero. Lambda equals zero case in which it's the Hamiltonian decouples, and we have this value here. Delta here would be the detuning between the frequency of the field and the frequency between the atomic levels. So, when one calculates again expectation values of the different operators and what. Different operators that one has, one gets the following. You can see that now the approximation in the fluctuation of the number of photons is resembled very, very closely to the exact quantum solution here in blue. Notice the scale here, which is in thousands. This is the plot that we had before, which is in hundreds. Hundredths. And one can also try to see how well we are approximating the true quantum states with this variational calculation by calculating the fidelity between the projected symmetry adapted states and the exact quantum states. And we see that the fidelity is one in the normal region. And then when one approaches the Is the separatrix, it falls a little bit to 0.996, and then we recover a fidelity of one as gamma grows. So it's really quite a good approximation. One can move up to three-level systems. In three-level systems, we have a richer structure. We have three different configurations. configurations which are called chi lambda and v just due to to the the representation that they have diagrammatically so instead of gammas i'm going to use here mu's for the coupling constants just because this is easier to generalize than to to any number of levels so mu12 would be the coupling between levels Would be the coupling between levels one and two with the whatever mode we're considering of the electromagnetic field. Again, mu23 would be the coupling between levels two and three with the field. There is no mu13 here because the dipole operator changes parity. So here mu13 would be zero. In case of the lambda configuration, mu12 would be zero. And we have the other two and in case of the And we have the other two, and in case of the V configuration, again, we have one coupling constant equals zero. So, by knowing which complex, which constant is zero, we can see what configuration we're talking about. And the reason one studies these three-level systems is because there have been proposals to use them as quantum memories, for instance, and also. And also, various, let's say, protocols of quantum gates have been presented using these three-level atoms. So in this case, for instance, with the psi configuration interacting with a one-mode electromagnetic field, and if we take the rotating wave approximation, then the Hamiltonian takes... Then the Hamiltonian takes this form. Uppercase omega here is the frequency of the field. Omega 1, omega 2, and omega 3 are the frequencies of corresponding to the energy levels of the atom. The A uppercase A J K are just the atomic transition operators, for instance, A2. Operators. For instance, A21 would be the transition between level 1 to level 2. And so we annihilate one photon here. A12 would be the transition between level 2 to level 1, and we create one photon, etc. So here, if we take a linear So, if we take a linear combination of these operators, the A11, A22, and A33, which correspond to the population of the atomic levels 1, 2, and 3, and then the number operator, the photon number operator. And we see whether this commutes or not with the Hamiltonian, then we get two operators that do. Get two operators that do. One is a total number of atoms, and the other one is a total number of excitations, which are given here. And again, the system cannot be solved analytically, so one has to resort to numerical diagonalization. And as a natural basis in which to diagonalize the Hamiltonian, we take this, which is the Gelfand settling. The Gelfand settling states just written in a more compact form. So, ν here represents the number of photons, R represents the population of the lower level, and Q minus R represents the population of the intermediate, the second level. And then, of course, the population of the upper level is just the number of atoms minus Q because the number of atoms is constant. And again, we find this energy surface by taking the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in this system. And we find that the surface energy has this behavior, in which we have a normal region with zero photons and all the atoms being in their lower level. Atoms being in their lower level. The number of excitations here is zero. And then we have regions with one, two, three, four, et cetera, excitations. So we have this complex structure of separatrices which are given here as the white lines. And how does one calculate this when one can take the fidelity between neighboring states? So we take, as I said, states. So we take a state, let's say psi of lambda, and then psi of lambda plus delta lambda, and we calculate the overlap squared and we move along lines of constant mu ij in this direction or in this direction. And of course, when one crosses from one region with a certain number of excitations to the next, then the fidelity will drop to zero. But otherwise, the fidelity But otherwise, the fidelity will be either one or very, very close to one. And this is how one obtains these parametrices. One can also use the fidelity susceptibility, which is like the second derivative of fidelity. And it's actually a more sensitive quantity, but either one will do. And what we see here What we see here is that if we look at the surface mu23 equals zero, so where this energy surface crosses this plane, mu23 equals zero, then we see that these separatrices cross it at different points. So depending on the number of atoms, these little dots here in blue represent this intersection. Represent these intersection points of the different sparatrices here for n equals three. And when we move to n equals eight atoms, then we see that all these points move upwards and appear up over here at lower levels of the coupling constant mu12. So these separatorizes are moving towards this straight line, which is This straight line, which is the sparatrix, which separates the normal region from all the collective regions, they all move towards this one. And in the limit, they coincide with this separatrix in the limit when n tends to infinity. And as well, the intersection of them with this upper curve bounding the region, the normal region, also moves down and Down and they coalesce with this orange little dot here, which does not move at all. So, this orange dot, which is at this coordinate one square root of two, is a true triple phase transition where m equals zero, m equals one, and m equals two intersect. And this is only true in the side configuration for three-level atoms. So, which means that if we stand here at this intersection, then any fluctuation, any quantum fluctuation will completely change the structure of the ground state. So we can move from this structure. In these diagrams, the little crosses represent occupation levels. Levels, atomic occupation levels, and the wiggly green lines represent number of photons. So in this region m equals zero, we have, I did it for n equals two here, we have two atoms occupying the lower level and zero photons, but any fluctuation will change the structure of this ground state into something like this, which is a superposition. Something like this, which is a superposition of one atom in the lower level, one in the middle level, and no photons, or two atoms in their lower level and one photon. And again, another fluctuation will change this to a completely different structure for the ground state. And if we take a higher number of photons, then of course these become much more complicated, but one can actually write them down. If we include the counter-rotating terms, the Hamiltonian just gets a little bit more complicated, but not much so. And the effect really is just that of shrinking the phase space by a factor of two. So the triple point instead of being at one comma square root of two is now at one half comma one over square root of two. The number of The number of excitations is no longer conserved, but its parity is. So, again, we have this two-point symmetry group for the Hamiltonian. And as before, one can take a variational state being a direct product of coherent bile states for the field and in this case, U3 states for the atom. U3 states for the atomic field. The U3 states would be like this for the uppercase AIJs would be the atomic transition operators. Gammas would be our parameters here, our free parameters, gamma 3, 2, and 1. And H1, H2, H3 would be the highest weight state. So taking, let's say, all the atoms in their lower level. Atoms in their lower level. And again, one can find the energy surface by taking the expectation value of this Hamiltonian and minimizing with respect to the field variables and the atomic variables. And again, one finds that there are distinct regions, a normal regime with no. With no photons and all the atoms in their local level, and a collective regime which meets at this separatrix, which is again a singular region for the Hessian. And one can actually find the analytic expression for this separate trick here, theta, is the Heaviside function. So in this case, we have In this case, we have again, we can calculate the order of the phase transitions and we can plot the different regions. Here in black is the normal region with no photons and atoms in their lower level. And then we can move towards different areas in the mu12 mu23 diagram in the xi configuration, for instance. What is plotted here is the derivative of the energy. is the derivative of the energy with respect here of a mu 12 and here with respect to mu two three and we see that when we cross this separatrix we have a transition of second order but when we cross it along this curved line no matter in which direction we have transitions of first first order and since the parity of And since the parity of the number of excitations is conserved, then it makes sense to again adapt our variational state to a given parity. So we project once more with the projection operators that I showed before. We have now states which only contain even values of the excitation. Of the excitation number eigenvalue and states which contain only odd values for the excitation number eigenvalue. And one can find that the ground and the first excited states, the symmetry adaptive states, give an excellent approximation to the ground and first excited quantum states. With the additional Advantage that one has analytical expressions for these states, and one can do then all different types of studies in different limits. These are plots of the fidelity between the projected symmetry-adapted ground states obtained from the variational states, the coherent states, and the And the quantum and the quantum states. So, if you see, we have a fidelity of one in the normal region, which starts falling a little bit as we cross the first paratrix to 0.98, and then it recovers to one when we reach the next region and then falls again. So, at each crossing of a separatrix, we have a little drop in the fidelity, but not much. Drop in the fidelity, but not much. So the states do approximate very well the quantum states. Whereas for the coherent ground states, this is the fidelity with respect to the quantum state. So it's only one here in the normal region, and it drops drastically in the super radiant or collective region. Perhaps I can skip this and move to a generalization of different levels and different field modes. So we can have here, it's very good that the participants can now see my screen, but it's terrible that they didn't before this. So we can have now any. We can have now n atomic levels and any number of electromagnetic modes. And we can write the generalized DK-Hamiltonian like this, where omega j k are the frequency of the different field modes, and we sum over all the modes. These are creation and annihilation operators for each mode. And then we have the atomic atomic Hamiltonian, which is just Hamiltonian, which is just the frequency of each of the levels times the population of each level. Remember, h-bar equals one, so this is radio energy. And then we have the interaction Hamiltonian given in this form with the same kind of operators that we had before. These operators, transition atomic operators, obey the UN algebra and and we take a kj to be the transition between levels j and k promoted by the mode omega j k and again we can follow the exact same procedure of of using a variational test state starting from coherent states finding the critical points using the fidelity between neighboring states to determine the To determine the separatrix. And this is what we find as a phase diagram for each of the configurations in the case of three levels. The psi configuration, we have again a normal regime, and then we have super radiant regimes S1, 2, and S23 or the subscripts 1. These subscripts 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 are according to the photon that dominates in that region. I'm going to show you later a picture in which we can see that only one type of photon dominates in each region. And so we have second-order transitions from the normal regime to S12, but first order transition from the normal regime to From the normal regime to region S23. And then between the two super-radiant regions, we have a first-order transition. This is for the xi configuration. This would be for the lambda configuration. And in case of the V configuration, all the transitions between normal and super radiant regime are second order. And the only first order transition is between the two superadient regions. Radiant regions. Here we have two parity symmetries given like this. So we have two constants of motion given by the number of the first one given by the number of atoms of mode one, two plus number of atoms of mode two, three plus the population of the second level A22 plus Population of the second level, A22 plus twice the population of the third level. This is for the xi configuration. And then a second constant of motion given like this: mu23 plus A33. Of course, the number of atoms is still conserved. And due to the parity of these two, the possible parities of these two constants of motion, then the Hilbert space breaks itself into subspaces according to the parity of K1 and K2. Parity of K1 and K2. So we have H even even, even odd, odd, even, and odd, odd. And we can see here that when we project these spaces, then this is, for instance, for the Lambda configuration with two modes, three levels. So we have in blue, we have the expectation. Expectation number of the number of photons of mode 1,3, and we can see 1,3. Yes, we can see that it's zero in all this region. And then as we cross the separatrix, it starts moving upwards, and we have non-zero photons here in this region. And for the other mode, nu2, 3, the opposite happens. So, this idea that we have all different modes of the electromagnetic. Of the electromagnetic field, and we have this like a polychromatic phase diagram, it breaks itself into monochromatic regions where only one mode dominates in each super radiant region. This is the normal region here, back here, where we have no photons. If we take four levels and three modes, then this would be the phase diagram, a normal region. A normal region, and then a region where mode 1, 2 dominates, a region where mode 23 dominates, is a super radiant collective region. And then above this, we have the other mode, S3, 4. Again, this would be for ladder configuration, axide configuration. And if we allow modes to interact with more than a pair, With more than a pair of atomic levels, and we follow exactly the same procedure. What we find is we have critical points both at zero and infinity for the matter variables. And when we take particular values of them, then we can see that we can reduce the system by one level. So, if we can reduce our system of n levels by one, then we can iterate. Can iterate as many times as we want until we arrive at two-level DICKI models, and these can be solved analytically with the variational method that I showed before. So, this allows us to treat systems with any number of levels and any number of field modes. So, this is just an example we take here for. Example, we take here, for instance, in the case of four levels. This is lowercase lambda configuration just because of how the levels are diagrammatically shown. This would be like an N configuration. In blue, here we have one mode, one field mode. In red, we have another field mode. And I'm going to show you how you reduce. you how you reduce this uh these systems so here when row four remember row row here is uh is just the magnitude of of these atomic variables the gammas the ones that we had in the exponential in the in the u.n in the uncoherent states so rho is just So, rho is just the absolute value of gamma, and then we have a phase. And when one of these rows, let's say rho four is zero, then this level decouples, and we just have the three-level lambda configuration. Sorry. Okay, if you allow me just a couple of more minutes, thanks. And when row two goes to infinity, which is another critical value, then this lets you. Another critical value, then this level dominates over this one, and the one that decouples is row one. And then we get this three-level ladder configuration, of course, with different atomic variables now. And then this three-level configuration, if we take eta3 going to infinity, then it dominates over eta four, and then we have, sorry, it dominates over eta two, and then we have a two-level system with, again, system with again different atomic variables and if we take eta four equals zero then this one decouples and we get this this two level system so so this four level system can be brought to to a combination of two level systems and the same for the end for the end configuration we just break it in by steps and we arrive to just two level systems which we can we can study and Systems, which we can study analytically. And this allows us to have a very good description of the phase diagram in all cases. In this particular case, for instance, where we have four levels, this is the end configuration. We have a normal regime. Then we have three different collective regimes. This blue surface. This blue surface divides the S23 super radiant region from these other two. And then there's a green surface that you can barely see here, which divides the S13 from S24. So here we have one mode, mode 1,3 of the field dominating. Here we have mode 2, 4 of the field dominating. And above this blue surface, we have mode 2, 3. And again, this phase diagram tells us that we have models. Phase diagram tells us that we have monochromatic regions always. So, with that, I thank you for your attention. Question from the audience: How critical is the use of this particular answer for your variation? You play with coherent states. Have you tried other family of answers and see how much of your findings depend on it? I mean, is it robust? It is critical, of course. It depends on what states you start with. And as we saw, the And as we saw, the coherent states, in principle, appear to be very good approximations, but not very good for all the different quantities that one evaluates. And what we found is that when we project them in such a way that these states get the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, then we have an excellent approximation. Of course, you can start from different test states and not get anywhere or get to. anywhere or get get to to um uh to something in between so but but this is this is a property of the catastrophe formalism uh because we have such a good agreement with these symmetry adapted states we have not tried others i have a question so you didn't tell us why you were talking about this or you were going to tell us why you chose to talk about this in this Talk about this in this meeting as opposed to the other thing. Okay, so I thought I did say that at the very beginning, but maybe I wasn't very explicit. So if we're going to use light in order to study fundamental aspects of quantum theory, and this light interacts, of course, with matter, it will interact with the It will interact with the different detectors or with beam splitters or with any other material thing that you have in your experimental setup. Then it's interesting to see how this interaction behaves. And in order to see that, then you study phase diagrams of the system in order to see whether you have different behaviors in different In different places, let's say, of for different values of the coupling constant and so on. In particular, if one thinks, for instance, about quantum computation, then all the different quantum gates are actually realized by using matter interacting with light. I think I mentioned the proposal for quantum memories again is using atoms or spin states. I mean, I mentioned atoms here, but it can be any artificial atom, spin states or even Bose Engine condensates and so on. So the idea is to use atoms that you can force a certain excitation on. Certain excitation on the atom and then leave it there for a while and then force a de-excitation. So you have like a memory in the sense that you keep the state for a little while while you do something else. So the idea is if we want to study fundamental aspects of quantum theory that you can measure, then it's a good idea to study phase diagrams of the interaction between light. The interaction between light and matter. How much can you trust your phase diagram? So, how much can you trust your phase diagrams when you know that your states are just an approximation? What I showed here is that the approximation is very good with the quantum phase diagram. So, if you diagonalize the Hamiltonian, you get the exact quantum solution, and then we We compare this to the one we get with the symmetry-adapted coherent states. We find that we have an excellent approximation. And this, I mean, I showed the fidelity measure, but you can also use the Bureau's distance to show this. You can use the Wigner function as well to show this. And they behave quite well. they behave they behave quite quite well uh with the advantage that you have analytical solutions you have you have expressions that you can study analytically is there any other question here if not let's thank Eduardo
