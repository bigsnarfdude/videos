She was speak about global dynamics around multi-solitoma for the non-linear plan for information. Thank you. I'd like to thank the organizers for invitation and to give me a chance to talk. So, my talk will be a sort of a continuation of the second talk by Con Chen. So, we consider the same equation, and the main question is about the global behavior of the solution. Is about the global behavior of solutions around multi-service. So let me just recall something. The equation is the Langoran equation and I focus on this particular case, the cubic nonlinearity, focusing in three-dimensional and the question is the global behavior of general solutions. Behavior of general solutions, but we are interested in the particular case when the solution is close to the superposition of the ground states and they are traveling by the Lorentz transform. So the initial vector will be denoted by something like this. The vector means just the pair of the solution and the time derivative of that. And we consider solutions in energy space every time. Solutions in energy space every I will be using the same notation. So this is just energy space. Then the main object is the ground state, which is denoted by Q. It's a radial positive static solution, meaning you have this simple elliptical equation which is very classical. And we are interested. And we are interested in the solutions which look like a supervision. So, and we have the Lorentz transform which makes this static solution to a traveling weight. So, for any data which denotes the speed of the traveling weight, it has to be slower than the right speed. Here I choose one to be the right speed for any beta you have linear transform of. Linear transform of this guy, which travels by the speed beta. This is the solution. I I don't write the precise definition, but this is one of the solutions, particular solutions. Then the question a general conjecture is that we can somehow describe the asymptotic behavior of solutions as long as they are global in time as a superpower. In time, as a superposition of this kind of solutions localized in space but with a fixed shape and traveling by different speed under radiation. So, this is a stop-how-resolution conjecture, which appeared several times in this conference. So, we want to say that this is a kind of summation of finite objects in this form. This form, let's say this is some type of function, and radiation as time goes to infinity. And in particular, Guang Chen and Yassik Zhenjue has proven somehow completely characterized uh this kind of solutions uh for a given uh for a given uh for any number of uh grounded states, right now. Random states. So here, P is the just free solution. So the question I want to consider here is to somehow determine the asymptotic behavior for any given initial data close to this kind of configuration. Because as a As explained by Boon, those kind of solutions are unstable. So each of them has one direction which is unstable, meaning that if you start with, yeah, even without beta, if you start with this solution, in general you may have exponential growth. Eigen values of the j just take uh Kappa for example. Kappa, for example. And you have typically this kind of behavior if you choose the unstable mode, which is just the eigenfunction for the linearized operator. And because of this behavior, you cannot really expect, for example, numerically or experimentally to observe this kind of solutions for a long time. This will quickly disappear, I think. This will quickly disappear. For example, if you just do simple numerics because of this behavior. And in particular, if you start with a solution which looks like the ground state and add a very small amount of unstable mode, like this, then the solution will quickly grow up in this way. And if you add a negative guy, then the solution will quickly collapse and this will... Collapse and uh this will somehow become uh radiative waves and the they will scatter. And you you see only this kind of thing. So the question is to see the behavior of solutions somehow which are not on the manifold constructed by one in the in his talk. But not the exact. And we want to somehow classify the behavior of such solutions. And as it was nicely introduced by Bond, Was nicely introduced by one. When we have only one solitone, then this problem is somehow completely understood. It was in a joint work with Shira. And roughly speaking, in that case, we have a classification, at least for positive time, we have a classification into three cases. One is the manifold as appeared in Bohn's talk. Here in Bohn's talk, we have the manifold of four dimension one on which the solution looks like the solitone, the single soliton, which is like plus the radiation part which is approximated by a free solution and the small power. But it is an exceptional case. But it is an exceptional case, meaning that it has a dimension one in the energy space, and the general case is either, as I explained here, either blowing up or scattering. So, for example, here you have scattering, meaning that U is just approximately by B, while you have here level of So, for uh n bigger than two, uh natural expectation would be uh at least when the solitons are far enough from each other to have superposition of the sp. And you have to dance the conclusion. So, it's uh somehow uh quite simple and uh maybe not so interesting, but uh to prove it it's not so Uh to prove it it it's not so easy. But so so yeah. As long as uh sorry sort of far so roughly speaking, that is uh what we can prove, but uh to be honest this is uh sort of out in progress. But what we can prove is the following: given any solitons in this form at the initial time, then we can classify all initial data in this form, but with more than one soliton. This means we have this kind of graph for each soliton, and the description is given by kind of intersection of them. So, more precisely, we have for each. More precisely, we have uh for any uh set of velocity and the position given at the initial time and then I need to assume that the solitons are getting away from each other somehow. Already at initial time they should be like this. Uh it's not so uh unnatural because the Uh unnatural because the multi-solitons will be eventually getting away from each other. But I have to assume that, for example, for any pair of so this denotes the points of the solitons. And if you consider the direction of velocity, this has to be big enough. Then let me And then the initial data of U is in the form its superpositions. You can take either positive or negative sockets. It doesn't really matter. And even set of velocity and positions with this separation position. Position. And then the main point is to look at, as in one's talk, the unstable mode for each one, which I just borrowed from his talk. I think it was YJ ‚Åá. This is the unstable mode for each solitons. And this depends on the velocity, but it's somehow explicit in terms of the unstable mode of this. So the initial data is given, this part is prescribed, and we are going to choose some parameter here and some orthogonal components. I can gamma and maybe just skip the condition on this guy, but this should satisfy some orthogonality condition, which is described in God's talk. So given So given given Aj and gamma small enough, we can tell what is the asymptotic behavior depending on the choice of AJ, which is described by a set of lip sheet graphs. For each j, there is a lip sheet graph which is Graph which is graph from the graph for each unstable mode. So it is a function from, for example, for each j, it is a function from a1, a2, anything except a j gamma. It tells you what's the stress of the for. You, what's the threshold for the change for point? But this is a bit complicated. I think it's better to draw a picture in the case where we have just two soil tons. Then it is rather simple. And I can draw it with a 2D mode. In terms of the two state modes, so when you have only two Depending on the choice of the orthogonal component, we have a specification on the plane of the unstable mode for the first soliton and unstable mode for the second soliton. And the region will be something like hecto or a square. Rectangle or square. Uh we can consider only small ways, so this is just inside a small ball. But inside a small ball, we have the precipitation in this way. So here we have scattering. So all the solitons disappear, and asymptotic behavior is just a quite a free equation. But at this point, we have the At this point, we have both solitons, two solitons in this case, and here you have one soliton, and here you have one soliton. I mean on the boundary. On the boundary, you have one soliton. And in the complement, you have rho. So, roughly speaking, it's like a rectangle, slightly. Rectangle, slightly deformed, and this graph this graph is given by G1, and this graph, the threshold, is given by G2. And you can imagine the same thing for higher case. I mean, if it's like three-dimensional, then you have something like a cube or maybe just a corner of the cube. And depending on the dimension, you have a corner. Dimension, you have a corresponding number of solitons. So if I try to state it precisely, it's a bit complicated, but it's not that complicated. Somehow, as I said, it's just a superposition of the one solitone case. This is because we assume that the solitons are well separated and getting away from each other, and they do not interact so much. In fact, the interaction is exponentially different. The interaction is exponentially decayed because of the decay of the soils. Yeah. Is essentially a solution that is one soliton and the other one scatters or not? Here? Yeah. Yeah, on this boundary, you have only one soliton. And the others will be destroyed at the scale. Others will be destroyed at the scale. Yeah, the same on the other one, but they are different. So, in fact, this kind of result, we have this kind of result for the EGF Easy equation, where you add the dumping to the Kragon equation. As is. With the boundary path of stable? No. If you put up into the boundary, Parturable into the boundary, then it remains. But if you buttur in a different way, here you don't have any solitone, and here you have rocks, so they are very different. You can choose a parameter which keeps solitones stable. Sure, that is precisely given by this graph. And it's somehow similar to one's case, but in that case, they consider only this point. So with the darking we have in fact we can consider similar power. For this we we have the previous result with its I hope it will appear this year, maybe next year, but I don't know. But in this case we can consider only the two solitons. Although the equation is easier, the main problem in this case is that we the solitons cannot have velocity. Solitons cannot have velocity, and like in the pre yesterday's talk, we have only strongly interacting solitons. And so, in this case, the difficulty is mainly the soliton interactions are strongly interacting, meaning that they are getting away only by logarithm in time, and this makes the interaction not integrable in time. And therefore, Not integrable in time. And therefore, the main difficulty in this case is solitons. And the reason that we cannot go beyond two is that as soon as we have three or one solitons, we cannot avoid that two of them approach each other and merge into one soliton. This is too dramatic for us to analyse. In particular, we cannot we can prove the existence of such solutions. Existence of such solutions, but we cannot characterize their initial. That's the problem. That's why we need to restrict to this case. But here, because we are assuming that the solitons are getting away from each other, that part is somehow much easier. And therefore, we can treat any number of solitons. But the main difficulty, so compared with this guy, the difficulty, of course, that the That we don't have energy damage. But in particular, when we have solitons collapsing, they are somehow small in amplitude, but they are still big in energy. So the main difficulty is to consider large large radiation coming from. From the collapsed solitons. So, for example, on this curve, we start with two solitons. For example, like this. This guy is going this way, this guy is going this way, and maybe this one is remaining for all the time, but this guy will be disappearing because of the. Because of the unstable mode, this will destroy and it becomes radiation. And even though they are getting away from each other, it is sublomina. The speed of this wave will eventually take over. And this means you have some interaction here, at least for large time, between these solitons and the radiation. Radiation. And unfortunately, this radiation is big because it is coming from this soliton. So the main problem is to analyze this interaction. However, the good thing here is that although this guy is large in energy, we can say that they are small still in the energy norm if you consider locally around here. And it is because. here. And it is because of the local energy estimate. And so local energy estimate, there are various forms of estimate, but for example by Moravitz in 60s there is a estimate which looks like energy energy norm. Energy node in a bounded domain is bounded by the energy. For the three languages equation, for example, if you integrate in space-time, so you have this kind of estimate. So, this means, of course, if you integrate over all space, you cannot hope this kind of decay, but locally around some point, you can hope to have. You can hope to have decay at least in an integral sensing time. And this is exactly what we need here because this will tell us even though this guy is big, the interaction is small. So the main point in the proof is to prove this kind of local energy decay around the soliton trajectory and the multi-exoliton trajectory. And moreover, we want to take We want to take advantage of the distance between them. So, heuristically, we expect that this is not only localized, but should be small, because they are very far away from each other. So, we want a local energy estimate among multi-isolitons and weather decay with respect to the distance. And that's the main estimate we need. Estimate we need. And for that, we can somehow follow the idea of Moravetics. It's a very simple idea using what is called the Moraves multiplier. You multiply the equation with something and integrate over space-time, and you get a very nice formula, which is some sort of miracle, as Bau said. Or say it's a kind of monotonicity, but in a different way. So maybe I think. Yeah, so this is the key lemma somehow about the local energy decay. So let's consider the case of two solid trajectories, which I denote by Qj. This is just a given This is just a given trajectories. And we can consider for this, I don't need any specific dimension. So let's say q prime is the distance between two trajectories. So I consider something like one is this and this one. This is q1, for example, q2. And the distance is denoted by q prime. Then I assume that I Uh I assume that I need to assume something. Uh first of all, we need this to be subonominal uh uniformly. So the derivative should be bounded by something which is degree less than one uniformly. And we also need the second time derivative to be integrable in time. It should be bounded. This condition This condition naturally appears as long as the solitons are modulated by interactions. So, and we have nice global control on that. So, this is not the source strange. But we also need to assume that they are keeping away from each other. For that, I assume that the derivative for the difference is bounded from below by some number. Number and also I need to assume that it is already getting away from each other in a rather wakeful sense. So there is some capital T such that the minimum of the distance is achieved within time T. So it's possible that they are getting uh closer, but only for short time. But only for short time. It has to be getting away rather soon. Then, under these assumptions, and depending on these parameters, theta b, delta t, and epsilon, we have the following estimate with a uniform decay with respect to the distance. So, let me write it precisely. So, So we measure the solution around here, but by imposing some weight, which is my list. Sorry, I think. Yeah, um the I need a weight to decay slightly faster than minus one uh under square. Uh this is natural from the uh This is natural from the uh strict calcium estimate of a Hardwick quality. Although I could prove better decay estimate uh for some directional derivative uh for the entire decay I needed this this order. But uh for solitons this doesn't really matter because solitons exponentially decay. And uh so so this is bounded by initial data, also with the positive decay, uh positive weight. Positive decay, positive weight around this time. So now I use Q2 for the initial data and for the forcing term. So here I consider the free triangle equation with a force. So something like so this is the force part. So this is the post. And the with with the you are uh wait, but the imposed uh on the different uh type. Okay, uh I guess I have almost zero in today. So so this sorry I forgot to see this is going to zero as as the distance goes to technically more precisely I need to estimate the power Need to estimate the definence, the inverse power of diffidence, and also the L1 norm of the second dynamic body. So this is kind of uniform decay because the trajectory can be anything as long as they satisfy these conditions. Right, and this is very convenient. Okay, so I guess I don't have time to talk about the truth, but Talk about the truth, but it is roughly speaking, this is at least in a speed the same as Moravits. But in the so Moravitz considered it's a very nice simple proof using this kind of deployer. So the main question is how we can modify this guy in order to Modify this guy in order to adjust the trajectories. And so, somehow we know how to modify this guy in general by using the Einstein's metric, sorry, the Minkowski metric in space-time. But the main point is that we need to find, so in this case, it is just this one, but more generally, we can consider. And more generally, we can consider vector field for which we have a positive Jacobian matrix. This is a very particular case, but we need some non-negative Jacobian matrix. And it's not so easy, but somehow we can find good nice vector field, adjust it to this guy and to this guy. And to to this point. But i it's not so easy because uh uh in order to satisfy this one, we cannot simply localize the vector form because this implies it is somehow growing at the infinity. So it is kind of miracle that we can find the bounded one. But the idea is that so uh we can make for example for for this guy I need the vector field to vanish at this point. For that purpose we can use the diffraction. Uh Use the reflection. By using the reflection, even though this is not localized, it can vanish around this point. That's one idea. And when we have an interaction which is very far in time, then we can use that this is almost pointing. In this case, it is pointing in the space direction. But when they are very far away from each other in time, then this will be very much time-like. And in that case, I can use that time-like vector, it's just And we can subtract this time vector to make it also vanishing when it is very far in time. Roughly speaking, that's the main idea, but it's not so easy to prove it. But anyway, I think I stop here. Thank you for your attention. Yeah, so the case where you can have this information. If you have this patient, then we can just use the energy dumping. For the radiation, we can raise it to the energy dumping, which makes that very much easier. So, you will have this local energy decay? We don't even need that.
