Okay, hi everyone. My name is Ernie, of course. So today I want to talk about, I said quantum Riemannian, but we know when it's non-commutative, we say quantum non-commutative as interchange, because we can. Okay, so basically what I want to do is first thanks for the organizer for making this possible. I haven't seen so many co-working. Seen so many people working in some things related to me in a very long time. So grateful that there are more people. I'm going to try to, I'm not going to try, I'm going to give a brief introduction of what I said is the false sphere, give a formalism of what I understood of quantum Riemannian geometry, then of course apply it in my problem, and then just mention some results. Just mention some results about it and about more things. So, what is this? So, this is the Faucy sphere. Basically, you are algebra people, very pure. So, I think this is the slide that you're going to like and then the others probably not. But stay with me as long as you can. So, basically, I work with the enveloping algebra with the angular momentum algebra. This, I choose. This, I choose that my elements behave in this way. Why? Because basically, I want to do some I'm trying to apply this to physics somehow. So the relation that I inducing here, this lambda p, it's my deformation parameter. And I think that this parameter is going to be in the quantum, on the Planck scale, more or less. Well, not more or less, I hope. Well, not more or less, I hope. But it's not forced to be in this, and I will mention why I'm saying this later on. So I define my relations in this way. I do introduce to my algebra these relations in here that basically they can be using a finite-dimensional irreducible representations. Representations, but the thing is in here is that this is the setup that I need. Everything that I'm gonna work after this is introduce the formal quantum Riemannian geometry that I work and then I come back to see how can I introduce a metric in here, my differential, and then try to produce some geometry somehow. So something like that. Something like that. I'm not a physicist, I'm a mathematician, so this is as hard for you than for me. So basically, what is the problem with the quantum Romanian geometry is that we don't know what happens in the Planck scale. So basically, this is a picture that I told to my supervisor. I didn't say at the beginning, of course, this is not my solo work. This is joint work with my supervisor Shan Majid. Professor Shan Majid. Professor Shanmaji. So, the thing here is: we don't know what happens in the Planck scale, but how do we think about this? So, basically, the smaller the scale that we're working, the bigger energy that we need to work with. Also, like here is the black holes reference in order to understand. So, it is impossible for us physically, as an experiment, in order to An experiment in order to understand what happens in here. What is the geometry that is living in here? So, in order to understand this, we assume that, of course, because of the mass energy that we have in here, my geometry, as I know it now, as we can see, is destroyed. So, what we propose is: let's assume that this is not continuous. So, the coordinates that I So the coordinates that I that I so the I don't know how I did that but if you hold on to the pointer somehow my fingers so what I was saying is I want to understand the geometry in here somehow in order to understand the geometry in here I In order to understand the geometry in here, I assume that the coordinates that I'm working in here are not commuting. And this is where everyone here can relate non-commutative geometry. So because I don't know how the world looks in here, and I am assuming that this is non-commutative, the way that I'm thinking this is that it's not continuous, so everything is like separated in small subjects. But then, as a mathematician, how we understand. How we understand this. So, the approach that I want to explain here is: I'm trying to be as general as possible and I'm trying to use as less conditions as possible. So, in order to use what we know about Riemannian geometry, what I'm gonna say is there are two things that we have to have in mind. I'm gonna, if you don't believe me what I'm saying, just think instead of non-commutative algebra, think in. Non-commutative algebra, think in a topological space, instead of thinking in a differential-graded algebra that you use a lot, think in a differential manifold and so on. The structure of the Riemannian geometry, I'm going to define later what I understand with that. But the goal is with all the setup that I'm going to introduce using only algebras instead of manifolds, instead of more topological space, more plastic. Space more classical. What I want to do is, whatever I do, in order to know or to say that I'm doing quantum things, I have to recover the original thing. And in order to recover the original thing, I have to recover it somehow. So in instance, for instance, when I was defining here, I told you the lambda P was taught as a blank scale. But if we recover later, But if we recover later this lambda b equals to one, we should recover the classical Riemannian geometry. So that's the goal. And then what is this? So basically what I use is I'm going to work with the spaces of commutative algebras. These of course are in using the notation of one forms. I'm introduced abusing of the notation of using the letter D. Of using the letter B, but I'm introducing a function that I want to work as a differential. And because I'm using as minimal as possible things that you should impose, I'm imposing that it satisfies the lateness rule. Moreover, in order to define the wedge product, I'm not thinking the wedge product as we think. I have to define exactly what it is depending on the algebra. Define exactly what it is depending on the algebra that I'm working on. But in general, I wanted to satisfy this with this relation in here. And moreover, I have to understand, or I have to say to the reader, or to you in this case, what I understand with the differential when I'm working with my one forms. And lastly, I'm going to define this. This is going to simplify some solutions and it's going to be able to rely in the classical work instead. Rely in the classical work easily and then a lot of definitions. So basically, what I need is the following. So I'm asking to have an algebra. And in order to understand or work following or working later with the quantum Romanian formalism, I already said who is D, I already kind of said what is the set of one forms. But I just want to say that. I just want to say that everything has a naming here. So for now on, I'm going to work in the most basic problem, which is using what is a differential algebra. And I'm going to use three elements. I need an algebra. I don't need a one. I need my map D, which I haven't said too much about it, other than the Leibniz rule, and the set of one forms. So there are a few things that we can have, and we. Are a few things that we can have and we might not have, and it doesn't affect at the end. So I can have that the set of world forms are generated using the DMAP, but this is not required. It happens, it's nice, but it doesn't happen. If it happens, it has a last name, this algebra, but it doesn't happen, it's not a problem. But I am working, if we can see the set of one forms are increasing the dimension of, I mean, if I The dimension of, I mean, if I continue using the MAPD, I'm increasing the dimension of the one form that I'm using. So it means that the algebra that I'm working on should, you know, pair with this. And that's why I'm working or I define what they're saying with the graded algebra. I impose this relation again. And then I write again what is the relation of my maps. Now, there are many of these elements. There are many of these elements of my algebra, regarding of the map D, do not commute. But sometimes there are a few elements that do satisfy the commutation relation. And every time that we have something that is unique or does commute, we like to highlight them because they are kind of the star of the show, to say something. And in other words, when we do calculations, When we do calculations, these are the ones that save the day because instead of having this, you commute and you can reduce your calculation. So, this is one of the start of the show, which is if I can find an element in the set of one forms such that satisfy that for all the elements of the algebra, when I take the differentiate of this, or any element of the algebra, it's exactly as a connotator of this element. Then, this, I'm going to say that this is. Then this, I'm gonna say that this is my inner element, the theta one. And also, I'm gonna say that the algebra is going to be inner. Why is useful? Because it simplifies a lot of the relations when I'm trying to define the set of one forms, because I haven't said how to construct them. But when I define these things, this relation in here simplifies a lot the expression of my elements of my algebra. My algebra. So now that I have more or less what is the concept that I'm going to use, like the basic thing that I'm going to use to construct the geometry, I should be able to introduce more things. Because we are working in an algebra, these things works should work with over the real numbers, over the complex numbers. Over the real numbers, probably. Real numbers probably is too small, the space that we can work, but over their complex numbers, we have to be careful with it. You should probably use to work with the star algebras, but I have to say how this star property in the algebra is going to adapt to the mechanism that I'm showing here. So, among other things that I have to say in order to do reminding geometry. Reminding geometry, I have to introduce what is a metric. Now, why I'm saying this because I am working in the most general way, and because of the way I'm defining the things, I'm just seeing that my metric in here can be seen kind of as a matrix, if you think so. But it also has to satisfy Also, it has to satisfy some properties. So, I want that if I have a metric, a quantum metric in here, I want to know the inverse of these things. Why? Because if I don't impose these things, when I'm doing calculations, I need the inverse of something. I cannot find it. So I have to impose it. If I'm choosing a metric, I should be able to find inverse. As you can notice, I have to impose or kind of force, or how do you say? Force, or how do you say, compatibility. So basically, making all the elements that we know in Riemannian geometry compatible with the basic notions that I'm introducing here. And as something nice that we have in here is that if I define the metric here, the quantity metric like this, it does satisfy that it commutes with the elements of the algebra. And this, NEMA, it's not so hard to prove, it's in the proof, it's in the book of. It's in the book of my professor, and it's super useful because we have commutativity here, and the metric is something that we use a lot. So, this thing is nice. Now, let me clarify something. I'm abusing of notation. So, when I'm thinking G here, I'm thinking in G I J S I S J with S I in the one forms, and this G here is basically just Is basically just the GIJ that I'm working based, so that makes sense. What else? So I need the star structure. I need to understand what happens if my algebra has complex numbers in here, how to relate this with my mappings. And the way to do is I have to make compatibility with the inverse of the metric and also with the map D and also with my D and also with my star element that is the kita, the inner element. Are we good somehow at this point, more or less? So now the good thing, which is, when I say the good thing, which is my work. So we apply all the formality that we have. We propose at this point that the inner, the set of one forms has exactly this dimension, and that's because of the It is dimension, and that's because of the dimension that I'm working with my algebra. And I propose that it exists, and then with the relations that we know that it has to satisfy to have an inner element, the relation that it has to satisfy with the connotator and the wedge product, I can't recover what is exactly the explicit way of the set of one forms in here. So it is a different approach because we propose that they exist and then we They exist, and then we do a lot of computations, a lot of calculus using the formalism in order to force these to have a very explicit structure. And with all these restrictions or compatibility conditions for the false sphere, we have that our theta, our inner elements, is not as ugly at all. Are we good? It's not ugly, but it is what it is. So now. So now that I have the most basic, the most fundamental things in the Punto-Riemannian world, what I need is to see what happens with the connections. At the end of the day, I think the first fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry is finding the quantum Leviticus Vita connection. So the first step after choosing an algebra and saying I'm doing Riemannian geometry. Doing reminding geometry should be recovering that thing. And that's the goal, the goal in here. But what is the connection? So, because I'm working in a non-commutative world, I should know what happens in the left and in the right-hand side. But as you can notice from the left-hand side, I need a way to relate the elements of my one form. Of my one forms between each other. And for this, I have the braiding. If we want to be very, very simple, the most simple expression of the braiding when it exists is going to be just flipping, changing the sides, which is... But the definition that I didn't put in here because it's super long, super ugly, is it's a very big expression. So when I worked with this FOSI sphere, the expression became very big. Falsy speared the expression became very big. But we kind of forget about the ugly expression because it was very, very, very, very hard to do the computations. And we only thought this as the flip map. Now, when we have this information here, we want to know what is exactly a quantum Levy-Shibita connection. And basically, what I'm thinking like this, just remember that. What I'm thinking like this, you remember that when I'm using G, I'm thinking G I J S I tensor S J. So it's basically using the definition using the definition of this thing in here with the S I S J G I S using this. And if it satisfies or I have to find the condition such that satisfies that this thing is zero and such that the torsion free is also zero, that's our condition in the in the classical world. Condition in the classical world. If I found those things, then I can see if I can recover or how is the expression of the Levi Shivita connection in here. And the solution for this problem is that it not only exists, it's also unique. Where is it? Here is my quantum Lebesgue connection. And I did impose some things in my path, like the metric that I choose the entries. Like the metric that I choose, the entries I choose them to be either real numbers because it was easy to compute it and it was forced in some of the calculations later on. So having this unique quantum Library data connection, being in this expression, which basically is only knowing the trace of the metric and that's it, you have it, it's very beautiful, it's very simple, and usually in the non-commutative world, having such a nice expression. Having such a nice expression for something is rare. Now, to finish one more minute, I guess. I just want to say some conclusions about this. I did mention at the end, I didn't mention, but I did put this at the end. Well, I didn't say, but let me say it. So these are exactly if if if you ask me what is the result of the quantum manner geometry in the falsy sphere. Many geometry in the false sphere, if you know the theory, I just could tell you this expression. If you see, we introduce everything that we have before. The SI expression was constructed using my inner element. I propose a very basic expression of my connection in order to work in here and then working towards with the formalism that we have here, I could find out the Here, I could find out that this connection is exactly explicitly given by this expression in here. The condition for the compatibility and the torsion for you to construct the Levy-Shibita connection are not as complicated as you can see. And finally, and I'm not going to say too much about this, it is possible to do more things. One thing that you can do is you can try to construct. Is you can try to construct what is gravity in here. You have to use an integral and you have to have a lot of luck choosing the cutoffs for your integral. Also, you can work in FOSI monopole, which is another connection. You can construct more connections and try to get a direct operator, which among connections it has more elements in here. More elements in here, and this is not my work, but of a peer, of the same supervisor, of course. You can also try to construct what is a black hole, what the concept of black hole. And finally, as you can see, there are a lot of things that you can construct. Everything is related, which algebra you use, how much that algebra can give you using the quantum Riemannian formalism that we have. Sometimes the algebra just doesn't want to cover. The algebra just doesn't want to cooperate, and then you try another model. Of course, this is toy model of quantum gravity somehow. And that's it. I promote it myself because otherwise no one is going to have it. And I promote my peers, I don't feel bad about this. So thank you. Questions? Yes? Yes. Can I actually have a curvature? Yes. I didn't put it. Yeah, it mine is flat, but there is a way to check the curvature. Yeah, the rishi scalar, the rishi tensor. Yes, yes, there is a whole world of things that we can do. But I mean, the questions are not so nice the first time that you see them, so it's too much to quit. But yes, yes, you have them. You can do it. You mentioned the Dirac operators on the last slide. Does this stuff interface well with like these this approach via spectral triples and things like that? Yeah, so the DIAC operator I use it to construct the spectral triples of the allying cones version, but with the geometric version, because at the end of the day, the allying cones one is so big, it uses a lot of functional analysis, so you don't really see the geometric. So you don't really see the geometry that is underneath. And what is doing this, it is compatible with that, but allows you to see the geometry because you're working with the elements very explicitly. So you are able to see how it's really to work in that. But yeah, I mean, that's one, that's it. Another algebra that I choose to work in that. But yeah, yeah, it is connected. Um I was wondering what do you what does the word fuzzy mean to fuzzy sphere or fuzzy? Yeah, I don't remember the paper, but someone at some point given these relations that I given this way to express this this is developing algebra. This is developing algebra, and even this relation and this way to express this relation, it decides to put Faucy sphere to that expression. But more than that, I mean the hard thing is finding the representation to find exactly explicitly this part in here in the quotient and and that's it. I mean it it is determined, I I have the somewhere there the the reference, but it is just I'm sure is quite an old reference. Any other questions? Questions from those online? All right, well, let's thank the speaker again. And we have a 33-minute coffee break.
