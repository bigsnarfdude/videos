So it's my pleasure to introduce our last speaker today, Dolapo OE2B. He's going to talk about the system that angles of inductive limits of one-dimensional non-computing CW complexes. Thank you. I would like to thank the organizers for the opportunity to give a talk today. So, to start with, any way to see the one-dimensional One way to see a one-dimensional connected finite CW complex is as a finite graph, where the finite discrete space consists of the set of vertices, and then each of the units interval corresponds to an edge. So, if we take X to be unit circle, which is a one-dimensional connected finite CW complex, then it is known that we can consider the continuous function on this unit circle. On this unit circle, in this way, as a sub-algebra of the spheres of continuous function on 0,1. And another way to formulate this is as this. We can also write this or consider the continuous function on the unit circle as a sister subordinate of this turret sum, where f of 0 is equal to v naught of lambda and f of 1 is equal to beta 1 of is equal to beta one of lambda, where beta naught, beta naught, beta one are identity maps. So this example gives an intuition into how to generalize this one-dimensional connective finite CW complex into the non-commutative setting. So instead of consider the space of complex number, we can consider the space or we can consider finite dimensional system Jiva and then our map beta is beta naught. Our map beta 2, beta 0, and beta 1, we will be mapping from one finite dimensional system to another finite dimensional system algebra. So, in general, given two style morphism that maps from one finite dimensional system algebra to another finite dimensional system algebra, we call system algebra of this form one-dimensional non-commutative CW complex, in short, NCCW complex. And then we can consider that. And then we can consider the spectrum of this sister algebra. We can identify the class of the spectrum with this, which consists of the spectrum of E. So E is a finite dimensional sister algebra, so we can consider it as a direct sum of material algebra. So the spectrum will just be projection of each component, I mean projection to one part of the component, and also the second part here. And also the second part here is talking about second part is talking about evaluation at a point between zero and one, and after that we project the resulting answer. So we identify the spectrum of A in this way. And then some examples of one-dimensional NCCW complex include the space of continuous function on one-dimensional. function on one-dimensional connected finances of B-complex as we mentioned in the previous example and also include other examples such as the dimension draw algebra so we we place some minor assumptions on our on set of unital one-dimensional NCCW complexes. So the first assumption is that we assume that Assumption is that we assume that the direct sum of beta naught and beta1 is symbolic. This assumption allows us to consider one dimension, A as a sub-algebra of the space of continuous function from 0 to 1 into F. So that is the use of this first assumption. And the other assumption is also natural. We're saying that we can, the image of each of the beta naught of beta 1 is just. Beta naught of beta one is just arranging the element on the diagonal. So, with these two assumptions now, we can see that the B defined here actually may make the standard sister diagonal in the space of continuous function from zero, one to the matrix of Graph. So, in this case now, given B in this way, we'll see that F of T is a diagonal matrix for all T. Diagonal matrix for all T, a member of 0, 1. The second assumption about arranging the element on the diagonal also implies that this A must also be a diagonal matrix. So this is like a standard sister diagonal of A. Then we also have a bit of motivation to. Bit of motivation. The reason why this direction is considered is because of the work of Ling, the starting point, kind of that every perceivable simple sister of diva has a sister diagonal. In this case, there's assumption of simplicity, and also most of the building blocks are one-dimensional and simplicity of E-complex. And then if one work to remove the assumption of simplicity was done by Lee and Was done by Lee and Rad, where they showed that every unital inductive limit of homogeneous systems, whose building block has spaces of dimension at most one, in this case now, each of the building blocks are actually one dimensional NCCW complex. They show that this inductive limit has a sister diagonal. So, to work in this direction, we consider the inductive limit of. Inductive limit of one-dimensional NCCW complex in general. So, to move forward, we recall the definition of standard map. A unit style morphism that maps from this homogeneous sister algebra to another homogeneous sister algebra is called a standard map. If we can find a unitary such that we can write five. We can write file of H in this form, U, and then we have the composition of H with the eigenfunction on the diagonal. This map is kind of special because it characterizes the behavior and the possibility of mapping sister diagonal from the domain to the codomain. Thompson showed that we can write a standard. Show that we can write a stabomorphism from the left-hand side, from the domain to the codomain, if and only if it maps a diagonal of a sister diagonal of the codomain, of the domain to the sister diagonal of the codomain. So, this is another property of this standard map is that every style morphism from this commuter scale division can be approximated by the standard map. So, and then since the So, and since the domain and the codomain in this case, they are both one-dimensional NCCW complex, we can extend this definition to one-dimensional NCCW complex. So, to extend this definition, we consider a partition, we want to extend this definition to n standard map. So, the interval, comma, one is partition into n sub-interval, and then on each. interval and then on each interval the on each sub interval we have a standard map. So we have an interval command one we partition it into n sub interval and then on each interval we have a standard map. So we can combine all these unitaries and then we can define a piecewise continuous function from 0 comma 1 to the map m. So in this case now, and then it should be noted that if we have just one unitary, then that is the case of the standard map. So this is a generalization of the first definition. And also, since we assume that we place two assumptions on our B, on our on one NCCW complex. NCCW complex, the first assumption allows us to consider B as a sister algebra, sub-algebra of the continuous function from zero, one to F prime. So because of this, we can consider a projection to each of the components and then consider and use the first definition to show that to define a style morphism from two one-dimensional SNCCW complex as a standard map. As a standard map. As an example, we have this A, which is a one-dimensional NCCW complex that is defined by beta naught and beta1. And also, in this particular piecewise function, it's continuous. Our U1 in this case is actually the identity map, and then the U2 is the permutation matrix 1001. Matrix 10001 and 010. So this is an example of a two standard map. So to construct the sister diagonal we need, we use the result of Lin that says that if we have an inductive limit and then the connecting map satisfies some property such as it maps the diagonal of It maps the diagonal of the domain to the diagonal of the codomain, and then it is regular. That is, it also expects the normalizer to map one normalizer to another normalizer. And also, we have that the conditional expectation that they are compatible. So, in this case, we can say that the inductive limit of the sister diagonal of each of the building blocks is actually the sister diagonal of the original inductive limit. Don't you get the compatibility and the expectation automatically because of the extension? Yeah. So the first result we have is that just like for the standard map, every star model between two one-dimensional NCCW complex can be approximately. CW complex can be approximated by the unita M standard map. And also, if the map is unitar, then the M standard map that we construct will also be inductive. I mean to say inductive. So in this case now, we know that we can approximate any style morphism by a M standard map. So our final result is to say Result is to say that if we have an inductive limit of the unit separate processor with A, where each of the AN is an element of one-dimensional NCCW complex with trivia K1 group. We also assume that the connecting map are unit and inductive. Then we have that A as a sister diagonal. So the idea of the proof is to go back to the first result here. First result here. The result says that we can approximate any star we morph using between two dimensions of B complex by a standard map. But we want more. The standard map that is constructed here, from that standard map, there is an associated piecewise continuous function. Now, for that piecewise continuous function, we want the image to be a permutation matrix. But from this construction, we can't have a permutation matrix. We can't have a permutation matrix as the image of each of these piecewise continuous functions. So, the reason why we need this extra assumption of trivia K1 group is because with that assumption, we can use the result, the classification result of muon of the inductive limit of one-dimensional CW complex with trivia Q1 rule to actually show to actually say that we can approximate phi n by a psi n. By the psi n, and then this psi n, the endpoint of the associated piecewise continuous function, the permutation matrix. So that is the first step. The first step is to approximate by a standard map, M standard map, such that the initial and final point, their permutation matrix. Then with some modification, we can redefine AN to be AN. A n to the a n bar and also we define sign to sine n bar. Now in this case now the sine n bar is also a m standard map. In this case m n standard map for each of these n. And then the image of the unit tab is there. The image of permutation matrix. So it makes it easy to transfer, to map diagonal matrix to diagonal matrix, and also it Dynamic phase and also it makes it easy to verify all these properties and then we can conclude that he actually has a sister diagonal. So I would like to stop it for now and I believe we can go ahead for configuration. Any questions? Uh
