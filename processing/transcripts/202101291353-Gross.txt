Get the link and join us for as much of that afternoon as you can. It's been a who's picking up the funding then? Well, so Nimbus will continue as a center supported by the University of Tennessee in its moving into the College of Arts and Sciences. And the focus, of course, is going to be quite different from what we've been able to do with NSF support. With NSF support. But the focus will be very much on issues associated with Tennessee and challenges at the university. So at any rate, it will continue. And I'm very proud of the many, many things that we've accomplished. And thanks to all of you who have devoted time and effort to participating in things. Thank you for leading it. Sure. Now, Eli's not on, I don't think. Eli's not on, I don't think, but I had to put up this slide. So, this is taken from the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems program, the CNH program that NSF supported for almost 20 years. And I did want to point out that the expectations from this program were that it included dynamics of the natural system, the human system, the processes by which the human system affects the natural system, and the reverse. System and the reverse. So that was the expectation of the program. And as all of you who are involved in this know, we've heard again and again that some of the challenges associated with this are the mismatch between temporal and spatial scales at which the different sort of organizational levels of these things go on. As Madar just pointed out, the main conceptual models for the human systems are really not The human systems are really not quite as agreed upon as they are for the natural systems things, in which we've got logistic model and Atka Volterra and hosts of other things that although they differ from model system to model system, they're at least a standard upon which to build. And also the rules for coupling are unclear. And I'm sure that you can come up with other things that are challenging about this. So before I go on and talk about climate systems, I want to click on the client. To talk about climate systems, I wanted to talk about something that's related to this because it's of great interest to those of us who run synthesis centers and how we do this kind of coupling matters to this group. So here's a question. Can we actually measure how challenging it is to link human and natural systems? And here I argue that you should actually get some data on this. And so that's what. Data on this. And so that's what a group of us did with support from CISYNC. So Yuna Shin is a postdoc at CISYNC, just ending her time there. Katie Lacasse is a psychologist at Rhode Island College. And Brian Beckage, who's participating in this, is a computational data scientist, ecologist and jack of all trades at the University of Vermont. And so we asked the question, how coupled is coupled human natural systems research? So this is part of a paper that's So, this is part of a paper that's currently in review in Ecology and Society. And I thought it would be interesting here to look at how difficult it is to actually carry out these linkages because all of us are involved in collaborations in which we're trying to do this. So the objectives of this study were to evaluate the degree to which interdisciplinary research teams that actually were designed to study couples, human natural systems, really did post. Systems really did publish research that displayed these sort of two-way linkages between systems. And is there any indication that academic disciplines of the team leaders and the members are in any sense important predictors of achievement of those two-way linkages so that you can actually carry out this really interdisciplinary research? And what analysis methods most affect the achievement of two-way linkages? So, I'm going to just give you a quick summary of this, the data that we use for this. Data that we used for this were all the funded CNH programs from the National Science Foundation. We took 10% of them from each year between 2001 and 2018. So we actually chose 34 of the over 300 projects that were there. And we analyzed the publications from those projects. In this case, over 200 of them. We looked for author attributes. We did a coding for whether or not there was indeed two-way linkages between human and natural system back and forth. system back and forth or not in the publication. Happy to talk about the coding methods if anyone's interested. This is coding not programming. This is coding in the social science framework. And the results from this were not totally surprising, but somewhat. So only 13% of the total articles analyzed, even though the projects were supposedly going to include two-way links. Supposedly, going to include two-way linkages. Only 13% of the total articles listed as publications from these projects actually included two-way linkages. 25% of the articles had a one-way linkage from natural to human systems. 12% had a one-way linkage from human to natural systems. And 48% had no linkage between the systems at all. They were really focused on just natural system or just human system, mostly just natural system. A good thing is. A good thing is that almost half of the projects published at least one article with two-way linkages, but still half of them did not do what the program was clearly designed to do. And you could look at the impact on this on the presence of two-way linkages in the paper of several things. So if indeed the authors or the PIs were either in social science, were either in social science or they were interdisciplinary, and I'm happy to define that, but we viewed it as individuals who were associated with more than one unit, disciplinary unit, not all quantitative, I mean math and computer science didn't count as interdisciplinary. And so the presence of social science or interdisciplinary authors led to an increase in the likelihood of two-way linkages in the papers. Having biological or physical Having biological or physical science authors decreased the likelihood, as did the use of statistical or spatial analysis methods that also decreased the likelihood of two-way linkages. What increased it was that the paper used approaches that were either conceptual or kind of literature reviewed, or they used computational simulation as the sort of main approach in the paper. And we did a sort of regression tree. Of regression tree analysis of this. I'm not going to, I won't go into the details, but you can, on the lower axis, as you go from left to right here, you basically increase the likelihood of presence of two-way linkages. This is in the papers from these 34 projects or so. And as you move across, you see that the regression tree splits off, and so that you get methods which are not computer science, math, and engineering. Science, math, and engineering, more focused on simulation and literature review, and you get increase in interdisciplinary PIs. So the takeaway from this sort of analysis is that even for projects that were explicitly charged to link human and environmental systems, success is rare. There's some indication that success in linking human and environmental systems depends upon the team characteristics and the presence of And the presence of interdisciplinary individuals as either PIs or authors increased the likelihood of success for this. So, for those of us that are involved in putting together interdisciplinary teams with challenges at this interface between human and social systems, the takeaway is that it really does matter in terms of how the teams are structured. And so, there's a new synthesis center call from NSF that if anyone's involved, From NSF, that if anyone's involved in that on environmental data, you might actually take these kind of results into consideration. Anyway, that's a background. This has not been published yet. I'm happy to talk more about it if people want. But I'm now going to go on to, as Madar pointed out, we have a group of us that is highly interdisciplinary, including geographers, sociologists, psychologists, modelers, ecologists. Modelers, ecologists, climate scientists. And this group was the first and actually only joint working group between Nimbus and Sysync, just to make sure Sysync is the socio-environmental synthesis center based at the University of Maryland, run by Margaret Palmer and a wonderful group of other folks. And so we met a very large number of times to get to the point of being able to carry. Of being able to carry out this research. And obviously, the very first thing in these kinds of working groups is to figure out a joint vocabulary so you know what you're talking about together. And of course, this is the standard sort of image. We're kind of fried with regard to climate change. And the kind of overview of what I wanted to talk about today is to just do a real quick summary of climate models. Real quick summary of climate models, say something about the background on models for human behavior, a little bit about the theory of planned behavior, which was the approach that we used in the behavior components of this. Say something about how we sort of went ahead to link a human risk perception model to a climate model, and then say something about the results in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and global temperature. So that's kind of a quick summary. I'm going to Kind of a quick summary. I'm going to go over this fairly quickly, though. So, obviously, our objective here was to consider how human risk perception and behaviors arising from this might impact and interact with climate change. It was not really clear to us that the potential feedbacks from human systems are sufficient to significantly, in some appropriate metric, push the Earth system response to a different state. A different state. So, you know, all of the climate models have come to the general conclusion that unless there's some major changes, we're looking at increases of two to three degrees centigrade mean global temperature over the next 50 to 100 years. So we're really asking, are there circumstances in which risk perception, perhaps arising from major events, shifts in a manner that causes behavioral changes? Causes behavioral changes and associated policy responses that could measurably impact future climate. So that's the overall objective of this. I do want to point out that Mater pointed out a very, very simple coupled differential equation climate model. There's hosts of other ones here. And of course, the major ones that are part of the general sort of planning process. Planning process for what's going on across the planet are the fairly complicated three-dimensional general circulation models, but there's lots of other ones, including I'll mention integrated assessment models. And so one of the approaches that's used to sort of compare different models is what's called CMIP. We're now, there's a group is now working on CMIP6. So this is the coupled model inter-comparison project. Inter-comparison project. So the objective here is to use a whole set of general circulation models or general climate models to evaluate how realistic the models are in simulating the recent past, provide projections of future climate, both on the short term and the long term, and understand factors responsible for differences in model projections, including the sort of key physical key feedbacks in this. But the climate models But the climate models, including the most complicated GCMs developed today, really do not take into account feedbacks from human social system changes. They simply include some assumed fixed mitigation or adaptation strategy worldwide. So they generally just assume, oh, there's going to be a 10% per year decrease in greenhouse gas emissions or a 20% decrease or some other set of assumptions. There's a set of models. There's a set of models called integrated assessment models that take into account various human activities, some aspects of agricultural production, energy use, and their feedbacks to greenhouse gas emissions, but they also just assume some fixed scenario for these human activities. And this is sort of a graph of one of them. This is the MIT one. And I do want to point out that it does include a lot of the, quote, human activity. The quote human activity in terms of the feedbacks to the Earth system, and it includes general circulation models. And these integrated assessment models have been pretty useful in assessing the impacts of economics on Earth system responses and climate responses. But they really do not really have any kind of human behavioral or social system feedback. Social system feedbacks going on, except to the Earth system. There's not anything like perceived risk or other aspects going on in these integrated assessment models. So how do we model human behavior? Well, there's lots of approaches. We've heard about a bunch of them. I'm not going to make attempt to summarize these, except we've heard a lot about game theory models and indeed, you know, von Neumann and Morgenstern when they developed this theory. Develop this theory, we're certainly very hopeful that it would be tremendously useful, and it has been tremendously useful in coming up with ways of looking at human behavior responses. But I want to point out somebody else that you may not think of as doing human behavior modeling. But Isaac Asimov, a wonderful writer, wrote over a thousand books in his lifetime and published them too. He just didn't just write them. And just write them. And one of the things that Isaac Asimov did was come up with the notion of what was called the Foundation Series. And it is probably the most known series of science fiction novels built around the notion that there is overall guidance in what's called psychohistory, he called this. So he Called this, all right. So he applied the notions of, as he defined it, psychohistory is a branch of mathematics which deals with the reactions of human conglomerates to fixed social and economic stimuli. And it developed an entire theory associated with this. The hero of these books was a mathematician, Harry Seldon. And for a young person like me reading these books, it was always great to have a mathematician as the hero. A mathematician as the hero. And the approach led to the approach was essentially the approach of agent-based models. We call them individual-based models. And Don D'Angelis and I compiled a book associated with this. Now, it's hard to believe. It's like 25 years ago almost. And those models have now been used in many, many aspects of human behavior. If you're not familiar with the journal JASS for the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulations, Societies and social simulation. There's paper after paper, and they are using this kind of an approach and looking at behavioral modeling. If you're interested in a paper that I highly recommend for looking at a summary of alternative approaches to human behavioral modeling, this one, which I did put on the list of the Google Doc list that Mark sent around by Maja Sluter, came out in 2017 and it does do It does provides what they call the Mohub, the modeling human behavior framework for mapping and comparing and looking at alternative behavioral theories and how they might apply to social and ecological systems. And we're going to talk about in our approach only one of the notions that is talked about in that book. The one that we're going to talk about here is the theory of planned behavior. Theory of planned behavior. So, this is in psychology, it links beliefs and behavior, and the theory basically states that attitudes towards behavior, subjective norms, subjective based upon your perception of what others are doing and acting like, and what's called perceived behavioral control, which is whether or not you perceive that you actually have some That you actually have some way of your behavior impacting the system. And that these together shape an individual's behavioral intentions and behaviors. And this is due to Achen. It's been around for 30 years and was initially developed in terms of organizational behavior. But we are applying it here with regard to climate change. So the theory of planned behavior considers this connection between attitudes, perceived social norms. attitudes, perceived social norm, which we call PSN, and perceived behavioral control, PBC, how these interact. And the attitudes are people's positive or negative evaluation of behaviors. And the policies, in this case, we're talking about are related to climate change mitigation. So these are attitudes are affected both by risk perception of the adverse effects of climate and perceived Of climate and perceived efficacy. In other words, the extent to which people believe that behavior will influence greenhouse gas emissions. Now, I do want to point out that the theory of planned behavior, as it initially developed, was a theory of individuals. We are using it, treating it as a theory of group, in this case, global. We could do some disaggregation, but we haven't done that yet. We're talking about that. That's future directions. Okay. So, Okay, so perceived social norm here is the perception of how much a behavior is performed or approved of by other people. And that perceived social norm then influences the likelihood that people will undertake or support particular behaviors. And you saw that in Moder's model and in a whole variety of other models over the course of this week. Perceived behavioral control was not really in many of these models. It refers to people's perception of how much control they have over whether or not Control they have over whether or not they perform a behavior, both in terms of their perceived ability to do a specific mitigation act or to influence policymakers. So perceived behavioral control might be much higher for some individuals than for others. So we had long discussions about whether we would include celebrity factors in this kind of a model. Celebrities likely would have a much higher perceived behavioral Much higher perceived behavioral control than individuals who do not have the capability of influence a large number of other individuals. So the usual sort of picture for this theory of planned behavior is this one, that there's attitudes that are indeed affected by and affect the subjective norm or the perceived norms, the perceived behavioral control. That leads to intent. Perceived behavioral control that leads to intentions, which affects behavior, which then feeds back to the system. That's the sort of standard sort of graph for this. It's not clear that there are many mathematical implementations of it. We think we developed one of the first ones for this particular project. So our implementation of this, and I should say this was published in 2018 in Nature Climate Change. And nature climate change. And that group has spent probably close to three years working to get to a point in which we came to concordance about the key elements of this. So I'm going to go through the key elements. This does have this exact sort of feedback between the social system and I'm not going to talk very much about the carbon aspects of this, the physical models. The physical models. That's something that we're using basically from another modeling framework called C-ROADS. But I'm going to go through this in a little bit of detail so that you have some ideas of what's going on. So this climate social model, it has a number of components. First of all, what drives perception of climate change? And in our particular model, we did this by looking at the frequency. Did this by looking at the frequency of extreme events. And we characterize these in an explicit way based upon data. And that data led us to a formalized way of having a stochastic sequence by sampling extreme events based upon mean global temperature, which is the key factor that comes out of the carbon model in this. The carbon model in this. And then there's sensing, which is the assumption as well as data from our colleagues in sociology and psychology that perception of extreme events depends upon your own history of experience. So there's habituation in the model. Forgetting Forgetting at the same time, there's a rate at which you lose the memory of these extreme events. And this leads to a pool in the system dynamics sense of a number of extreme events that are like a stock and you have inflow to it. And that level of extreme events in memory then affects the perceived risk, perception of adverse effects due to climate change. And we don't really have... And we don't really have a good idea as to what the functional forms would be for this. So we actually studied three different ones, logistic kind of one, as well as linear and sort of cubic. In terms of on the horizontal axis here, we have an increased number of extreme events, and then on the vertical axis, a measure of perceived risk, which leads to potentially behavioral change. And so we analyze. Change. And so we analyzed all three of them and varied the magnitude of them, too. So that's one set of this linked to the extreme events and the response to it. Then we have perceived efficacy, which is a factor that is the extent to which a behavior influences greenhouse gas emissions. Attitudes, which are positive or negative evaluations of emissions behaviors. And we did not specify in this We did not specify in this that behaviors would always mitigate. They could indeed lead to people buying many, many gas guzzling SUVs and leading to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions as a possibility. There's perceived social norm, meaning the perceived extent to which a behavior is commonly performed or approved by others. There's also perceived behavioral control, which is the ability to perform a behavior or not. Behavior or not perform it. And there's emissions behavioral change that leads, this is the behavioral change that arises from the social model here to adjust greenhouse gas emissions. There's a limited capacity for changing greenhouse gas emissions that we put into the model. And then, of course, there's greenhouse gas emissions that arise from the social behavior piece that goes into a It goes into a carbon cycle model, which is a kind of, it's a model that was developed as an outcome from the big global circulation models, but is actually simpler in framework. That leads to the key driving variable, which is average global temperature in this. So that's the sort of the overview of the model structure. And there's a set of assumptions in this. There's a set of assumptions in this, okay, and we realize that those assumptions may bias the kinds of results. So, first of all, human behaviors do feedback to climate through a modification of carbon emissions, and that modification could be an increase or it could be a decrease. The behavioral responses arise from perceptions of risk established through experiencing and then remembering the progression of extreme events. the progression of extreme events. So it is extreme events in this which are driving behavioral responses, not something else. The annual number of extreme events is characterized due to mean global temperature conditions, and the number of extreme events we did as being stochastic, but increasing with mean global temperature. And again, this underlying statistical model for this was derived from data on temperature extremes. Temperature extremes. It was not derived on data from drought or precip precipitation extremes. That would be a somewhat different model. Precip's much more difficult to get at. We drove this completely through global temperature. And the modification of emissions due to behavioral feedbacks in this really are maintained in a pool that represent cumulative changes. Cumulative changes which reflect cumulative infrastructure change that continues to impact future emissions, even without additional behavioral responses. So, a key result is that if you don't have cumulative infrastructure change, and you can think of that as building out an electric car framework or wind turbine framework or something that is maintained and that allows greenhouse gas. Allows greenhouse gas reductions to accumulate through time. If it's just reducing electricity use by turning off lights or moving the temperature down in your house a little bit, that's generally not sufficient. At least that's one of the results of this. We did have that encoded in it too, but how to switch between them. And also the other assumption is that there's a sort of minimum level of carbon emissions, that no behavioral changes. That no behavioral changes can modify, and a maximum change allowed per time step that can go on. So, the pieces of this is, and I'm not going to go through this, this is coded in a standard system dynamics software called VENSIM. And so, there's a set for extreme event simulation, there's a set for attitude and perceived social norm calculation, and then there's Calculation and then there's feedback to greenhouse gas emissions that go into a carbon model that's called C-ROADS. Okay, again, happy to talk about this if anyone's interested in the sort of details. So we take a look at the results here in terms of the model dynamics for a change in global temperature. This graph has a number of things going on. I'm going to go through them. Then. So, first of all, it goes over the next hundred years or so. There's a baseline, which is here in solid A. Let's see if you can see my cursor here. That's the baseline there. And as you can see, oh, I should say, degrees centigrade here is a change from pre-industrial. Okay, so this is a standard way of looking at greenhouse gas. Looking at greenhouse gas emissions impacts on global temperature is to look at change from pre-industrial mid-1800s. And you'll note that right now we're at about 1.1, 1.2 degree centigrade higher mean global temperature than pre-industrial. And the baseline is this response. That response is sort of the average from a whole set of sort of Sort of what's called the standard scenario for greenhouse gas emissions if we don't do anything more than what we're doing now. And that leads to a five degree centigrade increase from pre-industrial, basically a four degree centigrade increase by 2100 from where we are now. And we're really fried then. And if you take that key assumption and you just increase or decrease. And you just increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 5% or so a year, that hardly moves this. Okay. So that's an indication that indeed we really do need to do something major in order to have a significant change. And now this CSM is our link climate social model results. Okay. And the key thing here is that And the key thing here is that we ran an enormous number of simulations under different assumptions about the model result. I'll show you a regression tree analysis in a minute. The largest of these leads to an increase that's over six degrees Celsius increase. And the smallest of them, and linking the climate and the social model, leads to an increase that's about About three degrees. So it's a reduction of almost two degrees Celsius from the baseline scenario. And I show this here because I want it to be clear that including the social responses into the climate model does not necessarily lead to a reduction. It can lead to a great increase as well. It all depends upon the way that the social norms interact. Norms interact with the extreme events, and I'll show you how that works in a minute. Okay. But the bottom line is that there is some hope in the sense that incorporating behavioral changes into a climate model leads to the capability for a significant reduction from the baseline model and projections of future global temperature. Of future global temperature. And this is to point out that there are real differences between how you incorporate perceived social norms, and in this case, perceived behavioral control, and their impact on temperature change from pre-industrial. So here the figure is, this is the baseline, okay, of five degree centigrade increase by 2100. Increase by 2100. So, what we're doing here is we're comparing the mean global temperature at 2100 for different model runs with different assumptions about perceived social norm and perceived behavioral control. And this shows, as I noted before, that there are cases in which in the model the perceived social norm is very low and underwrite assumptions about perceived behavioral control. About perceived behavioral control, that you can get great increases in mean global temperature. And it also shows that under assumptions about high perceived social norm, you actually get a significant reduction in mean global temperature by incorporating these social responses. Five minutes, Lou. Okay, thanks. So the regression tree that we did a lot. The regression tree that we did allows us, so here on the lower axis is mean global temperature at 2100. And so it varies in this case, 3.8 degrees Celsius was the low end, and 6 degree, almost 6 degrees was at the high end. And the regression tree allows us to partition out what factors in the linkage between the social model and the functional forms and so on that arise. That arise are ones that lead to the greatest reduction in mean global temperature. So it allows us to partition what really matters in terms of the social model in this regard. So some of the conclusions from this, integrated human behavioral and climate model results in global temperature change that ranges over a pretty wide range compared with the about five degrees centigrade from the core model alone. The core model alone that doesn't include behavioral change. Cumulative infrastructure change significantly reduced future climate change. Non-cumulative short-term behaviors, as I mentioned, have much smaller impacts. The magnitude of behavioral uncertainty in mean global temperature was similar to the physical uncertainty. Mater pointed this out from her simple model. We actually can come up with an actual level of uncertainty. An actual level of uncertainty associated with this in a complex linkage to a climate model. But the key thing is there that behavioral uncertainty matters. The social components with the largest influence were the functional form of response. I showed you several different ones of those. And the interaction of perceived behavioral control and perceived social norm. That was in that violin graph that I showed. And it really is attribution of extreme events to climate change. Attribution of extreme events to climate change and infrastructure mitigation that may most reduce climate change. And so attribution matters. And again, we can talk a bit more about that. So we've thought quite a bit about this since then. There's a very active group that is going on at CISYNC, which is also linked. We now are linked to a geoengineering group, which is thinking about how perception of geoengineering might impact. Of geoengineering might impact perception of climate change as well and the potential benefits of geoengineering approaches. But we published a paper earlier this year in climatic change, actually last year, in which we made an argument that indeed it is really time for the investment in these climate models, which is pretty large, that some of that investment should be made in linking to the made in linking to these social models and comparing, rather than what we did, comparing regional impacts to various behavioral models. Another next step is to take account of regional responses and again we've been working on that because you can get spatial coherence associated with accounting for space and different behavioral responses in different regions. Different regions. So, in sum, there is some rational basis for hope. Maybe not a lot, but there's some. That climate models have had a huge impact on our ability to project global trajectories and assess the impacts of policies for greenhouse gas mitigation. The next steps will really require us to not fear the incorporation of social science and to overcome the barriers to incorporating human behavior into climate models. So, I'm going to end there, and thank you very much. Going to end there and thank you very much for your time. I think I've left some time for questions. Thanks a lot. Very good, Lou. Thank you very much. So, I had a question, and I see Hans Copper's question sort of follows up one. I was going to ask you what the definition of an extreme event is. And Hans asked, how sensitive is your model to the choice of extreme events? Sure. So, what we did was we took the history of History of temperature. So, for us, again, I want to emphasize extreme events were not drought, they were not fires, they were completely driven by global temperature. And so, we took the history of this, get the statistical distribution, and looked at how that distribution shifted as global temperature shifted over the last 50 years or so. There's data on that, and looked at the 5% tail, okay. Five percent tail, okay. Uh, and uh, and the tails were not just increases, they were also decreases, okay. So, that so those were what we called extreme events. Um, and then we basically shifted the that distribution, which we assumed was normal, actually it's pretty close to normal, and and and and shifted the mean frequency of extreme events based on the event. Of extreme events based upon that shift in global and mean global temperature that came out of the global model. Did that sort of answer the question, hopefully? Well, did for me. Hans? Hans, you're muted. Okay. Can you give us any quantitative indication what happened, how sensitive this was? How sensitive. How sensitive what was in other words, changing the definition of extreme events to instead of being 5%, 1%, or yeah, we did not actually do a sensitivity analysis on what we called the tail of the distribution. Okay. I think, at least I don't recall that we did that. I mean, we did so many things, but I don't recall us doing that. Brian Beckage, who's on here, may remember. Beckage, who's on here, may remember if we did anything other than that, but uh, but I didn't remember that. Okay, Rebecca. You had a question about socioeconomics. Terrific talk, Lou. Thank you very much. I was just wondering how socioeconomics have come into your predictions. So, we've seen with COVID that there are a lot of groups that would like to follow the physical distancing rules but can't. But can't. So I assume there must be similar forces with who can choose. It's a great question. So we knew that we were missing the economic components of this. And so we, the current succinct group includes economists. We didn't actually have, well, Ann Kinzick is an economist too. But we realized that. She wasn't trained as an economist. No, no, I know, but at least she knows more than I do. She's married a lot. Yeah. So there's some osmosis going on there. Anyway, so the current research group that is supported by CISYNC is looking at a whole set of economic components linked to these kinds of behavioral things. So it's a very good question, and we realized it was a hole in what we did. Remember, what we really Hole in what we did. Remember, what we really did was just to get some idea as to whether incorporating behavior in this, you know, with a fairly detailed climate model really had any impact at all. Okay. Yeah, and that's huge. Just quickly, so then whether or not government policies can actually get you anywhere would also hinge on whether or not those policies financially supported those groups that. Those groups that are on the margins and can't afford the switch. So, I hope you're including that as well. Yeah, so the economic model does incorporate aspects of inequity. I'll just call it inequity like that. At least that there's not a model that's really one that we've agreed on yet on that stuff. Pauline. Yeah, somehow my question got dropped, but it's related to some previous questions. So we hear that behavioral change of the hots due to COVID, less fuel being burnt up in the air, et cetera. Has that changed any of the model predictions? Reductions? Oh, the COVID. So the COVID responses, you know, it's actually, if you look at the data, the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, yeah, they're good, but they still are nowhere near what needs to be done. And of course, they're not likely going to be. We don't want to do this for the next 50 years. And so it does provide some indication that. Does provide some indication that there is hope for behavioral change to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. But frankly, those reductions are not sufficient. And this is one reason why we're actually talking very seriously with the geoengineering folks, because it's not clear that relying on GM to move to electric cars by 20. To electric cars by 2035, I think is what the last announcement was, is going to be sufficient, even if many, many of the other car manufacturers do it and we reduce other emissions. Concrete is still a problem if you're building. Just a very small effect then? Oh, yeah, airlines.
