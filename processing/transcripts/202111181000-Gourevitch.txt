So, first of all, thank you very much for inviting me to speak here. I am really enjoying this conference. And I am very glad to congratulate Bill with his 80th birthday. Actually, I was lucky to encounter him on a very early stage of my career. He kindly allowed me to use his. His unpublished notes on Schwarz functions. So, Schwarz functions are very important for me as well and will be relevant for this talk. So, my talk is about joint work with Rami Eisenburg that appears on the archive. Today we uploaded a certain correction, by the way, which is taken account in these notes, of course. So let me introduce some notation. Let G. Subnotation and let g be a reductive group defined over the real numbers, x be an smooth algebraic variety on which g is acting algebraically. Gautic G denotes the Lie algebra of G. This purely n of g star denotes an important column in the Dolly algebra, and the Roman letters will denote the real points of the group or of the manifold. So S of X denotes the. So, s of x denotes Schwartz functions on x that Raphael talked about at extent. This is the same as smooth functions that are flat at infinity, or in other words, rapidly decay, or in other words, are bounded and stay bounded after you apply to them any algebraic differential operator, differential operators, pnominal coefficients. So, the bold X is called spherical. If it has an open orbit under Open orbit under Borel subgroup of G. This is equivalent to having finitely many orbits by Brion-Wienberg's theorem. Now, regular X, the real points of bold X, is called a real spherical if it has an open orbit under a minimal parabolic subgroup of the real points. So, our major goal is Our major goal is to study functions on X as a representation of G. So, which functions? I think many people are interested in two functions, specifically me and Rami Eisen, but we work more on smooth functions or on Schwarz functions. So this has been studied in depth by many people, but usually in some generality. So you have to put restrictions on X. To put restrictions on X, which first people first was considered spherical, symmetric spaces. And then it was realized that you can go further, you can go to spherical spaces or even further to real spherical spaces. So Berston gave some very general estimates on the support of the Plancharian measure. And then Patrick Delorum and Raban worked on symmetric spaces and then further. On symmetric spaces, and then further, the Worms Schlichtro, Kriots, Kobayazzi, Kobayashi, Oshima, Raphael, Guitvan, and of course, Friedrich Knob worked on spherical spaces. And it was realized that the geometry of these spaces is very important. So, one evidence that spherical spaces, or real spherical spaces, are somewhat tame, not as wild as general. Not as wild as general X is the following theorem by Kobayashi and Oshima. For homogeneous spaces, spherical is equivalent to Schwarz functions having bounded multiplicities, and real spherical is equivalent to having finite multiplicities. How do we measure multiplicities? For Schwarz functions, we measure them in this way. This is the dimension of the home to irreducible Castle-Man-Wallach representation. This is the multiplicity of sigma, dimension of home. Multiplicity of sigma, dimension of home into sigma. But for homogeneous spaces, this equals by a kind of Farbenius reciprocity to the dimension of the space of H-invariant generalized vectors. He mentioned in Patrick DeLauren's talk, he had those multiplicity spaces coming into Blanche-Real formula for L2 of X. So even for L2, it's important to measure these multiplicities. To measure these multiplicities, and these are the dimensions of those multiplicity spaces. It is technically important for them that these dimensions are finite. And in this talk, we propose a wider generality in which the small enough representations will still have finite multiplicities. And now I will define small enough and define this generality. Generality. But so, first, let me give an example of space that is spherical but not symmetric. You can take G modulo maximum compact subgroup, G module, and then the multiplicities, I think they were known to be finite maybe to Harish Chandra. The interesting thing proved by Bill Kasserman that they are all also positive. So, this is the part that I'm not talking about, though I did say something in Marseille. Though I did say something in Marseille about it, and if you want, I can repeat it. So I'm more interested in this part, which multiplicities are still finite. Okay, so we define a notion of xi-spherical spaces. To define it, we will need some notation. First of all, we need the moment map. So what is the moment map? For any point in X, we have action map sending. map sending group element G to G times X. Then we have differential of this map. It sends the Lie algebra to the tangent space at X. Then we have dual of this map, sending the cotangent space to the dual of the Lie algebra. So at every point we have a map from cotangent space to the dual Lie algebra. Altogether this glues to an algebraic morphism from the cotangent bundle to the Dual Lie algebra. Cotangent bundle to the Dole algebra. For homogeneous spaces, it has an elementary description, namely, the cotangent space is a quotient by the action of x of just the group times h perp. H perb is the annihilator of h in g star. The space of functions on g is a divination h. And then the moment map sends g, alpha to the co adjoint action of g on alpha. action of G on alpha. This is an element of G star. So that's what the moment map does. Using this moment map, we give the following definition. For an important orbit, O, we say that X is all spherical if the dimension of the pre-image of O under the moment map is at most the dimension of X plus half the dimension of O. So what I'm not So, what I'm not formally speaking about, but is somehow present under the carpet, is that all has a natural simplectic form. This half-dimension is just a Lagrangian dimension. So, more generally, for any union of Nilpotent orbits, or in other words, gene-invariant subset of the Nilpotent con ψ, we say that X is ψ-spherical if it is o-spherical for every orbit. If it is o-spherical for every orbit inside xi, altogether there are finitely many important orbits, so these are finitely many conditions. An equivalent formulation for homogeneous x x is all spherical if and only if the dimension of the intersection of all with the annihilator of h, the Dolly algebra is at most half the dimension of all. So, our first theorem is the following. For any parabolic subgroup of G, one can define the corresponding Richardson orbit. Namely, it is the unique important orbit that is open, that intersects PPERP by an open and dense set. So, PPERP is annihilator of P in G star. Using Kiring form, it will identify with the new radical of P. Nil radical of p, so it lies in the nilpotent cone and thus lies in finite union of nilpotent orbits. The biggest is called the Richardson orbit of P and the set of orbits that intersect P per orbits precisely the closure of this O P. So our first theorem says that X is spherical with respect to the closure of O P if and only if P has finitely many orbits on X. Many orbits on X. Any questions up to now? Dima, does your definition of ospherical, can it be stated in terms of Poisson commuting gene variant functions on kind of. Kind of. So we can do the following. I can give a definition which I think will be more conceptual, but it will lay a priori. I don't know if it's equivalent. Namely, it's the following. The intersection being isotropic. Instead of demanding that it is of isotropic dimension, I could just demand that it is isotropic. So for the case of closures of Richardson, Case of closures of Richardson orbits, it is equivalent. So being opi-bar spherical in the stronger sense is equivalent because both are equivalent to P having finitely many orbits on X. And in general, I don't know. Okay. It's just, it happens that our theorems only use this dimension estimate. So we said, why demand more? But it would be more natural to demand more. So let me say the first corollary of this theorem. If we take P to be Borel, then the closure of OP will be the whole Nilipotent cone. So being spherical with respect to the whole Nilipotent cone is equivalent to just being spherical in the classical sense. So this justifies the name of O bar spherical because it would mean for Borel to have finitely. Uh, for borel to have finitely many orbits on x, and for the borel, having finitely many orbits is equivalent to having an open orbit, something which is not true for a general parabolic. Going to the other extreme, being spherical only with respect to the zero orbit, is equivalent to having finitely many orbits under G, which is again a reasonable condition on X. So now let me say what do I mean by small enough representations. This will use the associated variety of the annihilator. So let me define this notion. Let u n of g denote the ends upon Karabikov width filter of the universe enveloping algebra of G. The associated gradient with respect to this filtration is, of course, the symmetric algebra of G that can be Algebra of G that can be viewed as algebra of polynomials on the dual algebra. Then, for any two-sided ideal in the universal enveloping algebra, for example, annihilator of a representation, we denote by ni of i its associated variety, which is the set of zeros of the symbols of i in G star. So we take all the elements of the ideal for each. Take all the elements of the ideal for each of them. We consider a symbol in the symmetric algebra. View the polynomial on G star, take zeros, intersect all those zeros, so take common zeros. This is a sub-variety of G star. If I is invariant to conjugation by the group, then this variety will also be invariant to conjugation. And if I includes, if I intersects the center of the universe. Select the center of the universe Molopic algebra by finite by as an ideal of finite codimension, then this associated variety will lie in the nilipotent cone. So for a G-module M, we denote its annihilator by n of M, and then we consider associated variety of the annihilator. Now we consider the category of Castleman. We consider the category of Castleman-Wallach representations, namely finitely generated, smooth admissible fresh representations of moderate growth. And as Castleman and Wallach proved, this category is abelian, surprisingly, even though there are many analytic words in its definition. Then, for any subset of the important column, we denote mu psi of g by mu psi of g, the subcategory consisting of representation. Consisting of representations with associated variety of the annihilator lying in psi. So, as I said, this associated variety always lies in important cone. So, taking psi to be the whole n of G star, we get the full category. So, our second theorem is that for any closed G-invariant subset, for any xi-spherical G-manifold, and any representation. And any representation, a Casimir-Wallach representation with a social variety of the annihilator lying in this subset, the multiplicity of the sigma in Schwartz functions on X is finite. So this is our main theorem. Let me tell you some corollaries for restrictions. So if H is a reductive subgroup of G, active subgroup of G. We want to know more. We want to know when a representation of G, when a certain representation of H appears with finite multiplicity in restriction of a representation of G. So if both are small enough, this will happen. So one criterion for being small enough is the following. Take a parabolic subgroup of G and a parabolic subgroup of H. If the Of H, if the set of double cosets G mod P mod Q is finite, which in general doesn't happen because Q is only a parabolic subgroup of H, not of G. H could be much smaller. But if this happens, then for any representation pi that is P small, pi in mu O P bar of G and tau in OQ bar of H, the dimension of the home is finite. So one example of So, one example of such a representation will be degenerate principal series induced from this parabolic P. So, from a fine-dimensional representation of P. But if both point our degenerate principal series, then the statement is not so difficult. Its strength is that it's completely uniform. We only need to know the size of the representation and not its structure. So, luckily, more or less, such More or less, such triples consisting of a subgroup of H and two parabolic subgroups, one of G and one of H, have been more or less classified. Sorry, I'm jumping too fast. I first need to derive another corollary. So in the other corollary, I want either it has two parts. In one part, tau is arbitrary, in the other part, pi is arbitrary. So in the first part, we put restriction. We put restriction, we fix a parabolic subgroup of G such that G mod P is spherical as an H variety. So G acts on G mod P on the left, but thus also H acts. And suppose that already for the smaller subgroup H, this G mod P is a spherical variety. Then, for every P small pi, its restriction to H has finite multiplicities. Just all representations of H appear. Of H appear with at most finite multiplicities. And the other direction is we fix a parabolic subgroup of G, sorry, of H that is spherical already as a subgroup of the bigger group G. It's somewhat rare, but happens. Then any representation tau in U of Q bar of H, its small induction, which is a Schwarz induction. Which is a Schwarz induction defined by Doc law, has finite multiplicities. And now, such triples consisting of, or pairs consisting of H and Q, or also such pairs consisting of H and P, have been more or less classified. So for simple G and symmetric H, they were classified by Hainishiyama, Ochiaya and Oshima. Gamma, Ochiyai, and Oshima for classical, for simple and classical G, but all reductive H by Avdiev and Pitochov. Avdeye and Pitochov also have a strategy for any G, but only for one part of the corollary. I don't remember which part. I think the first part. I think it's another good point for questions. Okay, and then if not, then let me give another corollary where G is not simple. On the contrary, let G be H times H. Then we don't even have to write it in the corridor. So let H be reductive group and let P and Q be parabolic subgroup. P and Q be parabolic subgroups such that H mod P times H mod Q is spherical under the diagonal action of H. Then for any pi in U or P bar of H and any tau in U or Q bar of H, the attensor product has finite multiplicities. So there is this famous triple product by Prasad for SL2 tensor product. Tensor product has is multiplicity free, but that's just for SL2. And then, for if we take tensor product of any representation by finite dimensional representation, then of course it's admissible and has finite multiplicities. But now we say we can take tensor product of two infinite-dimensional representations of any group, but they should be not so big. How much? How much not so big? It should satisfy this, but all such triples were classified by Stenbridge. Let me give you two examples. One example for GLN, let us put no restrictions on pi, but require tau to be minimal. Then pi tensor tau has fine conspiracies. Another case, let H be classical and pi and tau be small. So small means that. So, small means that the Siegel parabolic sees them, or equivalently, it means that every matrix in the associated variety of the annihilator squares to zero. In terms of partition corresponding to the orbit, all parts should be twos or ones. So, biggest part is two. So, for such representations, tensor product has fine multiplicities. It will not be admissible because it will have infinitely many. It will have infinitely many different infinitesimal characters. But it has fine multiplicities, which, by the way, is equivalent to the statement that if you consider, if you project it on a single infinitesimal character, then this projection, this quotient, will be admissible. So one can define translation operators using not just fine-dimensional representations, but But using minimal representations for JLIN, for example. Then, will they have any good properties? I don't know, but at least those functors will take you to admissible representations. So our result also extends to certain representations of non-reductive age. So, for example, we For example, we can take a generalized Schalaika model. So we can take G to be GL to N and then consider inside it the parabolic whose levy is G Ln times G L N and unipotent radicals and matrices. Then we inside the levy we consider a diagonal J L n, which is the stabilizer of a generic unitary character of U. And we take H to be Of u and we take h to be m times u then we consider so as usual she like a model is uh you take uh you take infinite unitary character the non-degenerate unitary character of u, let m act on it trivially and induce. Now, there are twisted Shellika models on which you let M act by a character, but we say you can let M act by any minimal M act by any minimal representation. So, for GLN, this notion is not so widely used minimal representations because, unlike other groups, for GLN, they are not unique. But what I mean here is that the society variety of the annihilator is the closure of the minimal orbit. So, for example, the general principle series induced from the mirror bolic sample. So, this we call generalized challenges. Generalized Shaleika model taking a minimal representation of m, tensoring with a unitary character of h, and inducing. It doesn't have to be non-degenerate to have finite multiplicities. This is needed to have multiplicity one in the usual case, and I have no idea whether we have multiplicity one in this case, but we have finite multiplicities. And the same thing can be done with. And the same thing can be done with G equals O4N. This eagle parabolic, whose levy is GL2N, stabilizer of a character will be sp2n. And the orbit we can take minimal, but we can even take it to be next to minimal. Like pi with mu O bar of m and extend by character and induce. Any questions up to now? Any questions up to now? Okay, so these are some sufficient conditions. To which extent are they necessary? There is the following theorem by Tauchi. If P is a parabolic subgroup, if all the generate principal series, namely inductions from P to G of fine-dimensional presentations, have fine Dimensional presentations have finite H multiplicities, where H is some algebraic subgroup of G, then H has finitely many orientable orbits on G mod P. So mind you that in this theorem, P, G, and H are not both. So these are real points. So this condition in general is not equivalent to our sufficient condition. So this is a necessary condition because the size of this principal series is exactly OP bar. O P bar, it's a search to write of the annihilator, is the closure of the Richardson orbit of P. But this is not the same as our sufficient condition, but they are very close. For example, if G, P and H are complex reductive groups, if already the real points themselves are complex reductive groups, then they are equivalent. More generally, we can formalize the following corridor. Let P and H be defined over R, and suppose that for all but finitely many complex orbits, the set of real points is non-empty and orientable. Then we get that all the four conditions one can think of are equivalent. Namely, one is H being OP bar spherical, in the sense that G mod H is O P bar spherical. Second, that F Second, that every op-bar small representation of g has finite multiplicities in Schwarz functions on g mod h. Third, that h has finitely many orbits on g mod p. That's when we take the real points, finitely many real orbits. Fourth, finitely many complex orbits. All the four are equivalent under an assumption. But the assumption holds, for example, if H and G are complex reductive groups. Groups. In general, however, the conditions are not equivalent. Namely, the finiteness of complex double cosets is not necessary, and the finiteness of real double cosets is not sufficient to have finite multiplicities. So, an example of when this is not necessary is a real spherical. Real spherical varieties. For real spherical varieties, we have only a finiteness of this, where P is a minimal probability and not of this. And this is not equivalent. And the example when this is not sufficient was given by Tauchi in another paper. So, in general, there is a gap, but say for complex reductive groups or for quasi-split groups, well, for complex reductive groups, Well, for complex directing groups, for sure, they're equivalent for quasi-split. I don't know any contracts of so, of course, our theorems were inspired by some special cases. Actually, we were inspired by three things. But the first of them was branching multiplicities for degenerate principal series. These are the most accessible examples of representations of this. Examples of representations of this size. And multiplicities were completed explicitly in many cases by Fram, Ørsted, and Oshima, and other cases by Kobayashi. Another expiring example for us were degenerate Whittaker models, which are induction of characters from some unipotent subgroups, which are quite small and in general they have infinite multiplicities, but small enough. Infinite multiplicities, but small enough representations appear with fine multiplicities. And the third work that inspired me was a work about spherical varieties. It was a work of Venway Lee. So in parallel to our preprint, there appeared a preprint by Kobayashi, in which he considered conditions for bounded multiplicities. So, as he writes, there, associated variety of the annihilator by itself. Variety of the annihilator by itself cannot give conditions for bounded multiplicities. So his condition was for the representation to be distinguished with respect to another subgroup of G, which is, in his case, he takes it to be symmetric. But then the conditions he's getting are similar to the previous correlary or to this corral. It was some sphericity, sphericity of some quotient by. Sphericity of some quotient by parabolic. So let me show you some examples of non-Richardson orbits. So we had a criterion for OP bar. Let me show non-Richardson orbit. One non-Richardson orbit is the minimal orbit for the simple acting group. And it gives the following example closely related to how correspondence in type 2. So for So for G, let us take GLV. I think for G, I think this is a cheapo. For G, I would like to take just this. So let us take two vector spaces, V and W. Consider the simpliex group of V tensor W plus V star tensor W star. And as H, consider G L V times G L W embedded into G. W embedded into G. So G should be just this simple active group. And then G modulo, the Borel subgroup of H is spherical with respect to closure of the minimal orbit. So this implies some finite multiplicity. Implies some finite multiplicity, for example, over the complex numbers, but so, but how correspondence gives a much stronger multiplicity one? Yes. So this implies that all that you have that every irreducible appears with finite multiplicity as a quotient. How correspondence says that there is a unique irreducible quotient? So multiplicity one and So, multiplicity one and for only one reducible. But still, this was a stimulating example for us. Let me give another example in which our inequality is strict. So again, let G be simple active group. Consider the Heisenberg parabolic, namely a maximal parabolic whose unipotent radical is a Heisenberg group. And let O be the minimal orbit. orbit. Its dimension is 2n. While if we intersect it with P perb, we take P as our H, its intersection with P perb is 1. So this subgroup is parabolic and thus spherical. So it is spherical, which means this inequality is satisfied, but we demand weak inequality. In this case, it is a sharp inequality. Dimension of pre-imagendromu is. Dimension of pre-image under mu is sharply smaller. So, sharp inequality happens. In other words, the intersection can indeed be isotropic and not just Lagrangian. So, now let me tell you a couple of words about the proof of the theorem on finite multiplicities. We reduce it to a theorem on distributions. On distributions, the following theorem on tempered distributions, that is, a dual space to Schwarz functions. Let I be a two-sided ideal whose associated variety lies in the important cone of G star. Let X and Y be neophi spherical G manifolds. Consider the space S star of X times Y fixed by delta G and by I. Fixed by delta G and by I. So the space of delta G invariant tempered distributions on X times Y annihilated by this ideal. The claim is that this space is finite dimensional. Actually, we will need not just this space, but distributions with values in an algebraic vector band, which still will be finite-dimensional. So, how How is it related? Let us deduce from it the theorem two. Theorem two is on finite multiplicities. Yes, that neophyte, that psi, if x is, so here is the theorem. In short, if x is psi spherical and sigma lies in mu psi of g, then the multiplicity of sigma in Schwarz functions on x. In Schwarz functions on x is finite. So we prove it in the following way. Since sigma is admissible, there exists an algebraic bundle on the symmetric space G mod K, where K is a maximum compact subgroup, such that the Schwartz sections of this bundle map onto sigma. This E is just induction of any k-type in sigma. Let I denote the annihilator of sigma. Then, by definition of this mu C, as a search variety of this I lies in sine. And now home over G from S of X to sigma, it embeds into home from S of X to this big representation. And we can put annihilated by I, that's because sigma is annihilated by I. Annihilated by I. So this map into bigger representation will be annihilated by I. And thus, this in turn, by the Schwarz-Kernel theorem, embeds into distributions on x times y with values with standard product of bundles. Well, here it's a trivial bundle, so exterior product of the trivial bundle with E. Product of the trivial bundle with E. And the distributions, since here we have home G, the distributions will be invariant to the diagonal action of G. And since here the home is killed by I, so it will be here. So now we just need to prove this theorem on distributions, and we will be using D-modules, namely modules over the sheaf of algebraic differential operators. Differential operators. Now it's perfectly fine if we will assume for this talk that x is a fine and thus we don't have a sheaf, we just have one single algebra dx. But it's all the same. The algebra of differential operators has a filtration, geometric filtration, what's called filtration by the order of differential operator. And the associated gradient is regular functions on the cotangent bundle of x. On the cotangent bundle of x. So, for a finitely generated shift of dx modules, we can define its singular support. Namely, we use this filtration on the algebra and a finite set of generation on the module to define a filtration on the module. And then we can take associated gradient module. It is a module of regular functions on t-star x. It has a support. This is a closed subset of t star x. Closed subset of T star X does not depend on the choice of the filtration on the module. And Burston showed that its dimension is at least the dimension of X. Actually, it was later shown that it is coisotropic in T star X with respect to the nature symplectic form. One of the latest proof is by Gabber. So M is called holonomic if this. M is called holonomic if this inequality is equality. Holonomic modules have a lot of nice properties. They have finite lengths. This property of being holonomic is preserved by the six functors of growth and depth on the modules. But we use another theorem due to Berstein and Cashevar in different settings. In this setting, this is due to Berstein, but in another analytic setting, it was proven by Cashevar. I think it was proven by Kashavara much earlier and for also for cohomologists. So the theorem says that a holonomic D module has a finite dimensional space of solutions in tempered distributions. What does it mean? Solution? The module encodes a differential equation. The generators are indeterminants and the relations are the equations itself. Itself then, but we can also phrase solutions in language of D modules. This is home as D modules from M to S star of X. So the dimension of this home is finite. And from this, we deduce finiteness of these distributions. We can just write a demodial that they satisfy. So what is the D module? Fine invariance with respect to diagonal G we replace by invariance with respect to the Lie algebra. Invariance with respect to the Lie algebra. This is certainly differential equations, and the space could only be bigger. So, every Lie algebra element gives a vector field. Then, every element of the universe enveloping algebra gives a differential operator. So, being invariant with respect to this ideal is also a bunch of differential equations. So, there is a natural system of differential equations or natural D modules, such that home from this D module includes this space. Include this space. We just have to look at the equations and see what geometric conditions it imposes on the singular support. So I claim that the condition it imposes on the singular support are the following. So singular support is a subset of T star. In this case, T star X times T star Y or T star of X times Y. X times Y. y x times y has an action of g times g so it has a moment t star of x times y has a moment map mu x times y into g star times g star then invariance under the diagonal says that the moment map will land into in in the annihilator of the diagonal of diagonal copy of g inside g times g so it should land here in the purple to direct g and environment Strategy and invariance with respect to I means that the symbols of I annihilate, and this exactly means that the associated variety of the annihilator lies in psi, so the single support of the D module lies in the pre-image under the moment map of psi intersect delta G perp. And now we use a geometric lemma that under our That under our conditions that x and y are si-spherical, the dimension of this pre-image is at most dimension of x plus dimension of y. Actually, this is not surprising. We first wrote this condition and then decided what inequality to put on in the definition of sispherical. So, again, we define an HLD module such that the space of distributions is embedded into home. Is embedded into home from it to all distributions. And by this geometric lemma, the demodule is holonomic. By Berston-Keshewara's theorem, it's fine-dimensional. So we proved more actually not only the space fine-dimensional, it consists of holonomic distributions. So the proof of the layer might just follow from definitions, but let me spell it. The dimension of the pre-image is the following. So every Is the following. So every all the fibers here are isomorphic. The map is equivariant with respect to action of G times G, which acts transitively on O times O in G star times G star. So all the fibers have the same dimension, and thus the dimension of the premium of this intersection is the dimension of the fiber plus the dimension of this intersection. The fiber plus dimension of the intersection, so it's dimension of preimage of O under X, plus dimension of preimage of O under Y, and minus dimension of O so this is it. This is at most dimension of X plus the half dimension of all, this is at most dimension of Y plus half dimension of all, and we subtract dimension of all, all dimensions of all and their half. Of O and their halves cancel out, and we get dimension of x plus dimension of y. And I have a tipo. This should be O times O because it's in G star times G star. Then we intersect with delta G perp. And that's why we subtract dimension of O, also intersect with delta G perp. This is dimension of pre image of O times O. So that's the end of the proof, and let me pass. That's the end of the proof, and let me pass to open questions. First of all, we gave a nice geometric criterion for bar sphericity for Richardson orbits, but what is a criterion for non-Richardson orbits? Second, can we bound the multiplicities? So I said we cannot prove they are bounded using just a straight variety, but they are more refined invariant. There is the associated cycle of the representation, not of the annihilator. Representation, not of the annihilator, associated cycle of the representation itself. Maybe using this invariant or using some other invariant, we can write a formula that will bound the multiplicities. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for fine multiplicities? What should be the definition of real all-spherical? Also, in the proof of the theorem, we prove. So in the proof of the theorem, we proved that the relative characters given by the map, by any two maps, one from S of X to sigma and another from S of X to the Sigma tilde, for any two such maps, we are getting a relative character. If X is spherical with respect to such varieties of the annihilator of sigma, we show that they are holonomic. Next question is: are they regular holonomic? So, this is what Wenwei-Li showed. So, this is what Wenwei-Li showed that holds if X is spherical. Actually, first we showed that for spherical X, all no condition of sigma, for spherical X, all relative characters are holonomic. And then when Wei Lee built upon this and showed that they are regular holonomic, now we show that in this wider generality, they are holonomic. Are they regular holonomic or not? It would have very nice consequences. Another question. Uh, another question: Um, there is another proof of finite multiplicities for a real spherical due to Krautz and Schlichtru. And basically, it's not written in their proof, it's uh we wrote it down together with Kroots and Liu later, but basically they show that if G mod H is even real spherical, even not enough, if real spherical, then if you take the Harish Chandra module of sigma and restrict it to H. And restricted to H, it stays finitely generated. Of course, it will also have finite multiplicities once it's finitely generated. So, namely, sorry, it will have fine-dimensional space of H-coinvariance once it's finitely generated. So, my current question is: if G mod H is just spherical with respect to such to write of the annihilator of sigma, does this still hold? This is my last question. So, ah, no, one more question. All this makes sense periodically. Namely, the definition makes sense periodically. Our first theorem, geometric theorem, that O P bar spheristic equivalent to P having finitely many orbits, of course, also true periodically, it's a theorem in algebraic geometry. Do we have finite multiplicities periodically? Of course. Is PI decline. Of course, it will have to be proven by different methods. Cannot use differential operators. Maybe we can use some integral operators. I don't know. So we conjecture that it does. Happy birthday, Bill. And thank you all for your attention.
