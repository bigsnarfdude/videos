Thank you, Mauritio. Right, so I'd like to report on a project that is partly joint with Dominic Joyce on applications of cobordism categories to problems in gauge theory. So Let me start by reminding you that we can think of the Achia-Zinger index as a map from the Bordism ring actually of spin manifolds into KO. And let me also remind you that KO is, well, let's see. O is, well, C Z two Z two zero Z zero zero zero, depending on what star is. All right, so one of the tools that I'm going to use is a kind of categorification of this AHATMAP. To, well, it's a map, it's a homomorphism of groups. And at the first level, the categorification is going to be a functor of two groups, or sometimes also called Picard rupoids, which I'll try to describe as explicit as I can, at least in the first few cases. Right. Right. And then, after I've done that, I'll talk a bit about the applications that we have in mind to gauge theory. Right. So let me just remind you of the Clifford algebra. So the n-dimensional Clifford algebra, CLN, is the unit. Unital associative R algebra generated by n symbols and subject to the Clifford relations. The Clifford relations say that EI times EJ plus EJ times EI is going to be minus two is going to be. Going to be minus two, as Michael mentioned, times chronicle delta ij. Right, that's a that's an important player in index theory, as I'm sure you all know. And the group of units has an important subgroup called spin n. And it's mainly important because it has an interesting representation that we're using a lot. That we're using a lot, namely the spinner representation, which just to fix notation a bit, I'm going to call delta n. Right, now depending on n, I'm always doing real index theory here, by the way. Depending on n, sometimes the spinner representation will split into left and right-handed spinners, and this will also show up. And this will also show up in the definition of the index map, actually, that I had on the Blackboard in the beginning. Okay, let me also remind you that if we do have a spin manifold, so recall that a spin manifold is first and foremost, it's a manifold. It has a Riemannian metric, G, and it is also equipped with a principal spin n-bun. Principal spin n bundle, p spin some how I like to call it. So that's a principal spin n bundle, which reduces actually in the vector representation of spin n to the tangent bundle of x. So that's the data we're given if we are given a spin manifold. So, in particular, maybe I should have said this differently: P Spin is going to be a two-to-one cover of the usual oriented frame bundle. I should have said also we fix an orientation on X. Okay, so if we have that, then we can construct the spinner bundle on X, and it's going to be simply an associated bundle. Associated bundle using the spinner representation from before. Like so. So we take a Cartesian product and divide out by some anti-diagonal action of spinner. Okay, and the reason these are so important is that there is a differential operator that we can write down on a spin manifold that we cannot write down in general called the Dirac operator. And And it takes a section of this spinner bundle and spits out another section of the spinner bundle. And I'm guessing you've all seen the formula, it uses the Clifford multiplication and the covariant derivative induced by the Livita derivative on X. Right. Right. And in these certain dimensions n where the spinner representation splits, I'm going to adopt the usual notation that I'm going to split it as a d plus and d minus. V plus goes from the positive to the negative. Okay, so so much for background. So let's have a look at the first. So let's have a look at the first non-trivial, or maybe it's trivial, depending on what you think, case, which is n equal to zero. Right. I claim it's already interesting. Okay, so what do we have? n equal to zero. Well, the Clifford algebra is just generated by nothing, it was supposed to be unitary. By nothing. It was supposed to be unital. It was supposed to be in our algebra. So it's going to be R, which I like to write as one by one matrices over R. The spin zero turns out to be plus minus one and the zero-dimensional spinner representation turns out to be the sine representation on R. All right. All right. So, well, what does X look like? X is going to be a zero manifold, so it's going to be a bunch of points. And they're going to be oriented, so they'd also have some signs attached to them. And I was also assuming that this was a spin manifold. So we'd have a double cover of the frame bundle. Have a double cover of the frame bundle, which is actually just a double cover of X in this case. And the spinner bundle is the associated bundle. This actually splits into two parts. It's a slightly degenerate case in that usually these have the same dimension, but These have the same dimension, but actually, if n is equal to zero, one is going to be r and the other is going to be zero. And so the spinner bundle here over a point with the plus sign, if you work it out, it only has a positive component. Same here. This one only has a negative component, the other being zero, and this only has a positive component. So it looks something like that. Certainly, the Dirac operator is. Certainly, the Dirac operator is just going to be zero as a map from, well, sections to sections. What is a section? A section is actually just a vector. So the space of sections of the spinner bundle, say the positive spinner bundle, that's actually just going to be the direct sum over all these, all this x. I should introduce this notation for the fiber. Notation for the fiber. I sum over all points such that x is positively oriented. I sum the corresponding thing. And similarly, in the negative case. Okay, so what's the index? Well, according to what I'd written down, this should be something in K of. be something in KO of zero, which should be z. So I need to produce a number out of this. Well, it's the dimension of the kernel minus the dimension of the co-kernel, but it's a zero map. So it's actually just the dimension of the domain, which is that minus the dimension of the codomain. Same with the minus sign. And well, And well, each plus point contributes one dimension. Each negative point contributes a negative dimension. So it's actually just the number of points of x counted with signs. All right. So this is kind of just a numerical picture. There's no functoriality or anything. No functoriality or anything. So I haven't gotten there yet. The question is now: how can I extend this? How can I extend this to a functor where what I just described is what's going on on the object level? So also notice that what I Notice that what I've just written down, the index, this was the number of points, this didn't really use the spin structure yet. That's something that also makes sense just for oriented manifolds. But this is about to change. So now I'd like to define a functor from a boardism category. I think I like to call this board zero. Call this board zero of spin manifolds. So, well, the objects are just going to be zero-dimensional spin manifolds, as we just had. And the morphisms are going to be one-dimensional spin manifolds up to some equivalence relations that I'll be a bit more. That I'll be a bit more precise about later. Okay, so let me just draw a picture and explain how to get from this a functor. And I want to get into Z graded Z2 towards verse. So a Z2 torsor is just a fancy name for a two-element set. And Z-graded means that, well, it sits in one degree. It has also an integer attached to it. Okay. And it goes as follows. Well, let's take a morphism. That's what I haven't really explained what to do with those. What to do with those. So, amorphism is going to be first and foremost an oriented manifold going between zero-dimensional manifolds. Well, I mean, this is the familiar picture that you use to show that actually this is well-defined up to boredism, the number of points. And the number of points because you could pair off positive and negative points. All right. But, well, I've explained how to produce an integer. How do I produce a Z2 torsor from this? Well, in this case, I guess it's fairly obvious because we were assuming that these guys had spin structures. So we were assuming that actually each point has a natural that. Has a natural that X has a natural double cover. That's this P spin thing. Let's send over here for this point and over here as well. And what this functor is going to do. Do is it's simply going to associate to an object x. Well, the torsor is going to sit in degree number of points in x, that we figured out already. And the torsor is going to be, I'm just going to tensor all these Z2 torsors together in an unordered way. So I'm going to take some kind of unordered. Kind of unordered graded tensor product of these things. That's supposed to be a small x. So that tensor, that tensor that, and I'm seeking a map to here. So that's going to be my x, that's going to be my x prime. And well, in general, I can't do it. But if the morphism W has a spin structure, that's W, that means we have a corresponding double cover here, which I can just draw in quickly. So that might look like Look like this. And I've essentially, this is supposed to be a map of Z2 towards Earth. So I've essentially drawn the picture of what this map should be by drawing this picture. By drawing this picture here of the spin bundle of W. So, for instance, if this is A, this is the point B, this is the point C, and that's the point D, then the functor would map A tensor B tensor D, C, sorry. Sorry, which that's actually a basis vector of this torsor. If I tender these three together, that's going to map to minus D. Well, why is it minus D? A actually goes exactly to D, but B gets paired off with minus C. That's where the minus sign came from. And I guess you could be a bit more. And I guess you could be a bit more fancy and also allow maybe some close components like this. And then if it's the bounding spin structure, then I won't change anything at all. But if it's the unbounding spin structure, then I would have to introduce another minus sign to account for. To account for the appearance of this non-bounding spin structure here. All right, so how am I doing on time? 15 minutes. Right, that was the first case. And it was actually maybe kind of trivial because it didn't involve any analysis. This was just linear algebra, which is not a surprise in zero dimensions. Okay. So now I'd like to also briefly go over the n equal to one case, just so you can see some analysis as well. Still going to be fairly trivial, but just so you get the picture. So the one-dimensional Clifford algebra, well, it's one element squaring to minus one. That's going to be C and spin one. And spin one can then be viewed as O of one inside the one by one complex matrices. And the one-dimensional spinner representation is going to be C. And I'm sure you've all seen that the Dirac operator is just E I times D by D theta, where I'm thinking of closed manifolds X. Introducing some angular coordinate theta to parametrizes these. Okay, and O of one acts on C in the obvious way. So again, by plus or minus one. Well, there are two different spin structures actually on each closed one manifold. There's only one closed one manifold, I suppose, a circle, but there are two spin structures. We've just seen them. Structures. We've just seen them: the bounding one and the non-bounding one. Right? So the movie span or just the trivial double cover. And depending on what I have, this operator is going to act on functions zero to two pi, with vision c such that. Such that, well, it depends a bit, f of 2π is going to be equal to minus f of 0 in case 1. So let me draw one. Again, trying to draw the movie's band if I can. There we are. That's supposed to be case one. Case two, the non-boundary. Case two, the non-bounding spin structure is that one. And in the non-boundary case, we want F to be periodic. Okay. Well, I guess everyone knows what are the solutions to the Dirac equation, df being zero. Well, that's just going to be constants, right? The derivative is zero. The derivative is zero, but actually, it makes a difference. In case one, the only constants that are possible are obviously zero because they need to change sign. While in case two, all the constants are possible. Okay, so that means that the emergency I was writing down, the Down, the at genus of X. That is by definition, that is the dimension of the kernel of D, mod two. And we've just convinced ourselves that for every, so one was the bounding case, this is the non-bounding case, that the bounding case, they don't contribute any dimension. In case they don't contribute any dimensions to the kernel because the only solutions are zero. So, this is actually just the number of connected components of my one-dimensional spin manifold, a bunch of circles, that have the non-bounding spin structure. So I'm going to try to categorify that again. And since the KO theory groups, they have a Z, V2, V2. Now I'm expecting to see a functor. See a functor in the one-dimensional spinboardism category into Z2 graded Z2 for right so the big question is what to do with morphisms all right so let's draw one one picture of a morphism well It's going to be a pair of pants, obviously. I can never talk about borders in theory. And well, what am I going to do? That's going to give the grading, same as before. That's w, that's x, that's x prime. Firstly, I need to associate Associate to the object, so to these one-dimensional spin manifolds, I need to associate a Z2 torsor. I've already figured out the grading. So the Z2 torser is going to be as follows. Well, we have this one-dimensional DIRAC operator on here. And I'm going to write it down as a set of pairs. A set of pairs epsilon lambda where epsilon is plus or minus one and lambda is some complex number that is not in the spectrum of the Dirac operator of x, which is self-adjoint. So it has a it has a, I suppose I could say r, not an r without. spec dx for instance on the circle the standard size circle the spectrum would be the integers okay and there's an equivalence relation saying that e lambda is equivalent to e prime lambda prime if and only if epsilon prime is minus one to the number of points Of points in the spectrum counted, obviously, if I mean, so number of points in the spectrum between lambda and lambda prime. And if lambda is greater than lambda prime, well, actually, it doesn't really matter since I'm taking it mod to anyways. So let's just say it's the number of points. So let's just say it's the number of points in here. Okay, so that does define, in fact, a Z2 torsor. And you can define a functoriality morphism from the one on x to the one on x prime. It goes roughly as follows. It goes roughly as follows. So w prime takes a representative epsilon lambda to some weight factor, which I need to explain, w lambda mu times this mistake. This is a mistake times epsilon mu, where w lambda mu is the number of solutions to the Dirac equation on W with decay, lambda, and mu. So And so here I'm going to impose the solutions to this is a an elliptic equation on a manifold with boundary, which means you need to impose decay conditions. So on the left-hand side, I'm going to impose decay lambda or e to the minus lambda is maybe more appropriate. And here I'm going to impose decay e to the minus mu. So if I impose So, if I impose decay conditions, I get again a Fretom operator. That's why you need these. And I can therefore count the number of solutions, something finite, and stick it in here. And that turns out to define a function. Right. Okay, let me sit ears a little bit now. It clears a little bit now through these preparations. Oh, by the way, what I just wrote down, these torsors with the spectrum and so on, it's all a special case of what's known as the Quill determinant line bundle, which plays an important role in gauge theory. Theory, so it's not, I guess, so surprising that I care about this, right? Okay, so now I'd like to talk a bit about the applications to gauge theory, and it's actually not going to be the boredism category I was just talking about, but it's going to be a boredism category which is kind of decorated with a bundle on. With a bundle on top. So here, B is just going to be a tangential structure. G is going to be a topological group, although in gauge theory, it has to be a Lie group usually, so we can talk of curvature and so on. Mostly, actually, G is SU2 or SUM. or SUM and N is going to be some dimension and well the objects are pairs X and P where well X is a closed manifold with a B structure a tendential B structure and P over X And P over X is a principal G bundle. And a morphism, well, a morphism is going to be, maybe I'm just going to draw a picture. All right, so it's the pair of the tanks again. W, and the morphism goes from x to x prime. We have a bundle p sitting on here. We have a principle. On here, we have a principal bundle P prime sitting on here, and I want there to be, so a morphism is going to be a pair WQ. I want there to be a principal G bundle Q over W, which restricts to these guys on the boundary. Okay, I need to be a bit careful. This is not necessarily going to be a category because I can't compose so well unless I choose colors and so on. Unless I choose colors and so on. But I'm mainly interested in mapping into things like these KO theory groups. They're in particular groups where we have a lot of invertibility. So for my purpose, actually, I can be rather drastic and introduce an equivalence relation, which is quite strong. And says that W q is equivalent to w twiddle q twiddle if and only if there exists a manifold with corners and a bundle on that. It's maybe called a manifold with corners v of dimension n plus two. It has some bundle r on it and um it's supposed to be that's v that's uh That's w, that's w prime. And here on these points, I'm just going to put x across the interval, maybe with a negative orientation here. I'm going to put x prime cross the interval. And I want the boundary of v to be that. So it has to be metric with corners for that to work. Okay, well, we can take a tensor. Well, we can take a tensor product in the usual way by taking the disjoint union. And the effect of this very strong equivalence relation is that actually, instead of just taking modipiomorphism, what is usually doing is the following. It's that Following proposition, which is not too hard to see, but this category that I've just written down for any tangential d structure is a symmetric monoidal groupoid, and also every object has a tender inverse. Inverse. So this wouldn't usually be true if you just smought out idipiomorphisms. But okay, so this is what's called a Picard group audit. And a Picard group audit is essentially described by two invariants. This category has a pi zero and it has a pi one. Well, pi zero pretty much. Well, pi zero, pretty much by definition, is going to be the Bordism group of n-dimensional manifolds with the map to BG, and pi one, which is the automorphism group of unit objects of mt here, is this for as you and there's also some quadratic invariant which maybe is not so important. Maybe it's not so important for here, but it corresponds to the symmetry that we have here in this category, restricted to the diagonal. That's some third quadratic invariant. And these three pieces of data completely describe up to equivalence one of these Picard group points. Okay, so it's a bit like group theory, except that I have two groups now, and I also. Except that I have two groups now, and I also have this addition invariant. And I can control a lot of what's going on just by understanding these groups. Okay, so let's see what's the time. Is it a one-hour talk? Yep. Okay. Very good. Right. Um okay, so um right there's a more general theorem, but um this is actually the case that is of most relevance for me. So let me just restrict to this. This is also what I have on my sheet of paper here. So suppose that n is divisible by a. So suppose that n is divisible by eight. And well, then I can prove there is a symmetric Minoidal functor of Picar group points from the, well, if I restrict to B being a tangential spin structure. So if I start off with an N manifold and a bundle on top, I can associate I can associate to that a Z2 graded Z2 torsor. It's just as before, where I did the n equal to zero case and there wasn't any additional bundle. And well, such a functor in this keeping in this philosophy, it's actually just up to equivalence, so to speak, a pair of group morphisms. So what are the invariants of this functor? So, what are the invariants of this functor? Well, it's going to take this group onto Z2 and it's going to map X, P, this board is in class, is going to go onto the real index of the half Dirac operator twisted by By the adjoint bundle of Lie algebras associated to P. So I guess I should restrict here now to G being the Lie group. And also this adjoint bundle of Lie algebras, that's just if you take P cross G and divide out by the diagonal, anti-diagonal G action. Okay, that's that. That's on objects. What about What about morphisms? Well, at least on automorphisms from empty to empty. Well, it turns out there's in dimensions 9, 17, and so on, there's actually one slight variant of the Dirac operator that you can do that I like to call the skew Dirac operator, since it's a skew adjoint operator. And skew adjoint operators, they always have an index mod2. An index mod two. Actually, here I should have added mod two that since this was an integer, this skew index is naturally always mod two. So that's what it does. And maybe I'll just say what it does on objects since that kind of connects to my main application. So This orientation functor at xp is going to be given by the quilm determinant line bundle, which you might know has this expression here in terms of the highest exterior power of the kernel, tensor, the highest exterior power of the co-kernel. Probably dualize this. Well, this is a real line bundle, but real line bundles can be viewed as, or real lines can be viewed as Z2 tormatrix in a fairly obvious way. Okay, so yeah, as I said, this is the quill, the real determinant line bundle for line. Good. So, um, right. One of my main applications of this business, it takes it takes actually quite a bit more work, but I just want to explain my motivation for looking at this in the context of gauge theory. So So H theory used to be some theory about three and four dimensions only, in particular studying how many four manifolds there are, smooth four manifolds. But it turns out that they're very similar equations to the anti-self duality equations that appear in Donaldson's work in higher dimensions, but you need some extra conditions. You need some extra conditions which are special holonomy. And I'm going to focus on the eight-dimensional case. And I'm going to assume that X is a compact eight manifold with a Calabi-Yau structure. So a Calabi-Yau structure is, if you will, it is a restrict, it is a Strike it is a reduction of the structure group to SU4, and it's also a parallel reduction so that the holonomy of X, G, G has a Riemannian metric, is going to be contained in SU4. There are other ways to say it. You can say that X has a complex structure, it has a symplectic form, complex, and there. And there's a holomorphic volume form around as well. Anyways, we won't need the details. Okay, so, and also suppose that P over X is an SUM model. And gauge theory is all about counting solutions to differential equations. So you're trying to understand your manifold by looking at an interesting differential equation. At an interesting differential equation, trying to count the number of solutions. That's going to be some kind of invariant, hopefully. Unfortunately, these equations are not equations on functions. They're not even equations on sections, as in the Dirac bundle case, but they're usually differential equations for a connection. So the connection plays the role of a function. And in the eight-dimensional case, In the eight-dimensional case, you're interested in the set of all connections whose curvature, well, that's going to be some two-form. And due to the Palau-Yell condition, the bundle, the bundle of complexified two-forms, decomposes into various bits. So, well, you've got this complexified. So, well, you've got the symplectic form first of all. You've got the usual Dolboch composition. The 1,1 forms perpendicular to omega. Then you've got 2,04. And the 0, 2 forms, well, they're actually not irreducible because there's some Hodge operator around. So you can split them again into two bits, plus and minus. And minus. So these two make up lambda zero two. Okay, and then you can project the curvature onto all of these different components. And it turns out that you get an elliptic equation if you project to this component and to the plus component here. So if you insist on these two things, it's going to be an elliptic equation with just Of going to be an elliptic equation, which is a very rare thing to find in practice, and an interesting elliptic equation that makes sense for all manifolds. So, this is what's called sometimes the moduli space, space of solutions of so-called SU4 instantons, and it's a subspace of the space of all connections on P, modulo, the gauge group of all automorphisms of P. Okay. Okay, why do I bring this up? What does it have to do with this up here? Well, you want to count the number of solutions. So that usually involves counting with the correct signs. Or this will usually be a moduli space of positive dimension. So the counting of solutions corresponds to constructing a fundamental class. To construct a fundamental class, well, you could either do it over Z mod2. Could either do it over Z mod2 or you need an orientation. And turns out that the tangent bundle of this thing, the tangent bundle of this moduli space here, well, that's described by the linearization of these, of this elliptic equation. And I assure you, it is given in terms of the twisted Dirac operator. So, in particular, So, in particular, the orientation bundle of that thing is going to be the same as the determinant line bundle that I wrote up there of this twisted Dirac operator. Okay, so in order to make sense out of this count of solutions in this higher gauge theory business, you would like to have a trivialization. Have a trivialization, an orientation of this determinant line bundle. That's the main goal. Well, and what can I do here? I haven't written down a theorem yet. So there's one further condition here. Suppose that the SQ2 bundle actually satisfies C2 of P equal to zero. Then there is some game I can play involving. Involving exploiting a connection between SU4, SU5, and the exceptional Lie group E8 that allows me to find a canonical orientation of this guy. Okay. So, um So, yeah. Now, in the last 10-15 minutes, I'll try to come back to our original point of view of these functors and so on and explain how they come in when you want to do the general case, where this condition is dropped. Okay, so I want to somehow compute these functors, these that category. These that categorify index theory, I want to compute them in some way. Don't really know how that goes, but here's a concept that turns out to work in this case. It's called flag structures. Okay, so well, flag structures, that's going to involve some other kind of category, which I need to briefly define. I need to briefly define. So I'm going to call that the Bordism category n, k m h. M stands for Tom space. And H is going to be some Lie group with a fixed representation into G Ln minus K. Okay, so the objects are going to be pairs x, one. x, 1, where x is going to be a closed n manifold with a b structure, as usual. And y is going to be a closed submanifold with a normal H structure. All right. And well, what are the morphisms going to be? As usual, the picture. Okay, that's supposed to be W. It's X, that's X prime over here. And now we're also having sub-manifolds of X. Maybe that's a sub-manifold of X, that's a sub-manifold of X prime that point. some manifold of x prime that point there and um the morphism is going to be some equivalence class of pairs wz it's w and the z is going to be some k plus one manifold maybe i need a third point here um which goes between these um sub-manifolds so that's y here y prime I prime and then there was this condition with the normal bundles indicate here. So Z also has a normal H structure. Okay, so this is actually gives rise to a few constructions, these definitions. A few constructions, these definitions, which connect all the ingredients we've met so far. So firstly, what am I doing here? Yeah, that's going to show up. So if I have a codimension A codimension k submanifold of x. I can do something by looking at the self-intersection. So I'm going to pick a transverse section of the normal lung. And then I'm going to associate to this pair the To this pair, the inverse image of zero, the Borders and class of that thing. So that's rank n minus k. So it's n minus k equations on a k manifold. So that gets me into dimension 2k minus 2, minus n. So this goes into board 2k minus n, just at the point. The point. The usual board isn't category. Right. So the picture is that's why, and then we do a slight perturbation while it whittle. And that's the self-interception here. Okay, so we can produce this functor. I can also connect this theory with what I had before. So I was looking at. So I was looking at SU bundles on an N manifold, and I can construct from an SU manifold, from an N manifold with an SU bundle, I can construct a codimension for sub-manifold in a fairly standard way, and it's going to have a normal U2 structure. Going to have a normal U2 structure. So explicitly that goes as follows: you take this p over x, and then you take sections, transverse sections, n minus one of them of the associated vector bundle with fiber c to the n. And then the manifold I'm going to say. Then the manifold I'm going to associate to this, the submanifold, n minus four-dimensional. So the n-manifold is still going to be x, but the sub-manifold is going to be the y is the set of all points in x where, well, the span of S1 up to Sm has rank m minus. Is rank M minus 2. So this is the set of all points where there's precisely one dependency among these guys. Okay, so that's kind of a standard way to think about the second Chern class in algebraic geometry, where they need to produce an element of the child group that represents it, some kind of variety. That's a standard way to do that. Maybe topologically speaking, we can say. Topologically speaking, we can say also there's a condition here. Sorry, n needs to be less or equal to 10. Otherwise, I can't prove that this is independent of choices of the S1 up to Sn minus 1. And topologically speaking, you can say, well, there is actually a 10-connected map from Mu2 into BSU, 10-connected. And well, I can take an inverse. And well, I can take an inverse at least up to the 10 skeleton, and then I can do this thing here just by thinking of these as being equipped with a map to BSU and then composing features. All right, so I'm almost there, and I have about five more minutes. So, what do I do? Yeah. One final diagram, which summarizes a lot of the constructions and also kind of one of the main theorems that we have. Okay, so I set out to do this Fordism theory in eight dimensions with an SU bundle, SUM bundle. An SU bundle, SUM bundle for some large M. And we had the kind of index theory thing going to Z2 torsars. That was a kind of an analytic construction. Call that OHSU. And that's kind of the analytic index of the kernel and so on. And so now there's a very different thing we can do. Well, first of all, let me do this co-dimension for construction thing. So that takes me to the Bordism group of eight manifolds, which have a four submanifolds sitting in them. And here we can do this self-intersection thing. Self-intersection thing we just talked about. That would take us to so that's n, that's k, and it took me to board 2k minus n. So 2k minus n turns out to be zero. Okay. Spin of a point. And at the very beginning of the talk, if you remember, I talked about zero manifolds. Remember, I talked about zero manifolds and these one manifolds and how to construct a Z2 torsor out of them. That's where I told you how to construct this functor. This is the beginning of the talk. And the Sear theorem says this thing commutes up to natural isomorphism, and therefore, I was interested in constructing a trivialization of this upper guy. It would be enough. Would be enough, therefore, if I construct a trivialization of this guy here. And this connects, this is actually a bit more explicit. So for every four sub-manifold, I have to associate some sign having to do with intersection theory. So I don't really have time to explain this so much. But let me just remark that this is equivalent to orienting. To orienting a special class of submanifolds that every exceptional holonomy manifold has. So here we had X was Pellardiel. And the special class of submanifolds is called Cayley, Cayley force of manifolds. So if you write down some fairly explicit structure to orient your Cayley force of manifolds, then you can more or less also do this. Can more or less also do this gauge theoretic counting. Okay, yeah, that was pretty much all I had to say. So, thanks a lot for your attention. Are there any questions for Marcus? On Zoom. Okay, maybe I have a small one, but this is a bit far-fetched. Usually, when you do index theory, you can also work with a Clifford leader bundle, and you chose to. Bundle, and you chose to work with a reducer representation. Is there a special reason for that or just convenience? No, actually, you can do it more systematically if you work Clifford linearly. Yeah, that's right. I mean, you can interpret the K groups, of course, as the isomorphism classes of CLN modules, modulo those that actually have a CLN plus one multiplication. So that's more systematic, but That's more systematic, but it's also a bit more technical to present. So, yeah. Okay. More questions? And let's thank Marcus again.
