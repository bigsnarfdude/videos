A really wonderful opportunity to be here to give this talk. And also, thank you to all of the people who've done amazing jobs on active matics before me. So, definitely, I think the motivation for studying them was made very clear, particularly in all talks. And Francesca even was saying active matics is sexy, so that's a good reason for doing it. And definitely, a bunch of talks, even yesterday and today, have made clear also that topological defects are very important. Topological defects are very important in these axomatic structures. They chaotically mix the fluids and they also can be controlled. They set the flow direction and so it's very interesting to study them. And so this talk will show to you that there's a relationship between itomatic defects and instantaneous voice structures. And so this work has been published, or most of this talk has been published earlier this year, and this was in Year and this was in when I was doing my PhD in Edinburgh with Tyler Schendruk. But I also have many collaborators who are part of this work. In particular, I would like to thank Claire and Theresa who did the experiments and also several people from, he was born in Edinburgh who did a lot of the simulations work for this. And then also I've recently started a postdoc with Darren, and so here's a picture of the group and we've all been speaking here already. And so some of this work I'm Here already. And so, some of this work I'm continuing, and this will be made clear towards the end of the talk. So, thank you to all these people. And here is an outline for my talk. I don't need to give a lot of motivation or background at mathematics, but I will very briefly go through some things that are important. The main part of my talk, as I say, is to talk about the interplay of topological defects and instantaneous flow structures. And I will, at the end, give some insight into how. Insight into how this might hold in the three dimensions as well. So, this slide in particular has been done many, many times. So, I don't need to tell you about the mechanism for forming active turbines. I think this picture has been cut off a bit, but never mind. But what I just wanted to remind you is that the generation of these disorderly flows is controlled at the micro scale, so or on the scale of these microtubules. On the scale of these microtubules and fiercely lecomoters. And this is captured by this actor of stress with mattex imagery, as we know. And what is interesting is that the emergent behaviour is being transmitted into scales many times larger. And so we get these mesoscopic collective flows that can be seen in the form of this active turbulence. And so this is an experiment by Claire, and as has been mentioned many times, this has the Mentioned many times, this has these topological defects or these dark spots that are zooming through the fluid and stirring it and causing this chaotic state. I wanted to just put it side by side. Is this screen collapsed inwards? It is. Okay. It's fine. I just want to sort of put here some of the sort of important mesoscopic structures that you could identify in active turbulence. Identify a hexa turbulence because the simplest description is that it's actually a sort of two-field coupling. You have your orientational order which couples into the flow structures through this microscopic measure, and this gives rise to, in the velocity field, coherent flow structures such as vortices. This is just shown by the vorticity and phase experiments. But on the director field, like order parameter sense, there's also this, as I said, Since there's also this, as I say, steady-state population of defects, they're moving. But there are also other structures here, too. There are these long lines of deformation that are also existent in active remnants. And this is because of instabilities. Instabilities have been talked about already, but I wanted to give you just another picture of this, in the sense that, as I said, the microscopic stress can be thought of as this fluid of form. Can we thought of as this fluid of force dipoles? And so this means that any deformation, such as a bend deformation, or anything that gives some polarization to the orientation order, is going to create this net force polarization, which is going to be self-amplified through a feedback that flows and forcing. And so, in extensor systems, this is bend that is unstable. And you can see this here. So, the simulation. Here. So, this simulation shows an initially aligned state, and this is unstable in this way. So, we have perturbation. These are actually structures of bend that are forming. They form these big long lines, and eventually, these get tighter and tighter through the smoothback loop. And eventually, the elastic energy expels these topological defects, and they form these defect unbinding like. Defect unbinding like behaviours. And this eventually transitions to a steady state active totalance. And you can see this effect here also in actually here through the experiments as well. Defects are created through these lines of thin. And what I also wanted to say, sort of moving on back towards this image of defect dynamics, is that the idea of defect dynamics solves. The idea of defects dynamics self-propelling and creating this steady state active turbulence at least is sometimes brought back to this idea of active backflows around defects. And so what this means is if we, well actually Cody Shimmy was showing something very similar, is that if we have a hematic defect, it has some deformation around it. Deformation creates flows, and the nature of the flows can be predicted through solving the Stokes equation. Solving the Stokes equation. And a very simplified description was done for a minimal energy description of a topological defect. And this shows something like this. And this has given a picture that plus half defects are associated with two vortices, this is accepted in literature, and minus half defects with six of alternating handedness. And then also this idea of the flow generation on defect also has sort of lightly predicted that. Sort of lightly predicted that vorticity might be zero at a defect core. And so, as far as how this relates to defect self-propulsion, sometimes, well, if you can just evaluate the flows at the core, so set this to r equals zero, then we can actually also obtain this sort of estimate of the self-propulsion loss through a plus half defect and a minus half, which shows that plus half defects are actually self-propelling in their orientation. Self-propelling in that orientation direction, and minus half defects actually don't create flows that self-affect them. They can be affected by other flows, but more self-contribution. And this sort of idea of the flows generated on defects and their self-affected motion has contributed to some very meaningful and interesting defect gas models. One in this paper here. But something that's also important to take in mind is how does this active backflow picture hold when the flows are evolving and when you don't just have an isolated defect. And something that has been seen and sort of verified in a bunch of experiments and also simulations is that actually, if you average the flows around a defect over its trajectory, you actually do retain something quite similar to what Retain something quite similar to what Jeremy's prediction was, in particular, that you can obtain a sort of zero vorticity at defect core and these two opposite-handedness vortices on either side. And likewise or minus half, this little picture of six vortices. And this is seen in other experiments. And this was actually an axopmatic made of Bacillus subtilis swarms, which was more recent. But of course, as I said, this picture is representative of. Picture is representative of an isolated defect solution, so it is interesting that it holds in this case. But at all instances and trajectories, this doesn't necessarily hold true. This is a, again, this picture from Claire. And you can see, for instance, that these plus half defects are definitely sometimes residing on regions where there is a net vorticity. And also, it's not. Some of these you could see have two vorticities nearby, but a lot of them don't. By but a lot of them don't. They actually are on these curved paths or curved streamlines. So this definitely is not. So this ideal solution is informative, but it's not everything for defect dynamics, like this. But there is an interesting relationship that can be kind of seen from a bunch of the literature, which is that there is actually a lot of topological defects do reside towards the ed edges of vortices. Toward the edges of vortices. And this has been seen in experiments, in particular, but it has also likely been explained in simulation. This has been seen in simulations of experiments. And so here, all of these pictures have been shown with the vorticity field shown behind. And so it's not necessarily zero at that cause, but they're near the lower magnitude regions. And so also it's been seen in this ordered flow state, which is Ordered flow state, which is a channel complyment. So we've seen this a bit already. This is known as the Cayley dance. And in this flow state, plus half topological defects are actually weaving in between all of the vortex, well this vortex lattice which is established through the center. So there is clearly a relationship between where defects are and these rotational flows or these vortices, but it hasn't been overly clear what exactly the relationship is. Very clear what exactly the relationship is from just these studies alone, and it hasn't been explored. So, that brings me to what this talk is about. This talk is about how do defects relate to these instantaneous structures in the flow field. And in particular, I will show to you sort of how this ideal picture changes when you can think about these other interactions and active terminals. And so, yeah, brings me to the next part of my talk. But, an important Part of my talk. But an important part of trying to look for relationships between defect dynamics and flow structures is to actually characterize what our flow patterns are and what they're showing. And so I'll bring this up another time because what actually is a vortex one? This is something that is debated in the fluid literature to an extent. Is it a region of just high vorticity? At which point do you define the edge of a vortex? At which point do you define the edge of a vortex? That's quite an arbitrary question. Is it something which has closed streamlines? Is it something that is coherent in space and time? These are all kind of questions that don't necessarily converge onto the same answer. And I actually wanted to pick out again this point of this high vorticity, which is often the parameter that people are using to look for relationships between defects and flow structures here. Because if you say, I had just a parallel line flow, so it's like a simple. Parallel line flow, so it's like a simple shear flow. This actually does have a net vorticity to it, despite having streamlines that are actually all moving in one direction. So, this is the reason why we decided to use a different description of flow patterns. And so, we're using measures of velocity gradient invariance. And so, this is sort of done in the fluid literature. I've given a bit more detail than you probably need to know, but effectively, these parameters are derived through. These parameters are derived through centering on each fluid bucket and looking at what the structure of the streamlines are in that reference frame. And so that gives you a measure of how close the streamlines are in that reference point or that calc straight line or how hydraulic they are. And if you wanted a bit more details as to how this happens, it's just because you're expanding the velocity field. In the reference frame, you're just looking at the first order term. That's you're just looking at the first order terms in terms of the velocity gradient tensor, and then you're constructing the solution trajectories and looking at how they're invariant through their principal invariance. And so, this sort of describes this family of different streamline patterns, which you can characterize on a diagram a bit like something you might see in a dynamical systems critical point analysis. So, anything by these, so this is the second invariant here, the Q. The second invariant here, the Q. This is the first invariant P, and so anything sort of above this discriminant has basically eigenvalues that are complex, and so they have this closed streamlined form and so on. And this is more hyperbolic in nature. But there is a simplification that can be made often in active pneumatics or in many clusters of fluid, which is incompressibility. And so you'll see that the first invariant is just the trace of the Volsty gradient. Invariant is just the trace of the velocity gradient, and so this becomes zero in this assumption. And this means that we can give all of the topological flow patterns. The topology of the flow patterns can be described by a parameter which is known as the Q criterion. And this is simply, I think I might much have forgotten to tell what this is, but this is the rate of rotation tensor, or factorises vorticity tensor. And this is the rate of strain tensor, and so it gives a relative magnitude of the isometric symmetry. Of the asymmetric symmetric control. And a little summary as to how this is actually helpful is because it means that if this parameter is positive, then we have these elliptical streamlines and it's vorticity dominated. If it's negative, then we have something which is more of a hyperbolic base streamlines or subtle. And if it's zero, then we have we've done this biscometric with analogies of simple shear flow, but this is basically. Share flow, but this is basically just a kind of uniform motion of a fluid parcel along these streamlines. So it characterizes the nature of the streamline patterns. And we're going to use this for analysing active tablets. And before I show you the movie, I just want to explain what these all mean. And so what we've done here is we've coloured these regions where We've got these regions where the Q criterion is greater than zero, so these are optical streamlines, and we've said that this is a vortex, and that's what's shown here. I've also given a measure of the strength of the vortex through colouring it by its circulation with an anti-flock present and flock both handedness. And all these white regions are the strain rate-dominated regions. And so, necessarily in between, this is showing these lines of simple shear flow where the stream lines are parallel. And so now I'll show you defect dynamics related. Defect dynamics related to these structures. And these are the defect markers. And something that's very striking here is that plus half defects actually reside on these surfaces at all points, at all times in their trajectories. And so I'll sort of let you sort of look at that for a bit longer. But if you follow any given of these green markers, it will actually either follow the surface or it will sort of sit between these two surfaces where the Surfaces where the Q is zero. So these edges are vortices. Whereas actually the minus half defects don't necessarily satisfy this. They can be observed in both sides of the Q criterion. So that's something quite interesting and it definitely gives some weights to these observations before that defects are actually sitting directly at the edges of vortices by this definition. Of course, this is. Of course, previously was just simulations, but it's also beautiful to see if this happens in experiments too. I wish it wasn't so squished, but I think it gives the same patterns anyway. And so this is Claire's video, and you can see here again that these defect markers, every single one of them actually, it's very striking this relationship with sitting on these boundaries and following them. So I'll let you watch this for a little bit longer. Okay. This this is showing that there is definitely a clear clear relationship in both simulations and experiments that defect cells are in on all surfaces. So I want to go back to, of course, why is this happening and what do we expect this? So I'll go back to this ideal solution what I was talking about earlier on in the talk. And this is what the this, so this is again q greater than zero and minus the negative. And this is They're negative. And this is what it looks like for these ideal solutions. And this predicts that plus half defect does reside exactly on a Q criterion intersection, QC intersection, whereas minus half doesn't. So I'm actually going to focus, again, more on this plus half case than the minus half, but certainly this ideal solution was predicting this. Although, something we'll see from the videos and also the experiments is that actually the Is that actually this picture of a defect residing in an intersection isn't true at all times? In particular, there's another type of relationship that they can have, which is that a defect can be associated with a single vortex boundary. So it has this Birken mirror symmetry or chiral symmetry. And this is quite interesting, particularly because this is the picture that everyone's been thinking about when they've been averaging over their solution defect rejection. Their solution defect trajectories. And so, yeah, even though the theory predicts that the actual chiral sublux dominates active turbulence, you can give a rough measure of this by looking at the alignment of the defect orientation with the tangent of the Q boundary. And this is showing this very strong preference to align with the tangent. So this is demonstrating that there is this chiral broken symmetry. Carol work on symmetry that is existing with defects and flows. And so, actually, I probably went onto this too quickly, but now the next part, I was just going to tell you why this is helpful. I'll explain afterwards what happens. But one reason why it's helpful is because I think it gives an interesting language to talk about the transportation of defects across the flow structure. So, this is showing that again, our channel confined active momatics are KLE dance, and plus half defects are traveling around. Defects are traveling around these vortices, from these surfaces, alternating between these chiral and achiral classes. And so, clearly, when they're on this chiral subclass, they're associated with one vortex in their trajectory, whereas they can actually move to another vortex through an intersection. So, at least this gives some language through why these might be useful to distinguish these two classes. Another reason. Another reason is because, of course, if a defect is just traversing the edge of a boundary of a particular hundredness, it necessarily must be travelling in a chiral path because defects aren't just rectangles, they have some curvature to them. And so, this can be seen here. I've got quite a lot of information here, but this was some examples of just some defect trajectories. So, here you can, these blue lines mean that they're associated with mantra clockwise, chiral pace, and clockwise. Parallel case and popquies. But what I'm saying is that you can see that they're following these curve paths when they're associated to a ball set of that sign. And I also have some more statistics that demonstrates that here. So of course, why are these subclasses happening at all? And so I told you that the ACARO subclass, or like we saw from the ideal solution, that a defect in this mirror symmetric configuration can be predicted. Merrisymmetric configuration can be predicted from thinking of the defect as the only source of motion of active forcing. But of course, in active turbulence, that isn't necessarily true. Defects can interact with other defects. They can also interact with these lines of bend that I was mentioning earlier on the talk, these sort of bend walls that are characteristic of the active instability. And so here I just again remind you that actually active grouping can be created by any Created by any source of spail bend in the director field. And so that is shown here. But these walls of bend I'm not going to show you are actually here visualized using a parameter called the splay bend parameter. And so this is showing how localized this factor forcing is, or how localized this bending is, through measuring the divergence of splay-minded bend. So that means these negative walls are showing up as these, this negativeness is. This negative SSP is these bevels. And now I'd like to show you this video. So one thing that you can notice from this video is that actually these bend walls are very well correlated with these Q-equals surfaces. You can see these really long regions where they're correlated. There's also other features, such as if you have a bend wall somewhere in the Active Matic, Active Matic, these streamlines of simple shear actually overlap on top at later time, so it's forming these simple shear flows. Also, the converse is true that if you, that, yeah, the bend is creating simple shear flows, but you can also see examples where if you just have a simple shear streamline, it will actually create a bend wall as well. So there's this feedback between bend walls and simple shear flows. And I can explain to you why this is with a simple model. Model. So this black line is supposed to be the director field, or like the line curves of the director field. So we just gave an example of Ben Wall and sort of decomposed the different types of forces that would exist with such a ben wall and relative to the Stoic exclusion. And actually, French showed something quite similar with these ben type structures and this sort of divergent active force. And so this is what's happening here. That active force is being directed along the Is that active force has been directed along the bend wall, although it isn't all contained along it. But we also have pressure gradients which exist to satisfy incompressibility, and so that actually penalises this divergent part of the forcing. And so pressure gradients act inwards into the pin wall. You can also understand it through, if you construct a pressure equation, there's a Poisson equation that arises. Equation that arises and it identifies negative SSV as being a pressure sink. So you have these like lines of pressure sinks, which is interesting. And by these balancing their outer plane component, it means that you have these parallel aligned net flows, net forces, which is what's being fed into the flows. And so this is why we're getting these parallel flows. I'll just keep the sorry. And so, of course, I've shown you now why Ben. I've shown you now why bend rules are correlated with Qt Cozur. I've shown you why defects are correlated with Q Cozer when you think of them isolated. But I also showed you that actually there's this network of defects and variables that exist connected to unions. So this is a very, very simple model which tries to model them together. And we do this not through constructing any explicit sort of director field approximation, but we just think about what the nature of their forcing is like. Nature of their forcing is like. And so clearly, these are really continuums, but at the simplest description, you can kind of think of a Passoff defect as a point force. And so if you solve the flows around a point force, then you get this intersection that I was showing you before. If you have defects with a line, or this is lightly a defect, it's not exactly a defect, but if you have a line with endpoints, this is Walter's defects in Benwalls. Defects in benefoles. And if this is straight, then you also have this achiral symmetry. But one thing you do get is that the tangent of these curves sort of collaps inwards to the structure of the active force, or force in this case. And of course, if you have a curved line, then you actually break this, as you would expect, you break this achiral symmetry and you get chiral symmetry. And also you can see that this is necessary to split open the structure of these vortices. To split open the structure of these vortices. And this is at least enough for us to sort of quality to understand why a defect might be aligned with a cucalzaura surface. So that gives the summary of this part of the talk, is that we've confirmed these qualitative observations that defects tend to reside near the edges of vortices. In particular, we show that if you use the Q-proterium, then you can observe that falsehood defects are actually constrained to these isolated. We also showed that unexpectedly, but the flows around defects aren't always captured by this picture. They average out to this picture, but by averaging out, you're missing this other class of defects relative to these flow structures. And then we also gave some insight onto the role of bend walls. Some insight onto the role of ben walls, which I think have been very neglected in many models of active turbulence. Usually, we focus only on defects, not only, but often on defects in these simple models. But actually, we saw here that they're actually very relevant to defect dynamics because they can break this achiral symmetry. They form this network and they're also generated in the ven walls, and they also form the simple shear flow, which controls their paths. So, this was the summary of this paper. This is a summary of this paper that was published this year. I also wanted to tell you that some of this we're also thinking about moving to three dimensions, which is a lot less understood in general about the interplay of defects and flow structures. So this is a very ongoing work, so I haven't permitted this. But of course just to give like a very simple overview, of course defects are different in 2D and 3D. Of course, defects are different in 2D and 3D, as we all know. And so in 3D, you get hedgehogs, discussion lines, and discussion loops that we've seen a lot already in this conference. And hedgehogs tend to be observed really with colloidal particles. And so when we're talking about these bulk fluids, you're really mostly seeing dissipation lines and dissipation loops. And whether you see one or the other depends also on boundaries. So you tend to see dissipation lines if you have, say, client compliance or some sort of closed box and defect loops otherwise. Close box and defect loops otherwise. But also, what's very relevant to defect dynamics is not just its topological description, but also its winding character. And so in three dimensions, and Jane actually showed a nice schematic of this yesterday. So plus half and minus half profiles smoothly transform on these half integer distillation lines. And you can sort of look at this transformation. Sort of look at this transformation through the rotation vector, which describes the rotation plane that you have an anti-clockwise winding of your director and of the director in that plane. And one thing that I've been doing and also was sort of motivated by other work is just colouring defects by their winding character. So you can get an idea of whether you have a plus half profile if they're parallel. They're parallel. So I've shown this as yellow. Or if you have a minus half profile, which is if they're anti-parallel these two vectors with respect to line tangent. And green is twist. And I haven't put all of the types of disconnection loops that you can possibly get, but some that are quite relevant to either this talk or what's seen in active pneumatics is these uncharged defect loops that, in characterized by these two vectors, tend to come in a wedged. Tend to come in a wedge twist form, so one plus half and one minus half profile that's smoothly intersected by twist, or pure twist, which is clearly where there's twist everywhere. There's also a charge defect loop that I'll also talk about a bit later, and we've also seen in many talks here, particularly with respect to colloids, is that you can get these Saturn ring types defects, which in this colour scheme is purple, and has a net winding of the rotational vector. Rotational vector. So, in active turbulence in 3D, there were some Newport experiments that Dan was part of in 2020 in this science paper. And they observed that bulk active tigers in 3D is characterized by this really interesting distribution of defect loops of varying sizes. And some of these, as they came in, they're all charge-neutral as far as we're aware. And it also resembles something a bit like, say, if you had an isotropic. A bit like, say, if you had an isotropic somatic phase transition in a snapshot, in the sense that we have these long dissipation lines, but the causaling dynamics is very different. And this can be shown by this picture here from the Ljana group, is that you have these causaling dynamics related to this interplay between defects and flows that not only lead to their formation, they can obviously grow and form these structures from linear. Structures from an initial modern state in theory. But they also have these loop dynamics, so growth expansion, and they can also reconnect and recombine and form these interesting sort of conformational properties. And so what I'll first of all tell you is how these defect loops, what we know about how they couple to flows or how they create flows, and then I'll tell you some work that we've got at the moment which tries to look at the converse of how flows. To look at the converse of how flows might influence the defect dynamics. So, first of all, this is here. I'm just plotting the flow solutions derived in this paper, which is a very similar derivation to that shown by Liquid Jomi earlier, but for three-dimensional defect profiles. And so, this is showing a plus-half profile and their backflows, and how it transforms to a minus half profile. And you can see that the magnitude of the velocity decreases to zero. Magnitude of the velocity decreases to zero, as we would expect through this transformation. But also, the symmetry and the geometric properties of the flow field is different. And so, in particular, you go from these sort of dipolar flow patterns to these flow patterns with three-point symmetry. So, this is our understanding of how light process control quack flows. And also, they have this orientational property, too. I haven't shown it here, but I haven't shown it here, but the dipolar flow patterns are in the direction of the defect band infection. And so now I'm going to show you two, these are two simulation studies that I've been part of, or all my group's been part of. I'll show you how you can think about this in terms of these winding patterns. And so this is a very similar structure to our paleody dynamics that we had in the two-dimensional channel. Here we've got planar anchoring. Here we've got planar anchoring and it's a sort of rectangular duct instead. And in this case, we can also have these stable defect dynamics as well. And what's interesting is that instead of point defects, so plus half and minus half, we have destination lines that are connected between the walls. And they also split into the winding character as well. So we have these motile positive winding disclinations, and we have static minus off disclinations. Static minus of disclination lines that reside on the vortex boundaries, the boundaries of the channel. So, this is very characteristic of what we were thinking before about the nature of the flows at each point of the defect line. This can be understood in this material. This was also just to show that, like in the two-dimension case, they're also weaving between vortices. And the vortices are static. Actually, how long do I have? Actually, how long do I have? Half of the work. 15. Okay. Another study which I twitched back into one slide, which I probably shouldn't have, but this is another one where we're trying to control the dynamics of defects. And so what we did was we have a multiple mulsion. And so this also has a homotropic anchoring so that we induce the topology in the bulb. The topology in the bulk. And so this part is activatic. These are isotropic cores. So, in essence, this is a bit like having two coidal particles inside a droplet. And the reason why we get a defect loop is because by each core, you can create a hedgehog charge, which relates to its order characteristic, which for a sphere is two. And so each core gives a hedgehog charge a one, but there's also a modulo two property. There's also a modulo two property of the overall charge. And so this confinement with these inner cores means that we have a net charge of one in this bulk fluid, which is nucleated by this charge defect loop. And what's interesting here is that we see, in this case, we actually didn't observe a Saturn ring-like defect. This was because these two cause light to stretch outwards. You could also. You could also see, if this was flipped over to this one core, then you'd have a subtle moon. But what's interesting is that these minus half profiles, like we see in these photo inclusions, are pinned, geometrically pinned to these isotropic plaque cores that are homotropically anchored. And the plus half defects are, or plus half profiles, are driving these flows and they're forming this rotational dynamics. So that was quite nice in this. So that was quite nice in this case. I also have another example. This is also a sort of clearer image of what's happening. So here are the flows that are being that are correlated to that part of the distillation. So you can see that they're parallel aligned and it must have been azimuthally oriented with respect to each other. Whereas the flows go to zero here. We also saw, if you put more pause on, sorry, for this simulation. Simulation. So it starts off as one loop with a higher order winding character, but it becomes unstable. And again, we see the same motif happening between these two cores with this rotating defect loop. And you also can see some saturn rings here too. They're not really moving very much, but they are actually forming this kind of topological dipolar structure, which is also driving close. So this is one example. So, this is one example of a file-winding character that can lead to various defect dynamics. So, if we're going to search for a sort of three-dimensional self-constraint in the same way that we were looking at in two dimensions, it makes sense to, again, look at the invariant, since that was what was happening in two dimensions. This isn't a great picture, but what I want to tell you is that there is a third invariant that becomes relevant to the structure flow patterns in three dimensions. To the structure of the flow patterns in three dimensions, which I've just called for is called R here. And under incompressibility, you can characterize the topology of the stream patterns through a phase plane in the same way that we did before. This hasn't got everything that I would have wanted to see on this, but the important parts here is that these kind of simple shear or parallel alignment would actually correlate to this center point where Q and R equals zero. Where Q and R equals zero, pure rotation would be something up here, and these kind of pure hypolic structures down here. But also, R would be able to characterize the sort of outer plane components of the flow. And so, based on what we're sort of seeing from these active backflow solutions, it would make sense for plus-half profiles to be constrained to this center point because they're forming these parallel-aligned streamlines. And I have to say, this is very much in progress. This is very much in purpose, so this isn't super well presented. But what we have so far is: so, this is just showing the key criterion isosurfaces, again on this vortex letter state. And the plus half defects you can kind of see are actually again traversing these huge boundaries. So they're traversing these vortices. This is my way of showing you that they're also constrained to R. But they're also constrained to R, at least from this particular geometry, we're still exploring it in others. And so, what's here is that I've mapped R onto Q equals zero surface, and blue is where it's less than zero, and red is where it's greater than zero, and you can see it's sitting at this intersection. So, again, it's showing that even now with these other sources of active forcing, at least in this case, the path half defects are still have these parallel aligned flow patterns that are still directing its motion. Directing its motion. So it's something analogous to what we're seeing in 2D is probably happening. I don't have R shown here, but this is also an example from the multiple mulsion with this rotating defect loop. This is just showing the Q surface, so as I wear the rate of rotation, rate of strain are balancing. And you can see that the plus half profiles are residing in this boundary, which I think is quite nice. And again, it also gives this weight about the constraint. Also, gives this weight about the constraint isn't to these zero vorticity regions because clearly the flow patterns have some curl to it much further out, and so it is this constraint to these kind of parallel streamlines as characterized at that reference point. And finally, just throwing some more evidence that we're currently exploring, this is active turbulence and these disclamation loops. Exclamation loops, in this case because it's proof by my conditions, are shown with these kind of planes intersection that are showing the keypriter in. And it's interesting because not even just Post-Half profiles but also other types of winding characters are also sitting at these intersections between this rotation-dominated and strain-rate-dominated regions. Again, it'd be interesting to look at the other invariant and also with some progress about how strong this constraint. With some progress about how strong this constraint is, given that there are these other sources of active forcing in this case. So, my summary here for the talk is that this was kind of known before, but burning patterns influence active backflows, which we demonstrated through these simple simulations. And there is this evidence that there is a soft constraint between defect dynamics and these invariants of the velocity gradient. At the moment, it looks pretty convincing. Um at the moment it looks pretty convincing for q equals zero, but also potentially r equals zero as well for post-half profiles. How does that extend to other um disconnection profiles? I don't know yet. And so some of the things that we're currently exploring, these also the non-local effects, which are particularly relevant for these three-dimensional systems, in particular because of course a disconnation loop is non-local and you don't just have a point, you have a whole loop, and they're all going to be creating active forcing through their definitions. Through their definitions. And so, this necessarily will affect the kind of morphological dynamics of these defect structures. And also, based on the two dimensions, there are also evidence that there's going to be these extended structures for vector forcing. I don't know if it's a bend wall as such, but it will have some polarization that will extend beyond just the defect core that we probably should be looking at in its dynamics. But there are some small things here as well. For instance, actually, I don't. For instance, actually, I didn't make much of a point of this, but we'll go back a bit. Is that these streamlined patterns that I'm describing here actually don't characterize negative winding distonations very well. And so this gives you its sort of hyperbolic base character over streamlines. But clearly, when we saw the minus half distinction, it has higher symmetries, it's three-fold symmetric. So this probably works for a plus-half and twist, but Half and twist, but this might not capture any constraint that might extend towards negative winding characters. And yeah, our outlook of this is that maybe it might help to sort of understand this dynamical feedback between defects and the flow structures that are existent in 2D and 3D active turbulence, or active matics in general. And it might give some insight into ways that we can control their dynamics. Yeah, that's everything. Yeah, that's everything. Thanks, Claire, for this nice talk. I can answer two questions. First of
