In this beautiful event, and in particular for you invited me. And secondly, I'm Ivanova. So the Russians are Ivanova, but I'm a Bulgarian, so I'm Ivanova. As the title says, I shall speak about special quadratic algebras related to a very special class of solutions of the Young vector equation. But before that, I I will make some setting, I'll fix some setting for me by a solution. I shall mean just a braided set, that means a set with a map, in fact not necessarily braidive, which satisfies the braid relations. Relations. And I'll give some motivation why this talk will be concentrated on quadratic algebras. The study of non-commutative algebras defined by quadratic relations, as example of quantum non-commutative spaces, has received considerable Received considerable impetus from famous works for this, repetition, and from Manin's program for non-commutative geometry, which had great influence on further studies. So we shall be interested in special quadratic algebras, what is called Young-Baxter algebras. This terminology comes from This terminology comes from Manin algebras, which have relations coming from a solution of young Lax equation, not necessarily set-theoretic solutions. And exactly this kind of study was proposed in our paper with Madrid, where we studied specific solutions. And we call this We call these Young-Baxter algebras, we call them quadruples, and developed some non-controlled geometry theory. Ah, sorry. So these algebras have very very special properties when the solution is non-declined. The solution is non-degenerate, evolutive, and finite. And they were studied with details for different goals in the joint paper with Vandenberg in 1998. So we proved there that although the algebra is absolutely non-commutative, and in most cases, the algebra is even not commutative. Is even not called Karebi-Hobit type algebra. It shares various good algebraic and homological properties with the commutative polynomial ring in n variables. If x, for example, has ordered n. In particular, the algebra has finite global dimension in polynomial growth. It is coin-off-colli, causal, and a material domain. A material domain. And in the special case, when XR is a square free solution, the algebra is PBW and Artinchellering algebra. So at that time, this was just the beginning of classification and intensive investigation for art in Sheltarregular Algeria. Art in Shalta regular algebras, which are considered as main objects in non-commutative algebraic geometry. So having got these good properties, I decided to investigate some kind of non-computative algebraic geometry for this kind of algebra, namely various notions and Notions and special algebras known from community geometry could be interpreted for the Young-Baxter algebras. So the last year and a half, I investigated Perlonese and segreamorphisms between some Young-Baxter algebras defined by involved if non-degenerate solutions. And I wanted to continue with this kind of ideal important solutions. But the reason that I considered this initially was inspired by a very beautiful paper by a big team, Eric, Ilaria, Arm√©, so they are all listed. And they initiated and made, I would say, a deep study of a special class of non-evocative solutions called left non-degenerate, idempotent solutions. So I believe this algebra should be studied. Not all questions are solved, so they they deserve very special attention. Very special attention. So I considered initially a very particular subclass I need some to fix some notation before I continue with this class which is called pernotation. Which is called permutation solutions. So having a set with a map from the Cartesian square of the set onto itself, but no more restrictions, we call such a pair quadratic set. And this is what we shall use instead of these maps to lambda rho, which other colleagues were used to. Are used to. I like this notation for the left and the right action, which comes from mathematical physics. So we write just the image of a pair x, y r as y to the power x, x to the power y. And this formula defines something I put it left action because we don't have a group, affects onto itself. To itself defined naturally. And if this left action is bijective, we say that that is left non-degenerate, right-non-degenerate is defined similarly, and it's called idempotent if r squared this r. So here is a repetition, we need to separate it, s? To each quadratic set, long time ago, 2004, I associated canonically various algebraic objects with relations naturally defined by the map. So xy is equal to y prime x if r xy is y prime x, but do you want? is y prime x, but we want to make sense, they should be different words. So today we shall consider the monoid and the quadratical with such relations. When the solution, when the quadratic set is a braided set, we call these objects accordingly Young-Paxster algebra and the According to Young-Baxter algebra and Young-Baxter monologue. Because we shall involve a Gromner basis for finite sets and finitely generated algebras, we need to fix an enumeration on X, which is extended to the so-called degree lexicographic order on the freemonoid generated by X. generated by x. So typically we can always write the relation xy equals zt as if we live in an algebra as xy minus zt or zt minus xy according which is the greatest greater monom. So the corresponding algebra is quadratic algebra and I start with the very first very Start with the very first, very small result which motivates some further studies. So we don't start with the solution. We start just with the quadratic set, which is left non-degenerate and of very special shape. XY is mapped onto Y to the XY. And then if we start with this setting, XR XR is a solution of the Ein-Baxter equation if and only if there exists a permutation such that R is equal to Fyy. So it does not depend on X at all. In this case, Xr is an identical solution that is R squared equals R. And I just formalize the I just formalize the definition. If x is a non-empty set and f is a connotation on x, we shall call the pair xrf, where rf is defined the way that we already discussed. As a permutation, I then put a solution. And for short writing, I often write PIS, but I pronounce it permutation. But I pronounce it permutation on the highly important solutions. So we will be interested in the class of all permutation ideempotent solutions on sets of order N. This class will be called Pn. The solutions do not have to be necessary reacts, they can be other sets as they will appear in the future. And we will see that all pernotation solutions in this class, if x is fixed, their Young-Baxter algebras are isomorphic, not just isomorphic, they have the same standard finite presentation, which totally does not depend on the pernotation method. This will be our first year. So we start with We start with first studying just mentioning some properties of the Young Bacter algebra of permutation as important solution. And the second part will be already some first steps in non-commutative algebraic geometry in this class. The third step, I will not speak about this, it is developed by It is developed by Chan. Non-commutative differential geometry. It was written, but I didn't mention vocally that these results are published in a joint paper, which are not read, so this is very recent work. So this is our theorem A, which is mainly combinatorial, but it is like the core results from which Results from which follow, and which is used intensively for the further results. It presents, it gives a new set of relations for the Yal-Baxter algebra of a permutation solution. So we start with the permutation solution given by some fixed set x, which is enumerated, this is essential, and a permutation. A commutation. By definition, the Young-Baxter algebra has this kind of presentation. It's a portion of the free associative algebra module ideal generated by these relations which come from the map R. However, instead of these relations, we prove that We prove that one can take another set of relations which generate the same ideal. That means all relations of the algebra follow from these relations, but also from these relations. These are equivalent generators of the same ideal. And they are very, very simple. And these relations, if you notice, These relations, if you notice, they totally do not depend on the permutation method. Moreover, these relations form the reduced, what is called the reduced Gromner basis, that is the minimum Grubner basis of the ideal, generated by R zero or by this new set of relations in the free associated function. Having the reduced ground the basis here, there is a typo we mean here we mean x1 to the power k. k runs over from 0. k is a non-negative integer. So the Ponkreberkov with k basis. With k basis of A consists of these elements. And in particular, A is a graded algebra, Geoffen Kiru dimension one. You can use Diamond Lemma to work instead of some algebra on the scan of all normal monomials, and the operation ball is normalization of the products. And it is essential to know the basis of the D-graded component of the Fay. These are the words of this special shape. X1 to some power D minus 1, not some, D minus 1, multiplied by Xm, where M varies from 1 to M. So that these are all normal. So, that these are all normal monomials of lambda. And it is easy to see that the dimension of every graded component is fixed. It is always n. This is a phenomenon for me. For me. And it will be essential for the description of the Veromeze, actually. So here, I think I'm afraid I'm a bit slow. Here I have given an example, but I'll not read it. But I'll not read it. You can read it. Of the case when X has just three elements and R is defined via the longest three cycle, one, two, three. And these are the graphs of what we call our orbit. Rx on x squared, right? And it maps every monomial of length 2 into Of lambd2 into possibly another monomial of length2. And two words of lamb2 are equal in our algebra if they belong to the same r orbit. So this is the trick. Instead of writing the relation that we start, we choose in each orbit, so the first orbit tells us that x1 x1 equals x2 x1 equals x3x1 in the algebra. X1 in the algebra. Instead of writing the relations that come from F, we just organize them this way. So we take the minimal monomial here on the first orbit is X1 X1 and then every other gives a binomial relation. So that means in our algebra X3X1 minus X1X1 is 0, etc. Etc. Now I continue. So our first corollary is that no matter what the permutations are, the corresponding yand-vector algebras are isomorphic. And for a fixed enumeration of x, these algebras share the same, this is called. Share the same, this is called standard finite presentation when the Grogner basis is finite. The same standard finite presentation, the same basis of normal words, etc. We have seen that standard presentation. There is some simplification. If you take a word of length, so this is rotating. If you take, so we don't rotation assumption as before. Solid rotational assumption as before, if you take just a word of length D, you can immediately say what it is as a normal word. It only depends on the last letter, xq. No matter what are these guys, the result is this normal word, x1 to the power d minus 1 by xq. So this equality holds in the Holds in the monoid associated to the solution and hence in the algebra. And again, I repeat, it totally does not depend on RF. I have listed briefly some of the null algebraic properties. Most of them are written in a more general setting in this joint paper. But here, Joint paper, but here they follow straightforwardly from theorem A. And one is proven, it's very not obvious, that the global dimension is always infinite. I proved a more general new result, which is theorem P. And this result is about PBW algebras, not necessarily. Not necessarily related to Young Baxter with the set of PPW generators X1 and Xn and Gauffenker dimension M, which is strictly less than N. It can be 1, 2, whatever. In our case, it is 1. Then, the algebra has infinite global dimension. I recommend there is no time to explain, I was planning to put some pictures. This is why we explained it. This is well explained in the paper, but I started this technique in an old paper in 2012 in Advances, where I wrote about Arctic Shelter regularity and Young-Baxter, a solution of the Young-Baxter equations, where I introduced two dual graphs. We speak about PPW algebras. One is the graph of the normal words, and the dual And the duograph, I know, I know, uh, is uh coming. I I have to finish at 10:30. It's until 10:30. 10:30. Yeah. And I'll continue. So, those who want to read, please feel most welcome. So, here we come with PRMC, which is a bound for Bound for lower and upper bounds for the dimension of the graded component. So all the time we consider these algebras. And it is clear that the law about bounds is exact because the pronutation idempotent solutions satisfy this. But here the assumption is that the solution is just non-degenerate ident solution whose young bar. Important solution whose young bugs are algebraic PPW but not necessary for notation. And there were questions and I thank Garney for answering for the second open question. If the dimension A2 is N, then XR for the permutation solution. The answer is no. Can you provide with the example? Just a permutation. Just a permutation, just of ident solutions who salt.us pbw. And now, very far fastly, we will speak about some applications. In fact, this is the study I started with, the diveronesis of algebras and the secret products. So, the definition I remind: if we have a graded algebra, the diveronesis of algebra thing. Diverunesis of algebra of A is the gradient algebra defined this way. So the diverunes algebras were studied and the morphisms were studied. They are fundamental objects in commutative algebra and geometry. So the Hibernone algebras are not very clear when the case is non-commutative. What I mean, the relations are involve serious study. Involve serious study. And I'll skip here and I'll just go to the theorem. So we start with the permutation solution and we list down the normal monomials of lengthy order flexible graph. And then I introduce some notion of different. Some notion of Divermunes solution which is extracted from the monoid S. The monoid S is not just a monoid, but this is a braided monoid. This is a result in Madrid, and it is a graded braided monoid, and there is a braiding operator which preserves the lengths. And with it, we can from it, we can induce special neurons. Can induce special new solution, which is, I prove that it is again a permutation solution. Of course, the set will be the set of all words, normal words of Lamb D. So this is our theorem. These solutions are needed to describe the relations of the Divoronese. The relations of the Divoronese come from the Veronese solution. And in fact, again, a phenomenon which was a great surprise. Phenomenon which was a great surprise for me that the algebra, the initial algebra A and its Diveronese are isomorphic algebra. But even more, the Diverunese algebra, sub-algebra, is the young Baxter algebra of what I call diveronesization. So here, here, this is mentioned. And then this is a strategy coming again from This is a strategy coming again from quantitative algebraic geometry. Besides the Diveronese subalgebra, one has, in fact, this is how they started, to define Diveronese map from another algebra of the same class onto the Diveronese sub-algebra. So we organize algebra, Young Baxter algebra coming from induced Coming from induced from what I call equal solution. And the statement is that the generators of this young Pactor algebra can be mapped in the generators of our diverumes. If we just map this, then this assignment can be extended to injective homomorphism of graded algebras from this young factor algebra that is curly A to our A to our Young-Buxler algebra A in such a way that the image of the map is the Brunesis of algebra. And in contrast with other cases of solutions here, this is an injective map. The kernel is trivial. Or if you look at my previous papers, when we consider involutive, non-degenerate solutions, it's very difficult to. It's very difficult to describe the kernel. I mean, it's not obvious, and it is large. Three minutes. This is a great product. Again, we need quadratic algebras, which are, no, not quadratic, just graded. They don't have to be quadratic. Just graded algebras, A and B. And as a grade product, it is defined the following way. Is defined the following way. It is a new graded algebra whose graded component A or B is the tensor product of the corresponding graded components. And again arises the question how can we describe the segregated product of two Young Baxter algebra that correspond to our type of solutions? And here, And here, for this purpose, I need to define what is Cartesian product of solutions to organize its algebra, young particle algebra, and then so here is our theorem describing the relations of the segreg product. In fact, the segregated product is also isomorphic to a young Baxter algebra. Backstep algebra of a permutation solution, but this time it will have order m by n if the x has order m and y has order. And we need to organize the Cartesian product of these two solutions and then to find it turns out that the Cartesian product is not difficult, it's also a permutation solution. It's also a permutation solution. Solution. It's also a pernotation solution. And also, the relations are a typical notation from community algebraic geometry. When people study Segreg product, they give double indices. And here are given the relations. And again, the relations are, as we can be expected, the reduced grommon basis of the new ideal in the new. The new ideal in the new free associative algebra, which will be generated by this W one one, W one two, so it has m by n generators. And then comes so the separate product is isomorphic to the young factor algebra of the technical product of the solutions. And I have to stop at just to say how the typical strategy when we want to find the cigrimorphism. The Sigremorphism. So we have the Sigret product, and in the same class of algebras, we are searching another algebra which is abstractly given, which is mapped onto our algebra in such a way that it's mapping the tensor product of A and B in such a way that the image is the cigarette product that the original object. The cigarette product is a The segregated product is a sub-alpha, but it is not embedded. So, what is the theorem? It doesn't have a name. So, as I said, we organize special permutation of ideas solution. Luckily, it is high-important. The Cartesian product of ideal important solutions is always high-important. I prove this. And then we organize this young factor algebra and then factor algebra and then we start with an assignment, it's a nature assignment and we prove that it extends to an algebraic homomorphism from our algebra Az, the young tax algebra corresponding to this solution that is given, into the tensor product of A and B. This map is called the Segrem map, I think. And the image of the Segrem map is exactly the same. The Segre map is exactly what we want. It is a Segre product, and the great thing is that the kernel is trivial. This never typically never happens otherwise, as I said. So, thank you for your attention. Any questions or comments? Yes, he's the first series of every box to start algebra. Every gapstair algebra question? It is not. It is not difficult to do. Especially in these cases, when you know, sorry, I'm not going to work. Did you get the answer? If the algebra is PBW, it's always known. It's always known. I tell you why. There is a theory, very, very old theory. This is from Moscow State. From Moscow state, we were a small group when we studied problem cases before the changes. And in fact, this is the theorem of mathematics. When you have algebra which is standard finitely represented, not necessarily quadratic, and M is the highest length of the monomer. Of the monomial, of the monomials which are highest terms in the grommet basis. Then a special graph can be organized, directed graph, and the normal words in the algebra, the basis, can be read of this graph. So you can count, and also the graph gives you information about the galvanic dimension. Here, I have given the graph of The graph of our solution, which is very, very simple graph. So, in this case, it is rational. Yeah, but in the general, the graphs may be complicated. If the directed graph, so having the graph, you can always write an algorithm for the Himbler series. Let me say one thing. For finitely, standard finitely presents algebras, that means finite group bases. The Hilbert series is always. The Hilbert series is always a rational function. I know. The question is: what do we want? Is the Hilbert series of every Garibaster algebra ration? I cannot say because I haven't thought about this. But of course, for every PPW, things are very easy. I don't know. Of course, it was a conjecture of shared that always the Hilbert series of a finite representative algebra. Series of authorite presented algebra administrational, and David Granik, whom I use a lot in my studies, he made a counter-example when he was very young. So I don't know what exactly, but I haven't been interested in... So the growth is of explanation of what we are faster. So it's just if I haven't talked about If I haven't thought about this, I don't want to say information that can be used. It could be exponential. Okay. Other questions or comments? What last time?
