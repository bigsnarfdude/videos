Great. So I'll start off with giving a lot of credit to where credit's due, and that's this character over here. This is Matthew Schwaffer, who's a postdoc in the lab, and he has been responsible for almost all of the unpublished results coming later in the presentation. So, Matthew has just been great. And we've been looking at this pretty interesting question of how. At this, you know, pretty interesting question of how do you scale biosynthesis with cell size. Okay, so how did we get there? Well, we got there through some studies of my favorite problem. And my favorite problem in biology is to try to understand how it is that growth triggers cell division. And so we know for in a variety of different contexts, cells need to grow in order to enter. Cells need to grow in order to enter the cell division cycle. And my lab has really been focused on trying to understand how it is that that happens. What is it that's biochemically different about this large cell compared to this small cell that makes it divine? And we think that's important because the ability to couple growth to division is ultimately what allows cells to set their size and hit a target size. And in fact, you know. And in fact, you know, one of the most obvious differences between cells of different types are in fact their differences in size. And we think that that is closely associated with their function, at least in a lot of cases. So if we look at different cells in the human body, I'm showing here a millionfold range in cell sizes. What I hope you'll appreciate is that, you know, things at the lower end of the scale here, like sperm cells. End of the scale here, like sperm cells and red blood cells really need to be small in order to fit through tight spaces to perform their functions. On the upper end of the scale of mitotically competent cells, we have the oocyte, which is just a honking big cell. And it really needs to be that big because it has to contain all of the mass to produce over 100 cells by itself to kind of form the entire pre- By itself to kind of form the entire pre-implantation embryo, which then implants into mom and can start getting nutrients from mom and then switch on Tor and start growing. But it needs to be big because it needs to have mass for hundreds of cells. Okay, so cells of different type are different size, and that may be associated with their function. A kind of second argument as to why this is important is because if you zoom into any one particular type, what you'll see is an assembly of cells that are all, you know, roughly. Assembly of cells that are all roughly equivalent in their size. And what that means ultimately is that cells have a way of kind of measuring how much they grew and then linking that information to either division or differentiation processes. And so we'd been really interested in this question of, you know, how do you do this? And 15 years ago, when I started thinking about it, we didn't really know how this worked for any type of cell, much less how. much less how that process would be modulated to hit over a millionfold range in target cell size, right? And so the approach that I got going on while working with Fred Cross and Eric Sidia as a postdoc at the Rockefeller University was to try to attack this question in the simplest eukaryote that we can work with, which is budding yeast. Now, how does it work in budding yeast? Well, in budding yeast, Work in Budding East. Well, in Budding East, it's been known since the beginning of time when Lee Hartwell roamed the earth that the G1S transition is kind of a key point where you link cell growth with cell division. And if we crack open the really nice textbook on cell cycle control by our colleague Dave Morgan up at UCSF, what you'll read is that the GMS transition, like Is that the G1S transition, like the other transitions in the cell division cycle, are driven by changes in activity of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase complexes. So as posed by the textbook, the question was really one of how does something like cell size or cell growth feed into this increase in cyclin-dependent kinase activity? And so for yeast, what that means is this molecule. Is this this molecule Clin3? Now, I realize that there are mathematicians here and physicists and stuff like that, and they can be a bit challenged in remembering three-letter acronyms. But I assure you that I'll only introduce the absolute minimum number of these that I need. But I do need this one. So, apologies, but here we go. So, Clin3 is a cyclin which finds a cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK1. I was also similarly challenged, but I've been through. I was also similarly challenged, but I've been through like a multiple-step program by immersing myself in a biology department. And now I can actually listen to a talk and remember the names of things, which is strange. Right. And so this complex triggers a series of biochemical events, which then lead the cell to enter the cell division cycle. But let's forget about all those for the moment and focus on this, right? Because this was kind of our question: how does size and growth lead to increases in Plin3? Increases in Clint3. And so we did, you know, what was kind of our favorite thing to do, which is to tag genes that they're endogenous loci and then measure with high kind of temporal and spatial resolution, what are the concentration dynamics of this protein. And so we did that. I won't get into the details, but it was a lot of work. And what we found was basically that the concentration of Clin3 was not changing very much as cells were going. Changing very much as cells were going through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, right? So the concentration of Clin3 was roughly a constant in G1. And this wasn't actually a new result. This result was also published almost 20 years ago by Mike Tyers and Bruce Futcher. And they got the same result essentially using Western blots and other stone tools. But ultimately, the stone tools agree and with the Tools agree, and with the newfangled single-cell imaging, and the concentration of Clin3 is not changing all that much. So, that rules out many of the kind of simplest versions of the textbook model. Unfortunately, it didn't rule anything in, right? We kind of like rule something out, but we couldn't rule anything in. And we were basically stuck trying to figure out how do you get some kind of size-dependent signal out of a protein which concentration is not changing. And we were basically stuck there until Kirchmoeller. Smaller, yeah, a silly question. Um, yeah, so you put the GFP on Clin3, yeah, but I mean, that just tells me how many Clin3s there are. Does it tell me whether it's bound by something else? I mean, you or free or active or inactive? No, no, that's right. And so that's why I try to put this caveat of it rules out like the simplest versions of the textbook model. There are other ways. Textbook model: There are other ways of kind of answering this question: how do we get a size-dependent signal with a constant concentration protein, like you know, titrating it against something else? And we did a lot of work, actually spent a couple of years trying to test different versions of that model, quite a few of them proposed by Bruce Futcher at Stony Brook. And we couldn't really find one that worked. But yeah, like what I'm showing you is just What I'm showing you is just concentration of the molecule in the nucleus. Okay. So, Jan, just a clarifying question: Are you looking at the number of molecules per nucleus or the concentration in the nucleus, meaning concentration, number of molecules per volume, right? Yeah, yeah. So the immediate output is kind of number of molecules because we're using wide field. Because we're using wide-field microscopy, so we sum up all the light. And so we get the total amount of fluorescent molecules. And so to estimate the concentration, we use the fact that, you know, the, well, we measure the size of the cell, basically. And so we divide one by the other. Got it. Thank you. Yeah. So, you know, we were basically stuck trying to come up with various Trying to come up with various versions of the solution to Constantine's question until Kurt Schmoller, who was a postdoc leading this project at the time, asked, what about all the other proteins in this network? We've been spending so much time and attention on Clin3. What about everything else? And so he tagged everything else and measured its dynamics. And then what he found was a whole bunch of things, the concentration is not changing very much, except for one thing. And he found this protein we. Found this protein We5 whose concentration is decreasing as the cells grow. And that was exciting for a couple of reasons. The main one being that We5 had already been established as an inhibitor of cell division. And what we're seeing now is that the concentration of this inhibitor is in essence inversely proportional to the volume of the cell. And so that was nice because now we have like a new model, right? So cell size and cell growth, you know, may not be operating through Clin3, but rather. Operating through Clin3, but rather that cell size can act on W5, which is this protein sitting in the middle of this pathway or network, and it simply dilutes it out. So you get, the bigger you are, the lower the concentration you have of this cell cycle inhibitor. And we, of course, did a lot of experiments to establish that. There's also ongoing experiments derived from this paper, but I'm not going to get into that. But I'm not going to get into that because I think the most interesting experiments are already published. I don't know. This is one of the favorite papers I wrote. So, if you read anything that we ever wrote, read this one. I think it's pretty good. Okay, so we have our initial question was, how do you get a growth requirement to enter the division cycle? And we have a bit of an answer here, right? So, the way that you would generate this kind of growth requirement would be through an inhibitor dilution mechanism. An inhibitor dilution mechanism. So, you know, as the cell grows, you get lower and lower concentrations of the cell cycle inhibitor, and that makes you more and more likely to enter the cell cycle and divide. In contrast, most of the other parts of the proteome, most of the other proteins that are kind of required for the genome transition, they're just all sitting there at roughly constant concentration and are kind of this kind of static, not dynamic background. Not dynamic background over which, like, kind of like the moving part is this diluted cell cycle inhibitor WE5. And, you know, since then, we've applied this same type of concept looking at human cells, which are a bit different in the sense that they have kind of different proteins that have different evolutionary histories that regulate the G1S transition. But the principle in essence was the same. So instead of We5 being this. The instead of W5 being the cell cycle inhibitor that's diluted in G1, we have the retinoblastoma protein Rb, which is diluted by growth in G1. And this is an important way that human cells link cell growth and cell division. In contrast, other things like cyclin D or E2F1, I mean, are sitting at constant concentration. Okay, so So and that was we recently published that last year. All right. But what I'm going to talk about today is actually sort of not this. It's actually going to be like this boring green line that's sitting at constant concentration. And actually, if you think about, you know, how does a cell do that? Do that, it's even the kind of like generic result that's happening for most of the proteins. The more you think about it, the more you realize that that's actually quite a non-trivial result as well. Okay, so you know, we've done a couple of follow-ups that I wanted to just like briefly mention. This is on BioRxive. It will be appearing in Molecular Cell for those of you that are interested. Appear in a molecular cell for those of you that are interested in. And that's, you know, looking at which genes behave kind of like Clin3, which genes behave like We5. And, you know, the vast majority of them behave like Clin3. Only a small minority of genes like We5 and histones behave like We5. And in budding yeast, the reason that you get this kind of dilution behavior is actually through a transcriptional mechanism. Okay. But Okay, but really the main thing that I want to get at here is: you know, why do you have size scaling? How is the cell able to kind of maintain size independent concentrations of proteins and more particularly, message RNA as the cell grows? Right. So that's the question. And so to give you a little bit of background on that, As cells get bigger, you know, all kinds of things change. Most things change in direct proportion to the size of the cell. So it's been known that for quite some time now, it's become more quantitative in more recent years that the size of organelles of the cell scale so that their size increases in proportion to the volume of the cell. So if you look at things like the nucleus or mitochondria or the vacuole, you can see this direct. Or the vacuole, you can see this direct increase in the volume of that organelle in direct proportion to the volume of the cell. So, organelle compartments generally scale with size, the total amount of RNA scales with size, so that the concentration of RNA remains constant in the cell, the total amounts of protein scale with size, and here's just a nice piece of data from Arjun Raj. piece of data from Arjun Raj looking at human cells at a single single molecule fish using single molecule fish to measure the number of mRNA in a particular cell as a function of the volume of that cell you know and you can see this really nice linear correlation which is independent of the cell cycle phase so if you're G1 cell your S phase or G2 cell no matter where you are in the cell cycle you have this linear correlation between the number of these mRNA and the cell volume The cell volume. So, all of these things really scale. How does it happen? Or why does that happen? Well, why it happens, I think, is because, you know, biochemical reaction rates are the way that they are in the cell for some reason, presumably that's good for the cell. And by scaling all of these things, you are able to kind of maintain concentrations roughly constant and sort of maintain your relatively optimal biochemical reaction rates. Now, Now, is that true? Do the cells care? Well, one way of kind of seeing how they might care is to make them too big. And so that's what's shown here. In budding yeast, it's really easy to introduce like just a bunch of mutations where you can make cells that are five or 10 times the normal size and just see what happens to the cell. And generally, what happens to this cell are not such good things. And that was really nicely documented. And that was really nicely documented in this paper here, which is, you know, I don't know, a really nice paper, but unfortunately, one of the last papers from Angelica Amon, who's a really wonderful researcher in our field. So Gabriel Nur in her lab really documented how biosynthesis collapsed when S cells got too big and all of the other different cell biology. Again, and all of the other different cell biological things that go wrong after you get too big. And everything to do with cell function is decreased. And in general, what they thought was triggering all the loss of dysfunction is this kind of general stress response, like the cells got too big, that led to some kind of generic stress response, and then that inhibited cell function. Okay. So. So scaling is important. I think the step which is maybe most confusing or most difficult to understand is this step of how do you get RNA to scale in proportion to cell size, right? How do you get total protein? Well, protein is made by ribosomes and mRNA. So if your mRNA is scaling, your ribosomes are scaling. Scaling, you know, the more kind of like you would anticipate that that would result in synthesis of proteins, which just scales in indirect proportion to the volume of the cell. However, for RNA, it's more confusing, right? Because like big and small cells, you know, they have the same number of genes. The transcriptional machinery, as I'll show you, is at constant concentration. So you have sort of a constant concentration of this transcriptional machinery. This transcriptional machinery, you have this same number of genes. How do those genes know that the cell is larger and that they should transcribe at higher rates? Right? So that's kind of a key question. Yeah, again, I mean, isn't there an maybe there's maybe you already said this and I just missed it, but that seems to me an assumption that, because you were measuring the proteins, at least earlier, maybe RNA has also been measured. Maybe RNA has also been measured, right? But why wouldn't you just say, oh, it could be translational control that's somehow volume dependent? The translational control could be volume dependent in principle. Yes. I just think that the simplest thing to think about is that if it isn't, and you just have. It isn't, and you just have this sort of constant concentrations of ribosomes and mRNA, and then you're just synthesizing proteins at a similar rate, roughly per unit mass. And you don't need any kind of complicated translational control that would be size dependent to do that. On the other hand, for transcription, I think it's much less obvious how you would get the scaling of the transcript. Scaling of the transcript, right? Because somehow that genome needs to know information of the, it needs to know what the total size of the cell is and then increase transcription accordingly, right? So I've missed something fundamental here because you just said exactly kind of what I was thinking. So are you going to suggest that it is translational control that is happening or transcriptional control? Well, I'll just give you the punchline. Okay, so I'm going to explain how transcriptional control leads to increased transcription rates per, you know, whatever, as the cell gets bigger. However, then I'm going to say that we're going to measure things carefully enough and show you that that's not enough. That doesn't explain all of the scaling. And then we get, you know, in the end, this really. Really exciting new mechanism that is required to get you the rest of the way there, which is not translational control. But I'm not going to tell you what it is, so you have to stay tuned. Oh, damn. Can't go to sleep yet. Hey, hey, Jan, quick question. So most of the RNA in a cell is ribosomal, right? So does this same scaling work if you just if you just look only at mRNAs? Look only at mRNAs? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. They both scale. And we are going to look really at mRNAs. Okay. Thanks. Okay. So RNA synthesis increases with the cell cycle. This has been known since kind of the been measured in the late 70s using various radio labeling techniques. And so here's just one of them in budding yeast where they use a sort of pulse of. It uses a pulse of labeling to label the nascent RNA, and then kind of steady labeling to label the total amount of RNA. And if you look at the ratio of those, it's relatively flat. So the bigger the cell is, you know, the more, the more RNA it is synthesizing. But, you know, how does this happen, right? How does the larger cell transcribe more than a smaller cell? More than a smaller cell. The DNA constant, DNA is constant, and they're bathed in this sort of fixed concentration in the nucleus. And so, why do you get increased transcription rates? And so, Matthew, as a starting point, said, well, let's just try to measure this globally and as carefully and as quantitatively as possible. And so, we spent months and months trying to make CHIP-seq, the chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chip-seq, the chromatin immunoprecipitation, and followed by DNA sequencing technology as quantitative as possible. And so he did that using this spike-in normalized ChIP-seq method. And the way that that works is he puts in a fixed number of Saccharomyces POM B cells. So yeah, and yeah, Matthew did his PhD actually with Paul Nurse working in POM. Actually, with Paul Nurse working in Palm B. And so, there's sort of a residual tendency to want to use that yeast. And so, here it is: it's the spike in control for everything. So, here's put in a fixed number of the saccharomyces Pombi, and then you mix that with the same number of budding yeast. The budding yeast can be various different sizes of budding yeast, but always mix in the same ratio of numbers of budding yeast to Pombi. And then, what you look at is. And then, what you look at is the kind of ratio of the reeds from the budding yeast to the pompy. And that gives you really an estimate of the actual occupancy on the budding yeast genome of a particular factor, not just the relative distribution across the genome of that factor, which is what you normally get from ChIP-seq measurements. So, here we're using the spike to get how much are things on the genome. You know, on the genome. So, just to show you that, so here we're looking at RNA polymerase 2 occupancy. And per cell, the bigger the cells are, these are different populations of cells of different increasing size. The bigger the cell is, the more RNA polymerase II you have on the genome. And we have other ways of looking at, oh, so here's, and all of that RNA polymerase II is really, you know, on the gene bodies, right? So here's the transcription. The gene bodies, right? So here's the transcription start site, transcription termination site, and this is where the RNA polymerase II is, and then it goes away. And so we can also look at things like initiated versions of RNA polymerase II using different antibodies, and that looks exactly the same. And we can also look at things like elongating, you know, actively transcribing version, and that scales exactly the same as the initiated and the total. So we're looking at, you know, really active RNA polymerase II on the On the genome, and we can see that there's more and more of it in bigger cells. Okay. And so how does this happen? So one thing you guys probably wouldn't worry about this, but like most biologists would worry about the chromatin. So like have there been changes in the chromatin? The chromatin, you know, in some way that makes it more permissive for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the genome in larger cells. And so Matthew spent a bunch of money on a bunch of these experiments. I'm only going to show you one. And this is like a methyl fitting assay where the DNA, which is which is accessible, gets methylated, and then you can read that out using sequencing technology. Read that out using sequencing technology. And in essence, you know, if the cells are big or medium or small, it doesn't really matter. The signature of these things is exactly the same. Nothing really changes. You can also look at histone modifications. They don't change. And so there's nothing really that changes in the chromatin that we can measure, despite having spent quite a bit of money on it, that seems that would be different in a large versus a small cell. Like it all basically looks the same. Looks the same. So we're still stuck with the same question: how do you get more RNA polymerase too? And the hypothesis that's been out there since some time, I think was first really articulated by this crazy Russian Zarinsky, who was a postdoc at Rockefeller the same time that I was a postdoc there. He was working with Paul Nurse at the time. And he and Paul kind of proposed this idea that there was some kind of limit. Proposed this idea that there was some kind of limiting factor for transcription. They're probably not the first ones to say it, but they had data and they wrote more about it. But that's the first time that I read about it for sure. And so the idea was that you would have some factor that's limiting for transcription, and that that factor would activate transcription in terms of its amount rather than in terms of its concentration. So it would kind of like pile up on the genome and increase the transcription. On the genome, and increase the transcription in proportion to its amount, and its amount is directly proportioned to the size of the cell, right? So, that's this kind of titration of a limiting transcription factor on the genome. And there have been various versions of this model that have been proposed over the years. And so, but none of them have done anything empirical to try to identify what that limiting factor would be. And so, we said, why don't we do that? And so we said, why don't we do that? You know, let's try to find the factor. Let's have a look at all of the basic transcriptional machinery in the cell. And when we look at that, we see that everything having to do with basic aspects of transcription just scale in direct proportion to the volume of the cell. So they all have the kind of first property of limiting factor. Right. So they all bind more in larger cells. Bind more in larger cells. So they all have like kind of the right property. And so what we thought to do was to directly test whether or not transcription is sensitive to any one of these factors. And so the way that Matthew did this was he created these heterozygous diploid budding yeasts, where one allele is just a wild type allele and the second allele is tagged with this FRB rapamycin-inducible binding. Rapamycin inducible binding domain. So you add rapamycin, and then that yanks half of your protein of interest, which then yanks whatever complex it's attached to out of the nucleus and then gets anchored in the cytoplasm. So we can acutely remove half of any particular factor from the cytoplasm and then measure, you know, what happens to transcription. And so we do that for all of these basal transcription complexes, and you see a whole lot of. And you see a whole lot of nothing happening with one exception. And then the one exception is down here in the bottom right, which is not like the others, and that's RNA polymerase II. So if you remove half of the RNA polymerase II, you have a drastic effect of reducing transcription a lot. So the only one of these things that fits the limiting factor model is RNA polymerase II itself. Okay, can we increase RNA polymerase II? We can with great difficulty. With great difficulty. And so, in this experiment, what Matthew's done is overexpress all 12 subunits of RNA polymerase II by about twofold. And when he does that, we can get about a 25-30% increase in the amount of RNA polymerase II on the genome. Of course, we don't know that we've gotten double the amount of complexes here because it's a really complicated complex to make and we've just overexpressed everything. So we don't know how it all fits. Everything, so we don't know how well it all formed, but certainly this is going in the right direction, right? Like we made more complex and we got more transcription. So RNA polymerase theory really seems like the thing. Okay, so let's get, you know, maybe even more kind of quantitative about our assay of transcription. We want to make it as simple as possible. Previously, we were looking at different mutants that were different sizes. Here, we're going to keep Here we're going to keep the DNA constant. So we're going to keep the constant, we're only going to look at G1 cells. We're going to do that by using centrifugal literation to isolate small G1 cells. And then we arrest them in G1 and grow them for different amounts of time. And so we get all these G1 cells that are of increasing size, but all in the same, with the same amount of DNA. And so when we do that, we get this kind of curve where the transcription goes up and then flattens. Transcription goes up and then flattens out. And so, can we understand that with a titration model? Well, with the simplest titration model, you can't. This flattening out, we weren't the first people to observe either. That was also observed in the initial, you know, 2010 Zarinski paper. And to kind of explain the flattening out, what they propose is a kind of combination of this titration model plus a saturation step, where at some point you sort of saturate all the sites. You sort of saturate all the sites, all the transcription in the genome, and so all the excess of the factor just floats around and doesn't engage transcription, right? So you get like a linear increase followed by a saturation. Okay, but that should result that some genes should probably saturate before other genes. And that's not what we see. So here we're looking at occupancy on each gene, how much RNO polymerase II there is on each gene. Two there is on each gene, and you know, for the small cells versus the big cells, basically, you know, you just scale transcription up. So, you know, so the lowly transcribed genes are scaled up, the high transcribed genes are scaled up, and they're all scaled up by exactly the same factor. So, there's no evidence that, like, some genes are saturated and other genes are saturated or anything like this. Like, all the genes are kind of doing more or less the same thing. So, that wasn't like the most. So that wasn't like the most consistent with this saturation type model. It doesn't of course totally rule it out either, but it's certainly not something where you feel like, okay, this is definitely happening. And so we thought maybe we should develop a different model that might fit this data. And so I did that. So this is, I don't know, a pathetic little thing you can do, even if you have a PhD in applied math, but anyway, so the But anyway, so the so what I wrote down, kind of like the simplest model, the next simplest model is just a dynamic equilibrium with mass action kinetics of the free RNA polymerase to in the nucleus, you know, engaging the DNA, which is at fixed amount per cell, with it with the constant, you know, k on. And then we have, you know, first-order kinetics for the boundary. kinetics for the bound DNA to fall back off and become, sorry, the bound RNA polymerase II to fall off and become free RNA polymerase II in the nucleus, right? And so then we can assume that transcription is fast relative to how quickly the cell grows. We can make the left-hand side zero and then solve that. And in essence, we get a model with two parameters. One of them is the relationship between the amount of RNA polymerase there is. The amount of RNA polymerase there is in the genome. There's that linear constant. So that's one constant. And then the second parameter is essentially the dissociation constant of the polymerase and the DNA. And so that's we have a sort of a two-parameter model. We can fit that to four data points. So woohoo. But the fit doesn't look too bad. Right. But the models make predictions, right? And so here there's no more free parameters. So one of the predictions out of both of these models is that we should. out of both of these models is that we should, you know, how much of the RNA polymerase should be bound in each case. So in the regime where it's close to linearly increasing, all of the RNA polymerase 2 should be bound for the titrated factor model. But in our case, it's more like 50%, right? So we have to have this sort of free nuclear pool, which is loaded in proportion to its concentration onto the genome. And so then we make. Right. And so then, you know, we make very different predictions here. So, can we test this? Well, we can. And so, here we collaborated with Rodrigo Reyes from McGill University. And what Rodrigo does is single molecule imaging. And so he can track single molecules of either freely diffusing protein, like this, and they're rapidly moving around the nucleus. New hand histones are tightly bound, so there's a really small radius of gyration. Know is a really small radius of gyration, and RNA polymerase 2 is kind of sometimes freely diffusing and sometimes slightly bound. And so then we can look at these histograms of our RNA polymerase 2 radius of gyration and separate out sort of free versus bound fractions of RNA polymerase 2, and then see how that fits the model. And it fits our model, the dynamic equilibrium model, I would say, surprisingly well, right? And so this is zero free parameter fit. This is just a straight-up prediction from what we had before. From what we had before, so the single molecule data are supportive, but you know, as I said before, we don't get all the way there, right? So we don't get this proportional scaling of transcription with cell size. We get a significant deviation, and that deviation becomes bigger and bigger the bigger the cell gets. So, how would you get constant concentrations of mRNA out of something like this, right? If as previously If, as previously had been assumed, that the decay rate of mRNA is independent of cell size, that's just some decay rate of the mRNA, then what you would predict would be that the mRNA concentration would decrease the larger the cell got. In order to maintain constant mRNA or a constant concentration of mRNA, what you would actually need would be that the mRNA decay rate would decrease as the cells got bigger and bigger to exactly compensate. To exactly compensate the deviation from the linear model, the linear increase of the actual transcription data. So the transcription doesn't increase enough. That deviation has to be compensated for by an increase in the decay rate of mRNA. So is that true? So we sought to measure this. And so here we're just taking cells and measuring the decay rate of an mRNA, you know, in You know, in small cells after turning off the transcription. And in big cells, it does indeed decay slower. But not only does it decay slower, it decays slower in the exact amount needed to compensate for the deviation in transcription. So now we have decay rates in five different sized cells, and the larger and larger it gets, the longer and longer the half-life of the mRNA. Longer the half-life of the mRNA, precisely in the right amount to compensate for the deviation to compensate and keep the mRNA at a constant concentration. And this is just one gene, but I can show you another gene or another gene and another gene and another gene. So there's this really this global compensation at the level of the mRNA decay rate that maintains the constant mRNA concentration. Right. Right. I was a question. Quick question. So, is this the decay of mRNA active? I mean, it's not, you know, clearly proteins are ubiquinated, right? But mRNA decays. What's the mechanism of that? Yeah, there are machines that chew up the mRNA. And there's a couple of pathways that are involved in that. And we're looking at mutations in those pathways, but we don't have really any data on that yet. Really, any data on that yet? But yeah, if you assume that those machines, okay. But if you assume that those machines do a little bit of volume, would that be complete? I mean, can you just do the same thing as you did with Wi-Fi somehow? That could explain the whole thing, maybe, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That could explain the whole thing. We have one more experiment, which I didn't put in this presentation because I'm kind of wrapping up now, but I'll tell you, which is that the You, which is that the previous experiment where we remove half of the RNA polymerase 2 from the nucleus, we get this drastic drop in the transcription rate, right? The cell doesn't change size, it's just, or it changes like very little over the course of the experiment. But immediately, like once you lower the transcription rate, you can, we, after that experiment, we measured after like half an hour of that experiment, we then measured the half-life of the The half-life of the mRNA. And by lowering the transcription rate, it led to immediate change in the mRNA half-life. So it's not like there's a size. So that wouldn't fit like kind of what you proposed, where there's some sort of sort of like size-dependent control of the degradation rate, which is tuned. What I'm thinking is that there's a I'm thinking is that there's a sensor of the mRNA concentration, which is then tuning the half-life to maintain homeostasis around the desired mRNA concentration. But we have to find the molecules. But that's the favorite model. Yeah. So just to kind of say what I said again, transcription is in this case, maybe kind of stupid. Case may be kind of stupid, like just a simple mass action kinetic model of free RNA polymerase bumping into sites on the genome might explain how transcription increases with cell size. However, that obviously doesn't increase linearly with cell size. And so, to be able to maintain the constant mRNA concentration, there's actually some interesting clever feedback mechanism operating at the level of mRNA. Operating at the level of mRNA stability that we're now, of course, very interested in knowing more about. I'm sort of gonna wrap up here. Like, we don't need to go back over this. I think I will just end with that. But I wanted to touch on a couple of points that I thought would be maybe discussion points for this meeting. I don't know how we're doing on time, but this should just take a couple of minutes or a minute. Take a couple minutes or a minute, I hope. So, one of the things we realized through our work and looking at cell growth is that, like, anything could be a sensor of cell growth. Like, all that would have to happen would be that the concentration of that protein would change as the cell grew, and then that the change in that concentration should change the output of the cell. And then that would be a growth sensor. It doesn't like, and that could be really anywhere in a network. It doesn't have to be upstream or downstream. Or, you know, in our case, it's right in the middle. Or, in our case, it's right in the middle. So, that's kind of one principle we learned. Oops. Certainly, the field, I think, of cell growth could use more mathematicians. I think there's a lot of problems to solve here. I think help is needed to try to distill principles out of all of this kind of molecular. Kind of molecular information. There's kind of a lot of, you know, yeah, I mean, I mean, you've seen all these like metabolism diagrams and all of this different stuff, but when you look at it, you're like, how does the cell grow or why does the E. coli grow at 20 minutes and the yeast grow at 90 minutes doubling time? Human cell, sometimes 10 hours, sometimes 30 hours. It's very, very confusing. So I think there's a lot of kind of So, I think there's a lot of kind of big principles yet to be discovered. Coming from an applied math tradition where you try to make like the smallest possible model and then make it more and more complex from there as needed to deal with the data. So that was, I think, I don't know, like the PAL2 mass action kinetics was, for me, a very satisfying, very fun type of model to make. And then seeing if that worked. If that worked. Like a lot of this stuff, I think a lot of our successes over the last decade have really been boiled down to just being as quantitative as possible in our measurements. So the fact that we really believed that the deviation from the line of the RNA polymerase II was a deviation from the line and required more explanation is what led us to discover the mRNA half-life regulation. But if we didn't truly believe in those measurements, Um, like measurements, like we wouldn't have discovered that, right? If we're like, oh, yeah, it's just going up. Like, just going up is enough. It has to be is not enough. Like, if, but that's mostly the terminology still in the literature and biology is like things go, they're like upregulated or down regulated or they're not regulated. You know, that's like about it. But like knowing kind of what the numbers are as much as possible has been really important for us. Okay, so I'll sort of stop there. I'll sort of stop there and thank the group. And thank you for your attention.
