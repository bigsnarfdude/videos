Okay um one second um can you see my screen yes okay perfect let me go on like full screen mode okay uh okay this year okay so just let me know when So, just let me know when I can start. Yes, please go ahead. Okay, yeah. So, yeah, good morning, everyone. And I'm Robert Oliveri, postdoc at Observatoire des Paris, actually based in Medon, at Lutz. And today I would like to talk about some recent developments in asymptotic symmetries. Before starting, I would like to thank all the organizers for the kind invitation to attend the The kind invitation to attend the workshop. I'm really learning a lot, and also for the nice opportunity to speak about in particular these two recent papers. I mean, they were out on archive one year ago in collaboration with Lauren Fredel, Daniele Pranzetti, and Simone Espeziale. So just to give a very Just to give a very quick overview about a very broad topic, I just try to put all together some highlights in the last 60 years. So already, like basically in the last decade, there was evidence that seems to like apparent different topics like asymptotic symmetries, soft theorems, and memory effects. memory effects actually were were playing there were actually there were a very close interplay among among these topics and one of the very few references pointing out these are this paper by steker and then strominger and sibed off and the first appearance of asymptotic symmetries in gravity actually dates back in the 60s when bondi messner and sark Bondi, Messner, and Sachs discovered, actually, with some surprise, the so-called now BMS group, which has the structure of a semi-direct product of Lorentz transformation that you are very familiar with, and the so-called super translations that can be thought of as like translations that depend on the angles on null infinity depicted here with some like blue. Depict here with some like blue lines. But also, super translation, for example, gives some very interesting symmetry-based arguments to explain the so-called memory effects. In particular, for example, the Christoduru memory effects that essentially tells you that there is a permanent displacement in the relative position of two inertial observers. Of two inertial observers before and after some gravitational waves passed through. Here they picked this also as well in terms of super translation, just to give you like an idea, pictorially, an idea of how these two concepts are related. Then there are also like soft theorems that essentially are theorems that tells you about the structure of your theory, your gauge theory, also gravity. Also, gravity, when you are in the infrared regime, they essentially are relations among scattering amplitudes when one of the massless external particles is soft, so has zero energy. So in the end, actually, the most important thing about these interesting relations is that they arise as like very new theoretical questions with the possibility to observe new gravitational effects. Gravitational effects, for example, memory effects are among them. And what we learn, at least what seems that is the case, that the larger the symmetry group is, the more soft theorems and the more memory effects you have. Just think about the extension of the BMS group with the super rotations. They give like a symmetry-based argument for Symmetry-based argument for the spin memory effects, for example. So, the main question today is a very big question that I think has no very sharp answer yet. That is, what is the largest asymptotic symmetry group in gravity? And in some sense, also having the largest or the biggest asymptotic symmetry group in gravity will also help us a lot because it will serve as a kind of organizing principle. Of organizing principle where to point to new effects or to properties of gravitational radiation and so on, thanks to this framework. So the outline of today's talk is the following. First, I'm going to introduce you this latest extension of the BMS group that it's called the BIL BMS group. I will be very Be very elementary, just to be sure that everyone, not only like the experts, are on the same page. So I will introduce the Bondi-Sachs gauge, I will spell out the boundary condition of the gravitational field, and then I will derive the generators and the asymptotic symmetry algebra. The second part of the talk instead will try to give you evidence of a very sharp interplay among the asymptotic symmetry Asymptotic symmetry algebra and the asymptotic gravitational dynamics. To do so, we need some basics of covariant phase space formalisms. And also, I will comment about how to renormalize the phase space. This actually is also a very important topic, per se, so I will just touch it a little bit. Then I will give a different understanding of the viable. Understanding of the biel BMS group as essentially the limiting case of the so-called extended corner symmetry at finite distance. And then I will conclude and I will also talk about some future direction that can be expanded later in the question time. So let's start with the bio BMS group. So first of all, what the bond So, first of all, what the Bondi Sachs gauge is. So, we need coordinates that are well adapted to describe null radiation, like electromagnetic radiation or gravitational radiation. And this is what actually Bondi and Sachs did by choosing some appropriate coordinate system. Here, U is the coordinate on null infinity, which I should say. Which I should say has the topology of R cross S2. R instead is here the luminosity distance and each point here on scry plus is a sphere that is described by usual coordinates, spherical coordinates. And then the gauge is also important and is reached by this Is reached by these four conditions on the metric. And finally, you have this bondy SACS metrics, which is given by this sector spanned by the U and R coordinates, and this other sector spanned by the spherical coordinates with some shift, vector shift UA. At this stage, the function that appears in the stage the functions that appear in the metric beta f qab and qa are just functions of all the boundary coordinates and when you want to try to describe the asymptotic behavior of the gravitational fields in a neighborhood of null infinity here well you have to specify the asymptotic boundary conditions and this is not actually an easy task conceptually because Conceptually, because I mean the metric is also the dynamical object that you are studying. It's not like when you study, for example, electromagnetic radiation where you have an inert background and well, this is what it is, right? But in this case, this question actually has not really like some definite and sharp answer. So, indeed, from time to time, it gets updated. The answer gets updated. Gets updated. And this is actually what happened in time. So you fix the UR and UA coordinates, at least in general relativity, this is always the case. For example, if you consider Branse-Decay theory, well, this O should be R minus one, for example, but this is just a minor comment. Then you have different choice of boundary conditions. Of boundary conditions that I want now to tell you. So, in the original BMS, so they wanted Bondi Mesner and SACS introduced, the metric on the leading part of the two-sphere metric is the so-called round metric, the one with richest colour equal to two. Later, actually, quite recently, Later, actually quite recently in 2010, this condition has been relaxed by just considering conformally related round metric with a time-dependent conformal factor. And then Campilia and LADA in 2014 introduced the so-called generalized BMS because they consider an arbitrary metric on the two. metric on the two sphere with the condition that it is time independent and the variation of the of the square root of the metric determinant is is kept fixed what we instead introduced very recently last year is that we keep we keep this condition this boundary condition for the leading metric Living metric on the two spheres, but we relax the scale structure. We want it to vary. Just a few remarks at this stage. Well, if you impose this condition, then using the equation of motion, you get that GU is just order one. And this is actually one motivation not to just put this different than zero, because if you Different than zero because if you consider the most general linearized solution to vacuum Einstein's equations without incoming radiation, well, and you then you try to see how this metric behaves at null infinity, you essentially get this condition. So, of course, you can relax this time dependence, but if you do so, well, you are describing a space of solution that is definitely. That is definitely much bigger, and perhaps you don't know really the physics of this solution. So, this is one motivation. The second motivation is that, and this is a very important, sorry, remark, very important remark, is that whenever you relax boundary condition, what actually you are doing, you are introducing divergences. So, you have to be sure that you are able to renormalize these divergences and to make sure that. To make sure that the asymptotic symmetry is actually, and whatever you compute, for example, the charges and the fluxes and so on, they are well defined, otherwise it's pointless. And this is something that has been done already many times in ADS CFT, for example, by adding boundary actions as a counter terms. It's also done in particular by comparing. In particular, by compare for the generalized BMS, where he had here and his collaborators added some boundary Lagrangian to renormalize the sympletic form. And in general, I mean, if you're really interested in this kind of procedure, there is a series of nice papers by Freder Geiler and Francetti two years ago that investigate this issue really systematically. So now what we want to do is that given the bonding gauge and given the boundary condition, we want to find those vector fields that preserve the bonding gauge and the boundary condition. This is how usually you compute the asymptotic symmetry group. So preserving the bonding gauge essentially gives you a very specific radial dependence. Specific radial dependence of the components of your vector field that is essentially written here. Here, the IAB is just a function of R, as you can see here. You can expand in power of one over R, for example. But what I want to stress is that the variation of the determinant of the leading Determinant of the leading metric on the two spheres changes now. And it changes, it is parametrized essentially by, of course, by the divergence of the YA, which is the firmorphism over the two spheres, and by W, which at this stage is just a function of U and XA. Preserving the boundary condition instead gives you a more precise constraint over Precise constraints over the components. In particular, it tells you that tau, which is the u component of the vector fields, is at most linear in u, where t and y are time independent, as well as the vector field over the sphere. So, in general, so what you get is a vector field that has this form. A vector field that has this form: you have supertranslations, you have while rescaling, and then you have the feomorphism over the two spheres. And I just learned from the talk of Lewandowski that we also have these generators that I think the self. I mean, I would really would like to understand now the connection between this work. The connection between this work and the Lewandowski one with non-expanding horizons. This may be for later. Okay, then you have the generators at null infinity. What we can do, we can compute the Lie commutators and we get the Bile BMS Lie algebra, which has the structure of. Algebra, which has the structure of a double semi-product given by the Feomorphism over the two spheres and by the scaling over the two spheres with direct sum with supertranslations. Just to give you like a big overview of the ViBMS and the previous extensions, well, let me tell you that the original BMS group, you know, as I told you before, is the Lawrence. I told you before, is the Lorentz group, so it's like global conformal filling vectors over the sphere. Then, with the extended DMS group, what you do, you just promote, you just use, consider local conformal killing vectors. That's why you have double copy of Virasoro algebra. And what you keep fixed is the conformal structure. So, essentially, you keep fixing the class of equivalents of QAB. QAB and in generalized BMS instead you just consider really like the arbitrary field morphism over the two spheres, two spheres, sorry, but you keep fixed the scale structure, so you keep fixed this quantity. In BioBMS, we don't have any of this kind of restriction and that's why actually we have And that's why actually we have three gauge parameters: the translation translate super translations, the diffeomorphism of the two spheres, and this bile parameter W. And it is quite easy actually to recover the previous expressions whenever you know what to keep fixed and whenever you know how to relate these parameters with. Relate these parameters with these other parameters. So, there are any questions so far about so w is constant? No, w is a is a function of the angle, of the spherical angle. It's just an arbitrary function. It's like the super translation parameter. Yeah, it just depends on xk, so t times phi. I have a general comment. I mean, I think mathematically, I completely agree that we can look at more and more general cases. I mean, I could also just say that the group of diffeomorphisms of scry is a symmetry group, period. All diffeimorphisms, because that will be even larger than your while group here. The question is always about physics, do these bounds. Physics, do these boundary conditions represent? And in terms of compact binary coalescence and various gravitational collapse, what was done originally by Bondi and Sachs and other people is sufficient. I mean, that's exactly those are the boundary conditions. Now one is saying that, well, no, I'm going to consider weaker boundary conditions. So I think the burden of proof is on people who propose the weaker boundary conditions. On people who propose the weaker boundary conditions to tell us which physical systems necessiate, force on us these weaker boundary conditions. And to me, this has not been done at all with a small exception that we can talk about later. But the things that you are proposing here, I like it very much as mathematics, but I don't understand the physical meaning at all. What Lewandowski did this morning, that the MS group was extended in a certain way. Extended in a certain way, where this w in your case was just a constant, and then the statement is that it was not done ad hoc, but that is something that we are forced upon if we look at the horizons because of the various things that he said before. So this is what always kind of puzzles me, like why this point is not emphasized. Yeah, no, no, actually, I totally agree with you. And that's, for example, one of the reasons. That's, for example, one of the reasons why I have control of this boundary condition. I don't want to have leading R divergences in GUU because I don't need to describe physics, at least so far. But let me just, I agree, I also cannot tell you what kind of all the physical solutions that are inside this kind of space of solutions, but I can tell you that since Since weakening the boundary conditions introduces divergences, what I can tell you is that I can remove these divergences using a normalization procedure. So I can give, like I can promote in some sense the space of solutions to a phase space, right? But what is the physical meaning of it is not clear, at least to me, yet. And I'm very sympathetic. No, no, I'm very sympathetic with the mathematical physics aspect of it. So, I mean, yes, I agree that it's very obscure what is the physical solutions that we can describe in this phase space. Yes, I agree. Thank you. Yeah, no, no, thank you for the remark. And okay, sorry. Sorry, we are here. So, I mean, this is like some of the kinematic part of my Part of my talk. Now, I want to tell you that there might be, actually, there is a sharp interplay among this group, the asymptotic symmetry group, and the asymptotic dynamics. So, to do so, we need some basics of covariant phase-space formalism. I mean, it's a very nice piece of work, started with the Polish school and with the Stecker school. School and with Ashteka School, Walt School as well. So there are many people involved in this, and I'm really sorry for the basics, but it's just for people that can follow. So we can, you're aware of the fact that we have a Cartan calculus on a given manifold. So we have a space-time differential, times contraction, and the derivative. And you can And you can build something similar on the space of the field space. You can have like variations and field contractions and so on. So imagine that you have a Lagrangian, L, for example, the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian. You take an arbitrary variation of your Lagrangian, and what you get, you get the equation of motion and the differential of a The differential of a tree form that is called the sympletic potential. Then, if you take the field construction with your equation of motion, what you get is the divergence of a three-form. Just to be sure, to give like examples, in Einstein, in In Einstein, in Einstein gravity, here the equation of motion looks like this construction. So g v nu is the Einstein tensor and this epsilon is the volume form here. Okay, I cannot, yeah. Then this C psi is the contraction of the vector field psi with the Einstein tensor and the codimension one form defined here. Defined here. And then theta L, for example, you can write it as an anti-symmetric expression containing the variation of the Levi-Civita symbols. And Q is the nether charge. Here is like actually the commerce, netter charge, commerce charge. And what you know is that you can. And what you know is that you can define a nether current that is closed, was external differential is closed on shell. So having all these quantities that actually comes from the Lagrangian, you can compute the symplectic to form, you can compute the nether charge and the flux. And they obey a very nice, interesting relation because when you take this. Because when you take these simpletic two forms, which is a two form in the field space, and you take a field contraption of it, on shell you have a total variation of the nether charge and a flux in case the system is radiating. And you can make a second contract, and what you get is a very interesting relation that has some. That has some property, interesting properties. First of all, it is invariant under the change of a boundary Lagrangian. And this also implies that it is insensitive to phase space renormalization. So you might basically have divergences in Q and F, and this divergence really like cancels out. We did this exercise explicitly at null infinity, actually. Infinity actually, and we found that all the divergences cancel out. By the way, the second expression here in the box is part of the Einstein's equations. But what really this exercise here suggests is that one can define a charge bracket for the nether charges. In this way. So, this is exactly the left-hand side or the right-hand side of this equation, plus this additional piece that generalized the previous Bernich-Trusser charge bracket. I also want to mention that there are some little work on this topic by Wolfgang Wieland last year. And I mean, the main And I mean, the main key message here is the following, that we have two vector fields, xi and chi. They can be actually, they are field dependent. And one can define a modified Lie bracket. This modification is due to the fact that the vector fields are field dependent. And then one define also a commutator of this symmetry transformation. These symmetry transformations. And one then can prove: this is a quite long technical result, but just this is the result, is that the charge bracket on shell gives a representation of the vector field algebra. This is like one of the main results. The main one of the main results that we discovered. And this equation here in the box, again, it is invariant under change of a boundary Lagrangian. The equation that I highlight actually is the so-called flux balance relation, and it is really equivalent to the asymptotic Einstein's equations. And indeed, let me Indeed, let me show you something more explicit. So, this is the charge bracket on shell. You can expand it a little bit. And what you find is a very interesting interplay among the symmetry generators, so psi and chi, phase-space quantities like the netter charge and the fluxes, and your theory that you. And your theory that you are using. And this is basically a different way to write Einstein's equations at null infinity. Indeed, what we did, so how to read this table? So you just have to consider a pair of vector field, psi and chi. And for example, here you can consider psi to be partial u and psi to be the And psi to be the super translation generators. Then, what you get here is essentially this equation tells you how the netter charge associated to some vector field change in the direction of the other vector fields. And the change is due to the fact that you have some group rotation, plus the fact that the system is emitting some radiation, some waves. And what you are able to probe. What you are able to probe using these equations are some components of the Einstein tensor. So essentially this equation here, whenever you do all the computation and so on, can you hear me? Yes. No, because yeah, because my coordination is unstable for some reason, I don't know. So it's such that you are able to probe some of the Einstein's equation. Of the Einstein's equation, namely the one with GRμ and GU. Here, I want to say also one thing that is also important. I mean, if you consider the original BMS group, the only equation that you can really recover using this result is just the flux balance equation for the energy. Equation for the energy, I mean the bonding mass formula. And you can do so technically because this equation here in the end of the computation is an integral of the symmetry generators times it. I think it cut out completely.   I think it was in a hotel because we had an exam this morning, an interview. Lost a lot and also fall. Okay, um, perhaps we can wait a couple of minutes more. Maybe somebody someone can send him an email. I just wrote it. I wrote him. Okay. Thank you. I got this cut. Let's see. While we are waiting, can I ask a question, please? Sorry, I can't hear you. Is that a yes? Yes, please. Go ahead. Okay. Abbe, in your question, you pointed out there's a small caveat to what you were saying about when BM. We're saying about when BMS is valid. What is that caveat? Okay, so the right Roberto is not here, so I might as well ask you a question. Okay, so yeah, so the caveat is the following. Yeah, I mean, the point is that if you consider, I'm not sure about this, but it's likely that if I consider That if I consider some situation in which there is a total scattering, right, when the things actually come in from minus infinity and go to plus infinity, I mean, it's some kind of a total scattering up there. Then it is possible that we need weaker boundary conditions than what DMS has given us. Okay, the real statement is the following. I okay. The real statement is the following. In that case, it is quite likely that feeling does not hold. Okay. That doesn't necessarily mean that. So that means that the standard statement is that it is very likely that feeling does not hold. Yeah, okay. So yeah, you're saying it's possible that the smoothness structure at null infinity is not as strong as we think it is. Right, exactly. So it's not exactly the same as BMS. So if you feel like the BMS is. Same as BMS, so if you feel like the BMS is, I mean, they are not so. I mean, Newman Penrod, sorry, Newman himself actually just never did conformal completion, was always looking at physical space-time. And the physical space-time, they were still obtaining feeling by integrating equations using the body type of expansion. Yes, so therefore, something in the body type of expansion would not be true. It will be good to answer. It will be good to answer. So, that was really the statement up here. But that was only caveat. I mean, I don't see any other system for which one has to go beyond what Bondi et al. did. I mean, in fact, in this direction of compact binary colonists, there's a very nice review article by Luc Blanchet in which he explains that in the early days, people were concerned about logarithmic divergent terms at scribe. Divergent terms at scry. But then he points out that that was really because they were using some certain coordinates which are not so good there. And if you instead one use radiative coordinates a la bondi, then in fact everything is perfectly smooth and that framework is completely compatible with the post-Newtonian expansions and so on. So I think for compact binary coalescences, I really don't see any reason to go beyond the standard body thing. For the scratching problems, there may be something has to be slightly weaker. Something has to be slightly weaker, but nothing to this extent just slightly weaker. Oh, and just sort of a follow-up in case Roberto isn't here yet. If he is, just please stop me. There's a claim by Christian Dulu-Kleinerman that their space-times don't satisfy Kaling, and there's a big, I think, debate about it, whether they proved non-satisfying. Proved non-satisfaction of peeling, or whether peeling, or they just couldn't prove peeling, if you know what I mean. And you know, if that has been settled, or do we know anything about that? I had a very, very long conversation. That's the largest class of space-times we know, right? So, that's not a very long conversation. No, but that's that's not okay. So, there is a work by Christian. By Christel and the name will come back to me in a second. Delane. Christel and Delaney. So there is a in which they can give initial data for which there is in fact there is in fact a perfect C infinity, not C infinity, C K structure for K arbitrarily large. But that's on hyperboloidal initial data, correct? No, no, no, no, on a space-level caution. So, so, so, so, the statement is there are these initial data sets, and then the question again is really, physically, do we think that, I mean, of course, the initial conditions that they use, Crush and Delais, are slightly stronger, of course, than the crystal phenomenon. And the question is: well, are we forced? And the question is: well, are we forced to consider Krishna Panaman? And I mean, as far as I can tell, the only argument, plausible argument, is really including the scattering problems. And the question is really, if you include scattering problem, then the statement is that what Newman Penrose calls psi one, which is angular momentum information, which normally keeps like one upon r to the fourth, will go like there is. There's a lock up there, but that's the funny thing is that that lock is a very strange thing. Okay, maybe I shouldn't go into too many details. Yeah, so there is a there is a there is a weak weakening required there. And the question is whether this is forced upon us for skapping problems or they suffer slightly. Maybe I can chime in here. So thank you. I love the idea. Thank you. I'll give you idea. Okay, I'll give you the idea. Because I didn't know that it. So I had this long conversation with Lydia just this week. So maybe you can tell much more. Right. So hi. Yeah. I mean, I had, as Abe said, a very nice and long conversation about exactly these problems. And so let me maybe just summarize our point of view. So in the finer one, first of all, you have some, you have a math term which is constant in the metrics in one plus two and over r. Metrics in one plus two L over R delta Ij plus lower order terms in the initial data. And so, I mean, what Kupidulu did in the Marcel-Brothers paper in 2000, so he looked at, well, if we take stronger decay of the data, then we get the R to the minus 4 people in for the next component, right? Like in the Newman Penrose. And he showed that, well, if you add a little bit more decay, then you pick up some lock terms. Then you pick up some log term at null infinity. And well, there's an argument to show that you also pick up a log term in the initial data. So, like Abbé said, you would have something like r to the minus 4 log r instead of r to the minus 4. But then there's another argument if you look at, so here we come into scattering, if you like, if you look into, let's say, black holes coming in and try to understand, let's say, some situations at minus null infinity for certain data. For certain data. So he shows that if you have non-incoming radiation conditions set at minus null infinity, that this log term in the initial data disappears. But you still pick up, let's say, the log term in the evolution when you go towards future null infinity. So there is some physical argument there for certain type of systems that you say, well, it's not that you cannot prove it if you just plug in large, strong or decay. In large stronger decay, then you don't necessarily get stronger peeling. And there's something else I've done recently where I got rid of this constant mass term, but I have some isotropic mass, which I also talked with Abe. And there's also certain things to say that you don't get the full peeling result, even if you're putting more data, more disdicated on the data. But of course, you can construct space-times which obey the full. Space-times which obey the full peeling, but then the question is: what are the physical systems that obey one picture or the other? And I think there's more to say about that. So is it known if you say that peeling is satisfied at past null infinity? Let's just assume that on the initial data. Is it known whether peeling will be satisfied at future null infinity? Probably not. That sounds like a hard problem. No, I think this is open. No, I think this is open. Yeah. This is open. This is open. That would be kind of exactly the question one would like to have, right? I mean, if it's true, then that would be great. And we can just assume peeling and, you know, go on a holiday or something. No, no, no, no, but yeah, I think it's very likely that you don't have really this symmetry between scribe plus and scribe minus respect to peeling in general. Peeling in general. I mean, so there is not really a theorem saying that, but then you can do some. So, using Helmut-Friedlich formalism, you can do sets and expansions, and then you can see that there is actually an asymmetry between Scry plus and Scry minus in general. So having something that is smooth in Scry minus doesn't imply that it will be smooth or you have peeling, say, on ScryPlus. So in fact, I also looked at this quite a long time ago. A long time ago, so yeah, yeah. On the other hand, for the binary black hole coalescences, first of all, I mean, I think what Lydia was just stepped back, I mean, what Lydia explained to me just last week or 10 days ago was that this work of Christie Dulu in the Mars and Grossman proceedings, which is after the Christo Lu clan. Which is after the crystal of clanamadma. That, if you assume certain that there's no incoming radiation of scry and so on, then on scry plus, what they get is the psi one, there is a psi one does fall like one upon r to the four, but the log term is now in u, not in r. Log of u. So it's a strange thing in which the psi one seems to be blowing up at infinity, at future infinity. Now, Now, so I plus, I mean, as you go to I plus, on scribe is perfectly fine, but as you approach I plus, it is blowing up there. Now, the key question for me, the physical question for me, is whether the angular momentum is nonetheless well defined. Because the news is that there's no problem about it. So the angular momentum will just be given by the limit will be just given by psi one. Now, it could be that psi one blows up as a whole, but the first three ylm components of psi. CYLM components of ψ1 are perfectly fine. And if that is the case, then angular momentum would be perfectly fine. And then I would just say that, yeah, I mean, that's what happens in this scattering problems, et cetera. There is no absolute feeling, but there is no problem with physical physics in the sense that energy is finite, angular momentum is finite, and these are systems that are perfectly allowed. That's what I would like to say. So this is the So, this is, I think, what both in terms of older work of Constadulu and also the newer work that Lydia has done, which has beautiful results, which generalize quite a lot the older work. So, in that work, to me, the key question is really, even though Psi 1 as a whole may not be well-behaved, is it true that the angular momentum is still well-behaved? And if that is the case, then I would just say yes, there are physical systems for which peeling doesn't hold, but on the other hand, But on the other hand, you know, the physical quantities are well defined. If, on the other hand, angular momentum, cyber blows up, so that is first three YLMs also blow up, then the angular momentum blows up, then I would take a stronger point of view, which would offend several people, which is to say that really Minkowski space then is not stable under those perturbations. The reason is because Minkowski space should have zero energy physically, but not an angular physically, it should have zero energy momentum, should have zero angular momentum. Energy momentum should have zero angular momentum. And here, one is saying that in the asymptotic future, angular momentum actually blows up. Not only is it not zero, but actually blows up. That to me is not good at all. So to me, it better be the case that somehow the angular momentum limit to I plus is actually going to be zero. And then I would say, yes, then physically it is perfectly stable. And this was a lot of clarification in this long, I don't know how many hours we spent. I don't know how many hours we spent last week on this discussion. So, to me, I got a much, much cleaner picture about the whole thing. I'm writing notes, I'll send you, Lydia. I'll say a few things to David, but I didn't send you enough. Right. I also have a few more add-ons. I think Roberto is is is back. Yes, I'm back. I'm really so sorry. Uh, for some reason Zoom got frozen and I Got frozen and I had no access to the meeting anymore. Never happened. Really sorry for this. You were on this slide with the Einstein equation. Yes, yes. I'm going to share it again. Yeah. Okay. So we were here, right? Yeah. Okay. So you hear me up to the moment where I was saying that with the original BMS using this formula. Using this formula, you can really just get only the boundary mass loss formula. You cannot get, for example, the mass formula for, sorry, the loss formula for angular momentum for the very simple reason, because you will have like yA contracted with the equation for NA, the angular momentum aspect. And you cannot really say that the integrand is equal to zero because integrant is equal to zero because yA is just a global conforma killing vector is not the most general vector field over the sphere. So that's why in some sense you need the generalized BMS group in order to get the equation of motion for the angular momentum aspects. And on the same logic you can also you also need this additional Need these additional bile generators because they give you also the other, some of the other Einstein's equations. We don't recover all the Einstein's equations. For example, as you can see from the table, we cannot probe the GAB, so the angular part of the Einstein tensor, just because the group structure is such that we cannot really reach that tensor, that the The components of the Einstein tensor. So, this suggests definitely that this violent BMS group is not the largest group that definitely accounts fully for the gravitational dynamics at null infinity. This is just to come back to the original questions in the first slide.
