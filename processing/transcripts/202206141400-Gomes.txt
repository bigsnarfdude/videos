Okay, hello everyone. It's very exciting to be here. Thank you, the organizers, for inviting me, especially in this case. So, I'm this, I deliberately gave to this talk the title of a paper that I first released as a preprint over two years ago in April 2020. And it generated a lot of sort of very intense reactions from the scientific community and from the public. Community and from the public at large. So it's been a very lonely two years for me trying to take this work to completion and to publication. It just got published this year. And I'm really, really happy to be here, to be able to discuss it in person. I think I'm going to sleep better tonight than I slept in any night over the last two years. Okay, so let's start. So I've, for the last 10 years, I've for the last 10 years, I've been trying to understand why the infectious disease models, at least models that we developed in my group, but I think not only in my group, they tend to generate more infections than we see in the data for the parameters that we think we ought to have. And I've been trying to understand that. So I started realizing this 20 years ago when I started working on infectious diseases. Started working on infectious diseases. And I think I spent the last 10 years just almost exclusively trying to understand that. And I think it's due to the lack of certain forms of heterogeneity in the models. And the kinds of heterogeneity that are very difficult to measure, sometimes may not be possible to measure directly. And I've been trying to think of And I've been trying to think of possible study designs and ways of analyzing data so we can infer those kinds of heterogeneity that matter for the purposes that I'm interested in. So, and I've been reading and learning and attending meetings actually in other population disciplines and I just became fascinated with this concept of frailty variation. Of frailty variation in demography. So it's just developed in population, so in mathematical demography in the late 70s, that's when I saw it. I'll give you some references. So what does it do? What is relative variation and how does it respond to selection? So suppose that you have a cohort of individuals that are going to follow for some time, and some individuals are And some individuals are more frail than others. So, some individuals live longer and others live shorter for many, many reasons, which, you know, of course, we don't try to model mechanistically all these reasons. We just try to infer what is the variation of longevity in this cohort. So, suppose you measure, suppose you could tell what was the mortality rate at some. Mortality rate at some point in time, beginning of your following the cohort, and you get a certain mortality rate. If you measure the mortality rate sometime later, it will be lower. If nothing else changes to the individuals, it will be lower because the individuals who are shorter-lived are no longer there. Some of the shorter-lived individuals are no longer there, so they no longer contribute to the average of the mortality. Average of the mortality rate. So, and according to these alone, with this process alone, you get a declining mortality rate over time when nothing is changing at the individuals, at the individual level. It's just a population phenomenon. So, this has many names, and I think it's been discovered many times. One of the names is survivorship bias. Of the names is survivorship bias. I will refer to it as selection bias. I hope not to generate confusion with other uses of selection bias. So I'm just stating it here. When I mean selection bias, I mean this kind of process, not necessarily about mortality, but about other processes. Here is just some of the some figures that I got from publications in demography. It could be animals, so ecology. be animals so ecology as well so so so you get uh you you get that at the beginning of the of the age of the at the early ages you tend to get a decline in in mortality rate and then and then an increase due to senescence and then uh saturation so the the what happens at the ends of this uh of this curve could be partly due to the to the the To the process I just described in the previous slide. So, there are says here are some references, some only references for these. So, Nathan Kiffitz and Lippmann have a paper in 1979 describing these, and Jean Vappel also in 1979 also has a paper describing this. And that was Jean Vaupel who coined this by S. This by frailty variation. So, what does this have to do with our infectious disease models? So, in infectious diseases, I'll be interested not so much not in variation of time to death, but rather time to infection. And this is a measure of how different in susceptibility individuals may be. So, if an individual is highly susceptible, So, if an individual is highly susceptible, they'll tend to be infected earlier than an individual who is not as susceptible. So, let's consider the simplest infectious disease model. We could do the SI model. And for example, think about HIV. It's an SI disease. You can build a homogeneous model for that, a model where you have heterogeneous susceptibility. Susceptibility in the middle panel, and then you can also add a little layer to the model to make it as a heterogeneous connectivity model. So if heterogeneity is in connectivity, the individual who is more likely to acquire infection is also more likely to pass it on to others. So you get a kind of squares of the effect. And you can write these models very simply, like this. Like this. And so they become infinite differential equation models rather than a two-dimensional system, so ordinary differential equations. And you can calculate R0 for these systems using, for example, the next generation approach. And you can calculate R0 for heterogeneous susceptibility is the same as the. same as as the as the as for the heterogene as for the homogeneous model uh if the if the the the risk distribution which here i'm assuming a continuous risk distribution or susceptibility distribution has a mean one so um and for the heterogeneous connectivity model you have a slightly different formula for r naught you have the second moment of R0, you have the second moment of the distribution appearing in the formula for R0. So this is how the models are written. And here I consider risk. When I say risk, I mean susceptibility times connectivity. So let's just generate some outputs from these models. So on the left, you have the distribution. You have the distributions at the beginning of the simulation when you have a susceptible population that is evaded by a pathogen. And so you have the original distributions all with the same mean, mean one. And then you see how the prevalence of infection grows in the population. And I just calculate. I just calculated what R0 would have to be in order for this prevalence of infection to reach a steady state of 20%. It's totally arbitrary, but I just estimated what R0 had to be for each one of these models to reach a 20% infection prevalence. So for the homogeneous model, this required R0 equals 1.2. For heterogeneous susceptibility, R06.8. not 6.8 and for heterogeneous connectivity are not equal to 15 so a huge difference between the how much r naught you'd need in order to reach that infection prevalence so why does this happen there is a selection happening here so if you consider for consider for example heterogeneous susceptibility model the mean of this susceptibility distribution is one like that of the homogeneous model That of the homogeneous model, but some individuals are really highly susceptible. I assumed here variance 10 coefficient of variation 2. So these individuals that are highly susceptible, they are infected first. So as the individuals who are highly susceptible, Who are highly susceptible are infected and removed from the susceptibility pool, the mean of susceptibility decreases. So over time, the mean susceptibility decreases and this slows down the growth. So this decelerates the epidemic growth. And actually, if you had simulated the heterogeneous susceptibility model with the same R0 as the homogeneous model, you'd just have that. Model, you just have that thin blue line at the bottom of the graph. So it wouldn't grow anywhere close to 1.2. In order to get that, you need to boost R0 in order for you have to compensate with that deceleration of the epidemic growth with an increase in R0 in order to reach the same endemic level. The same explanation works for heterogeneous connectivity, except that this effect is exacerbated. So, by the time you reach the endemic level, the mean susceptibility in susceptible pool for heterogeneous models is about 0.2. So, it's much lower, while those individuals who got infected have much higher susceptibility. Okay, so that's just to explain why. That's just to explain why selection acts on variation in susceptibility and exposure, and why these characteristics are so interesting from this perspective. So, now if you have these models all at the 20% equilibrium and you apply an intervention in this case, it's In this case, it's called the 1990-19 treatment test prevention target, which was an important intervention for HIV control, which means that you aim to detect 90% of all infected cases and have 90% of those under treatment and 90% of those with viral suppression. So, if you apply this intervention to all these models, You apply this intervention to all these models, this intervention is going to have more impact under homogeneity. So you see the decline from the 20% steady state is more pronounced in the black line, less pronounced in the blue, and even less pronounced in the green. So that's the phenomenon described in the simplest possible way for infectious diseases. And this was actually realized in the 80s in the uh in the 80s in the in the that's the in the early days of the 80s um epidemic and groups in in in the uk and los alamos maybe others as well have recognized the issue and how important it was to consider heterogeneity in trying to understand the growth curve for hiv so epidemics so now we we get to something close to covid 19 so now COVID-19. So now we let's do a model for an epidemic, an SIR model. I'm not including birth and death, natural birth and death here, just for a simple SIR model. We do the same thing. We write down the homogeneous model here allowing for reinfection with a reinfection factor of sigma. And we have Sigma and we have the R nodes for that. So for the heterogeneous susceptibility, we include again the heterogeneity susceptibility in the force of infection. Yeah, in the force of infection. Yeah, I think I hope it's clear here the way the susceptibility appears. So the susceptibility factor x appears, of course, multiplying the susceptible group that has that index x. That index X sigma the first the sigma the the R sigma R comes out of the bottom equation it's it's the infection of the recovereds the third equation the the the the the R's are removed from the third equation and moved From the third equation and move to the second. Yeah? Is that the R is reinforced? Is it? Did I make a mistake? Yeah. Is there anything missing? There's a bit. Yeah. Okay. Yes, yes. Sorry. Yeah. Okay, yes, yes, sorry, yeah, yeah, you're right, yeah, yeah, there is a bit missing there, okay, yeah, thank you, okay, and uh, so that's how systems are written, and you can do the same for heterogeneous connectivity. So, what does this do? Um, so the the so you run this model with heterogeneous susceptibility and you generate this blue curve, I'm assuming here, R0 equals three. assuming here r naught equal three for all all the scenarios and i'm assuming um a variance 2.5 so coefficient of variation 1 point something and and so so you get you you you get that blue curve it's heterogeneous susceptibility you have the green it's the heterogeneous connectivity is a bit smaller because of the the effect is selection is Because of the effect, the selection is exacerbated, assuming the same are not and the same variance. If you run the homogeneous model with all parameters the same, you disable the selection process that decelerates epidemic growth. And of course, you have a bigger epidemic. And that's what you see here. And again, the risk distributions you begin with. You begin with respond to selection, and you end up with lower mean susceptibility and lower mean connectivity for the heterogeneous models. Of course, first the homogeneous remains at one because there's nothing else it can do. And another interesting observation here, if you look now at reinfection, so re-infection are the thin lines on the main panel. Main panel, but they are shown what the bottom panel shows is the ratio of risk of reinfection divided by the risk of first infection for each individual. And you see, sorry, the risk of reinfection divided by Of reinfection divided by the risk of first infection for each individual is the same, is the same for all models. It's marked by the black line. But when you calculate the rate of reinfection divided by the rate of first infection as time goes on, it artificially increases with the heterogeneous models because of selection. Because of selection, again, because the individuals who are at risk of infection are not average individuals, they are individuals that have higher risk to begin with. So it looks like if you just do a study and follow individuals who have been infected before and individuals who have never been infected, and follow them and count infections in one group and the other, and then just calculate the ratio that is biased. That is biased, so that's not the true relative risk if there is heterogeneity. So that's just an observation. So what we actually did for COVID was to include also an exposed compartment, like many, many other people did. So these are just the same models with a recovered compartment and with a mortality rate. So the individual. Mortality rate. So, the individuals, not all individuals who leave the I compartment arrive in the R compartment, a fraction of those phi, the infection fatality ratio, die due to the infection. And so this is how the systems are written. And the are not is actually rewritten, but this is the same, say the same, the same. Say the same, basically, the same R nodes as before, just a slight alteration because we assume that exposed individuals can also transmit, but by a smaller amount than the individuals who are in the eye compartment. And now I denote new the coefficient of variation of the distribution of susceptibility or connectivity. If we assume that the distribution is a gamma distribution, we can derive these simplified systems, which was very convenient to fit the models to data, because here, of course, we want the smallest dimension possible to do efficient parameter estimation. Susceptibility, this model reduction is exact in the case of. Is exact. In the case of heterogeneous connectivity, it's an approximation, but we tested this, working with this approximation or with the full explicit distribution system, and we got pretty much the same results. So now the variables SEIR are the sum of all the S's overall susceptibility groups, and the same for EIR. Before we Before we can fit the models, because we had all these interventions to reduce contacts, the non-pharmaceutical interventions, and also people changing behavior and having less contacts, we had to introduce a sort of sterilized profile for how contacts have changed over time. We try to be as simple as possible. We try to be as simple as possible in these, but being careful not to constrain the results in bad ways. So, we actually spend a lot of time trying to develop these profiles. So, we took into account when the first lockdown occurred. So, we fitted the model to England and Scotland. The first lockdown occurred here schematically in this period labeled L1. Labeled L1. And then we had a and then we assumed that we estimated how many days prior to the first lockdown there was already behavioral change and people already reducing contacts. We try to infer that by fitting model outputs to the epidemic wave. And then we allow for contacts to reactivate. To reactivate after the first lockdown, we assume that they just increase linearly after the first lockdown. We estimate the slope of that increase in contacts, and then we impose the second and third lockdowns, which were implemented in the UK. And that's how we use this profile. So we fitted this model with this profile to data. Profile to data, and these are the results for a heterogeneous model. So, heterogeneous susceptibility and heterogeneous connectivity actually give very similar fits with heterogeneous connectivity. We estimate a slightly higher coefficient of variation. No, the other way around, sorry, heterogeneous connectivity, we estimate a slightly lower coefficient of variation because. Coefficient of variation because the effect is amplified when heterogeneity is in contact. But in the end, we ended up with similar herd immunity thresholds, whether we use one model for heterogeneity or the other. And so, according to this, we estimated a herd immunity threshold by 50. A herd immunity threshold by fitting the model to these two waves of infraction, herd immunity threshold around 25 to 28 percent. We fitted homogeneous models as well, and so they also fit the data, of course, but with different with different parameters. So here, of course, there's no variation. So the So, the herd immunity thresholds. Before I describe the herd immunity threshold, I wanted to call your attention to the fact that the so I fitted the models to the green data points. The red data points were not used for fitting. And I used that particular, or we used that particular time period. So, vaccination, so we didn't have to include vaccination in the model, we just wanted to be the Vaccination in the model. We just wanted to be the model as basic as possible. So during the red data points were not fitted. So what this suggests is that the difference between the dash black line and the red is the vaccine, is the effect of the vaccination. And then we projected how much more. We projected how much more epidemic there was to be had given the parameters of the model. And that's the smaller panels on the right. And we see the scale is very different. So while with heterogeneity, we expect those moderate size exit waves. If we didn't have more variants coming, we would expect those moderate size. Moderate size exit waves, which should be comparable in size to the waves that had already occurred. In the homogeneous models, you expect 10 times higher waves. So it's a very large difference. So you expect a lot more infection and homogeneity. And the herd immunity threshold from the parameters we estimated would be between Parameters we estimated would be between 63 to 66 percent according to the homogeneous model. We did model selection, and scores were much more in favor to the heterogeneous models. I'm not showing that here, but it's in the paper. Trying to dissect the dynamics a bit more. So here I'm superimposed. The homogeneous model, so the results obtained with the homogeneous model in black, the heterogeneous model in red, and the green is the data. And I'm turning off the interventions, turning off the non-pharmaceutical interventions or behavioral change, just to see what the epidemic, what the unmitigated epidemic could be like. And you'd expect an unmitigated epidemic about twice. Twice the size under the homogeneous model. Now we turn on the first, we include the first lockdown, and of course both models fit almost indistinguishably well the first wave. But then we see that we still have a much larger wave under homogeneity than with the heterogeneous. Than with the heterogeneous model. And actually, with the heterogeneous model, we are actually getting close to the data. So now we include second and third lockdown, so both fit reasonably well to the data, but you still have a lot more infection ahead under homogeneity, but not under heterogeneity. So under heterogeneity, So, under heterogeneity and without variants, I think the pandemic would have been, the herd immunity thresholds would have been reached around during the first semester of last year. And I think what we had since then has been the effect of the variants and maybe some weighing immunity as well. And here, introducing vaccination again. Introducing vaccination again, vaccination would have some effect on the homogeneous model than according to heterogeneous, because heterogeneous was already at very low, the expectations was already very low levels of infection. Okay, and then that's when I saw sort of myself in a sea of unhumanized faces. I think there are lots of Faces. I think there are a lot of resistance to this work, a lot of very intense reactions, and so on. And then, of course, lots of criticism. So one typical criticism was gamma, but what a bad choice for a distribution. Okay, and this was all very public. So we went to look at data from the polymod study, and we fitted gamma distributions to contact data. Data to contact data from different countries and then in various at various times, but most of these typically from the 2008 here, it's just over 10 years ago, and some more recent studies as well. So the gamma distributions, I mean, some fit better than others, some of these data sets are better fit than others, but it's not really, it doesn't seem shocking to me. It doesn't seem shocking to me to use a gamma distribution to do this. So that's, and these gamma distributions that we fitted here, we estimated coefficients of variation very similar to the ones we had inferred in our paper. And here is comparing all these things. So the orange band is the coefficients of variation for those distributions obtained. Distributions obtained by contact surveys like the polymod study. And then our estimates for heterogeneous connectivity are the gray narrower band that is just glued to the orange band. So it seems quite agreeable to me. And the gray curve is the herd immunity threshold curve. herd immunity threshold curve according to the formula that I gave in an earlier slide. So where the gray line, the gray vertical line intersects the gray curve is where is the herd immunity threshold that we have estimated around 20 something percent. We can do the same for heterogeneous susceptibility, you have the darker tones, so you have the bar the black line and then the darker The darker sort of vertical line as well in black, and in blue are the epidemic final sizes. So, the lighter blue is for heterogeneous connectivity, and the darker blue is for heterogeneous susceptibility. Let's just show here to summarize the results. The dashed vertical lines are coefficients of variation estimates. Variation estimated from super spreader studies. So it's a different type of study. And the values are larger, perhaps as expected, because it also captures heterogeneity in infectiousness, and it also captures transient heterogeneity that may not be as permanent as the one we are estimating here. So, second criticism. So, second criticism in MPIs: effect sizes are unrealistic. And let's see if effect sizes are unrealistic. So, there was another study along the lines of the polymod study, but it was conducted during the pandemic when interventions were in place. So, this COMICS study found 74%. Found a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant. We estimated values in a range between 70 and 77 percent. It seems to be more or less aligned with the measurements. Next criticism: networks may rewire and cancel selection. So, what this means is that we are This means is that we are inferring this variation through the effect that selection has on it in the reducing size or affecting size of the epidemic curve. So if networks rewire, the argument is if networks rewire, you can have an epidemic wave that just ended due to Ended due to this selection. But then, if the individuals who were high contact during this process are not the same ones that are high contact in the future, you could have another large wave and you could have effectively what you'd see would be if effectively the herd immunity threshold estimated later in time would be larger than you had estimated. Larger than you had estimated based on a shorter data series. So we then fitted these models to shorter time periods, just based on two-wave feeds. And now there is a little difficulty for the model to infer the slope of contact reactivation. Reactivation after the first lockdown. So we considered two scenarios. So we considered that for the time of the time represented by our series, which was until the end of June 2020. During that time, the lockdown had finished not so long ago, so and people were still cautious. And people were still cautious, so contacts did not really reactivate significantly for the time period represented here. Or we assumed something that we did in an early preprint, in our second preprint, that the contacts had resumed with a particular slope, which was an assumption. So let's look at these two scenarios. So in the first So, in the first one, where contacts do not reactivate substantially between the first lockdown and the end of June, we estimate the herd immunity around 25 to 56 percent. So it's a very large range, but it captures the it includes the range that we estimated. Range that we estimated based on the longer fits. Now, if we consider the other scenario where contacts had reactivated in a more significant way, well, if the contacts had reactivated to some extent since the end of the first lockdown, we estimate lower values for the herd immunity threshold. And this is what we had assumed in some early versions. We had assumed in some early work, some early exploratory work we released in July 2020 that generated a lot of discussion. And we now think the results are closer to the left than to the right, but they will be somewhere in between. So here there could be some difficulties trying to identify some parameters. Identify some parameters. But it's reassuring to see the consistency between one wave and two wave fits. So, but about the rewiring thing, if rewiring cancels selection, then why do we get the same low heat estimates whether we fit to one wave or two waves? So, I think the heterogeneity we are capturing is really. Heterogeneity we are capturing is really permanent or is really long-term heterogeneity because otherwise we would see lower estimates for heat based on short time series. And as we increase the time for the feed, we would see the heat estimates getting larger and larger. And we don't see that at all. So I think we are. So, I think what we are capturing here is just permanent characteristics of individuals. Some individuals are more connected than others, and it's not short-term rewiring that is driving our results. But anyway, by then, I just had completely lost the hand on what was going on. Everybody were talking, oh, Gamma, what about? You're talking, oh, Gamma, what a bad choice. NPIs, effect sizes are unreliable, networks may rewire and cancel selection, low heat theory is false. So I just decided, well, I'm just going to go quiet. I'm just going to continue doing my work. And yeah, what can I do? You know, I just completely lost control of what was going on. And I, yeah, but the thing is that none of these claims has been proven. And it was just incredibly frustrating. And I just didn't. Frustrating, and I just didn't know what to do. You know, people were not reading my work anymore. They just, everybody concluded it was all wrong. There's nothing about this. And I think it's a shame because it could have really brought a different way of thinking about the pandemic. We may have been able to consider sort of less disruptive strategies, at least. Strategies, at least we could have considered them seriously with a solid mathematical basis, I think. But we didn't, it didn't get done. So I think I wanted to say some more things about vaccination. These ideas of variation and selection also affect the interpretation of vaccine trials in multiple. Trials in multiple ways. We spent a lot of time doing that. I'm just going to go. Sorry, I have to go to the end. I don't have, yeah, I always underestimate how long we're talking. And this is also about vaccine studies. I'm now part of a big consortium to try to measure, well, to estimate vaccine efficacy. Estimate vaccine efficacy and do many other things. I just do a small part here, and I will use there will be very valuable data that will be generated here to try to estimate heterogeneities of susceptibility for multiple infectious diseases. And I'm copying Odo Dickman here and make my own appeal. So, you know, my is just remove, please remove, let's remove selection bias from predictive models. From predictive models, I think maybe very well be the key piece, a key part that is really missing for making models predictive. We cannot make models predictive without fixing this. And let's be professional in the way we criticize each other's work and myself as well. Maybe I didn't present my work enough, maybe I emphasize. My work enough. Maybe I emphasized the results too much and then I caused these reactions. I don't know what happened. Something major really happened in the communication, happened, went wrong in communication. And I don't know exactly what. Yeah, a part of preparing for the next pandemic. Let's do it. Let's do this better next time. Thank you.
