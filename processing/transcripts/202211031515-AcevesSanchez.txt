Microscopics limit of kinetic transport equations. And yeah, the floor is yours. Thank you. Thank you very much. So first of all, I'd like to thank the organizers for organizing this great event. So Jos Antonio, Mary, Alina, and me. And unfortunately, I'm not able to be there and to meet a lot of Be there and to meet a lot of good friends, uh, but well, probably next time. Uh, so today I'm going to talk about this, um, so microscopy limits of kinetic transport equation in a smooth domain. And so, this was mainly a project in a collaboration with Christian Schmeisser. And the things that I'm going to talk about are basically encapsulated in the following slide. Encapsulated in the following slide. So we have when we have a normal diffusion, namely we have a particle going through a random Brownian motion, we have that the path is described roughly by something like this. However, there are some phenomena in which nominal diffusion is present. And in those cases, we have a combination of some normal diffusion, which is something like this. Which is something like this: a particle going undergoing this movement, but from time to time it makes long jumps and it continues its path, continued after some other jumps and so on. So we have this two phenomena and what I want to do is to describe or to give a framework in which we can use kinetic transfer equations to describe this type of phenomena. Phenomena. So the outline of the talk is the following. So, first, I'm going to introduce a linear Boltzmann equation that I'm going to treat. So, I know that a lot of your experts on this topic, but there are some newcomers, so I like to just kind of make it self-contained. Then I'm going to talk about asymptotic limits, something that is like old or classical, I would say, and new developments. And afterwards, I'm going to talk about the fractional appliances given in a Given in a bounded domain and versus the whole domain. And finally, I'm going to obtain the macroscopic limit on a bounded domain for a kinetic transfer equation. Okay, so that's the outline. And so here you have the linear Boltman equation. And this is an equation that describes the density of particles occupying a time t, the position x in certain domain in R2, and with velocity v, and the density. With velocity v, and the density is going to be described or denoted as f. Okay, so we have that for this type of equation, we have a free transport on the left-hand side. So if the right-hand side was set to zero, then we'll have only particles moving in straight lines. On the other hand, if we add this other term here, we'll have, so this term on the right-hand side describes two. describes two two uh stochastic processes and uh this is going to uh they are going to be described as follows so um we have a Poisson process with intensity lambda of b and the lambda of b enters into this tumbling kernel and in addition to that we have a reorientation kernel which is given by this function k of v prime and um which is uh normalized to one okay so um Okay, so there are a lot of applications of this type of differential equations as we have already seen during this workshop. Here, I just mentioned a few of them just for completeness, but I like to jump straight to the linear equation that I'm going to treat. And here I'm going to focus on this very special case because I want to show you all the techniques that are the essence of the techniques that are Essence of the techniques that we use in order to tackle this problem. So, here in this case, I'm going to take lambda v equal to one. So, this describes particles that, so a particle will go into like a straight line according to certain Poisson process with intensity given by this, so by one. And once it reaches the clock, once this run stops, then it stops, it tumbles, it chooses a new velocity, and the new velocity. A new velocity, and the new velocity is going to be given or going to be picked from this reorientation kernel. So, here in this case, we have M of B, and once we have here a particle which is coming with velocity V prime, it stops, it stumbles, and it chooses a new velocity according to this distribution. And then it continues its straight movement until we reset the. So we reset the clock with again with Poisson process with intensity of the Poisson process equal to one, and we continue like that. Okay, so what we're going to do now is we're going to introduce some time and space rescaling, and we're going to introduce the parabolic, what is called the parabolic rescaling, in which we introduce t bar as epsilon squared times t and x bar as epsilon squared. And x-bar as epsilon times x. Okay, now what we have is this classical result that tells us the following. So, if we introduce this parabolic scaling, we're going to have here an epsilon squared that is going to pop out, and here we're going to have an epsilon that is going to pop out of this transport term. So, now in this case, we're going to consider that, or we're going to assume that our m of b, which is called That our m of b, which is called here the Maxwellian, is given by this exponential function. So, this is a bell-shaped function. And we're going to assume that Q is mass conservative, namely that the integral of Q with respect to the velocity, of the average with respect to velocity, is equal to zero. Then, under this assumption, we're going to get that as epsilon goes to zero, our function f of our particle distribution. Of our particle distribution f epsilon converges towards rho times m and here rho is the macroscopic density and m is the Maxwell. And in addition, we have that this rho can be described or is described as the solution of this heat equation. Okay, so this is something, a result that is quite classical. And now I'm going to show you something that is Now, I'm going to show you something that is kind of relatively new. And in this case, we're going to consider the same equation as the one that we consider above, but I'm going to choose the Maxwellian in a different way. In this case, we're going to assume that the Maxwellian has an algebraic k of this form when v goes to infinity. And we're going to assume that our alpha is a real number between zero and two. Between zero and two. In addition, we're going to assume also that this M alpha is bounded and it has a finite mass. And we are also assuming that it's symmetric. So for instance, a concrete example of this is this function over here. Okay, so this, when v goes to infinity, this behaves like one over v to the two plus alpha. Okay? So we can. Alpha. Okay, so we can have this concrete example in mind. And now, what we're interested in is what happens when epsilon goes to zero and in this setting. So what happens is that, and this was proved like roughly 10 years ago, that if we have a solution of our kinetic transport equation with sort of initial conditions, then we have that the particle distribution also decouples into the macroscopic density. couples into the macroscopic density times the collivion distribution m as epsilon goes to zero where rho is a solution in the sense of distribution of this fractional heat equation okay so here we have uh the this is going to be a constant that is going to depend on the on only on the dimension of the space in which we're working so here everything is uh given in r2 however this result can be extended to This result can be extended to arbitrary dimensions. And here, this alpha is a number between zero and two. Now, the definition of this operator is going to be given here. So, here I actually have written down two equivalent definitions. So, the first one is given through the theoretical solo differential operators. So, what we do is we get if we So, what we do is we get if we want to apply this operator to a function phi, let's say a function in a short space with very strong decay when x goes to infinity, what we get is that if we want to apply this operator to that function, we have to take the Fourier transform, then multiply it by this symbol, which is just psi to the absolute value of psi to the power alpha, and then we have to take the inverse Fourier transform. Inverse Fourier transform. Okay, so this is one definition, and the other definition is through the theory of hypersingular integrals. And in this case, we have that we have to take the principal value and we have the difference between u at x and u at y. And here we have that, of course, there is a strong singularity when x is equal to y. Okay, so these two definitions are equivalent and. And this, in addition, this operator over here is the infinitesimal generator of alpha-stable Levy process. Okay, so as I said, as I mentioned at the beginning, if we have a Brownian motion, then if we have a lot of particles going through random Brownian motion, the macroscopic density is going to be described by the heat equation. If we have a lot of particles going undergoing this. Of particles going undergoing this alpha-stable Levy process, then the macroscopic equation that is going to describe the devolution of the distribution is going to be the fractional heat equation. So there are actually like 10 equivalent definitions of the fractional Laplace operator, and you can see a very nice paper dealing with this type of topics is this one over here. And if you want to learn more about fractional sublimate space and so on, I recommend. Fractional sublimate space and so on, I recommend like this paper over here. Okay, so that's all for what we have so far for this for this setting. And now here I meant, so I said that we're working in R2, okay? But now what we were wondering is what happens when we take a bounded domain, okay? So now we have fractional applied. So now we have fractional Laplacian, and we have two scenarios: one in which we have bounded domains, and the other one in which we have the whole domain. So there are many different definitions for fractional Laplacian in bounded domains, and this is one of them. The first one that I wrote here is called the restricted fractional Laplacian. And this is. And this is given in the following way. So, if we take a function which is compactly supported, so similar with compact support in omega, and then we just extend it outside of that domain omega by zero, then we can just apply the definition that I wrote before using this hypersingular integral, and we can obtain the restrictive fractional applause. Fractional Laplacian. Okay, this is the first one, and there's another one which is called the spectral fractional Laplacian. And for this one, what we do is the following. So let us consider the following homogeneous derivative problem. So we have minus Laplacian of U equal to lambda u in a bounded domain omega, smooth. And we have u equal to zero along the boundary. And so if we solve this problem. So, if we solve this problem, then we know from our basic courses on differential equations, partial differential equations, that there's a set of eigen values, positive eigenvalues. So the first one is lambda one, which is bigger than zero, and we continue like this. And corresponding to each one of these eigenvalues, we have an eigenfunction, which here I'm denoted as E1, E2, E3. Now, if you want to write this, Want to write this spectral fractional applaution? What we do is just take the inner product of the ith eigenvalue with f and then multiply it by the ith eigenfunction. Then we multiply that times lambda i to the alphabet two. And in this way, we construct this operator. Okay, so this is the other way of defining fractional appliances in. Defining fractional appliance in a bounded domain. But these are not the only ones. There are many other definitions depending upon the stochastic process underlying how particles move. And however, in these two cases, there was a paper in 2014 in which Servade and Valdinocci proved the following. So they show that actually the eigenfunctions Actually, the eigenfunctions of the restricted functional Laplacian over here, this one over here, are no better than how the pull continues up to the boundary. On the other hand, for the spectral functional laplation, they prove that the eigenfunctions are actually smooth up to the boundary. Okay, so we have these two operators in a bounded domain, and they're actually different. Okay, so now a natural question is A natural question is what is the macroscopic limit of a linear Boltzmann equation in a bounded domain? Okay, so what type of boundary conditions can we consider? And here I'm just going to there are many types of boundary conditions, of course, that we can implement. One of them is specular reflection. And another one is inflow boundary condition, in which inflow boundary condition in which basically what we are doing is we we are in the in the we are in a point on the boundary what we're doing is just inside our domain okay so and in this case we're actually going to consider the the the linear Boltzmann equation in a bounded domain with inflow boundary conditions and we're going to obtain the And we're going to obtain the macroscopic limit. That's our goal for the next few slides. Okay, so now, once we have the proper rescaling on this bounded domain, what we have is to give the boundary conditions and the initial condition. So here, what we're saying is that we're actually, if we're in the boundary, we're going to, we're not going to shoot or shoot in any particle inside the boundary. Now, the second condition here, or Now, the second condition here, or condition number four, what this means is just we are to this equation, we are adding the initial condition. And here we are considering a well-prepared initial condition in order to avoid these boundary layers. So now, once we have this, let me just write down here the proper definition of omega minus. This is just, as I said. This is just as I said, if you're a point at a point in the boundary, you're shooting particles, you're not sure when we're not shooting any particle inside, and we're going to assume that our Maxwellian or our equilibrium distribution has this algebraic decay. So this is akin to the one on the unbounded domain, in the whole domain R2. Okay, so now this is our setting, and we have, this is the main feature. This is the main theorem. So we have proved that if f of, so let f epsilon be a solution of our kinetic equation with the in this bounded domain with this zero inflow boundary conditions, then as epsilon goes to zero, our particle distribution decouples into the product of the macroscopic density times the equilibrium distribution m as epsilon goes to zero. And here, rho is the solution of the following differential. Of the following differential equation in the sense of distribution. And we have here dt of rho plus a function times rho minus an operator of a certain operator here applied to rho. Okay, so that's what we get. And the initial condition for this differential equation is just the average with respect to v of the f initial. Okay, and again, Okay, and again, here we're considering alpha and the interval going from zero to two. Now, let me start to kind of uncover a little bit of the hidden things here. Let's take a look at this operator here. What we're doing is if we take, we apply this operator to this function at a certain point x, what we're actually doing is the following. We are integrating Integrating over this domain the following quotient. Okay, so you can see here we have a singularity when omega is equal to zero. And what this means is that we are integrating over a star-shaped domain with center x in omega. So let me show you what this means in a picture. It's going to be much, much, much easier. So let me go to the next picture. And here we have, this is our And here we have this is our domain omega. This is the boundary. And this is our point in which we are interested. Now we consider an omega or a w and what this means over here is the segment that is completely contained in omega. And in this case, it's going to be the straight line going from here. The straight line going from here all the way until we touch the boundary. Okay, so now we vary all the W's, and what we're going to get is that the area in which we are integrating is actually all of this over here. So our operator is actually not seeing this area over here, kind of aligned towards that area, and it's only integrating only around this part. uh this this part okay um so that's what this this uh this term means and now we have here our function h alpha this is um um okay so uh something that i i just need to mention here is that uh so this x naught uh xw is just um given a point x here and a certain w, our x naught is going to be the first point that is touched on the boundary. Is touch on the boundary of omega. So in this case, it's going to be this one over here. Okay, so this is what we have so far. And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to describe a little bit more in more detail the behavior of this function. Okay, so this is the main result, and I'm going to To describe each part in a much better way or in more detail. Good. So now let's note the following relationship. So we have the following. If we consider the restricted fractional Laplacian in a bounded domain, then this can be written in the following form using this hypersingular integral. Hypersingular integral. So, what we do is we just get our φ of y and then we multiply it by the characteristic function in the domain that we're interested. Okay, so this is the difference between the entire domain and entire domain. We're not going to have this term, we're just going to have a one, and the bounded domain we have here this characteristic function. On the other hand, we can see that this term that appeared in our differential equation plus this other operator can also be. Other operator can also be written in a similar form, but the term over here is going to have a different form and is going to be multiplied by the characteristic function in a star-shaped domain with base starting at x. Okay, so in this case, it's going to be this one over here. Okay, and finally, the function h alpha has a very nice behavior. H alpha has a very nice behavior. So this behaves like delta x to the minus alpha as x goes to the boundary. And if we are, if we look at the just one decays, this has a very nice interpretation because if this is our, oops, sorry. We have in 1D, if this is x, so this is our domain. This is x, so this is our domain, then if this is x, then this is going to be the distance to the boundary. This is going to be delta x. And what this is telling us is that when x goes to the boundary, this function is actually going to blow up. So it's going to increase when we get closer and closer towards the boundary of omega. Good. Now, how do we show this theorem? Now, how do we show this theorem? So, how do we prove this theorem? I'm going to only go through the kind of main ideas, not going to go into too much detail. The first thing, of course, is the first step is to obtain a priori estimates. And a natural way to do this is to multiply by f epsilon over m to get the quadratic entropy. We multiply by that, we integrate with respect to x and v, and we obtain the X and V, and we obtain the following equation. This one over here. Afterwards, we apply, we know that our operator Q over here minus Q is coercive. We apply the coercivity of Q and we obtain the following inequality. Now, here we know that this term over here is going to be positive. So here, omega plus Omega plus so these are the vectors on the or the points in the in the boundary that are pointing outwards. So this term over here is going to be so this is the outward norm and V is pointing outwards. So this is going to be positive. So this term is positive and this term is going to be negative because we are not shooting any particle inside our omega and therefore we can from here obtain the following a priori estimates. So we get A priori estimates. So we get that f epsilon is uniformly bounded in this L2L L infinity L2 space, R epsilon, which is defined as follows. So we have F epsilon is equal to the macroscopic density times M plus epsilon to the alpha over 2 times our epsilon. And if we plug And if we plug in here, we're gonna get that this is going to be our epsilon. Okay, so from here, we're gonna be able to obtain uniformly bounded estimates for our residue. And likewise, we're gonna be able to obtain uniformly bounded estimates for our density rho epsilon. Okay, so now with this a priori estimates, we can move forward and we are going to apply now a method due to Now, a method due to Antoine Malay. And he was interested in obtaining microscopic limits for this type of kinetic equation with algebraic decay at infinity. And what he did was to introduce an auxiliary problem. So we get a function phi, which is going to be our test function. Like our test function. And what he did was: okay, we're going to set, we're going to construct the following differential equation. And given phi, let's find psi. Okay, then we get psi. We multiply our differential equation or Boltman equation by psi epsilon, and then we pass to the limit. Okay, so that's our idea. That's the idea. And from here, we can easily see that to first order our psi epsilon. order or psi epsilon is of the form phi plus epsilon b times gradient of phi. Okay, now here since we're working in a bounded domain, some technical detail that we missed is the following. So here we have to obtain certain decay of our test functions on the boundary of our domain. And for that reason, we assume this condition over here. This condition over here. Okay. So now we, of course, solve this set of questions. Yeah. Yeah, you're out of time. So if you want to wrap it up. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Sorry. Okay, so we obtained these characteristic equations. We solve our differential equation for xi. We multiply our kinetic transfer equation by psi, by psi, with the integration. By psi, we do integration by parts. And then from here, we use uniform, disuniform estimates to pass to the limit. And that's basically how we prove this result. Okay, so I just want to wrap up here. So I'm not going to go through the details on these slides. And I'll just like to point out some work in progress. So we're studying actually the regularity of solutions of this macroscopic equation. We're also Macroscopic equation. We're also studying the case in which we have non-zero inflow boundary conditions. And we're also studying the coupling with an external force field. And we're in another line of work, we're also working on applications of Russian techniques in coarse graining. Okay, so thank you very much for your attention. And I don't want to go, yeah, take more time. So thank you very much. Thank you, Federal, for the talk. I'm not sure if you hear the clapping, but. I'm not sure if you hear the clapping, but anyways, I guess we have time for one question. Does anybody in the audience have a question? I had a quick question, and I guess maybe you said I just missed it. So the limiting equation should be preserving mass because you have no inflow. So is that clear? So that is actually clear from the picture. I guess because the H alpha looked like a reaction term, the way you wrote it, but it actually looks like. Wrote it, but it actually looks like a fraction of Laplacian. And so it conserves mass at least. It conserves mass. Yes. Yes. You're right. Yes. Okay. All right. Is there any other comment or question? No, thank you, Pedro, for the talk. And we'll wrap up today and we'll meet tomorrow morning at nine. And yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Ah, Matías, elicidades por el puesto. Gracias, gracias.
