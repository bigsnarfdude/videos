Okay, good now. Thank you. I get an echo here as well. So, first of all, thank you very much for inviting me to this. For inviting me to this meeting, I'd like to thank the organizers, and I think enough has been said about how Carolina's done all the work, so I'm not going to say anymore. We all know it. We all know it. I'm going to follow in the tradition of Martin. I'm presenting something I've never presented before. It's kind of completely new work, and also, well, it's not new. I've already had a very surface involvement with it until now, and now I'm getting. Involvement with it until now, and now I'm getting more involved with it. But the real people that have done the work are Adam Steferoni and Adam Boxer, who are clinicians in the field, and Melanie Quintana, who's at Berry Consultants, did all the Bayesian programming for this. My focus here is on thinking about these models for clinical trials. So when I think about the title of the meeting, Statistical Challenges for Complex Brain Signal. Statistical challenges for complex brain signals and imaging. I'm really over here in the challenges part, maybe some statistical part. You'll get one slide with an equation on. And yeah, maybe not so complex, but other than that, it fits. Yeah, and sorry for the low-tech approach here, but it wouldn't fit on the screen in full screen mode. So I'm focused here on frontal temporal dementia. So I want to, the first part of my talk is going to be a little bit clinical and talk about this set of diseases, really. And the first thing I want to mention is that it's often talked about as frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobe. And frontal temporal lobe degeneration, FTD versus FTLD. There's a lot of overlap between these things, but they're not exactly the same. The frontal temporal dementia is the clinical syndrome, the way that dementia affects you. And the frontal temporal lobe degeneration is the effect on the tissue in your brain, basically. FTD is an early onset disease. It hits people much younger than Hits people much younger than Alzheimer's disease. Counts for about 10 to 20% of all dementia cases. Now, this contradicts what Doyurtosin said on the first day. She had it at about 2 to 3%. So we have a lot of uncertainty, basically, in what percentage of cases this is. It's as common as AD in people under the age of 65, but obviously for older set of subjects, you will see a lot more. Set of subjects, you will see a lot more AD than FTD. It has a very wide range of clinical presentations. There's a behavioral variant, language variants, motor presentations. You'll be familiar with ALS, I would assume. Many people have seen that before. And we're at a position now where there's a lot of potential treatments in the works, a lot of candidate drugs. And what we don't have is good biomarkers or Have as good biomarkers or designs for clinical trials, we need them and we need them fast. So, and I'm kind of switching my work over to work on this stuff. Okay. So, I'm part of a big consortium, the all-FTD consortium, which is kind of like the little cousin of ADNI in a sense, for intellectual demography. And there are 27 sites across the country. And I wanted to let you know we have it available and we make it available to investigators. So, anybody interested in working in this field, whether it's related to what I'm doing or you just want data on a different kind of dementia, we're a resource. But even this is, you know, it's a rare disease in Alzheimer's. Even with this big consortium, we still don't have access to. Big consortium, we still don't have access to enough people running clinical trials. So we now are working on a wider consortium. The results I'll show you today are based on all FTD and GenFi, which at GenFi is the European version of All FTD. And more recently, there's Red Lab for Latin America. And even more recently than that, a whole bunch of new East Asian consortiums started up. Consortium started up. And the idea is that we want to harmonize the data across all of these centers and be able to run international clinical trials. Recently, sort of like a development in FTLD is that Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with it. He has a form that's called aphasia. And it's a sad but true thing that having somebody famous. That having somebody famous have the disease can make a big difference to funding and visibility and awareness. You know, I think Michael J. Fox for Parkinson's or Robin Williams for Louis Body Disease. So it's becoming an even more hot topic. Now, there are two different kinds of FTLD at the base level. There's a sporadic form, which could occur in any of us at any time. And there's also a genetic form. And there's also a genetic familial form of it, which accounts for about up to 30% of cases. And it's autosomnal dominant and has high penetrance. So basically, if you have a parent that has it, you're at about 50-50 chance of developing it at some point in your life. Most cases come from the big three genes: there's progranulin, GRN, C9, MAP T. Map T. And unfortunately, it's not sort of totally clear here, but the numbers, but the only point of this table is just to say that the proportions of the kind of symptoms you see, the kind of the way you see the disease varies according to the different genetic markers. And in particular, ALS kind of appears almost exclusively in the C9 group. Group. The reason that these, even though it's a smaller proportion, the familial FTD is a particular interest, is because we know that there's a very high chance that these individuals will get the disease. So we would like to be able to catch them early on for use in clinical trials. So a little bit about this is the most common form, behavioral. But this is the most common form behavioral variant FTD. You have behavior disinhibition, apathy or inertia, loss of sympathy, and you don't not very empathetic. You could have any mixture of these, by the way, within the behavioral variant. Become perseverative, stereotype, compulsive, ritualistic, hyper-orality and dietary changes. And neuropsychologically, you get deficits in executive function. Deficits in executive function, so that's where you're planning things, monitoring their progression, and then executing them. But what they don't get, unlike Alzheimer's disease, is memory problems to a great extent. Or if you do, it's very late in the disease. So here's a if we're recording, can we stop the recording for this piece? So, this is Carmela Tetzigliani at UCSF, who's interviewing a patient with behavioral variant FTD.
