All right. All right. So, um yeah, I will not take too long, so like we have a nice coffee break. Um so this work is uh um a work really of my postdoc. I work really on my post at Ricochet in collaboration with Daniel, that is a master's student in the work with Joe Harrison in the Faculty of Biological Science. And I'm very lucky to have Joe Harrison at UCALGR, at the University of Calgary, because it enables us to work with these engineer strains that are really fancy from my side. And so, for whoever of you wants to or start thinking to work with bacteria, I start. To work with bacteria, I strongly suggest to work with the microbiologist on the side, it really helps a lot. Okay, so the motivation or like the justification to work on this pseudomona genosa is that like this is a pathogen that is basically ubiquitous. Like you can find it everywhere on earth from any sort of environment, and it's very relevant from a clinical application, it's one of the most. Clinical application is one of the most common bacteria responsible for infection that you acquire at hospital. So you can find it developing in catalysts, but also like this, one of the major pathogens responsible for cystic febrosis. And so there are two peculiarities of this bacteria that they are linked together is that it's a multi-drug resistant bacteria, so it's really tolerant to antibiotics. Biotics and the second thing is that it's able to form this structure, this perfume that relevant to this community have a structure that resemble polar media. And so the transfer to antibiotic in this type of system is very similar to what you guys were for in your modeling system. So the presentation today is purely experimental, and I hope I get some feedback and ideas also on the theoretical side of modeling. Also, on the theoretical side model of this system. In particular, Pseudomonas is a single flagellated bacterium, so it's only one flagellum, different from E. coli that have multiples, and it's essentially a pusher. So it's an active system. And you heard this morning a few talks on active system and active colloids from Sara and from Oper. So this is one biological example of that. Okay, so there are Okay, so there are various work relative to esprone riology of these biofilm at interfaces. And again, the motivation to study them at interfaces because of the majority of clinical application happens also if you include interfaces. And so you see that, for example, it was reported that if you look at the moduli of these pellibles as a function of time, so as the batteries colonizing the interface, we have two characteristic time scale as it grows. So the first one. Lesser growth. So, the first one where the cell originally fits, and then second when actually the structure percolate throughout the system. If you start comparing how the moduli, the last moduli, evolves at the interface when you compare a system that I've got flagellum, algum without, and you see there is a link in the polarization as expected, but still you are able to form a very elastic pellicle at the interface in just a longer time. And there have been work also to explore. And there have been work also to explore more locally what is the interfacial property with the like magneto radiometer. But still, there are a lot of questions about this information. For example, how heterogeneous are these particles? And the second piece is what is the role of the hexopolymer that this system produces. The other piece, if you think about the antiobioletic transport, has been shown that as any Like as any community of that is able to form visible film, these are mostly at solid liquid interfaces. They see that the diffusion of the transport of the antibodies in this system is very much affected by the structure that you have. And so it's affected, for example, by the aging. And you have change in the same structure of order, 20% in diffusion as it evolves throughout the colonies. There is a beautiful study here that is actually now getting quite old. Is actually now getting quite old, but this is on a PA, and you're basically looking at this column. In green, you see live cell, and in red, you see dead cell. And on top, you see the concentration of the antibiotics that was used in this study. And what you observe is that the antibiotics kind of like accumulates, the dead cell accumulates on only the border of the system, and the antibiotics are not able to penetrate at all into the bacteria. And so there is this, what's called. And so there is this, what's called in the literature now, the dead ring of cells around this system that protects somehow the rest of the colony from being affected by the chemical stress. The other information here that you see is that basically whenever in any system you can verify or engineer bacteria that form colonies and bacteria that do not. And as soon as the bacteria are able to And as soon as the bacteria are able to assemble in colonies, they are protected from the chemical stress. So there is a strong correlation between the transport, so the figures of antibiotics, and the structure and microstructure that is perfectly developed. Okay, again, we don't know much about what happens at fluid interfaces. Okay, so the talk here is structured in two parts. The first I'm going to focus on PA14 wild type, and the only important information that you need to know about this is that there is a large. About this, is that it is a lab strain that only produces PAR. Okay, so it's the only produce polysaccharides, it doesn't produce any other exopolymer. So it's very nice to work with, especially the interfaces. And then I'm going to discuss a little bit the role of pellet in these systems. Okay, so in the work that I'm presenting, we use value measuring techniques. One of them is interfacial shear radiology, and we use a geometry that is called the no-ring. Most of you might be. Called the no-ring. Most of you might be familiar, but the idea behind this geometry is that you have this ring that you place at the interface between the two fields. In this case, the broth and the air. And you, because of the thickness, the length scale of the ring, you hope you should have a high Gusiness number so that literally facial stress is dominated during the measurement. And in our measurement, we are ordered 100 and million. So as the colony evolves, increase the Gusiness numbers of which. Increase because mass numbers of it should be okay. And so we are looking at the evolution of the G-parameter prime versus time as the bacteria basically colonizes this interface. The other technique that we use is basically micro-reliology. So we designed a little micro-well to study these interfaces. And the diameter of the well, the only important thing is that it's smaller than the capillary length of the two fluids, so that you can have almost a flat interface, or basically a flat interface. interface or basically a flat interface and we use optical microscope for a microscopy to do tracking at this interface so we place probes on the interface and we look at the displacement of these probes as the material as the obesity the bacteria colonized we use ps particle for this and the we try to extract from the of course of mean square displacement but also how heterogeneous are these systemic interfaces okay for Okay, for most of you, mean square displacement already know this, but just as for the people that don't know, we have a, if you think about the mean square displacement, so how a probe displays as a function of time because of thermal fluctuation, you can basically describe it as a power law behavior. So, if you look at the power law exponents alpha, you can have a generally three situations where alpha is larger than one, you have a super diffusive behavior. Larger than one, you have a super diffusive behavior, so it implies that your probe is actively moving into the system. So you could think of bacteria moving, swinging, so that would be the case. If the disponence is one, you have a classic diffusion situation, and if the disponence is below one, you have a sub-diffusion problem, and this is generally induced by the viscerasticity or the structuring of the system around the probe. And so you can imagine, like, for example, a polymer neptune where the probe is caged, so it's an oil. Neptune where the probes caged, so it's not able to diffuse as much. Okay, so when you're doing experiments on this type of interface, you look something like this. You get like a, and each one of these lines is one of these probe, and they are completely structured. So you can imagine, you know already that this interface or this system is heterogeneous immediately, I don't see them. What do we do as an extra step? We try to co-localize this trajectory with the location of the trope. Projector with the location of the trope, so we realize maps of these interfaces. So we plot here on the right, basically the legend. This is the alpha, the power law index on this interface. And each one of these cells, this is the location of the probe, is a Voronoi plot, so you minimize the length with respect to the probe that it's located, but it's not. Don't imagine that all these areas have the same property, right? So it's an optimal condition with respect to the probe density that you have. There is a trade-off. Probe density that you have, there is a trade-off in the amount of proper you can make, you can add the interface until basically the probe starts to be hydrodynamically interpreted. And this is even worse than the interfaces than in bulk, right? You have longer range hydrodynamic problem. But anyways, this is a good representation of, or an extraction, representation of how heterogeneous these interfaces are. Okay, so let's start looking at some results. So PA-14, while type, no engineering of this, only PAL. Engineering of this only fell. And when you measure G prime G double prime, you essentially see three stages of evolution. The first stage, where mainly the system is a liquid-like system, G double prime dominates here. Then you have a stage of transition, where basically your G prime grows as the bacteria start to increase in concentration with interface and also produce interdependence structurally. So your G prime eventually you have a crossover point and then the final stage where you see this. And then the final stage where you see this another jump in order of money in G prime, where you form a basic solid-like behavior, and there's really a network, as I will show you later, some images of these columns percolating throughout the interface. Okay, so if we look at the heterogeneity map, you start from early stages, we'll see most of the isoped infusive behavior, most of the cells are swimming at those interfaces. As time progresses, you start seeing a decrease of the value of alpha, and eventually longer. The value of alpha and eventually, longer time, almost with most of the material seems to present a sub-diffuse. Even if you look at it as smaller scale, though, although it seems so homogeneous, there's still a lot of material happening in these interfaces. Okay, so overall, if I look at average visceral displacement as a function of aging of this perfume, you see that you have a transition from somewhere superfusive behavior and then slowly moves towards a subtiffus. Slowly moves towards a self-defense behavior as expected. So, you are developing this network, and so more and more product either in the colonies on this structure of in-between colonies that are formed. Okay, so this is what looks like development in terms of images. So, one of these dots is one of those cells that is swimming at interfaces. So, at early stages, you see few cells coming together, interacting. Coming together, interacting for a limited amount of time, and then separating. And so you have multiple of this event, of this interaction event. At later stage, you start forming some colonies. These colonies are still moving at interface. Given the colonies, they are completely restructuring. And you can imagine in the boundary of these colonies, you have an active cell pushing these colonies. So you imagine you c you can avoid thinking of these as a as a large object moving because of the pushing of the interaction with the active colloids around them. With the active collodes around them. And then eventually you start seeing this percolation happening that is really developed later at larger scales. So you can start measuring a few quantities here. So here is the number of colonies that you see as a function of time, and this is the average area of these colonies that occupy the interface. So of course the average area that you, as you can imagine, like acid bacteria increase in concentration and development is colony increase. Column increase. What you see here is more interesting and is really representative of this dynamic structuring that you have in the interface. The number of columns really change and fluctuate throughout the system. And even if you look at one of these time scale and you plot the versus time, you have fluctuation of order 10 in number of columns. So it's quite large restructuring map and order of seconds, right, on the time scale. If you try to correlate the rheology with this structure, you With this structure, you see very strong correlation, and it's really this percolation evolution that brings the modulus up with this stronger power of motion. Okay, so you can also start to look at motility of this cell as the system evolves. And here I'm plotting the trajectory. This is roughly 15 seconds of data for each one of them at different times. At different times, and you can see a very interesting behavior here. So, at early stages, you see a lot of silkworld trajectory, and this is like well known in the community of Actimad. When you have a system at the interface, you start calculating between the thrust and a torque happening because they are at the interface. So, this is a characteristic of three-fluid interfaces. But, what is interesting here is that, like, at the later stage, you lose this circular trajectory. This circular trajectory. This is induced by the fact that your interface is starting to become more discholastic as time progresses. A later stage, you see a much more confined behavior of this active particle. Again, you have more parallel in the system, you have more cross-string structure around the cell, and so the cells are not able to move much. Okay, but it seems thermal almost, but it's still active. You can try to correlate this with the To correlate this with the information that we have in terms of structural biology. And what we observe is that, like, if you look at an average velocity of this cell, it seems to correlate much strongerly with the colonies area, so how much the interface is occupied rather than on the actual rheology. And that was a bit surprising for you. I don't have a good explanation for that yet, if anybody asks, please. The other thing that is interesting to study is a little bit like how the Is a little bit like how the tortuosity of this trajectory. So, in terms of tortosity, here, if you imagine a path from the point A and from to point B, you can have a distance D that is the optimum, the minimum distance from moving from point A to B. But in general, you have something much more complicated for this system. And so, the ratio between these two is what we define totally. And so, if you plotted versus serial versus G', you see a similar behavior. So G', you see a similar behavior, but basically, you have this minimum evolution at early time or early coverage. And this is really this transition that you see here between circular trajectory to something that is like more rectilinear in our black. Anyways, that appears to be more rectilinear. But then, of course, because it becomes more chaotic and brownian, your tortosis goes up again. You have to see it goes up again. So, like at any later stage, it's fine. Okay, so this is what we know about the wild type. So, now what is the role of TAL? So, we have some information in the literature. So, this is for Pa1, and this is a bacterium that is, again, pseudonymous, but in this case, we produce both PSL and MTAL. And this is studied on substrate, solid liquid. And again, it's protein alpha, the same parameter that I've discussed so far. So, you see that different So, you see that different conditions of it, where the most important ones are for us are these three at the moment. So, I'll focus on delta Tel A, which is basically no production of Tel, no production of cell, and no production of X, so all units are crowded, except L G in this case. And so, what you see that basically at the early stage you don't see much of a distance or alpha, but the later stage you see that whenever you remove a Pell or PSL, Pell and PSL. Pell, you see a much reduction in alpha. PSL, you don't seem to affect much. Again, it's a solid liquid, so it's very recorded. But I'll discuss what happened in our case for PA14 at the interfaces. So PA14 has two types of cells. In reality, you have a high molecular cell that is cell associated to the membrane of the system, so it doesn't escape. It remains attached to the membrane of the system. Which remains attached to the membrane of the bacteria that is responsible for cell cell adhesion. And then you have a secreted cell that is lowly runway and is able to penetrate to transfer outside the membrane into the system and structure the interface. So again, I was very lucky to have somebody that works on microbiology because he was able to engineer this strain. And so we have three mutation of isogenic mutation of the wave type. So delta pellene that has low cell associated. That has low cell associated and no secreted, delta Pell F that has no PEL, and Pelle E218 that has high cell associated and no secreted PEL. You cannot unfortunately have, for a biology reason, you cannot have only secreted PEL and lower cell associated. Okay, so you can see here the biomass of these are the interfaces. You can observe that the white type and the one that produces a lot of cell associated. The one that produces a lot of cell-associated L produce a large biomass of interfaces, a nice phallical supply. In the facility of delta LF and delta T L A, you don't see much at those interfaces. Okay, so we can start to look at the rheology of these strains again. This is the wild type that I showed you again. Delta L A seems to present a similar transition, early set stage transition, and then a crossover, a long strain, very weak. Maybe like if we run this longer time but what? This longer time, but we had some problem at the time. So, part of the telegraph into the bulk of the measurement, so we weren't able to complete the experience a longer time than that. But in the case of that at the left, that doesn't produce terror, you see something different. You still see a crossover point at the top and air v stage. You're missing this like transition job completely. Completely. Maybe you have something here. But so it appears to have a crossover and still have elasticity that is very surprising. Although you can imagine, of course, you are colonizing this interface, so particles are there and developing some elasticity there because of the activity. So you have some secondary effect responsible for this engine. But also, you have another transition a long time that seems to reduce the G-ground. So we'll see that about. And then the sales of the. Then the cellosohida one you see a form of celicote and the tree prime keep growing as the bacteria colonized. We might have some difference in kinetic of growth, although in the classical biological measurement we didn't appear to observe that. So was because we are missing this transition region for these other two reports. So we are not sure why is that. Okay, these are average MS. These are the average MSD for each one of these trading. If the only exception here that doesn't present a sub-diffusive behavior a long time is the case where we have no PEL. And so if you have just cell-associated PEL, it appears to develop a sub-diffusive system as of course the buffin metallicole evolved. And so this is quite interesting because. And so, this is quite interesting because it points to the idea that cell associated is a necessary ingredient for the teleport formation. Necessary in the sense that it could be sufficient, but it's necessary, but we cannot say that it is sufficient. If I look at the micromechanical marks, if you want, of these interfaces with respect to This is with respect to the white type. You see that, like at long time, the white type and the strains that present cell-associated health are somewhat similar, although you have a region, larger region, where you have still activity. And in the case of Tel A, delta Tel A still presents a lot of heterogenesis. So this is the case where you have a low cell associated production and no split applied. Delta Tel F, you have still a lot of activity up there. You have still a lot of activity happening. Okay, so in terms of structure, the structures change completely as we are modifying the palm. So if I look at the white type, this percolated structure that we saw here, we don't sell in any other. And we see more density in the case of the cell associated, but like there is no percolation throughout the system. Motility as well changed a lot. Motility as well changes a lot. And what's super interesting, and I will show you at the end it is about this, is that in the case you have no Pell, you have a lot of motility. These cells are able to swim quite a bit and they like to explore those interfaces. Alright, so I'll talk quickly a bit about this. There are some we did some preliminary data on the effect of antibiotics on our effects, these interfaces, for the different states. For the different states. So, here I'm showing some images. So, these images are basically after 72-hour growth and after 18-hour wait for the antibiotic to affect the system. And in green, you still have the senior for the live cell, in red are the dead cells. So, well-type, delta Pell A, delta PLF, and the T-Me. And so, you see immediately that in the case of delta Pell A or delta PLF. That in the case of delta Pele or Delta Pelef, so the two cases where you have no Pel, there is much more efficiency for the abiotic. In the case of the white type, you have less efficiency. When you have the cell associated, you have less efficiency, but still you have a lot of efficiency at that county. And so this is a concentration that is physiologically relevant for the application of this antibiotic. If you try to quantify this ratio between LDNA and GFP, so basically, So basically, larger is the ratio, more Eukan in this system on average. So the wild type, of course, has the lowest. Delta Pel A seems to present a lot of efficiency, while delta P L F, where we have no cell associated and no CPTETL, it appears to be lower and similar to the one that cell associated. So there must be some other mechanism through which Delta Telf is able to protect themselves to To the transport of these antibiotics. As a function of time, you can also study this evolution of this ratio. And basically, you have the white type that is the lowest. And in the case of delta the left, it seems to resist the thermodynamic stages, but then a longer time eventually reach the E to a thing. Maybe even farther away, it will have more effect on the delta point. The rest of the method. Okay, so summary of this result. So I'll show you a little bit of the evolution of this interfacial property for PA14 wild type. So that we have these three stages of development of these fedicles. They are really heterogeneous in terms both of rheology and structure for the colonies. And we show that cell-associated is really crucial for both telecolformation in terms. Formation in terms of mechanics, but also seems to be very less efficient than say videotale in protecting from chemical stress. Okay, so in the last few minutes that I have, I want to show you some interesting video that I have on this particular strain that is delta Pelf. So, delta Pelf, as I mentioned, doesn't produce any polysax star. So, it doesn't structure structures. Structure like chemically, if you want the interface. And so the only thing that does is really a puller, the pusher, moving at this interface and has a repulsion potential because it's electro negative when coming close at it. So it's a very nice model system, biological model system if you want for kilometer. And so I'll show you first. And so I'll show you first this. So, this is about 32-hour growth. And you can start to see a lot of dynamics happening in these interfaces. But what is interesting about these dynamics, if you start looking at the fluctuation of the number of these, it presents large scale fluctuations. And so we believe this might be the incident or like we are in a motivated industry. We are in a motivated-induced type of phase separation. A longer stage, you have even more crowded interfaces. And so, here there are some probes that colloida probes roughly three, I think, three or five microns in diameter. And you can see, of course, there is a little bit, a lot of motion, but like if you look at the probe, you can see them jumping quite a bit, 10 or 20. Quite a data 10 or 20 times the length scale of the probe. And this is really like this active motion, collective active motion, transporting this colloidal probe into the system. So there is a lot of work that we are currently doing in trying to understand this phenomena from a physical point of view and correlating also with the technology of these system interfaces. Okay, so I'll stop here and I'll be happy to answer the question. Okay, questions for Jermaine? Thank you for this nice talk. I have a question about the spiel.
