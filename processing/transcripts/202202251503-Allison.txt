Didn't quite work. Can you see what we are seeing? We have like the PowerPoint window. I'm not seeing like just your slides, if you know what I mean. I think your computer's kind of having troubles. G, do you want to try? Like, Donnie, if you stop your. Do you want to try like Donnie? If you stop your sharing, G, if you try sharing something, it doesn't have to be PowerPoint. Anything will do. Any like browser window or something? Here, I can. One second. Okay, sharing just browsing the bird's website here. Yep, so what I'm seeing in the room, I have your browser on the left and then the small video of the speaker on the right. Is that what you were having before? Carlos, we'll go in and check. Carlos will go in and check. Here he comes. I'll just pretend I'm giving a presentation here. Beautiful day here in Banff. I think you might be the first day of spring feeling with the sun high in the sky. A lot of sunlight. Your audio is really nice and clear. The only thing I'm not sure about is the picture layout. Is that would you normally just have the slides? Would you have the slides and the speaker? The slides on the speaker, or the speaker will usually be like in the corner, but overlapping a little with the slide. You know what I mean? You would just see it like a Zoom session. It's usually picture in picture. On the right? Was it on the right of the projector? But it wasn't like a separate window in it. That was like the Zoom script had it set up so that it would set that up pretty. Or then maybe just one of those instead of the three that would work. Yeah, the top there. Or just the second one. That must have been that one. Yeah. And then voila. So far, yeah. I think I will come back. Like the next meeting, it's supposed to remember most of those settings, but you Supposed to remember most of the settings, but you would have to remember how you should do it. Because then it's better like that, because then the text is clearly bigger. You look like the presentation. Check one, two. Yep, sounds good. I'm great. Does it sound transmit well, like from the back of the room? Like, I can hear you. I know you're at the front. I can hear you. I know you're at the front. I think it should be good from most places, maybe apart from that corner, because that's the furthest from any lights. So now I'm in the back. Back left. Back left, speaker left. And now I'm wondering back for long. So I think it will probably deal off a bit over here and because that speaks without my phone doesn't have. See if we don't like what does it matter? Just very slightly quieter there. Yep, that's all. Not much, though, it's still much better. That's kind of the overall enhancement from the previous system is that now I can hear everybody in the room. Yeah. And so as long as we get those two working, what other schemes do we have? So we've had a remote speaker, we've had a local speaker. And can you maybe mute yourself? Maybe mute yourself. The Chalk Talk should do the same thing, but if you mute yourself and just check your live stream, that's not going to work. Somebody needs to check your live stream. I'll check it on my laptop. The live stream before had pop-ups. Linda was saying that she couldn't see them in the room though. So that was a bit troubling. I don't know how. The pop-up was on Castle. It's not on. So like in the room? You know how there's the two monitors? In the room, you know how there's the two monitors? No, he doesn't. That's a second monitor, isn't he? He has only one there. There was always two monitors in there. Because it was there when I got here. Yep. But yeah, I would have to go to the top monitor, and that's where I would close those windows. The top one at the moment is showing auto-auditorium, and I haven't been able to con figure out how to get it to show the second screen of Castle. Um, just give me two minutes to check. No problem, no problem. No problem, no problem. Question is when this little pop-up with a speaker pops up, someone would have to do it in the row, right? To make it a possibility at the moment. I think there'll be a bunch of that stuff. The next few weeks there'll be a lot on land. That stuff, the next few weeks there'll be a lot of manual little things. I'll try and figure out how to automate all of them. But what I want to get done today is anything that depends on that guy because I won't be here, like we won't ever be here at the same time again. So I need to get anything that's like physically needs wired together or logically needs to set in that rack. All of the stuff inside Zoom, so making sure the chat window is closed, making sure the pop-up's closed, moving the speaker around. In principle, I can automate that from wherever. It's just up. Wherever, and it's just updating those scripts. And until I get a chance to do that, yeah, we need somebody to.
