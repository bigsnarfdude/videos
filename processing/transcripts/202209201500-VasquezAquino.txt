Thank you, Pedro Lis, and thank you to all the organizers for the invitation. It's a pleasure to be here. My talk is something about the I worked on my thesis with Pedro Luis and Claudia Reynoso in CMAT. The intention of this talk, what I can change that's not working. I don't know, it's not no it's it's not maybe but there is not so much Okay, thank you. Thank you. Okay. The intention of this talk is to talk on a brief overview of some techniques developed by Francis Kirwan to compute the cohomology of GIT quotients. As we know, geometric invariant theory is used to construct modulus spaces. Construct model spaces. So, this theory of these techniques of Ernst's key one that I studied for my thesis, and I apply these techniques to the space of party plane curves. So the plan is I'm going to introduce the GIT action on the space of quantity plate curves. Corps, I would like to talk about the stratification based on the works of Hesseling, Ness, Kirwan, and Kemp, and some techniques to compute the cohomology of the JIT quotient, which in the good cases, the cohomology of the JT quotient is Equation is defined as the equivalent cohomology of that perfectly equivalent stratification. And on the other hand, a partial dissimilarization is necessary. And finally, I'm going to talk about the Betty numbers of the JIT quotients in the case of the JIT quotient is singular. So let me introduce the space of quartic plane curves. The space of quartic plane curves in this talk X will denote the space of quartic plane curves, and G will be the special linear group. And I'm considering the linear action by change of coordinates on this space of quarti-plane curves. So, why we are interested in quarti-plane curves? Some reasons is that the Is that the jetty quotient of quartiplane corps is by rational to the moduli space of genus of non-hyper elliptic genus fake curves? And also the space of quartic plane curves is related to the space of holomorphic foliation on the complex plane of the degree two. There is a rational morphism between the space of these degree two foliations. This degree two foliations and quite plane curves. So, and that voluntation have many applications as a solution of differential equations and that have applications on other fields. So, naturally, we are interested in the quotient of this action, which is defined by Munford. We know that this is the projective variety associated to this graded ring of invariant. Gradient ring of invariant polynomials. So we know about this is that this is an irreducible projective variety of dimension six. But on the ring of invariant polynomials, we know that this is generated by 13 homogeneous invariant polynomials, but the explicit But the explicit computation of these polynomials is still unknown. This is to compute the generators of the invariant rings is a classical problem in computational invariant theory. There are some algorithms to compute generators, but it's too complicated. It's too complicated if we if we don't have a computer with power that that's no, it this comes from a paper some recently in 2015 that proved that. That proves the conjectures of Shioda. And Shioda states that this ring is generated by 15. And in 2015, that was proved. Yeah, yeah. By Munford, we know that to construct the GIT quotient, we have IT quoti, we have to eliminate a closed subset of unstable points. This closed subset of unstable points are the zero locus of these homogeneous invariant polynomials. A simple definition of an unstable point is that a point is unstable if every homogeneous invariant polynomial vanishes on it. But we don't have the polynomials. Don't have the polynomials, but we can compute the closed subset of unstable points. As we know, if we restrict the action to the open subset of semi-stable points, we have the quotient that we call the GIT quotient of this action. So we can think what kind of quartics lives in this subset of semi-state. Subset of semi-stable points and unstable points. We can compute this, and we know by Munford that the space of unstable quartics consists of the smooth quartics, which are stable, quartics with ordinary double points, which are stable too, and the strictly semi-stable quartics are those with a technological singularity. Technology in reality. And we have in these cases the double conics, the reducible quartics, double conics, product of conics, and this product of conics and irreducible conics, and two lines tangent to the conic. This quartics are strictly semi-stable. And finally, we have that the unstable quartx that we have to eliminate is a sorry. Sorry. Yeah, if they intersect transversely, they have notes and similarities. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they have technologies. Yeah. Yeah. And the unstable quartets are those with a triple point, a singularity, and or is a product of. Or is a product of concurrent lines. So, how can we compute this? Or we know all the quartics in this unstable state. And why I am interested in the unstable quartics, this is because that Francis Kirwan shows that the closest subset of unstable points contains information about the JT quotient. Of course, this. The quotient. Of course, this subset or these points doesn't appear in the quotient, but this contains information about our quotient that we are interested in. So a simple criteria to compute, to know if a curve is semi-stable or stable or unstable is by using the diagram of which. This is the diagram. Of weights. This is the diagram of weights of the space of quarti-plane curves. And we know that equivalent of the Hilbert-Moonford criteria, if we take this diagram and we take all the lines passing through the origin, this is the origin for me. Yes. If for a given If for a given uh quartic, we have weights weights on the left on and and on the right side of the of the line, of every line. We always have weights on both sides. The curve should be stable. If we have weights on one side and some weights on the lines, that curve should be strictly semi-stable. Strictly semi-stable. And if for a line, we have all the weights on the one side, that curve is unstable. In this red convex, we have that all the quartics in this region is unstable because we have this alignment is easy to see a line in this was intruder. In this passing trunk origin. And also for this region, we have that all the way, all the quartics living of the change of coordinates in this region is unstable. Now, we have in this case all the explicit coordinates of unstable particles. What do we want to do with this unstable particles? With this unstable quartics, we are going to compute a stratification because Q1 results say that there exists a stratification of the variety of our variety by non-singular locally closed sub-varieties, where such that the unique open stratum is the open stratum. Open stratum is the open subset of semi-stable points. For every non-zero index, this is a finite set of weights. For every non-zero index, we have that this is a locally closed non-singular supervariation. And we have a partial order in this indexing set. We have a partial order such that the closure of Such that the closure of the stratum, Spita, is contained in the union of the strata over it. And a particular property of this stratification is that this is perfectly equivariant. That means that the equivariat of the variety X Decomposes into the equivalent cohomology of the strata. So we compute this stratification. This computation were unknown. So we compute the stratification. We can observe that the first three strata consist of product of concurrent lines. Concurrent lines and the other contains curves with a specific singularity. We have 11 strata. Each stratum is classifying unstable quartics with a specific singularity. That is something interesting with this stratification because in the case of curves, The case of curves, this stratification is classifying singularities, especially singularities of the curves. And we have the dimension of this variety. We can compute the closure of these varieties. Let me show you some pictures to understand these singularities. The Stratton 4 to the 11, we have all these type of singularity types. Type of singularity types for the quartics. So, this is an interesting property of the stratification, and that stratification is way to Kilwan, Hesselink, Kemfi, and NES. So, now what we are going to do with this ratification, this key one proof that if every If every semi-stable point has a finite stabilizer, then the rational cohomology of the GIT quotient is given by the equivalent cohomology of the semi-stable stratum. So, as the stratification is perfectly equivalent, we have that the betting numbers of the GIT quotient. Of the GIT quotient is given by this Poincaré polynomial. The coefficients of this Poincaré polynomial are the vertex numbers of the GIT quotient if every semi-stable point has finite stabilizer. And moreover, we have that since our group is connected, we have that the equivalent. We have that the equivalent homology of this variety is decomposed as the product of the cohomology of the variety X and the homology of the universal classifying bundle of G. And we can compute this equivalent homology of the every stratum by considering some subvarieties of X. Some subvarieties of X, such that the equivalent homology of the stratum Sβ is equal to the equivalent homology of this sub-variety. To compute this should be easier for computations. Here, you can observe that in this case, we are considering again the G-action of this subgroup. Of this subgroup on this subvariety. And again, we can apply these formulas in this case of the Guban community. We repeat all this process for each beta. In the case of plane curves, this is a little bit easier to compute all this. So we have to know. Know the classifying inversal bundle of each subgroup stabilizer. And this stabilizer is of the of the action of G, of the adjoint action of G on the space of a virtual one parameter subgroups. So we compute this for the space of quartiplane curves, but Of quarti-plane curves, but unfortunately, as in most of cases, we have points with stabilizers of positive dimension. And of course, we have that this covariant homology is not defining the rational cohomology of the JT motion. We can We can identify the quartics where we have the stabilizers of positive dimension. That is the space of double conics. The double conics has a stabilizer of dimension 3, and it is a subvariety where we can find the product of conics, product of conics, and we consider the product of semi-stable conics in this. This with the subgroup of dimension one. So what is this the end game? Because we don't have all semi-stable points with a finite stabilizer. The answer is no. Key one shows that if we compute a sequence of blow-ups over those Over those locus of points with stabilizer of positive dimension, we can obtain a variety where all the points of this, all the semi-stable points has finite stabilizer. And this sequence of blow-ups is defined in such a way that this induces a sequence of blow-ups on the GIP quotient. Such that it is the last of these block ops is called the partial decingularization of the quotient. One slide. Semi stable is we can find the double conics we can find the double conics in in the line in this line and that's strictly semi-stable strictly semi-stable. Yeah sorry one question and the the local where the stabilizers are uh infinite can be stratified qu by I don't know a smooth I don't know, smooth. I mean, are the blow-ups, the center of the blow-ups are smooth or yeah, yeah. Let me talk about that in the let me in the next slide. Yeah. This sequence of blow-ups, special blow-ups, induces a sequence of blow-ups in this, such that the last of these blow-ups is called a partial decimalization. A partial decimalization of the JT quotient in the sense that in this last of these blow-ups, every semi-stable point has finite stabilizer and the JT quotient can admit at most finite quotient similarities. So, how do we compute this blow-up? We consider We consider all the connected components of stabilizers of semi-stable points. Of course, we are interested in some in those semi-stable points with stabilizer of positive dimension. This is a reductive subgroup of G. And we define this set of all semi-stable points which is fixed by this subgroup R. This subgroup R. Can show that this set of the orbits is an invariant non-singular closed sub-variety of in the set of semi-stable points. So we can think by Hironaka a blow-up exists and we define, we call the let this symbol be the blow-up of this. Of this open subset of semi-stable points over this locus of points with the stabilizer of the R or connected component. So we know that by a chosen of the linearization, we can define a linear action of G on the blow up such that this reduction. This reducted subgroup of G doesn't occur as stabilizer of points in this variety. And this blow-up is in such a way that if you have a point in the blow-up that projects to a stable point, so that point was stable too. If we have a point that projects to a non-semi-stable point, and so that point was non-semi-stable. Semi-stable. So, this is solving the problem with points with stabilizer of positive dimension. So, and we have that. We can compute the equivalent homology of that block up in this way. Where this is denoting the exceptional divisor. This is the set where we This is the set where we blow up. And so we have a linear action of G onto the blow up. So by the first theorem of the Q1, there exists a stratification of that variety. And we can compute the equivalent homology of the semi-stable stratum of that blow-up. Can you speak? Yeah, yeah. And my question is from the result of the dilemma of Cuban. Is this a principal G-bundle actually, the GI comport in this particular situation? Or not just? I think, yes, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, this blow-up is So the the this uh blow-up is uh so special that uh this the jacket This, the GIT quotient of this action, G action on this blow-up is the blow-up of this GIT quotient over this image of the. So we compute this for the space of party plane curves. We have in this case, we have only two blow-ups. The first blow-up is of the orbit of double conics. The orbit of double conics. And the second blow-up is over this T-set. This is not only a single orbit. We compute all this, these two blow-ups, which induces blow-ups on the JT quotient. And we have that in this last blow-up, we have a finite stabilizer for semi-stable points and the rational homology of the Betty numbers of this quotient. Of this quotient is given by the equivalent homology of this. Okay, to compute this equivalent homology is something a little bit complicated because we don't know the explicit variety, the blow-up. We know that this blow-up exists, we don't know the explicit variety. So, how can we compute the stratification if we don't know a Don't know the variety, we use that. We use that is a isomorphic to the projective bundle, the projective normal bundle over this set where this variety where we blown up. And Kiwan shows that there is the strat. There is the strata of this normal projective normal variety have the same dimension as the strata of this blow-up. And they are related by some, the indexing set of those stratifications are related for some changes conjugated of the weight chamber of each group. So we compute that. So, we compute that for the space of quartiplane cups. And in this step, we have a homology which satisfies the poncariduality, but we are interested in this quotient. We have the partial singularization, but we are interested in this quotient. And we would like a homology. A homology which satisfies the prevalent homology, the concrete. So we think on the intersection homology developed by, I don't remember, let me remember Goresky and McPherson. And we have that, a key one shows that the The intersection cohomology of this GIG quotient is a direct summat of the intersection cohomology of this quotient. If this is the case where we have a block-up, right? And in the case of the, we have the partial similarization, the intersectional cohomology is given by the ordinary cohomology, and that is given by the equivalent homology of the semi-stable stratum. So in this So, in this formula, you can observe that we have our quotient that we are interested in, the JT quotient of the blow-up. We have the quotient of this set by this action of the normalizer of the connected component of the normalizer of the group R. And this quotient, which is the action of this group R on the normal bond. the normal bond over a point of closed orbit. So we have to repeat, we have to repeat all the techniques, all the machinery on each quotient that appears in this formula. This is geometric invariant and Q1 techniques in all this action. In this little diagram, you can observe that we blow up first in this type. Up first in this side over this set. Now we are working in this side because we have a blow-up of this question. And this quotient that appear in that formula are these questions. Okay, so we compute that the intersectional cohomology with the mean of diversity, and we have that We have that for the partial singularization, the intersectional cohomology is given by the ordinary cohomology. And we use that formula to compute the cohomology of this blow-up, the middle. And we repeat again the formula to compute the intersection cohomology of this quotient. So we have a comology where the Punkariduality is satisfied. The Poincaré duality is satisfied. Of course, these are our intersection. We call intersection Betty numbers. Intersection Betty number in these two quotients. And here we have the ordinary Betty numbers. Now the result of this work is that we can compute these Betty numbers of the partial similarization and the JT quotient of quartz and plane curves. So, and finally, for me, that I learned and I enjoyed that techniques of Francis Kirwan. And I try apply to that techniques on the space of holomorphic volation, because I said in the beginning that this space of quartiplane curves is related with the space of holomorphic volation of degree two on the complex plane. So we think with So we think if the spaces are related, are variational, what can happen with the GIT quotient? So we compute the intersection Betty numbers of the GIT quotient of polymorphic foliation, and we obtain the same intersection Betty numbers as the GIT quotient of quartiplane curves. But now the question is. The question is: how are the JT quotient related? Maybe the coincidence of these numbers is very coincident, but we don't know. We are studying birational morphism between that two spaces and look for information between this. information in between this this id question uh can be this uh jt question the same the same variety or or not we we don't know that is what we are uh we are studying now uh so and what we we don't know yet because uh i i we found this uh vibrational morphism some some weeks ago. An office some weeks ago, and we are working. Yeah. And so, since these are the three main papers of Francis Kirwan that we can consider. And since you are in Oaxaca and one of the main languages of Oaxaca is Zapotec. Obohaka is a Sapotec. Let me tell you: welcome in Sapotec. Sikaro Zedato Gijilula in Skije Pelato. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, we know that there is a rational morphism, but now I don't know if that morphism is equivariant. And yeah, we know that some semi-stable foliation like Lies in unstable quartics, but we don't know much about that, and we're that is something interesting. Another question, Marx. How is GIT quota plays the model eye of these three curves? Yeah, there is a vibrational morphism between the portion and the M3. We know that. We know that all non-hyper elliptic genetic curve is associated to a non-singular quartic, and but the comology is that something that I don't know right now about the cohomology of the entry and the cohomology of this I I don't I don't know I don't know. Hey, I'm not sure. Another question from the audience? Another question. Okay, just remarkable, you already see it. You compute the You compute the intersection homology, but you have still to work out the actual homology, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, well, thanks again.
