Dualizing shift twisted by the points has a positive degree on every component. And so this comes down to a combinatorial condition that each P1 has at least three special points where special means a marking or a node. This is a recall of how the dualizing shift restricts to a reducible component. And so we are compactifying the configuration space by adding reducible curves. This is the simplest possible situation and genus zero. simplest possible situation and genus zero. And so this locus will be the that we are adding is the union of so-called boundary divisors where generically you have the curves has two components. So this corresponds to a partition of the set of markings. Now these can further degenerate and so you take the closure of such a locus you get one irreducible boundary divisors. These intersect and you get higher And you get higher codimensional strata. So, this really the strata here cor correspond to a lower bound on the number of irreducible components. We have this stratification. And so this is now a MZ member is smooth over spec Z. So if you want to think about what kind of variety do you get, say, when you base change over your favorite algebraically closed field, it's something very concrete. So you can describe the theorem of Capranov. Can describe the theorem of Kapranov. You can describe M0 and bar as an iterated blow-up of a projective space at dimension minus three. And then you take n minus one points in linear regional position. You can fix them up to automorphisms. You blow these up, and then you take all the lines stand by any two of the points. So n minus one choose two lines, and then any plane stand by any three of the points, and so on, all the way to codimension two. So the Picard number becomes exponential in n. And so an example is. And so, an example is for M05, yes, is a blow-up of P2 at four points. So, it's a Del Petro of degree 5. It's a Fano surface. And now, we call that there are different ways to realize Del Peto of degree 5 as a blow-up of P2 at four points. There are five ways. And the same is true here with the Capranov models. So, there are, in fact, not just one such identification, but M. These come from some tautological Lyman's Ramzer Mbar. And they are related by Cremona transformations. Mono transformations. And then, so you are still asking what kind of rational variety did we get? So, in dimension two, it's a Fano surface. In dimension three, it's still quite close to being Fano. So, the anti-canonical is a big NF line bundle. It's not ample. It's the blow-up of the unique cubic hypersurface in P4 with 10 nodes, the segregated cubic. But then it turns out that once n is bigger equal than 8, you lose any positivity of the anti-canonical. So, no multiple of So, no multiple of the anti-canonical will be effective. So, it's very far from being funny. And so, I'm going to be interested here in the birational geometry of this space. And now you can ask why do you care about something so specific? So it's related to the stratification that you saw before. So, you can ask more generally about Mg and bar. What is the role of the stratification for its birational geometry? In for this birational geometry, and so it's a question that goes back to Mumford. Can you describe, let's say, in a combinatorial way the ample divisors on Mg and bar? And so, a necessary condition for an ample divisor is to intersect all these one-dimensional strata coming from curves that are singular. So, the correct number of nodes, minimum number of nodes. So, any ample divisor will have to intersect these positively. And then the question is: is this enough? The question is: Is this enough? Uh, can you perhaps this is everything you get a nice polyhedral ample code? And so, it's there is a theorem of uh Gibney, Keel, and Morrison that says that if you know this in genus zero for all n, yeah, so that means every curve is a numerically a sum of one-dimensional boundary strata, then the same is true for mg and bar. And so, I think this motivated a lot of the research into the birational geometry of m0 and bar. And so, uh, another And so, another question that is related to this, that is attributed to Fulton, is: can you, for example, ask the same kind of question for other, not necessarily curves, but for other sub-varieties? So perhaps, is this stratification similar to that of toric varieties, where every sub-variety is numerically an effective sum of strata? So, I want to emphasize that it's not a question about the Comology. That it's not a question about the cohomology. The cohomology will be generated by strata. We are asking: is every sub-variety a sum of strata, an effective sum? So, for curves, this will give you this Fulton-Faber conjecture that I mentioned before. So, that is open. And now, I want to look at the case of divisors. So, for divisors, codimension one, we are asking: is every divisor, every sub-variety of M0MR? Every sub-variety of M0MR co-dimension one is it numerically a sum of boundary divisors. And so I should say from the beginning, this is known to be false, but it was not known how far from being false it is. So the theorem that I want to mention is that it's very far. So the theorem, the application is that the effective cone of M0 M bar is not even polyhedral. Is not even polyhedral, so not finitely generated when n is at least 10. And this is true in characteristic zero and also in characteristic p. So at least for an infinite set of primes, p of positive density, including all primes up to 2000. And so polyhedral just means a finitely generated non-polyhedral is the opposite of that. That can fail in different ways. So the shape is not clear, but the shape of the cone. But the shape of the cone can be round or locally polyhedral, but it's just not finitely generative. And so I just want to clarify what I mean by effective cone. So for any projective, normal projective variety, you consider Cartier divisors modular numerical equivalence. So we identify divisors which intersect curves in the same way. You look at the corresponding vector space and we take the cones spanned by effective Cartier divisor and take the closure. RTA divisor and take the closure. So you obtain a closed convex cone, which in general need not be polyhedral. But now there are big theorems that tell you that, for example, all fan of varieties or more generally, all logfano varieties will have an effective cone that is finally generated. And there is a meaning that one can associate to a geometric meaning that you can associate to the faces of the cone, for example. To the faces of the cone, for example. Okay, so for so now just some terminology. I guess I will call a one-dimensional subspace of a cone extremo if it cannot be written as a sum of two things in the cone other than things that lie on this ray. Excuse me? Yes. I'm confused. Are the DI's meant to be Cartier, or do you also know? Also, no, but always CARTIA, but it's true that in all the setups in which we will consider this, the variety will be Q-factorial, so it doesn't matter. But do you assume that every single DI is Cartier or just the sum of them? No, I can assume each of them is Cartier, but as I said, yeah. Okay, thanks. Yes. Okay. Okay, so going back now to the Okay, so going back now to the effective cone of M0M bar, I just want to give a bit of the history of what was known before. So, for example, every boundary divisor is contracted by one of the blow-up map descriptions, what I call a Kapranov map. Yes, MZMBA is this iterated blow-up of Pn-3 along points and lines and so on. And so these are, you can always choose a Kapranov map such that the boundary divisor is an. Such that the boundary divisor is an exceptional divisor for this blow-up, and therefore it generates will generate an extreme array of the affective cone. So, for example, yeah, this will give you that M05, for M05, every boundary divisor is a minus one curve. It's one of the minus one curves, and this is a blob of P2 at four points. There are 10 boundary divisors on M05, 10 minus one curves. So these are exactly the same, and they generate the effective cone. They generate the effective cone of this Del Petro surface. And then the first place where you already have a failure of the principle that the boundary should generate the effective cone is for any pulse 6. So this was discovered by Kiel and Verbier. There are some other types of divisors that intersect the interior. They are still rigid divisors, and so they can be contracted. And there is a, so if you throw these in together with the boundary, this will give you a polyhedral cone. Yeah, that'll give you the other extreme arrays of this polyhedral cone, that the theorem of Hassett and Chinko. However, this cone is still simple for n equals six because up to the action of the symmetric group permuting the markings, there is only one Kilver Mirror divisor. However, when n becomes larger, you can construct, you can generalize this construction when you find more More, but finitely many divisors that can be contracted by rational contractions. So, with Jenia Tevalev, we introduced a combinatorial object which we call the hypertree. And there are many hypertrees for each and finitely many, however. And so, the cone gets more complex. And then OP and Doran Janzira Kusa Yensen also found other. Doranjansirakusa Jensen also found other types of extremal divisors other than hypertrees. And so now our theorem explains this complexity. Yes, in fact, there are infinitely many extremal divisors. And so this, as I said, is an application of a result about the surfaces. And so to connect the two, I will call a rational contraction. A rational map between normal, projective, and Q factorial varieties, which can be decomposed into a sequence of two types of maps. So, either small modifications, so that means maps which are isomorphisms outside big open sets. So, the complement is a codimension of these two, or just a surjective morphism. And so, this kind of maps have the property that they preserve. The property that they preserve certain properties, such as so, here is two examples of two properties. So, if x has any of these properties, then y does two. One is the property of having a polyhedral effective cone. And so I'm going to comment on the second property. So, this is immediate for a small modification. And to prove that this is true for a surjective morphism, you use a theorem of Buxom, Demay, Pon, and P. Theorem of Buxom, Demaille, Paun, and Peternell: that the effective cone is dual to the cone of movable curves. So, this was proved over the complex numbers, but as Fuji and Lehman point out, this is true in arbitrary characteristic. And then the other property that is preserved by rational contraction is the property of being a Moradrim space. So, this is something, it's a property of It's a property of having the minimal model program working in an ideal fashion, in a combinatorial way, essentially. In particular, this will imply that the effective cone is polyhedral, that it will also imply that the NEV cone is polyhedral and it's generated by base point-free divisors. Excuse me again. Yes, sorry for interrupting. Are you assuming that a rational contraction? Are you assuming that a rational contraction is birational? No, no, not at all. No, not at all. So I could always take y to be a point, and then any map is a subjective morphism between q factorials. Correct. Correct. Except the point is not interesting from, yeah. So, I mean, we're going to prove things like X has a Russian contraction into Y and Y has no, no, has a polyhedral, has a non-polyhedral effective cone. And therefore, okay, thanks. Okay, thanks. So, that in particular is a statement about like all Q factorial varieties X, but you say that that statement is not interesting. Oh, yes, that's right. Okay, thanks. Sorry. Yes, no, no, no, thanks. Thank you. Indeed, that's what we are trying to do, right? So, I mean, I said this is an application about a result about surfaces. So, M0M bar is not a surface. So, I'm going to eventually look at the rational contraction from M0M bar into a Contraction from M0M bar into a surface. Thank you for the question. Okay, um, so again, this is what I was mentioning before, there is this philosophy that the stratification of M0M-bar is similar to the stratification of toric varieties. So, the more precise statement is the following: that M0MBR is actually similar to the blow-up of a toric variety at one point. Variety at one point. So, in the following sense, there is one specific Tauric variety. So, this is a result that Jenia Telev from a while ago: that there is one specific Tauric variety, which is also a moduli space, the so-called loss and money moduli space, such that when you blow up the identity point of the open torus, then M0n bar is squeezed between two rational contractions. So, here I'm taking the Loss Emanion space of the same dimension at M0N, blown up at one point. At M0N blown up at one point, and this is just a blow-up map. It's a this is a part is a fairly simple. The more involved part is to prove that there is a, if you take the same space but in one dimension higher, then there is a rational contraction from that into m0 and bar. So the content of the theorem is essentially in this part. And there are different ways to describe this loss of money mobile space. One way is, again, very concretely, you Very concretely, you start with the projective space and you start blowing up. It's the same description as before, except with just one last point. So you have n minus two points in Pn minus three. So you can choose this to be the total invariant points. And then you blow up all the lines spanned by any two of the points, all the planes spanned by any three, and so on. So it's a toric, you're blowing up at every step Taurus invariant. Invariant strata sub-varieties. Okay, and another way, this is actually a particular case of Hasset moduli space of stable rational curves. So Hassett introduced a version of M0M bar where you, instead of requiring that the log canonical bundle is ample, you throw in some weights at the points, some rational numbers between zero and one. So, for example, here these numbers can be two of them are one and the other ones. They are one, and the other ones have some very arbitrarily small weight, epsilon. And so, and you, this also is a fine moduli space for this moduli problem. The points in this case may coincide, but it just changes what you're adding in the boundary of the configuration space. So, for example, for the loss of mining space, you will allow only chains of projective lines with two points with weight one at the ends. One at the ends, and HP1 should have again at least three points, and the other points are allowed to coincide. So, and then you have a process of semi-stable reduction from a family of stable rational curves in the usual sense to control, you have to contract the components that become unstable. And so, okay, so the maps that this blowdown map that you saw before is. This blowdown app that you saw before has a model I mean in this way. Okay. And so from this point of view of rational contractions, the Loss-Manny space is, if you want, is the universal toric variety in the sense that if you start with any other projective Q factorial toric variety, there will always be an N sufficient. There will always be an n sufficiently large such that there is a rational contraction from a loss and money in space of dimension n minus 3 into x, toric. So all the maps we compose are toric maps. And then similarly, there is a rational contraction from the corresponding blow-ups at the identity point. Okay, and so this. Okay, and so this observation was used again before with Jeanette Tevalev to prove that N0M bar is not a modern space in characteristic zero when n is sufficiently large. The reason is that you have a rational contraction to the blow-up of a toric surface, so a weighted projective plane with weights A, B, and C, chosen such that this blown-up toric surface has This blown aptoric surface has an F but not semi-ample divisor. So, this is a construction that was done by Goto Nishida and Watanabe. So, in this case, you have a surface of Picard number two. The weights are chosen such that you have two negative curves. So, there is one obvious one, the exceptional divisor at the point you blow up, but there is another negative curve. So, for such a surface to be a Mori-green surface, this just means that you should be able to control. This just means that you should be able to contract each curve individually by amorphism. And so that can be done in a characteristic P due to Artin's contractability criterion because this surface is defined over the algebraic closure of a finite field. So you can do that in characteristic P, you can contract just one curve, but not the other, but it cannot be done in characteristic zero for in this particular. For in this particular situation. Okay, so but this is a surface of Picard number two. So yeah, so it is not a Moridrim surface, but it does have a polyhedral effective cone. And this, so it's a very subtle phenomenon. So the effective cone is much rougher invariant than being a more dream space. Okay, so for the so now so the main So now, the main theorem is that you can actually find projective toric surfaces given by what we call a good polygon, such that the effective cone of the blown up toric surface, so you blow up again the identity point of the open torus, then this is not polyhedral in characteristic zero. And then sometimes for some of these surfaces, this is also not polyhedral in characteristic p for an infinite set of primes p. For an infinite set of primes P of positive density. And so then you obtain also the characteristic P version of the theorem you saw before. Okay, so I have to explain what is a good polygon. This is an example, which I will explain. But this is the example that gives you the result, the bound n equals 10. And the reason is that you can construct. And the reason is that you can construct a rational contraction from M010 bar. Yes, you have this blowdown map to the loss of money space at dimension 7, blown up at the identity point. And you can construct the rational contraction to the blow up of the toric surface associated to this polygon you saw before. So the red dots here give you the rays of the normal fan of that polygon. And then so And then, so to obtain this rational contraction, you start with the rays of the loss and money in space, and then you choose a way to project, to set some of these rays equal to zero, so that you arrive in the plane at the images of the rays of the normal fan of the fan of the Los Emani space are the black dots here, and they contain the red dots. And they contain the red dots. And so, this is this fact is the one that allows you to decompose this rational map. Yeah, this will be a rational map between these blow-ups of toric varieties, but it's not clear a priori that this is a rational contraction, the way I define it. Okay. And yeah, so this is the reason that this is why the loss and money space works is that it. Is that it yet as a universal toric variety? Uh, is because it's uh its fan is very symmetric, and so it when you project, even if you project in a less careful way, you still can cover a large area. Uh, yes, and uh and yeah, you can yeah, okay. Um, okay, so I need to explain what the good polygon is and um. Wood polygon is. And so this will correspond to what something we call an elliptic pair. And so this will be a, here's the definition. It will consist of a surface, X, which is a projective rational surface with low-terminal singularities, and the curve of arithmetic genus 1. So typically, this would be a smooth elliptic curve, and with soft intersection zero. And we also want that this. And we also want that this curve is disjoint from the singularities of x. So for us, this x, the surface, will be the blow-up of the toric surface, of a certain toric surface at the identity point. So the examples will be typically singular. And so I want to point out that then, so by a junction, then k times c is also zero. And so we're going to look at the orthogonal complement of C in the divisor class group of X. So this will contain the curve C, because C squared is equal to zero. And they're going to look at the restriction map from the orthogonal complement of C to the group of line bundles on C of degree zero. So D, yes, if I take, because C is contained in the smooth locus of the surface, I get a line. Smooth locus of the surface, I get a line bundle degree zero on the curve if I take a divisor that intersects C0. And so I call the order of the elliptic layer the order of the restriction of C to itself. And so there are two possibilities for this order. Yes, the order can be finite or infinite. You can characterize the order as the smallest integer. Order as the smallest integer e such that e times c has a space of section which is at least two-dimensional. And you can prove that, yeah, so if the order is finite, then this space of sections is actually has dimension two. And if now note that if you have, if x and z are defined over a finite field, then the order will always be finite. Okay. Okay, and so again, summing up: if you have a elliptic pair has a finite order, then you get a map to P1, an elliptic fibration with C as a multiple fiber. And if the order is infinite, then the curve C is rigid, so no multiple of it will have other sections. And so, in this case, it is an easy argument to see that the effective cone cannot be polyhedral. Effective colon cannot be polyhedral if the Picard number is at least three. So, this is an argument that goes back to Nicolin. And it's the following observation: that if you consider the light cone of curves with positive self-intersection, then by Riemann-Roch, a multiple of this will be effective. So this is a, so all these curves with positive self-intersection are contained in the effective cone. And if the PCR number is at least three, then this light cone is a. These three, then this light cone is a round cone. And so, if the effective cone is polyhedral, the only way you can contain a round cone in a polyhedral cone is every irreducible curve without intersection zero will have to be contained in the interior of a facet. So you'll have the curve will lie on a face, but you can write it in another way as a sum of other curves, which are negative curves. So, yeah, so this. So, yeah, so this situation here cannot happen that you have a rigid curve with self-intersection zero. So, it you know, it's an easy non-polyadrality criterion if you have this rigid curve with self-intersection zero. And so for us now, going back to what are good polygons, so we start with the lattice polygon in the plane. So, we fix a lattice and we choose a polygon whose vertices are among the points. Vortices are among the points in the lattice. So, this will correspond to a projective toric surface with which comes with the polarization. And then I'm going to look at our X, our surface will be the blow-up of this toric surface at the identity point. Note that this is defined over Z. Okay, and I'm going to fix M an integer, which will help me construct the curve, the elliptic curve C. And so then a lattice polygon. The lattice polygon with at least four vertices is going to be called good if I can find a curve C in the linear system of this ample line bundle with multiplicity M at the point I blew up. So I want to find my elliptic curve, which gives me an elliptic pair with infinite order. The condition on the vertices is just so that the Picard number is at least three. And yeah, so this is now a concrete question. What exactly does this mean? The question: What exactly does this mean on the polygon to have this elliptic pair if I choose this curve in this way? So it comes down to this kind of concrete conditions. So if you impose, for example, that the Newton polygon of C, so the sections of this ample line bundle, the space of section has a basis given by monomials corresponding to the lattice points containing side. points contained inside delta. So yeah, so the equation of C will be such an expression. And so I can consider the Newton polygon of this equation. So if this coincides with delta, then this will imply in fact that the curve does not pass through the torus invariant points. And those are the only points where my surface can be singular. So this curve will be contained in a smooth locus. And then the fact that the curve has self-intersection zero and it's an elliptic curve comes down to Curve comes down to a condition about the volume. So, this is twice the area of the polygon being equal to this multiplicity m at the identity point square, and then having exactly m lattice points on the boundary. And then this last condition is the trickier to check. So, I'll give an example. So, here is a polygon with area. Polygon with area 18 and then there are six lattice points. Notice that each edge has a lattice length one. And then this is now a magma computation that the linear system corresponding to this ample polarization contains a unique curve with a multiplicity six at the identity point. It has this. At the identity point, it has this equation, and in red, you have the terms that correspond to the vertices of this polygon. So the claim is that the Newton polygon of this curve is exactly, we're covering exactly this polygon. Okay, so and then you can this curve is in fact a smooth, so once you blow. Is in fact a smooth so once you blow up the identity point, this is a smooth elliptic curve on our blown-up surface, and it has a minimal equation, Varshas equation, given by this formula. So this is again, it's a magma calculation to obtain this. And then the Mordelwell group has two generators given by these points. So we are taking as identity the point at infinity, and then Infinity and then now a calculation. You know, you have to compute what is the class of our curve on this blown-up toric surface and what is its restriction to C, and then translate it, what point do you get in this model? And so you obtain that this is a minus one of these generators. So this is not trivial, so it's not a torsion point. So this is a good polygon. Point. So, this is a good polygon according to our definition. And so, yeah, so we found a good polygon. That means you will get examples in characteristic zero, but as we said, the Nicooling criterion works only when the order is infinite. So, what to do, for example, if you're interested in positive characteristic or just in general, even in characteristic zero, you can ask what happens if you have an elliptic pair of finite order, what can you say? Finite order, what can you say about the effective comb and so here you need you need an extra layer of properties for our elliptic pairs. So it turns out you cannot decide, maybe, I mean, you cannot decide the polyadrality of the effective cone directly on your elliptic pair, but you have to simplify it by making it minimal. So I'm going to call an elliptic pair to be minimal if there are. pair to be minimal if there are no rational curves that intersect C in zero and intersect K negatively. And so this condition is equivalent. It can be formulated in different ways. So it can be formulated as K plus C being NF. So it turns out in this, in our situation for a rational surface with lock-term singularities, K plus C will always be an effective divisor to have exactly one. Divisor to have exactly one section. This intersects C in zero. So, this condition I claim is equivalent to K plus C being nef. And then you can also argue using the Hodge index theorem that K has to be actually a multiple of C, a negative multiple of C. And that's also equivalent to K squared being zero. And so you're entering into a realm where the anti-canonical becomes effective. And so there is more known about this case. Is more known about this case. So, so now, yeah, so we can, any elliptic pair can be reduced to a minimal elliptic pair by just making k plus c n f. So, there is a morphism which will not touch c but it will contract the curves on which k plus c is negative. So the order of the elliptic pair will be preserved and you get. And you get in the end an elliptic minimal elliptic pair. So this is this. Okay, so this is a consequence of results of Tanaka and Fugino. And so then the, so I'll give a criterion for polyhedrality of the effective cone of this minimal elliptic pair that we associate to X. So this will be in terms of, again, the restriction map. Of again, the restriction map, the one that takes a divisor that's intersects C in zero and you restrict it to C. So instead, you're looking at this quotient group of C per by the subgroup generated by K and the induced restriction map called as the reduced restriction map. And then so when you have now an elliptic, so a general statement is that whenever you have an elliptic pair with some extra condition that y has also. Condition that y has also Duval singularities. When you take the minimal resolution of Y, then the pair CY is minimal if and only if the pair CZ, minimal resolution is minimal. And this is equivalent to the P car number of this Z being 10. In fact, Z will be an iterated blow-up of P2 at nine possibly infinitely near points. So in this case, this quotient group. Quotient group, yes, is if you consider with the intersection pairing coming from X, this will give you the lattice E8. I mean, it's no surprise, it's blocked of P2 at nine points. And then here is the criterion of polyhedrality. So if you have now a minimal elliptic pair of finite order, then polyadrality of the effective cone of y is equivalent to the polyhedrality of the effective cone of its minimal resolution. Its minimal resolution. We still assume y has Duval singularities. And this is equivalent now to checking among the 240 roots of E8, can you find eight that are linearly independent and contained in the kernel of this reduced restriction map? And this is a polyadrality criterion. Okay, and so here is the upshot. So if you start with an elliptic pair, then you can Elliptic pair, then you can consider its minimal model. If the order was infinite to start with, you have non-polyedrality as long as the picarma is at least three. In this case, it also turns out that y has to be, in fact, with Dival singularities. And now, if the order is finite and if you have that y has Duval singularities, then you get this polyedrality criteria. So what we can do is start with our... With our, yes, we will start with our good polygon, which will be in this situation in characteristic zero or infinite order. And then if you reduce coefficients, modulo p, you will end up in the second situation. And so this is what you're doing. Yes, if you have a c and x defined over z, infinite order, you look at the minimal model, you can extend this. model you can extend this yes over over spec z perhaps outside some some some primes and so you're contracting the same curves yes and then you still have that the reduction modulo p of y is the minimolality pair associated to the reduction of x and now you want to study when is the effective cone of of y the reduction modulo p of y polyhedral or Polyhedral, uh, or not. So, if it's not polyhedral, you have the same results for x. Um, and so here I'm just gonna run quickly through an example. So, if you so let's say you start with this kind of elliptic pair obtained from a blow-up of a projective toric surface at the identity point, um, so in this is actually in the example I uh I showed you before, this uh volume 36. This volume 36 polygon. In this case, the K plus C, yes, as I said, has only one section. And in fact, it's a risky decomposition has a trivial positive part and the negative part coming from two curves. And so to get the minimal elliptic pair, you have to contract these two curves. So this is the map from X to Y. You end up with something of, so X had become was a six gone, a hexagon, yes. A six gone hexagon, yeah. So this has um, yeah. So the X has a Picard number five, the contract two curves, this is Picard number three. The minimal resolution, as I said, in this case, this will have Dival singularities, so its minimal resolution will be a Picard number 10. Another way to arrive at this minimal resolution is to just take the minimal resolution of our projected toric surface and blow up the identity and then run the And then run the make k plus c nef here when you arrive at z. So, this is what I draw here. I also have here the fan in bold is the fan of our toric original toric surface. I added some rays to get its minimal resolution. Then, in this example, the two curves, C1 and C2, are some proper transform of one-parameter subgroups, and they relate to the extra post-invariant divide. Extra post-invariant devices I introduced as in this picture. So you can start doing here this contract the minus one curves that are perpendicular to that intersect C in zero. And so yeah, so then I will call T the lattice spent by minus two curves about the singularities of Y. These will always be contained in the kernel of our reduced restriction. In the kernel of our reduced restriction map. And so, in a way, our criterion of polyhedrality says that I need to find many minus two curves there for the cone to be polyhedral. And so, here you already have some minus two curves coming from this lattice T. And the question is, do I find enough outside of T? So, in this example, these are some computations which were implemented into Magma. Magma. So you can run this on different examples. So in this case, the lattice T is A7. You can compute the images of all the roots of E8, modulo A7, and you see that there are always multiples, these multiples, so one, two, or three of the generator of this quotient. You can choose a generator here that, and then you. And then you can compute its restriction to the curve. So, for one choice, I obtain here that this is the difference between the two generator of the Mordel-Vel group. And so, then the condition of polyadrality, once you reduce coefficients modulo P, it becomes this condition here. So, I want that the multiples one, two, or three of the reduction modulo p of one, the point p, this one, uh, does not. This one does not belong to the subgroup generated by the reduction modulo P of the other point Q. And sorry, and so then this is the statement you prove that there is the set of primes for which these multiples do not belong to this subgroup generated by the reduction model P of Q, that this set has positive density. And to check this, you can fix another prime. This, you can fix another prime q, and then it suffices to check that the set of primes for which this other prime q divides the index of the subgroup unit by q in the group of p points of c and at the same time q does not divide the index of six times the reduction p of this subgroup. Yes, so that this has positive density, and now this condition. Positive density. And now, this condition that a prime divides the index of a subcognitive by a point, this is can be expressed. This is the theorem of Lang and Trotter. You can express this in terms of a Frobenius element, the Frobenius element of P with respect to a certain Galois extension of Q given by the Q torsion points on the curve. And then, okay, also the point Q. The point Q. And then it's a Chabotare's density theorem that gives you this must have positive density once you express this more concretely. And so I think I'll stop here. My time is up. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. So, is there any questions? Yeah, I had a question actually. So, a little ways back when you were talking about New Coulin's criterion for non-polyhedrality, so that the light cone has to be inside this polyhedral cone, and the only way this happens, et cetera. It strikes me that that's also an obstruction to not being locally polyhedral as a cone as well. Can you say anything about that and how? Say anything about that and how that's connected? I agree, I agree with you. But this kind of suggests that the, but well, let's be careful. So, for example, the blob of 22 at nine points, yes, if the points are general, then you do have if you take the let's say the unique curve that contains the nine points, so that's the generic case, this will have a generic case this will have uh i mean the anti this is the anti-canonical uh so this will have uh uh self-intersection zero but the cone is not is not around at this point so it's a what is an accumulate it's an accumulation point right so it's yeah i'm not sure i can say more than that but i it does suggest that uh you should you should be able to say more about these points yes that they are perhaps not locally not even locally political Thanks. I have a question. Are you able to say anything about the subcones, like the closure of the cone defined by rational curves? The cone defined by rational curves, as you mean, so the Mori cone, so that's the same as the effective cone if you're on a surface, yes? I mean on the blow-up. Oh, but still a surface, yes? In the surface case, you mean, or on any in the surface case, yes. So if we take a toric surface and blow up a general point, you know, we have lots of rational curves. Do you know anything about the sub cone of the, say, the effective cone of curves that's defined by these rational curves? I don't know, but I mean, this the elliptic curve that you see here that appears, yes. So that will. So that will be a rigid curve. So, yes, it's in it's in. Yeah, you mean so? Maybe the other curves form a nicer cone, you're saying. Yeah, I was just wondering if they're dense, for example. I mean, it seems like on this ray, maybe you even know that you don't get any rational curves, but you know, in the example you mentioned, you blow up of nine general points, then you do have these rational curves sort of. Then you do have these rational curves sort of converging towards it. So the closure would be the whole thing again. And I was just wondering if you ever do get like this round behavior where you actually don't see rational curves in a neighborhood. I don't know that yet. No. Okay. All right. Is there any question? Okay, then let's just speak again. And then, so today's session is over. So I'll share your. Is over. So obviously over, but Gala time is still open. So if you'd like to chat with your colleagues, then you can log into the Galaxy. Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much.
