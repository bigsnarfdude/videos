Sorry, I was asleep at the wheel. I flicked it on. So okay, we're now building there. My apologies. Okay, great. No worries. So yeah, this is joint with Dimitri and Wendy, and it's all in progress. So yeah, it's not finished yet, but hopefully you'll see some interesting things. So what I want to talk to you about today, first I want to tell you about some Kerr multi-thories from. First, I want to tell you about some cohomology theories for rings and vaguely what that should have to do with deformation theory. And then I'll tell you about sort of how to define topological host or cohomology for sort of some auxiliary objects I'm interested in. And that'll allow me to give you a definition for schemes and sort of various machinery we're going to build here will help us actually do some computations. And I'm going to show you some computations for small. Show you some computations for small projective spaces, and these are really going to be very easy given the sort of general machinery we have. Okay, so let's get going. So, if I start with just any commutative base ring k and I have any k algebra a, well what can I do? I can take the enveloping algebra, which is I just take a, I tensor up with its opposite algebra over k. Modules over this thing are exactly a bimodules. And of course, the Hofshug cohomology of A. The Hofshuk cohomology of A is this thing, it's the x over this algebra, enveloping algebra, from A to itself. Another way to put it is it's the x from A to itself in the category of A bin modules. Okay, we all know this story very well. Another thing I can do, I mean, if A isn't flat over K, what I can do is I can take the derived enveloping algebra instead. So this isn't a ring anymore. This isn't a ring anymore, it's a DGA, it's a DGA up to quasi-isomorphism because it's a derived tensor product. But I can still take X of modules over it, that still makes sense. And the analog is this thing called Schukler cohomology. So you can think of Schukler cohomology as like a derived version of Haushok cohomology. Okay, so what why am I personally interested in this sort of thing? Sort of the links. Interesting in this sort of thing, sort of the links with deformation theory. So, the second Hofschild cohomology space of my algebra A is in bijection with the split square zero extensions of A because it's in bijection up to isomorphism. So, what do I mean? Well, a square zero extension of A is the same thing as first. Sorry, I don't mean square zero extension, I mean first order defamation. That's stupid. So, it's in bijection with the split first order deformations of A. Sorry about that. But what's the first order definition of A? Well, it's a k epsilon mod epsilon squared algebra. square algebra a tilde such that when I reduce this thing mod epsilon I get I get a and this is basically the same thing as a square zero extension but I'd rather think about it this way and what the word split is doing here is it means my my canonical suggestion should should admit some k-linear splitting so it's it's not going to be a ring map but it will be a map of k-motions and I mean of course if a is a field uh any such map is going to Field, any such map is going to admit a k-linear splitting. And so when my base ring is a field, this second Hausschuko-Molten group really is telling me about all of the k-linear first-order deformations of my ring name. Okay, I mean, this is a story that we know already. There's a similar story for shukla cohomology. Basically, you can remove the split. Remove the split. I'm not primarily going to be interested in shiplocoemology today, so I haven't bothered to write it down. Yeah, but shiplocho-emology also has an interpretation as classifying general first-order deformations. So what's the sort of motivation between the stuff behind the stuff I want to tell you about? The motivation is we would like to come up with a similar story for abelian categories. Story for abelian categories. So here's a definition. This is due to Wendy Lowen, I think. So if A is an abelian category, I can define something that I'm going to call its abelian Hossield cohomology. So what is this thing going to be? It's going to be the Hossield cohomology of some auxiliary Z linear category. And I mean, you know how to take Hosshield cohomology of Z linear categories, right? Z linear categories, right? Z linear categories are certain types of DG categories. They're very special types of DG categories. And I know how to take the Holstril cohomology of a DG category. I can do it with the Bar complex, for example. And what is my auxiliary Z-linear category that I'm going to stick in here? It's going to be the injectives in the ind completion of A. So just to expand this a little bit, the IND completion of A, this is the category of formal filtered co-limits. Normal filtered co-limits in A. It's equivalent to sort of left-exact modules. This is an abelian category where I basically do everything level-wise. So I can take the injectives in this abelian category here. And I mean, of course, the categories of injectives aren't abelian. Kernels and co-kernels fail to be nice. But it's still a perfectly good Z linear category. And I mean, you can think of Z linear categories as rings with many objects, right? That's the sort of Right, that's the sort of uh the sort of intuition we want to use for a beaming category. Okay, I mean, maybe just one thought on why you might think to do this or why this is useful. This will come back later. It is true that if I have a reasonable enough scheme X, then the Hausschuk homology of X is the same thing as the Hausschuk. The Hossiel, the abelian Hossiel chromology of the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on X. So this is sort of a strange definition, perhaps when you first see it, but it makes this work. So this is sort of a good definition for geometric purposes. Okay, and well, the problem, of course, is that if I want to work Want to work over Z. Sorry. Matt, is there a reason you had QCo instead of Co on that last page? Not really. I can use either. If my scheme is QCQS and Ethereum, I can use Co. If my scheme is just QCQS, I can use QCO. So if I'm Ethereum, I can use Co instead. That's perfectly fine. But yeah, the problem being, you know, as we might expect, if things aren't linear over a field, this abelian Hoshock homology isn't quite the right thing to use. So here's a very basic example, but it's one that sort of we still don't really understand completely. Modules over Z mod P squared, you want to view this abelian category as some sort of first order defamation of the abelian category of modules over Z mod P. And of course, And of course, there's no linearity over a field here, right? This guy is not an algebra to this guy. And again, the sort of the non-linearity is, you know, there are more interesting things going on between modules as well. Even if you could base change up in some sense, that's somehow not a very interesting definition. So the loose intuition that I'm trying to give you from this. That I'm trying to give you from this is that we want some sort of co-homology theory that incorporates some sort of non-additive features. That's the sort of thing we're interested in. And then hopefully we could apply this to a B in categories and we'll get the sort of results that we like, that we want. We have for algebra in red. So what's the answer? What is this non-additive additive co-multi-theory going to be? This is something called This is something called MacLean Cohemology. So let me briefly explain to you what Maclane cohomology is. So it's a functor cohomology group, if you're familiar with that. So the Machlane cohomology of a ring A is going to be the X algebra from A to itself in some sort of category. In some sort of category. Now, for the usual Hossfield chromology, this would be the category of biomodules. And if you want some sort of non-additive Hossfield chromology, well, obviously the right thing to use is the category of non-additive biomodules. And I mean, what precisely is this category of non-additive biomodules? It's a functor category. So I look at functors from the category of free finitely generated A modules. Be generated A modules to all A modules. So this is, sorry, this guy is what I'm calling the category of non-commutative A bimodules. Sorry, non-additive A-bimodules. And well, I mean, why do I call them non-additive bimodules? So there is an embedding of A-bimodules into this category. Just simply, if I have an A-bimodule M, I can look at the functor given by tensoring with M. And this. Tensoring with M. And this really, of course, is a functor like this because M was a bimodal to begin with. And these are additive in the sense that, of course, this is an additive category. And if I add two bimodules together, it's the same as adding these functors together. But of course, there are many more interesting non-ilative bimodules. There are various sort of polynomial functors, for example, you might be interested in. So, you know, the symmetric square is a perfectly good functor. Square is a perfectly good functor, but that is not a bimodal, for example. Okay, so yeah, some sort of functor co-module. The precise definition actually is not going to be too important for us, but the point is there's some non-additive features. Okay, and yeah, so the eventual goal of what we're doing is to try to get some sort of good deformation theory of abelian categories. Of course, we would like to get theorems like the second Mapplenko homology of an abelian category. Second Maplan cohomology of the Nabelian category is in bijection with the first order deformations of it. Good. So, what I actually want to do today is, I mean, this definition of map lane cohomology is no good for my uses, really. It doesn't extend well to categories like that. Essentially, because functic homology is very badly suited for sort of differential graded objects. The theory doesn't really work very well. So I want to use a different approach to MACLAN coherence, and I want to use the topological approach. So I'll tell you what that is now. So yeah, the very basic idea behind this is that you can and you should do algebra with ring spectra. I mean, this is an idea that's been around for a while now. I mean, what's the spectrum? I'm sure you all know this. I mean, what's a spectrum? I'm sure you all know this, but a spectrum is nothing more than a sequence of topological spaces with some structure maps from the suspension of one to the next. And you can try, I mean, spaces have a smash product, right? You could try to extend this smash product to these sequential spectra. It doesn't work very well. It's not monoidal. And if it is monoidal, it doesn't have the properties you'd like it to happen. But sort of a lot of people in the 90s decided. Sort of a lot of people in the 90s discovered that, well, you can put a little bit of extra structure on your spectra, you know, get these things called highly structured spectra, where you do have a monoidal smash product. So, for example, you've probably heard of things like symmetric spectra, which is where you equip each space with an action by a symmetric group, and these are equivariant in some sense. Orthogonal spectra, where the same thing, but with the orthogonal group. These things called S-modules, there are various approaches. There are various approaches, especially if you want to use just connective spectra, it gets abilities. But the point is, you know, there are categories of spectra with monoidal smash products. And now as soon as you have a monoidal category, well, what can you do? You can talk about monoid objects in it. And the monoids in this monoidal category you'd like to think of as some sort of rings, and you'd like to try and do some sort of geometry. And this is, I mean, Sort of geometry with them, and this is I mean, really, what spectral algebraic geometry is. So, a ring spectra is nothing more than a monoid in this monologue category of spectrum. So, let me give you a couple of examples. So, this blackboard bold S here, this is the sphere spectrum, which just has a copy of the M sphere at level M, level N, sorry. It's the unit for the SMASH product, which is reasonable enough. Which is reasonable enough. I mean, smashing with S1 is the suspension. It's commutative, meaning that the multiplication is equivariant for the flip map. And S is the initial ring spectrum, again, essentially because it's the unit of the smashed product. The other example of ring spectra we'll want to know are just usual rings. So if A is a ring, well, if A is an abelian group for a star, A is an abelian group for a start. You'll recall that you can cook up a topological space, HA, the Eilenberg McLean space, which lives in a certain degree N. As N varies, these guys all fit together into a spectrum. This guy's the Eilenberg-Maclean spectrum. And of course, if A is in addition to the ring, then this spectrum HA and This spectrum HA inherits inherits the ring structure and does become a ring spectrum. And it's, you know, it's commutative as A was, for example. So being a ring spectrum, it receives a map from the initial ring spectrum. So there's always a unique map from S to any ring. So sort of usual algebra of rings and modules embeds in some sense into the world of spectral algebra, of ring spectra, and module spectra. Module spec. Yeah, so once you have a ring, you can talk about modules over it. You can talk about homological algebra, you can talk about Tor and X. And so, you know, once you have all these ingredients, you can decide what Hausshaw cohomology should be. So if I have just a discrete ring A, what is its topological Hossual cohomology going to be? Well, it's going to be what you think it is. Sorry. So it's an X algebra. Algebra over some sort of enveloping algebra. What I do is I take A, I don't tensor over Z, I tensor over the sphere spectrum with its opposite, and I look at the X over this from A to A. So again, this is an X inner category of bimodules. And T here is for topological because we have the sphere spectrum down there. There's a similar definition for topological Hoshi otomology, of course, it's a Tor as opposed to an X. Tor as opposed to the next. So here's the first big example. So for finite, for prime fields, this is in Footstep, and then for all finite fields, it's extended by Frankie, Langs, and Schwartz. K is any finite field. Its topological Haushok cohomology is just a polynomial ring. And it's a polynomial ring on a single element of degree 2. So this is, if you've heard about bookstep periodicity, this is exactly what that is. There's some degree two periodicity here. There's some degree two periodicity here. Okay, great. So, this is, you know, this is already not a very easy computation to do. Computing THH is hard. Here's another example. Here is an example when it's easy. So if A is an algebra over the rational numbers, so an algebra over any field with characteristic zero, its topological Hussriottology is just going to agree with its usual Hushiotomology and compute it over Q. Essentially, why is this? Well, it's essentially because if I take the rational numbers and I tensor themselves over S, I just get a copy of the rations back. If you like to think topologically, this is sort of the rational steenrod algebra, and it's telling you that there aren't many rational kinemology operations. But yeah, in characteristic zero, really, this is not interesting at all. So basically, everything I'm going to talk about is only in characteristic P. That is only in characteristic p. And this last example I want to give you is if I have an algebra over a field, there's some sort of spectral sequence. So I take the topological Hausschoko homology of my field, tensor toward the Hossiel cohomology over my field of my algebra, and it converges to the topological Hausschokology of my algebra. So the way I like to think about this is that this is a sort of arithmetic piece. That this is a sort of arithmetic piece because in characteristic zero, this isn't interesting, but in positive characteristics, something interesting happens. And this is a sort of geometric piece because everything's linear over a field and half-field ophthalmology is telling you something geometric. And these two combine to give you the whole thing. This is the E2 pig. Okay, so what does this have to do with backplane homology, right? I haven't told you anything about that yet. I haven't told you anything about that yet. Well, of course, it's a theorem from the past, Pierre-Chillium-Maltaisen from 1990, that Mach lane homology is the same thing as topological Hoffshield homology, where the input is a real. And well, it is also true, I'll say a little bit about the provenance of this here in a second, it is also true that MAPLAN cohomology is the same thing as topological Hoffshield cohomology. Shield co-aimolish. So let me say that this, to my knowledge, doesn't appear in the literature anywhere. The key ingredient is a very result that actually came out on the archive yesterday of Geoffroy Harel and Maxim Ramsey. Once you use their results, it's straightforward to get this, but even this doesn't appear in their paper, for example. So this doesn't appear in the literature, but if you're an expert and you read this paper, If you're an expert and you read this paper, you will be able to deduce this. So I don't want to claim it's my theorem because it's not. It's a folklore sort of theorem, I guess. Okay, great. So what we're going to do is instead of studying back lane cohomology, we're going to study topological Hoffshield cohomology because it has nicer formal properties. We can apply it not just to rings, but to DGAs, even to DG categories. Uh, even to DG categories, which is what I'm going to tell you about now. Um, so before I do that, are there any questions on the stuff I've just said? No, okay, I think we're good. Um, yeah, sorry, I have a question. So you also have this derived, I've got what you call it, chukla cohomology, this derived hotology. Yeah, the chuklicohomology, yeah, yeah, yeah. And is it the same? It's not. So one not so uh one slightly confusing thing uh maybe i'll put the new page here one slightly confusing thing is that um shookla2 is the same thing as map lane2 um so you'll recall that when i sort of vaguely intimated what triplico emulgy was earlier i was telling you that it was uh all not necessarily split deformations well it you know by using mappling i don't get anything new You know, by using MACLAN, I don't get anything new, but the difference you see differences higher up. So, there's a comparison map from, let me have a think, which way does it go? Bar construction goes topological to discrete. So, if you dealize, it's going to go discrete to topological. So, there's a comparison map which goes from Shuckler to Mac Lane. It's an isomorphism in low degrees, it's an isomorphism in degrees north through. It's nice to have some degrees naught through two, but in degrees three and above, it may fail to be an isomorphism. It's easier to see this on cohology, where the MacLane on homology, sorry, the MacLane homology of a field is a polynomial algebra, the Schuckler homology of a finite field is a divided power algebra. So they really do differ, but they are the same in low degrees. And the difference is, of course, in higher degrees where you're seeing these derived definition. In higher degrees, where you're seeing these derived deformations, or you know, more classically, where you're seeing these obstruction spaces, things are going to differ. And this guy really is the correct thing to use. But yeah, if you're just interested in spaces of first-order deformations, you can just use Schukler kernel models. So, yeah, the difference is a little subtle. Does that answer your question? Great, thank you. Okay, so let me tell you. So let me tell you, let me quickly tell you the story of how this works for enriched categories. And by enriched, I mean DG or spectral. So what's a spectral category? Well, it's just going to be a category enriched in the monoidal category of spectra. Fine. A spectrum is the same thing as an S module, right? Again, because a sphere spectrum is the units. So every spectrum has an action by the sphere spectrum. And this is an equivalence of voloidal calculus. So more generally, I can enrich over modules. Generally, I can enrich over modules over my favorite ring spectrum. And I'll be doing that in a minute. But a spectral category is just the cash enrichment spectrum. The cash group spectra itself is a spectral category. So not only does it have a tensor product, it has an internal hom. And this gives you an enrichment. So this is the kind of thing you think it is. And I mean, the analogy is, of course, that a spectral category is to a A spectral category is to a ring spectrum as a DG category is to a differential graded algebra. So you should think of a spectral category as like a many object ring spectrum, just in the way that you can think of a DG category as a many object differential graded algebra. Cool. And exactly as for DG world, you can talk about what it means to be a modular spectral category. A module over a spectral category. You can do homological algebra with modules over spectral categories. And sort of exactly in the way that we're now familiar with, you can define the topological Hochschuk cohomology of C to be the space of derived homes over the derived enveloping category of C. So this means, sorry, this means I take C, I, well, I yeah, let's ignore that maybe. All my smash products are going to be implicitly derived. I take C, I smash it over S with its opposite category. And I look at the maps from C to C. So this is, again, this is the kind of thing you expect it to be, right? Now, this is a spectrum. So exactly like a DG category has a Hoch-Shield coaching complex, a spectral category has a THH spectrum. A THH spectrum. And something that's going to be important later is that there is a bar construction you can use to compute things. So, again, just like for DG categories, they have a bar construction. In the spectral world, there's a bar construction too. Okay, good. So how do I apply this to DG categories? Well, it's the theorem of Taboada. There's a chain of coherent equivalences from DG categories over Z to HZ module spectrally enriched categories. So these are just categories. So these are just categories enriched over the monoidal category of HZ modules with the tensor product. And actually, so this category here, this is again equivalent to just the category of chain complexes of abelian groups. And this results. And this result for the one object, in the one object story, this is a result of shipload from the early 2000s. This is from 2008, 2009, or something. Okay, so the point is, there's a version of the Eidenberg McClain functor for DK categories that allows you to turn a DK category into a certain type of spectral category. So now what can we do? Well, there's a unique ring map from the sphere spectrum to Z. So this gives me a restriction. So, this gives me a restriction of scales map. So, in less fancy language, I take an HZ linear category, I forget the HZ action, and I just get a plain spectral category. So, what can I do now? If I start with the DG category C, well, what's its topological Haushohomology going to be? I take C, I send it through H, I obtain an HZ linear spectral category. I forget the HZ action to get a spectral category, and I take its THH. Okay, very good. Okay, very good. And just, of course, if A is a ring, rings are very special types of DG categories. And if I feed a ring into this formalism, I get the same thing as I defined for rings just a minute ago. Okay, so the definitions do match up, so that's good. Okay, so now I've got that sort of stuff out of the way. I can actually tell you. Can actually tell you how things work for schemes. So it's going to be with essentially what you do: you take all the results from the usual Hofffield world and you put T in front of them all. So the topological, so if A is an abelian category, I can define this sort of abelian th of A to be the TH, that's the kind of little thing up there, of some auxiliary Zebulin category. Auxiliary Z in a category, and it's gonna, as before, be the objectives in the completion of the. Okay, that's all well and good. So now, if X is a scheme, I can, as before, define a topological hotshot of cohomology of X to be the abelian th of its category of quasi-coherent sheaves. So this is again just sort of mimicking what we had before in the usual posture of world. We had before in the usual posture world. It's possible, it's of course, yes, so you can define things, you can define THH of actually just any ringed space, even like a non-commutative ring space, by just looking at all of the modules. And it's a little bit of work, actually, to then prove that that's the same thing as for a QCQS scheme. I may even need separated, not just quasi-separated, but for a reasonable scheme, these two definitions. But for a reasonable scheme, these two definitions agree. But I, for now, this is more transparent to me, and I don't really care about schemes which aren't QCQS. So, this for me is a nicer definition. And of course, yeah, when X isn't QCQS, this is going to behave a bit weirdly anyway. So you would expect it to go a bit wrong. Okay, great. So what can we actually do with this? Let's first have a sanity check. So if I have a cumulative ring, the two definitions, I better agree. Well, THH for spec R. This is by definition the abelian THH for quasi-current sheaves on spec R. Well, a quasi-current sheaf on spec R is nothing more than an R module. And yeah, I mean, all the work in the proof is in this step, which is true but not obvious, that the abelian THH of the category of R modules is the same as the THH of R. As to how you might go about proving this, I'll say more about this in a second. I'll say more about this in a second. Okay, so that's good. So, again, this is, yeah, this is essentially what Ed was asking earlier. If X is in addition to Ethereum, you can use coherent sheaves, not quasi-coherent sheaves. So that's also good. And the proof here again, well, there's easy stuff, and then one non-obvious step. You know, quasi-coherent sheaves in this setting are the same thing as incoherent sheaves, so QCQS and Ethereum. Achieves like QCQS and the theory. And then it's a fact that if I have an abelian category with enough injectives, I can sort of exchange an ab down here for an inch up there. Again, not necessarily obvious. The proof is again sort of similar to this one, which I'm not telling you about just yet, but I will tell you about in the next slide, I think. Okay. And in fact, what's really going on is that. And in fact, what's really going on is that if I have any, you know, let's say I have a QCQS Ethereum scheme, there are lots of associated DG categories, right, that I might want to use or I might think about using to define topological Hausschuk homology of this scheme. So for example, I could look at the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves, I could look at its perfect derived category, I could look at its unbounded derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves. I can do other things like, you know, I can add. I can do other things, like you know, I can add or remove boundedness conditions here. I can, there are various other things I might want to think about doing, but the point is that if I take th of all of these things, they all agree. And moreover, they all agree with the definition I just gave you. So you can use your favorite DG category to actually compute THH. So let me say something about the proof because the proof is quite important. The same proof. The same proof will prove these two statements I just told you that aren't obvious but are true. So, if you know what the proof for Hausshield cohomology is, it's basically the same. So the original theorems here are due to Loew, von Berg, and they were sort of inspired by Keller's computations. And the point is that all of these categories All of these categories are, uh, you know, there's obvious morphisms, for example, there's an obvious map taking perfect complexes into this big derived category. Now, it's not an equivalence of DG categories in general, but so I have a functor. Well, the functor is the same as a bimodule, and this bimodule does actually induce weak equivalences on topological Hausschook cohomology. Again, the usual Hussher story. You have these Keller bimodules, you check that they induce weak equivalences. I mean, really, the checking here is checking that sort of derived homes here and derived homes here match up, which I mean, you look at it, they do. And yeah, so the point is to construct these bimodules. All of the work is done for you here. All of the work is done for you here in Loewen-Von den Berg. Push everything through the Eilenberg-MacLean functor, check that things play nicely, and you're done. And the really key point that underlies all of this is this. This is really what Keller was doing, which is that if you use the bar complex to compute th, you have some sort of limited functoriality. So th obviously isn't a functor because it's every Obviously, isn't a functor because it's covariant in one variable and contravariant in the other one. But if you have, for example, a fully faithful embedding of DG categories, I get a map going the other way on Hosshield's cohomology, just by sort of looking at the bar complex and actually sort of writing down what happens. And very similarly, there's a bar complex to compute THH. And it's similar enough to the non-topological situation that I again have some sort of limited functoriality along suitably fully effective embeddings of DG categories or of spectral categories. So the proof of idea really is just sort of make all of the arguments of Lohen and von den Baer topological. So before I do some computations, does anyone have? Computations. Does anyone have any questions about this stuff? Okay, let's move on. So, okay, so you all know what a tilting complex on a scheme is, right? If I have some QTQS in the theory of a scheme, a tilting complex is a compact generator of the bounded-derived category such that it's excelled. Such that its x-algebra is concentrated in degree zero. So, this really is a ring, or at least it's quasi-isomorphic to a ring. And in this situation, this dg category is then equivalent to the bounded derived category of modules over this ring. A tilting schemes, yeah, so a tiltable scheme is one of the tilting complex. Tiltable schemes are the schemes derived equivalent to rings. Derived equivalent to links. And you'll see in a minute why I care about things that are tiltable. Okay, so here are some examples, which I'm sure again you all know. Projector space is tiltable using this standard Bailinson collection. Grass maleums are tiltable as well. Now, one thing I want to say here, I care about working in positive characteristic because I don't do anything interesting in characteristic zero. And I care about working over finite fields. So in, you know. So, in, you know, over the complex numbers, there are lots and lots of interesting examples of tiltable varieties. Over finite fields, I'm not aware of so many. Actually, if you are aware of lots of interesting varieties that are tiltable over finite fields, I'd be interested to know. There are a few more examples I know that I haven't written down here, but certainly not as many as over C, for example. Okay, so what is this computational theorem that I'm going to tell you about? Theorem that I'm going to tell you about. So, if I start with a tiltable scheme, I really just care about tiltability. I don't care about actually writing down a tilting bundle or a tilting complex and doing computations with it. All I care about is if it's tiltable, if it's got one. So I start with a tiltable scheme over any field, K, although again, the ones I'm interested in are finite. Then there's a spectral sequence, and it's exactly the same sort of thing as I had before, right? There's a topological Haushoker field. Cohomfield, tensor over k with the k linear Hausfield cohomology of my scheme, and it converges to th of my scheme. Now again, as you might expect, this follows from the analogue for rings. So essentially what I do, I take my scheme x, I tilt to a ring. This is preserved under tilting, this is preserved under tilting. I mean, this is well known, and this is the proof is the same in the topological world again. Is the same in the topological world again. And so I'm done. Now, one thing, again, one thing to say here is that where did this spectral sequence for rings come from? It came from the functor cohomology interpretation of THH or equivalently mapping. Now, it would be really nice if I had a spectral sequence of this kind for DGAs, right? Because any QCQS scheme is derived. Any QCQS scheme is derived equivalent to some DGA. It might be some nasty big DGA, but some DGA. And if I had a spectral sequence like this for DGAs, I could just remove this word tilt for here. But the problem is, I do not know that such a spectral sequence of this type exists for DGAs. I mean, some spectral sequence of some type should exist. I have a few ideas, but they're not sort of crystallized. Ideas, but they're not sort of crystallized in my head enough for me to tell you anything productive about them. But yeah, if you could extend this spectral sequence for rings to a spectral sequence for DGAs, you could remove this tiltability hypothesis completely. Okay, great. So this is what we're going to use to actually do computations because now we know lots of things, right? We can compute Haushochromology. Box that tells us how to compute topological Haushochomology of a... Homology of a finite field. So we're good. Okay, so let's do some computations. So let's take P1 over a finite field. It's my favourite non-affine variety. What's the E2 page of the spectral sequence? So here is the Hossield direction. Here is the topological direction. So you see here we have a copy of the Hosshield cohomology of P1. It's one in degree zero and it's one dimensional in degree zero and it's three dimensional in degree one. There's nothing above. Three-dimensional degree one, there's nothing above, nothing below. And you see, here you have a copy of the topological part shield cohomology of my finite field K. And the way I've drawn these, it's supposed to indicate that there's nothing in this row and there's nothing in this row. So they're sufficiently far apart. And if you stare at this spectral sequence for a minute and you look at where the differentials are going, you'll see that it actually already degenerates on the YouTube page. Already degenerates on the YouTube page. There's not much here, right? There's not many places we can go with the differentials. And this completely tells you what the topological Hosho cohomology of P1 is, with really no work at all. And yeah, so you can of course write down this explicit decomposition. Or you could write this maybe as th of P1 is a THH of K plus a U times a Hofshov cohomology of P1. That might be an easier. That might be an easier way or a nicer way of seeing it, where this U is this bookstep periodicity element. And yeah, if you count the dimensions which we can, yeah, THH0P1 is one dimensional, THH1P1 is three dimensional, and so on and so forth. So again, you'll see it's two periodicity here, so that's nice. So let's try and do P2. Again, if you sit down and you stare at the spectral sequence, you'll see that on the E2 page, That on the E2 page of the spectral sequence for P2, that also degenerates. And you can play the same game, and you can do a dimension count. We know what the Husserl coherence of P2 is, or at least we can work it out. And the dimensions you get here, in degree naught, th of P2 is one, in degree one it's eight, degree two, it's eleven, and so on and so forth. You're not seeing genuine two periodicity, you're just seeing sort of eventual. You're just seeing sort of eventual two periodicity. And of course, the reason you're not seeing genuine periodicity is if you look in small degrees along these lines, there's not much going on. But if you go further up and you go along a line, there's going to be a bit more on it. That's essentially what's going on. Nothing difficult. Now, for P3, P3 is the first hard case because there might be some E3 differentials and I. Might be some E3 differentials, and I don't understand the E3 differentials. So, yeah, so there's an E3 differential from HH0 of P3 to HH1 of P3. Secretly, of course, I'm tensoring with a HML2 of K, but I'm tensoring over K with K, right? So I'm omitting that. So there might be some sort of E3 differential. So I can't do the computation for P3. One thing I also don't know. thing I also don't know, I would really like, so I obviously have periodicity in just the actual modules making up the E2 page. I would really like to have actual periodicity in the maps as well. And I'm not quite at the stage where I can get that yet. It may be easy if you think about it the right way. But as of the moment, I have no sort of formal reason to believe that you necessarily must have this sort of two-periodism. Necessarily must have this sort of two-periodicity phenomenon. So it would be really nice if you could do that. Again, one other thing I don't understand about this spectral sequence, I don't understand the ring structure. You know, it looks very much like this thing should be some sort of square zero extension of this by this, but again, I don't understand the ring structure. I don't understand the module structure over this guy. There's a lot I don't understand. There's lots of interesting things still to be done. Sorry. Sorry. And maybe sort of one last thing I might want to say. It is possible to do computations in low degree. If I take any tiltable variety and I look at this spectral sequence, I can get computations of its THH in low degree. I can tell you, in particular, I can tell you what its HML2 is. So this should be some sort of space of first order deformations. And I can tell you what its HML3 is. And I can tell you what its HTML3 is. So it should be some sort of obstruction space. And actually, these deformation and obstruction spaces, again, if you look at the spectral sequence, they have as some kernels and co-kernels of E3 differentials like this. And essentially, if you then sort of take some vague guesses at what the obstruction map should be. At what the obstruction map should be from HML2 to HML3, you'll see it vanishing of the obstruction map is actually sort of closely related in some sense to vanishing of these E3 differentials. So what I'm trying to say is that the E3 differentials in the spectral sequence should be very closely related to the obstruction maps from THAQ2 to THQ. From THAQ2 to THAQ3. And I think that is probably all I wanted to say. So thank you. Well, let's make Matt. Do we have questions? May may I ask a question? Of course. Hi, Matt. Can you say something about how you get the spectral sequence for a ring? Or for something called... Yeah, it's not very nice. Yeah, I'm afraid. Yeah, so let me get you a new page. Get you a new page. The proof really is heavy on the functor cohomology. So the proof is HHP of A tensor T. Well, I'll write MAC lane here. HMLQA goes to HMLP plus Q of A. So this isn't a theorem of mine. This appears in thing in mind this this appears in uh the collegin lohan paper uh the cohomology of exact categories and non-additive sheaves um it only appears in the published version it's not on the archive version um but uh yeah it's it's functico homology basically uh this is really why you need it for rings i don't know the proof off the top of my head but um uh it consists of identifying uh Oh, sorry, I've made a mistake there. It consists of identifying something like this with the derived functors of something that's a bit nasty. And so it's slightly miraculous that it works. Yeah, I'm afraid that's not a very satisfying answer, but I don't myself understand very well where this comes from. It's a bit of a black box for me. Yeah, I mean, if I understood how to get. Yeah, I mean, if I understood how to get one for DGAs or how to get one for THH, I might have a better answer for you here. But as of the moment, this is not something I understand super well, I'm afraid. Thank you. Other questions? What kind of stuff happens? I mean, like, are there other interesting examples outside of algebraic geometry? Like, you know. Algebraic geometry, like, you know, like the abelian category of, you know, group, abelian groups or something, or, you know, like what happens in the middle of the moment. I mean, some of these cohomology theories are, you know, yeah. So I mean, if you if you just take, for example, um th if I if I think about algebras rather than categories, if I just use z, this is weird. This is something like a this is a z mod i. This is a z mod i in degree. I'm going to mess up the indexing in degree 2i plus 1, and it's zero else. So this is a very strange thing. So it's looking a little bit somehow like some sort of divided power algebra. I mean, it's not, but it's a very strange thing. So yeah, I mean, I'm sure that you could get interesting things if you apply this to sort of things, you know, just abelian groups or various other things arising. I haven't. Or various other things arising. I haven't, again, I haven't thought too much about this, I'm afraid. I'm sure there are interesting things you can say, but there's nothing interesting that I'm able to say right now. Any other questions? All right. If not, well, let's thank Macinten for his great talk. We will resume in about nine minutes. So time to get a quick snack or take care of everything else. By the way, I posted my notes to the website. This version is, I guess, slightly better. It contains a bit more. I can send them to you if you would like. Would like yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, you can send them to the either way. I can I can upload them directly, can't I? I'll do that to Zula. Oh, yeah, that's fine. And then we'll we'll send them to Burrs because they're also on the Burrs website, assuming you don't mind that they are. No, yeah, of course, that's fine. Great. Matt, would you mind saying again? Oh, you've just gone. Maybe you would. I'm stopping here. I dragged you back. Sorry. Would you mind saying, what did you say the difference was between? So you said topological Hochschl homology of a finite field is a polynomial ring in one variable. Cohomology, yes. Homology is, I think it's also true for homology, yeah, yeah. Okay. And you said that the Schuckler cohomology is something different. Yeah, the Schuckler cohomology is a bit funny. So if I take FP, say, and I tensor it over, if I derive tensor it with. If I derive tensor with itself over z, I get a square zero extension. I get fp epsilon, mod epsilon squared with epsilon in degree minus one. Yes. And then if I look at x over this thing, I end up with a divided power algebra. Okay. What's a divided power algebra? Oh, yeah, well, it's nasty. It's kind of, yeah, just look it up, I guess. It's not. It up, I guess. It's not, it's not, it's sort of you have a polynomial ring. I mean, it's close to being a polynomial ring, yeah. It's it's sort of in characteristic p, you sort of you want to be able to sort of formally invert some things. You want to be able to talk about, you know, like one over p factorial, for example. Of course, you can't do this, but a divided power algebra is sort of the machinery that allows you to do this very loosely. Okay, yeah. Okay. Yeah, I try and stay away from these sort of things, I must admit. So as an FP, but they really are different. Okay, but as an FP vector space, maybe it's the same, but you said the multiplication. As an FP vector space, yes, I think it is the same. Yes, but the multiplication is different. I think that's the case. I'd have to double-check. Like a graded filtration by some graded pieces and reproduce polynomials or something. Ah, probably. That's, I don't remember much, but about them. Yeah, me neither. That's the problem. I mean, one more, this is adjoining x to the n divided by n factorial, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's that's morally what's going on. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't think the base is any kind of tilting button. I don't know any kind of tilting button vector space is just the same. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, as a vector space, it is the same. But yeah, the multiplication is funny. Of course, in characteristic zero, these things are the same, right? So you're obviously looking at the same. Yeah, but cute. Yeah. Cool. Nice talk. Nice examples. Thanks. I think if you're looking. I think if you're looking for more tiltable things, anything that for a torque variety, a split torque variety, that works is going to work over Z. So. Okay, okay, thanks. Yeah, because I know some Tauric examples over complex numbers, but yeah, I'm a little bit scared of doing things over finite fields. But yeah, thank you. That's useful.  Howdy guys How's it going? Yo, good, how's it going with you? All right, can I share my screen and get some feedback on what's visible? Sounds good. So if I go this So, if I go this tall, does it start to become unreadably small? I think that's about the limit. That's about the limit. Okay, maybe I'll just go ahead and come a little bit back from the limit then. You can't push like function 11 or something and make it full screen. The problem is, well, my screen is super long. Oh, I see. You're saying, no, I want all the tools. No, I want all the toolbars up there because I might want to make something pink at some point. Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, we invited Ryan, but he said he might come. Oh, yeah, I sent him the link. Did you invite him to speak? No, just as a participant. Yeah, all right. Yeah, a hell of a year to have a PhD student finish, right? And I had to. Yeah, I had to. I had to and yeah, although they all my PhD students were like surprisingly fortunate, so oh, we're still on we're still on tape. Thank you for pointing that out. Yeah. Oh, yeah, because I was very scared after everything went down. Rightly so. Matt and/or David and/or Nitten. David and/or Nitten. I'll try to keep an eye on the chat, but I'm going to fail. So if somebody asks a question, will you just tell me? Yeah, I have a few windows open to try and keep an eye on all the various avenues for people to communicate. Oh, he says, does someone need to stop the recording? Yeah, someone needs to stop the recording. You know, you can trim them pretty easily. Yeah, I think the length is not the problem if they're overly long. Okay, I stopped that reporting.
