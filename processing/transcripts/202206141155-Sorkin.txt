Next, we have Rafael Sorkin. The title of his talk is Space-like correlations do not imply superluminal causation. So, what are they telling us? So, yeah, please, Rafael, can you hear? Can everyone hear me all right? Yes, we can hear you. Good, okay, thanks. The slides look great, by the way. So I think this is going to work out. I think this is going to work out. So I'm sorry that I couldn't be in Oaxaca today. It would be a very nice experience, I'm sure. But this is the best we can do right now. So as you can see, my title is in some sense in two parts. The first part and the one that I'm going to concentrate on the most because I think that for some people Because I think that for some people it might be the most surprising or call for us the most discussion is the first sentence, space-like correlations do not imply superluminal causation. The second part, so what are they telling us? I will start to propose some answers that even though they don't tell us about superluminal causation, they do tell us something. They do tell us something of interest, the particular pattern of space-like correlation. So, unfortunately, there won't be enough time to go into any detail in the second part, but I want to try and make at least the first part as clear as I can. And I hope maybe to get some reactions. So, starting with part one, non-locality rescues causality. Rescues causality. So you see the word non-locality there. It's trying to say that the reason that people have often felt that certain space-like correlations, like violations of the CHSH inequalities, do imply supralominal causation is because they're making some implicit assumptions having to do with causality. And this is what I'm going to try to explain. That if you relinquish those assumptions to control, Those assumptions to contradiction, the alleged contradiction goes away. I should say, I'm not sure exactly how much of this sort of quantum foundational terminology is familiar to people. So if I mention something that's not, please interrupt and I'll define it for you. For example, the CHSH inequalities. What is the CHSH inequality? CHSH inequality? I didn't mean you had to ask that. It's a version of the Bell inequality that governs correlations between if you create an entangled pair of particles, say photons in the typical case, and you have two standard, well in this case, two polarization analyzers, and you set them in different ways and you note the correlation coefficient between a particular Between a particular result here and a particular result here. And if you compare all those correlation coefficients, plug them into a formula, there's an inequality that must be satisfied if everything was classical and obeyed a classical causality condition that people call factorization, which is also known as the principle of Reichenbach common cause, which says that something in the past must be responsible for the Past must be responsible for the correlations on both sides. And if you totally fix that event, all events in the past, the correlations will go away. So they're only mediated through the past. That leads to, in the classical setting, that leads to a certain correlation, which is the one that's famously violated in the whole series of experiments. When you get people saying there are no realistic hidden variables here, there are no. Hidden variable series, or there are no local hidden variable series, or different terminology is used. But anyway, those are the correlations that I'm sure you've read about many times. Does that answer the question? Yeah, I just didn't recognize the acronym, but thank you for a nice brief explanation. Okay, thanks. Yeah, so that's just the acronym. It's also called the ball inequality. It's a version, variation, or improvement. Variation or improvement on the Bell inequalities. So, probably no one, except maybe for me, would disagree that if superluminal causation can occur faster than light, cause and effect, then any pattern of space-like correlations is thinkable. Because in these two Stern-Gerlaches or these two polarization analyzers that we were just talking about, they can communicate. About they can communicate with each other and set up any kind of correlation that they want, so to speak. I think that's relatively uncontroversial. However, what might be controversial, and I'm not sure how many would agree if I went further and said, yes, this is true, but suppose we do even exclude superluminal causation, we say it does not happen. Even so, arbitrary space-like correlations. Arbitrary space-like correlations are still thinkable, including, for instance, maximal violations of the CHSH inequality, which is something that goes beyond what even ordinary quantum theory can allow. So my first job is to try to convince you of this claim if you don't already believe it. In the way of encouragement, I mention here that I've already Mention here that I've already convinced my collaborator, which is Faye Dauker. I've already convinced my collaborator, and she authorized me to quote her to the effect that my claim is, quote, clearly not obviously false. So I hope that's some degree of encouragement. So in the rest of this talk or on these slides, you'll see the abbreviation RC. That's just short. C, that's just shorthand for relativistic causality. The idea that influences do not propagate faster than light. To introduce the point of view I'm going to be promoting, let me tell a little story. It comes from, I don't know, maybe a decade ago or something at Perimeter Institute when I was hosting a sort of discussion. Hosting a sort of discussion, mainly with students in, I think, in a course on quantum foundations, something like that. Discussion of the implications of these Bell-type experiments and the experimental confirmation of the quantum predictions, which many people took then and have taken to mean that there is superluminal causation in some sense, even though it does not permit what people call. not permit what people call signaling. So after discussing it, I asked them to choose between or among these three possibilities. Do these kind of correlation, these experimental correlations that are observed, do they violate relativistic causality, just to corp? Do they violate relativistic causality in some classical sense, but not in some quantum sense, maybe still to be Quantum sense maybe still to be understood better, or do they say nothing about faster-than-light influences at all? After all, they're just correlations and they say nothing about causation. Now, most of the students chose one or two, but there was one student, I'll call her Sarah, there was a student, Sarah, who chose three. She said, yeah, they are just correlations. They are just correlations. What does it have to do with causation? This set me thinking, or set me thinking even more about the third possibility. And after some time, I came to agree. Oops, what happened? Can you, yeah. Can you go? Right. And as it's down, now it's down a couple of lines, you can't. Oh, yeah, there it is. And so I'm now convinced that three is in fact the right answer. I mean, in saying this, of course, you have to be careful because terms like causality, locality, which we're going to be using a lot, they operate more at an intuitive level than at a formal level. Formal level. Unfortunately, or fortunately, physics as we know it doesn't have cause as a fundamental notion. In some sense, it may have locality, but it doesn't have really cause. It has at best correlation. Nevertheless, everyone has an intuitive sense of what these things mean. And those intuitions, I think everyone would agree, play an important role in guiding our thinking. Guiding our thinking and formulating theories, understanding existing theories and formulating new ones. So even though the intuitive nature of these terms means that the whole discussion can also be on an intuitive and not so much a formal level, I think we can arrive at some answer to the question. And as I claim, as I've claimed, as I just said, I believe that the answer is. Just said, I believe that the answer is correct. That the correlations in themselves tell us nothing about space, superluminal causation. So another thing that always needs to be done in this kind of discussion is defining the terms carefully because in the literature there's no agreement whatsoever. People use things to mean almost the opposite of what some others mean. So some people actually mean. So some people actually use locality to mean causality, what I'm calling causality. So let me just be clear on what I'm going to, the terminology I'm going to try to use. When I say causality, that will be always short and for relativistic causality or RC. And the meaning is simply that no cause can act. No cause can act outside its future light cone. It can act arbitrarily inside, but not outside the future light cone. Locality, which is an even more confused term in the literature, for this talk will mean no cause can act outside its immediate space-time neighborhood. And there are certain implications intuitively that people draw from that that we'll be talking about. We'll be talking about. I want to stress that these are two, although the names are often confused in the literature, these are logically distinct principles. One example, a simple example is given by tachyons. If there were tachyons and you could send a message faster than light using a tachyon, this would be a violation of causality because, for an obvious reason, because the tachyon travels outside the light cone. Outside the light cone. But it would not be a violation of locality because it would be continuously propagating from the emission to the absorption. And so nothing would have happened, everything would have happened by a point in space-time influencing the neighboring point, so to speak. Now, why do so many people think that by That violations of the Bell/slash CHSH inequalities do, in fact, entail supraluminal causation. And beyond those, it's worth mentioning the purely logical paradoxes of a similar nature that don't even use probabilistic correlation, but just perfect correlation, and derive a similar paradox that seems to lead to the same result. I believe that the reason. I believe that the reason people believe this is because, consciously in some cases, and I think unconsciously in many others, they take for granted that a cause must act locally. This is the locality. With the result that they effectively base their reasoning not on relativistic causality alone, but on its conjunction with locality. This is a combined principle that John Bell had called local causality, explicitly recognizing both aspects of the assumption as being made. However, even if at one time in the history of physics, locality was taken for granted or it was felt that it could be taken for granted. It cannot be taken for granted. It cannot be taken for granted today, even, and I'm not sure it ever could, but certainly today it cannot be taken for granted. Rather, nature itself is asking us to question locality. And the reasons, of course, one of them is what we just discussed, but I think that's a lesser reason. The most important reasons have nothing to do with the Bell inequalities. There's so many in number that one might even say. Number that one might even sense, I think I sense that non-locality is becoming a bit of a zeitgeist for present-day physics. I won't try to go in any detail at all into the individual reasons, but I just want to listen. The first and foremost in my mind is the lambda, the cosmological constant. Many people are of the opinion and have given arguments that the puzzles That the puzzles surrounding the cosmological constant will not be resolved in any local theory of gravity. Related to this is discreteness. Of course, many people, especially mainly in the context of quantum gravity, are working on theories in which the deep structure of space-time is discrete. And discreteness just by itself brings non-locality to an extra Non-locality to a certain extent because there's no infinitesimal neighborhood of a point in space-time. There's no actually space-time continuum. And it's only in terms of these infinitesimal neighborhoods that locality can strictly be defined. But when you adjoin to discreteness Lorentz invariance, the conflict becomes much more severe, and you find really radical violations of. Violations of locality. I think you can go so far as to say locality discreteness and Lorentz variance cannot coexist. The third point is causal sets. In causal set theory, because it does combine Lorentz invariance and discreteness, non-locality is there, is extreme, and is fundamental to the theory. So that's an example. That's an example. I could also mention non-local field series. There are many people working on this idea, but just let me just pick one example, Siavash, Aslan Begi and Makati Saravani, who at the time were students at Perimeter Institute, proposed a theory in which a non-local scalar field produces natural candidates for dark matter. Other examples. Other examples of essentially non-local or space-times that don't support locality are non-commutative geometry. And then finally, let me mention twister theory, in which the connection between a space-time point as we normally think of it and more basic twister is again radically non-local. So given that we can't assume locality. Locality, or let's say we don't assume it. Let's see why the argument that people have made from correlations to superluminal causation fails. So consider a space-time region, I'll call X, within which some sort of source, think of the EPR type experiment, the Bell inequalities. Consider a space-time region X within some source. X within some source emits an entangled pair of particles, which then propagate to space-like separated regions A and B. What needs to be explained are the correlations between the spins of the A particle and the spin of the B particle. So just to be concrete and definite, let us say that these are correlations between the readings of instruments, spin measurements. Of instruments, spin measuring instruments in A and spin measuring instruments in B. The key here, the crucial thing to notice, is that this is a correlation like this. It pertains to neither region A nor to region B alone, but to their union. It's not telling you anything about what's happening in A or what's happening in B, but it's telling you some relationship between them. So it's an event. Between them. So it's an event in the region A union B, which I've called Y here. Now the region Y lies within the future of the region X where the source was very trivially because particles, we'll assume here, don't travel faster than light. So both A and B, and therefore their union are in the future of X. X. But for something that happens in a region X to cause something else to happen in a region Y which is in its future in no way conflicts with relativistic causality. It's perfectly within the parameters specified by relativistic causality. The alleged superluminality evaporates. That's the whole argument. That's the whole argument, in fact. But let me try, say some more words to try and clarify it and make it more intuitively plausible than it might already be, if it's not plausible already for you. In arguing the way I've just done, what we are implicitly denying is that if a cause acts in a region, Is that if a cause acts in a region A union B, it is only because and to the extent that it acts in A or acts in B. Or in a slightly different wording, suggested by my collaborator, the effect or action of a cause in a region A, union B, is fully given by its, oh, I see that a By its, oh, I see that if I put my hands too wide, you can't see them. Okay, so the effect, sorry, let me start again. The effect or action of a cause in A union B is fully given by its effect or action in A together with its effect or action in B. This expresses one version of the principle of locality. Because if things propagate, well, if you think through, there's a kind of argument if things propagate continuously in space-time, then they can only act independently in A and B. Anyway, we could take this, let's say, as a definition, alternative definition of locality, and if we accept that, then we will be led, or anyone who accepts it will be led more or less inevitably from the space-light correlations that are observed to superluminal. To superluminal causation. Maybe we could. Oh, yeah. So I'm claiming that these arguments that go in that direction suffer from a fallacy. And I can illustrate the fallacy concretely in a rudimentary Gdankin experiment. Let there be two, I'll talk about spins now. So let there be two Stern-Gerlach animals. So let there be two Stern-Gerlach analyzers with fixed settings aligned so as to produce a perfect correlation between the respective beams, upper beam on one side or lower beam in which the A particle emerges and upper beam or lower beam in which the B particle emerges. People often talk about a perfect anti-correlation because they're thinking of spin-sign singlet state, but I've chosen to I've chosen to just let them be correlations. You could flip one analyzer if you want that imagery. So, following, if you set this up, then following a suitable preparation event in region X, the A particle, after propagating to region A, it emerge, and going through the Stern Gerlach, it emerges from the A analyzer in the upper beam or the lower beam, but it emerges in the upper beam. But it emerges in the upper beam if and only if the B particle emerges in the upper beam. This, I think, is all very familiar. We can express it by saying that the event, a particular event, the event UU upper upper or dd, lower, lower, must happen. It always happens. I will henceforth express this event as UU plus D D. Now, causality, relativistic causality always, insists that particle A cannot learn what particle B is doing and particle B cannot learn what particle A is doing because they're in space-like separated regions. Therefore, so is the claim, therefore both particles must know in advance before they reach the analyzers whether they will choose The analyzers whether they will choose the U beam or the D beam. Hence, the source must have predetermined both of these choices, or so it seems. And if you accept this, then you're led to these Bell inequality, CHSH inequality, experimentally disproven. What's the fallacy? The fallacy is to have ignored that if causation is not a problem. Have ignored that if causation need not be local, the preparation event in X can be the cause of any event in its future without necessarily being the cause of any other event. Now, UU plus D, the correlation, is such a future event, as I've stressed already, at least once or at least twice or three times. In order to cause this event uu plus dd, you need Plus Dd, you need not cause either UU separately or DD separately, but only their disjunction. That is, you need not, and in this example, you do not influence the particles individually, but only jointly. It's also illuminating to express this influence in a negative language. What is the preparation of What has the preparation event caused? It has prevented the event UD from happening and the event DU from happening. And that's certainly an effect. But beyond that, it has done nothing at all. In particular, it has had zero influence on A and zero influence on B. It has caused a correlation, but no more than that. In order to feel fully at home with this explanation, I think it's necessary, what might make it hard to feel fully at home with this explanation, is that it might be hard to accept that a correlation event like uu plus dd is really an event in its own right, having exactly the same logical status as u at a. Status as U at A or D at B or U at A and D at B, U D, etc. There's a nice quote from Kolmogorov that conveys this insight. However, in reading it, in transposing it to the present situation, instead of what he calls elementary event, read individual history or trajectories of the particles. And the quotation says that And the quotation says, the notion of an elementary event is an artificial superstructure imposed on the concrete notion of event. So the concrete notion is the event. In reality, events are not composed of elementary events, but elementary events originate in the dismemberment of composite events. So the correlation is event, the preparation is causing it, and there's nothing against it. It and there's nothing against causality in that relationship. Maybe by way of clarification, I should put a note here, note here that I'm not denying, in fact it's important, and it's true, at least in the frameworks that I usually think in terms of, and most people do, that an event like UU plus DD is a Is a logical combination of events in A and events in B. In other words, it's U at A and U at B, or D at A and D at B. So some logical, or you might say, Boolean combination of localized events. Some using, who use philosophical language in quantum foundations, they say that this event, uu plus dd, supervenes on those local events. But saying this is just But saying this is just a kinematical relationship. The relevant non-locality that has to be accepted to see why there's no superluminal causation necessary here is a dynamical one. The supervention that we do not accept is that the causal influence of the X event, the causal influence says the X event. The causal influence that the X event has in region A, union B, that does not supervene on its separate influences on the region A and the region B. I think I mangled that sentence a little bit, but I hope the meaning is clear. It's on the screen. Oops, it was on the screen. Okay. It's not possible to sort of have them both be on the screen. Screen, okay. Sorry, that's fine. Let's go on to the next thing. Now, I tried to make these as definite and clear as possible, but they might still seem very abstract or slippery. In this case, it helps quite a lot to go through a pass integral calculation. A pass integral calculation that shows, for example, to take the simplest example, how the forbidden event u d acquires net amplitude zero. In agreement with the viewpoint just sketched, we'll see that the calculation is fundamentally global in nature because the amplitudes that need to be added are themselves globally defined. So let me go through that, I think, quickly now, because we're getting a little late. Because we're getting a little late. So, can you put up the figure, the diagram? So, I should say, while the diagram is being put up, that this is not spinning particles, but just, let's say, spinless, or say scalar particles or polarized particles where the spin plays no role. This makes it easier. This makes it easier to do the pass integral calculation because it's always a little tricky to include spins in a pass integral. It's just an unnecessary complication. So you see here a source S. I assume you cannot see my own pointer here. So you see a source S, which emits two particles, and both of them hit a half-silvered mirror. They can either bounce off to the left or go through to the right. We're interested in the situation. We're interested in the situation where one goes through and one bounces off. So, for example, if the one at A bounces off, it proceeds along an upper path and can arrive at either of these two detectors. So, let's say this is this half-silvered mirror, M5 on the left, is the Stern Geralach playing the role of the Stern Geralach. And let's say it arrives in the upper beam. Then, in that same run. Then, in that same run of the experiment, the particle that went down would go through the mirror and arrive also at the upper detector on the right. Now, this is a certain history, and it has a certain amplitude. On the other hand, and it's not zero. On the other hand, it's not the only history that contributes to this event. The event was. The event was just arrival of the particle, left particle at the upper detector and the right particle at the upper detector. That can happen in another way where the lower particle bounces off, the upper particle goes through, and then the one that arrives at the left is followed the lower pass, and the one that arrives at the right is followed the upper pass. This also has an amplitude. It's also not zero. Also, not zero. But the thing is that the two amplitudes are equal and opposite, and when you add them up to get the net amplitude of the event, they cancel each other, showing you correctly that that event is forbidden because it's inconsistent with the perfect correlation. So I think what you see very clearly here is that to do the calculation, we had to globally follow the histories. There was nothing that prevented a particle from. Nothing that prevented a particle from ending up in the left either place or on the right either place, but there was something in the amplitudes, something non-local in nature that prevented a certain anti-correlation from happening. Okay, thank we could go back to the text now. So I think what's important here is that what to start What this does is it's a very concrete calculation of a sort that many, almost everyone will have done at some point. And it shows that if you adopt a pass integral framework, the fact that a correlation is an essentially non-local effect is very clearly visible in the computation that one performs to deduce the correlation. One sees concretely how a cause can act globally. A cause can act globally without necessarily acting locally. Neither U nor D separately is forbidden, but only of the event U and D. Also D and U is forbidden. But the one we did here was U and D. Oh, I think when I was describing it, I described the allowed event. I should have been describing on the right-hand side that the particle went to the lower analyzer. Those are the two amplitudes. Those are the two amplitudes that cancel each other. Anyway, I think the idea was clear. So finally, before passing to part two of the talk, I make a couple of notes for clarification. The first note is that everything in this talk has to do with the concepts of cause and locality and how they're related or not related. Not related. I did not at all try to address the so-called measurement problem, and I hope I didn't give the impression I was doing that. I would view that problem as the task of explaining why macroscopic reality can be identified with a single macroscopic reform history, even though arguably microscopic reality cannot be identified with a single history. However, I'm not sure. However, I'm not trying to explain why that's sort of the key problem of quantum foundations, in my view. But since classical logic does empirically work macroscopically, it's of course true that if the event UU or DD happens, UU plus DD, then that implies that either UU happens or DD happens, because they were detectors' clicks. So they were macroscopic events. So there's no harm in accepting that. In fact, we have to accept it. But it still does not say that the preparation event itself caused UU or caused DD. It still only caused their disjunction, UU plus DD. The second. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Arafa, but you only have a couple of minutes left. I thought I was timing and I had five minutes. Is that reasonable? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. Okay, thanks. So, in what second note has a question, in what sense can we give to either causality or locality? What sense do they have when the causal structure of spacetime is dynamical? So this ties up with the previous talks, as it is in general relativity, and more so in quantum gravity. What's remarkable is that in general relativity, they do. Is that in general relativity they do have definite meanings and they both hold, but this is possible only because, in the end, GR deals with a single space-time continuum so that locality has meaning and a fixed, therefore temporal ordering of the space-time points so that causality has a definite meaning. But to me, it still seems, as far as I know, a mystery once you admit distinct interfering space-times. Once you admit that distinct space-time, Once you admit that distinct space-times can interfere, as in quantum gravity, the mathematical foundation for both causality and locality seems to crumble. So it's a real question whether the principle of causality will survive the transition to quantum gravity. So that's the end of part one. Part two is asking, does some analog of factorization hold in nature? Of factorization hold in nature. Now, in the first part of this talk, which I just finished, I argued that relativistic causation is perfectly compatible with the space-like correlations that supposedly contradict it. Conflict arises only when you supplement relativistic causality with some other condition, typically conceived of as a form of locality. So, if you want to uphold causality, you need only make peace with a You need only make peace with a sufficient amount of non-locality. I also pointed out how the non-local or global nature of causation accords very well with the pass integral form of quantum dynamics, how you can almost read off the non-locality from the pass integral. But these conclusions are very nice, I think. But for me, they don't add much because I've already long since believed that both non-knowledge. Long since believed that both non-locality and the past integral are part of physics. But there still might be something, which is supposed we pay attention to which correlations do or do not occur in nature. Might we then uncover some unrecognized principle, perhaps even a weaker sort of locality that could offer some more definite guidance to model building. So I'll just rush through now in the next two Now, in the next last two minutes, I'll rush through a suggestion. The suggestion comes from looking at constraints, not the CHS inequality, but constraints which quantum correlations do, which they do respect. One of them is just the CHSH inequality with the bound of 2 replaced by 2 root 2. And let's see, is there anything, can we identify any? Is there anything? Can we identify any principle analogous to what Bell called local causality, which we now have to deny? Can we identify any principle which could be behind these constraints that are still present in quantum theories, at least in experiments so far? So I'm not going to try to answer this, but let me just state a possibility. A possibility that there are, which is not one principle, but two conditions that are really in search of an underlying principle. One is called persistence of zero, and it was going to originally be the subject of my talk. The other one is a technical condition, which I won't give a name to, because I have no time left. So let me just briefly do the last slide and explain what is a special case of persistence. What is a special case of persistence of zero, and you'll see how it relates to the discussions of causality we've already been having. Yeah, so in quantum measure theory, there's a kind of generalized probability called the measure, which you can think of as a probability in many cases. And if it vanishes, sometimes it vanishes, that is, it's roughly like saying that the net amplitude for that event vanishes. Amplitude for that event vanishes, and therefore the event cannot occur. And here's the principle of persistence of zero. Let E be an event in a space-time region X, and let F be, sorry, let E be a any event in region Y. And now suppose that E does have measure zero, then this principle of persistence of zero Of persistence of zero says that the event y in its future, when combined with E, still has measure zero. In other words, the event E and F, the conjunction, has measure zero. This is not automatic, but this serves as a constraint on the amplitudes that go into the path integral, which standard quantum series satisfy. So I won't Satisfied. So I won't say any more, but just to mention, except to mention that notice the asymmetry of time here. And I'll tell you that this leads to a derivation of the so-called Searleson inequalities that I mentioned before, perfectly along the lines of CHSH. So these are promising things, and I'd love to explore the consequences of this principle for pass integral quantum gravity. Quantum gravity, if only I knew how to generalize it to a situation without a fixed causal structure. Sorry for going a little over time. Thank you very much, Tor. Thanks. So maybe we can leave the questions for the discussion session or? Oh, well, if there's one. I was hoping at least one question. I was probably at least one question because the first part. On my timer, there's still three minutes left. Oh, well, yeah, then. Is there any question? Sorry, yes. Yeah, so there is a question by Benito. Hi, can you hear me? Sort of. Yeah, there's a blondmore outside. If I close the window, I could hear better. I'll take the opportunity, Sir. I don't know if I can make it to the discussion. Yeah, I was very pleased with your separation of locality and causality, first and foremost. I think this is the correct way of separating these two concepts. But I wanted to point out that, in fact, these baselike correlations, I mean, they can also occur, of course, classically. I mean, there are many. I mean, there are many, you know, many examples, including these typical examples where someone puts a red sock and a blue sock in a box and then sends them away. And then at space-like separation, you open your box and you know that the other sock is going to be blue if yours is red and so on. So I think that in some sense, it's already illustrated. I mean, what you're very clearly illustrating is already illustrated in, let's say, in classic. In, let's say, classical physics. And the other point that I wanted to make is the one bit where I felt a bit uncomfortable is when you refer to these up, up plus down, down events. And I guess the only bit that makes me uncomfortable here is the terminology, really, because when we learn, say, relativity or GR or even special relativity, we tend to associate events to or almost equalize. To almost equalize events to space-time points. So I was just wondering if this is standard terminology because I found it a bit confusing. Before you, on the second point, if it's just a terminological confusion. It's just a terminological confusion. I should have said that, and I often do, but I forgot today. When I say event, I'm using the word in the everyday sense of the word event, which is also the way that it's used in the theory. That it's used in the theory of stochastic processes or in probability theory more generally. And so, in that quotation I gave from Kolmogorov, that was the way in which he was using it. He didn't, now you're right, of course in GR there's a special, or even relativity more generally, there's a specialized usage to mean a point of space-time, which you might call a point event. And the point event could be viewed as a special case, perhaps, of the general. Special case, perhaps, of the general event because it's something that happens maybe at one point, but it's a very special case and it often leads to confusion. So, whenever I said event, I did not mean space-time point. No, I get it. I know it was a terminological remark, but maybe some terminology like end-point events or end events is quite appropriate. I mean, it is to be introduced in the literature. People in space-time usage said. In space-time usage said point event, that would be a big clarification because there's a clash from two different disciplines on the terminology. Exactly. Thanks, yeah. I'm glad you pointed that out. And the first point, of course, it does, your example was two sucks, does, of course, illustrate how you can have correlations. And it's, and many people say, well, therefore. Many people say, well, therefore, what's so special about the EPR? I mean, this is just, but of course, they're missing something there. They're missing that the strength of the correlated, the nature of the correlation is something more subtle in the EPR, I mean in the Bell inequality case. And that cannot be accomplished. And so what these in these classical models and what your example doesn't illustrate is Doesn't illustrate is going beyond locality because, in that case, the sock moved from the source to the detector, and the other sock moved. And the reason that the sock was blue here is because it was blue just a little bit earlier, slightly farther away, and that's because it was blue even a little earlier, and so on. And that's because it was blue when it was emitted, sent off from the put in the box. Put in the box. So there's a sort of local chain of causation, and that's what we need to, I think, deny if we're going to uphold relativistic causality. And the logical paradoxes that I've referred to but didn't at all discuss show this even more clearly because it's not a question of correlation coefficients or something. It's actually a question of strict logical correlations that are not compatible with any. That are not compatible with any single classical history, together with the assumption that the measuring instrument just reveals what the history was doing. No, I fully agree with you. I mean, just to point out that, I mean, space-like correlations shouldn't really scare anyone. But of course, I mean, I fully agree that the quantum correlations are in especially. Are in special in the sense that you said it very, very different. And I agree with your distinction. Okay, thank you. Yeah, thank you very much. Yeah, let's thank Christ.
