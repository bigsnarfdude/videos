Convoluted title, but by the end of the talk you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Uh fancy video here, first thing to keep you awake. Uh the basically what I'm showing you here, um one thing to note is that I'm going to be talking about cholesterol liquid crystals today. The title of the conference is Layered Liquid Crystals, so it still applies. The cholesterol liquid crystal forms layers. So not smectics, even though it seems to be everyone's favorite phase here. But I think a lot of what I say can still be. A lot of what I say can still be relevant for semantics. So that's a good thing. Another thing is that what we're seeing here, this is sort of the model system that I will be working on. It's a colocerfica crystal that's confined within a spherical shell, and I'll explain in a bit how this shell is formed. But basically, what's happening is that the way that the molecules are aligning at the surface is changing with time, and then that's inducing different patterns that we see here. And so, the goal of my talk is to explain why. Talk is to explain why these patterns are forming. Okay. Oh, and I guess another thing to say is I'm at Utrecht University. I started only two years ago. So I'm presenting sort of older work, and at the end I will talk about some of the current projects that I'm working on. Okay, so everyone has already explained a lot about what liquid crystals are, but just to cover all the grounds, the sort of workhorse for liquid crystals is using a polarized optical microscope. And when you look at the crystal, Microscope, and when you look at the rods, the sample under the microscope, if the rods are disordered in the isotropic phase, of course, you'll see black. In the pneumatic phase, they start to align. And so then you start to be able to change the intensity of the light, like what Randy had explained, and then you see a shlearing texture. But for a cholesteric, it's sort of like a pneumatic, where they point in the same direction as their neighbors, but then they also start to twist in space, forming a helical kind of stacking. And then, because of this helical, And then, because of this helical stacking, when you look under the microscope, then you see these stripes forming. And the stripes are emerging because of the twisting of the phase. Okay, and so this is sort of the main phase that I will be talking about. And the material that I'm using is 5CB, that's like the Drosophila fly of the crystals. And then I'm mixing into it this chiral dopant. The chiral dopant looks a lot like 5CB, but it has this extra little kink to make it chiral. Little kink to make it chiral, and then depending on how much of this dopant that you mix in, you can change how much it twists. The more that you mix in, the more that it twists, and the measure, the pitch, which is a measure of a 2 pi rotation of the molecules along the pitch axis, along the twisting direction, yeah, the smaller that the pitch will become, the more of the set you mix in. And so, with the chiral dopant that I'm using here, Hyrodopen that I'm using here, all the experiments that I show you, I want to be able to see the pitch, and so I'm going to be using 2.8 weight percent, which gives me a pitch of five microns. Okay. And so how do I make the model system? I had already explained at the beginning that it's a shell, and I use microphonics to form it. This is from my friend Guillaume Duray, and he made this video. He's also a collaborator in this project. And so we had a small glass. We had a small glass capillary that's fitted within a second glass capillary that's fitted within a third one. In the center, you have water flowing, and then on the outside, you have liquid crystal. And then this starts to flow towards a tapered end. The water is flowing in this direction. The liquid crystal is also flowing in this direction. And then on the outside, you also have water that has a polymer surfactant that will help to stabilize the shell. But then the tapered end. But then the tapered end allows for this pressure drop to occur, where you also have water flowing on the outside in order to create a sort of jet. And since, of course, water and the liquid crystal that we're using, they don't mix, the water is oil-like, you start to get this jet breakup. And so then they're forming, it's the double jet that has the water with the liquid crystal around it, is then breaking up into these droplets in order to then form these shells. And so this is the model system. And so, this is the model system that we're working with. And you can produce many of them at a time. And this kind of shows that. Okay, and so the shell geometry is really nice because at first when I started this project, I was interested in understanding defects in chole-stereicles. And so when you have a spherical geometry, you force it in defects. And then the shell is especially nice because you also remove a lot of the bulk. And so then that helps you to control. You have a lot of extra surface. You can really control the bulk from. You can really control the bulk from tuning anchoring conditions, and that's a nice thing. And so that's why this is our model system. Okay, and so cholesteric defects. Here's the sort of ground state in a simplified version of the cholesterol of the crystal. It's twisting, and when you have a cholesteric phase, it's I think a bit more complicated than the pneumatic. You have the direction in which the molecules are pointing, which is represented here by N. Which is represented here by n. You also have the direction in which they're twisting, which is perpendicular to the direction in which the molecule is pointing. That's the pitch axis. And then, since these in the cholesteric are always perpendicular to each other, you also automatically get this cross product. And so when you want to describe the structures that you get in the cholesteric, you have to think about a triad of vectors being ordered in space. And so it gets really complicated. But okay, so here's sort of like a simple Defect that's kind of specific to a cholesteric, where this is just a sort of small double twist region. And you can see that because, and again, this is three-dimensional, but just showing a small double twist region, there's no defect in the director, right? The direction where the molecule is pointing is well-defined everywhere. In the center, it's just pointing out towards you. But the direction where the molecules are twisting, that's radial everywhere in this configuration. Everywhere in this configuration, it's not well defined in the center. And so this is a simple pitch defect. And so this is a defect only in the pitch, and so it's a special defect that you only get with a cluster. They get, of course, much more complicated than this, but this is one small illustration. Okay, and so let's think about the shell geometry a little bit before jumping into results. You can tune the anchoring conditions on the inside and outside of the shell, and think about how you can fit in a helix. Think about how you can fit in a helix, this helical, the pitch axis, into this geometry. When you have planar anchoring, you can fit in the helix like so, and so then it can twist with the pitch axis oriented radially. That way it satisfies parallel or planar anchoring at the top and bottom surfaces, and this can fill the whole shell. And then you'll just have, because of the spherical geometry, you'll just have small localized regions of this order. And okay, and that. And okay, and that's been studied. And so, now, next, if you have very strong perpendicular anchoring or homeotropic anchoring, you're competing with a twist. You can't fit in a twist if it has to be perpendicular everywhere. And so, then you actually end up with no defects. You just have a sort of, I guess, a virtual defect, but since you have no liquid crystal in the bulk, there's no defect there. Okay. And so, only when you have sort of weak perpendicular anchoring, you're allowing the liquid crystal, the cholesterol, to twist at the The crystal, the cholesterol to twist at the surface of the shell, that then you can start to fill in like so, and then you can start to ask what sort of structures are being formed when you're working with this sort of moderate anchorage. Okay, and so with MAX and other collaborators, we looked at simulations, and so these are the Landau-Degene simulations where you have at each lattice point the Q tensor, and then you have the elastic energy, and then you have the. And then you have the elastic energy, and then you minimize it, and then you just sort of cut out the shell shape and define what the anchoring conditions are at the surfaces. And so, what we're seeing here is this cross-section of the shell that's highlighted here. The inner surface of the shell is also highlighted, and there's a color map, which is the director dotted into the radial direction. And this is what it looks like from the top if you look at the whole thing. But basically, if you have red, you have perpendicular arrangement of the molecules at the surface. If it's blue, it's parallel. If it's blue, it's parallel, and so on. And so then you see the sort of twisting, and it's twisting with the pitch axis parallel to the surface. And so, what's interesting here is that indeed you see the spherical confinement forces in defects. These double spiraled regions are sort of cholesteric focal conic domains, and they represent the location of a pitch defect. And you can tell because the blue region here, there's this intersection, and so the pitch is not well defined in that region. Okay, and there are two of them. Okay, and there are two of them. And so then that satisfies the topology where the line ordering is from the stripes that are formed by the codes. Okay, and so now experiments. How do we change the anchoring in experiments? Since we have, I showed you before, we use 5CB, that's an oil-like liquid crystal, so then you can use a surfactant, which has a water-loving head and an oil-loving tail. The oil-loving tail will want to stick into the liquid crystal, and then the liquid crystal will. Liquid crystal, and then the liquid crystal will want to lie sort of parallel to the tail, and so then perpendicular to the surface. And so, you control the perpendicular anchoring strength by controlling the concentration of the surfactant. And so, here we used a fluorescently labeled limin as our surfactant so that we can then see what their ordering is at the surface. And so, that's nice because now we see that the surfactant, as you change the concentration of the surfactant, you see here there's nice twisting. There are these double spiral patterns, it's twisting. Double spiral patterns, it's twisting without too much frustration at the surface where the lipid is located. But as you increase the concentration, you start to frustrate the twisting of the cholesterol more, so then you see more disordered patterns until no more twisting is allowed. And basically, all of the twisting is pushed away from the surface and into the bulb. May I ask? Yes, quick question. What is fluorescent in this system? Is it a surfaced? Yes, in fact, what you see is the umpoint. Yes, that's right. That's right. Onchoine, yes, that's right, that's right. So, it's not obvious that the onchoing should follow the cholesterol structure because it is what I mean? Ah, well, since the twisting of the cholesteric is the pitch axis is parallel to the surface, and so in the red regions, you would say that there are many molecules of the liquid crystal pointing out this way, but as it's twisting, the black regions are. Twisting, the black regions are parallel, and then you can see that the twisting is happening that way. Yes, but this is the cholesterol molecule that this is not the fluorescent pippy. That's right, and so the cholesterol is segregating also the surfactant at the inner field. This is what it means. Yes, exactly. Exactly. So then the surfactant, indeed, it's fluid at the surface and it has a preference for wanting to be in the oleotropic regions. You turn out the lights now. Oh. We'll turn them on and off as appropriate. Okay, there. Oh, yeah, so now you can see these black regions where it's sort of lipid is kind of depleted. It's not uniform everywhere, but yeah. Also depends on the type of surfactant that you use. I guess here we use DLPC. They have some affinity for each other too. And so that I think that can lead to heterogeneity on the surface. Okay. And so I won't talk about this too much, but I did use this. Too much, but I did use this. The sort of mechanism of surface patterning to use surface-active nanoparticles to pattern them at the surface. But okay, I won't talk about that here today, just pointing it out. Okay, and so now our model system, before I showed you, that was just at a flat film that was not at the surface of the shell that I had shown you earlier. At the shell, what you'll see here, this is just using a very common surfactant that's also found within the shell. Surfactant that's also found within hand soap, sodium domixyl sulfate. And here is what the shell looks like at a very high concentration of the surfactant. And so, what's happening here, you see these defect lines. These defect lines are within the bulk because the surface is saturated with the surfactant. It's not allowing twisting at the surface, and so this rapid, since it's frustrated and it has to twist very rapidly in the bulk, it creates these defect lines away from the surface. Okay. Okay, and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to sort of dilute the surrounding surfactant concentration, and then that makes the surfactant leave the surface, and so you'll see the anchoring weakening over time, and then different patterns will come. Okay, you see the stripe thickness is already decreasing with time. That tells you the homeotropic anchoring strength is decreasing with time. They don't change in a linear fashion because their surfactant is also going away in a nonlinear fashion. There's this instability that occurs until all of That occurs until all of the stripes disappear. And so, just to show you schematically, you're moving from this regime to then this regime. And then at the end, this here is when you have just the planner anchoring, the topology forces in a small local defect, which is a function. That's here. Okay. And so. Just a quick question. So you're slowly going from non-zero anchoring to zero? Non-zero, well, just the anchoring coefficient. I think the Anchoring coefficient? I think the I wouldn't say that I it okay, there's the Rapini popular anchoring energy, right? Yeah. I don't think homeotropic is forced in by is it zero in the Rapini popular term? Well, that's a homeotropic. Yeah, well it's going from homeotropic to then plan. Right. Right, so are you just basically taking that, or whatever you're doing as a quick? Or, whatever you're doing is equivalent to taking the coefficient that's in front of that, the weight, and just letting it decrease? You mean to change? Yeah, the same. In addition, you have to change the signal. Okay. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah, the signal. So you are changing. Sure. Okay. But the. But it's more complicated than only the. It's not going to zero. There's a. Yeah. Zero is somewhere. Okay, that's right. That's right. That's right. It'll be zero somewhere. But there there is an you know, there's an energy that's imposing here. Yes, be perpendicular, non-zero energy. And then here, be parallel, non-zero. Yeah. Why is one defect plus one? Oh, um, well. It should be two, right? Well, this one has a winding sense. Like, if you look at the index around it, it has plus, it's a plus two. And that changes depending on the thickness. Too, and that changes depending on the thickness of the shell. Okay. One more question. So, usually, when you fabricate these shells, you have like thickness is not in gems, right? That's true. Do you have this tissue here? I put in salt, then the salt helps to make the water a little heavier on the inside. Okay, you will be able to do it. And that helps it. I mean, it's not perfect, but it's not as bad. Okay. Yeah. But if the salt is problematic, I also sometimes use a D2. A-L-Matic, I also sometimes use a D2O, heavy water, and you can mix it in at different ratios to get it to be more dense than ratios. But okay. Here I go. Right, that's right. Okay, so here are the cholesteric focal conduct domains, these double spirals that I had shown you before. Here they are packing on the sphere. I won't talk too much about them today, but I want to point out that actually the focal conic domains deform the surface. We had mentioned at the beginning we were interested in. We had mentioned at the beginning they were interested in free interfaces. So we have seen, and this has also been seen in the literature, that each of these focal chronic domains form a little hill. And so then they deform the interface. And they need to deform the interface in order to respond. Okay, and so actually I'm going to talk about here this instability. What's interesting here is that this periodicity that we're seeing here is much larger than the natural periodicity of the system. It's much larger than the pitch of the coester. Larger than the pitch of the coister. And another interesting thing, why we call it an instability, is that if we leave this for, let's say, four hours, it goes away, always. I can't stabilize this pattern for a long time. It either collapses to this or it goes to having no strokes. And so now we're trying to understand why this happening. Okay, another thing to point out is that it's not just from moving from perpendicular anchoring to planar anchoring. Anchoring to planar anchoring. Going from planar to perpendicular, you also see this periodicity that's about double the size of the pitch. Again, much larger than the natural periodicity of the system. Okay, and so with MAX, we looked into this using, again, the Lano degen simulations. Here is a cross-section of a planar anchoring shell. And so same colour map as before, there's blue everywhere because that means the molecule is parallel to the surface. That means the molecule is parallel to the surface. And so here the pitch is oriented radially. And then here's that defect. So again, this is what Mohamed's question was. There's only one local defect that extends across the shell, and it has an index of plus two. But the only thing I want you to notice here is that the layers are sort of packed like an onion. Okay. And so now, if you impose, if you take this as an initial condition, and you impose a perpendicular anchoring strength. Perpendicular anchoring strength, like so, the system will relax, and you'll get at the end these stripes. And then the width of the stripes is equal to half of inch. But if you look at it in between, you do start to see this secondary periodicity emerging as you look at the top. It has to pass through this in order to get here. And if you compare the two, they don't look that different. If you compare the planar anchoring situation to this situation, the defect is still present. There's no addition. Is still present, there's no addition of new defects that are being introduced, but this onion-layered structure is just sort of undulating. And so it's the undulation of the cholesteric layers that seem to give rise to this additional periodicity. And what's interesting is that where the defect is located with respect to these layers is important. If you look at the cross-section that doesn't capture the defect, then it looks the same as this. You don't see any undulations. And so the undulations seem to be facilitated and the layer rearrangement. And the layer rearrangements are facilitated by the presence of the defense. Okay, and so now going the other way around, going from perpendicular anchoring to planar anchoring. Yes. Was the shell really that thick? Like the in the experiment? In the experiments, well, here also the scale is very low. I mean. Well, I mean, just the picture there. This picture. No, the simulation picture. Oh, yes. I mean is that the correct thickness for the experiment? This for the experiment? Uh, no. Okay. No. I mean, you see here, this is the width here is maybe like 200 microns. Well, I mean, the ratio. It's huge. I mean, like, a relative, but. Yeah, but still relative, no. That's right. It's hard to do because you want to fit in enough pitches into your system in order to capture it. But yeah. So it's sort of qualitative comparisons. But we look at the order of magnitude of the energy. The order of magnitude of the energy, because the elastic energy should still be quite comparable. But this is definitely one of the difficulties: you have this short-running scale, the pitch, and then you have the long-running scale, which is the whole system. It's very hard to mix those two. Yeah, I know. Maybe some businesses, yeah. Yeah. But the important point probably is that the structure that you find is. the structure that you find is double the double the pitch in the two two cases which suggests that capture yes yes that's right exactly thank you Amanda okay and so now changing the anchoring going from perpendicular into planar here we take just a vertically oriented pitch access with the shell this is the cross Pitch access with the shell. This is the cross section at the side, and at the top, we have this spiral. And if we take this as the initial condition, but actually impose a planar anchoring strength that's a bit weaker, we don't see the second periodic emerging in the simulations. And it's only if we impose a planar anchoring strength that's strong enough, where here we see the layers are there and the stripes are unwinding. So here it's unwinding to introduce more planner. It's unwinding to introduce more planar regions at the top and bottom. That then, at the top, here, we are interpreting this undulation here. It's again about twice the pitch as this secondary periodicity that's emerging with the changing anchorage strength. And so we only see it if you have a strong enough anchorage strength. And okay, and so that's actually very reminiscent of, I kept using the word undulation. There seems to be this critical anchoring strength. It reminded us a lot. Strength. It reminded us a lot of this classic system of having a cholesteric sample confined between two glass plates, and then you apply a magnetic field which will want to realign the molecules to be parallel to the field. And this is called the Helfer-Toreot instability. And this was initially studied in the 70s. And if you, yeah, in their model, you can get undulations in one dimension or also in two dimensions to get this sort of crate structure. A create structure. And so, okay, so we were inspired by this instability, this model in the 70s. I want to point out that this has been also studied in experiments. So, here this is from Oleg Lavrentovich's group, where they use a fluorescent microscopy to image the undulation of the layers with applied fields. It also was initially postulated for the formation of focal conic domains and smectics, where here it's not an applied field, but it's a change in the thickness of the sample. Change in the thickness of the sample. When you change the thickness of the sample, the preferred layer spacing is frustrated. And so now the layer still has to be able to fill in the thickness of your sample. And so it starts to undulate. And if it undulates too much, then it breaks up into many of these defects, forming this parabolic focal connectomine. Okay. And so now our proposed mechanism is that we don't have this bulk field, like a magnetic field, but by changing the anchoring at the surface, you're changing the alignment. You're changing the alignment of the molecules, you have to worry about the penetration depth of the anchoring, but it's sort of like using a surface tool. And so by changing the anchoring from either planar anchoring or perpendicular anchoring, you're frustrating the layer spacing near the surface. And so then the layers near the surface will want to alter. And then we modified the, with Max, we modified the Helper-Turot model to have just this surface term, and indeed. This surface term, and indeed, we got this critical anchoring strength that matches what we saw in simulations and is also reasonable for what you would expect with surfactants. And indeed, the critical wavelength is twice as much, which is what we also see in experiments at the same pitch. So, nice. But okay, and so the pandemic hit. I can go into the lab. Max and I were chatting, and we also were thinking about how lamellar systems are everywhere. And so, this health ratio instability should be applicable to all. Should be applicable to all lamellar systems. And so recently we wrote this review paper. It's been accepted, which is very exciting. And we think it applies to all fluid lamellar systems. And so diblock copolymers, lamellar surfactants, you can see them break up into sort of these, I would loosely say, focalconic domains. And then the breakup and the onset of these undulations or this herringbone structure can be described with the same Helfer Turot mechanism. Helferturomechanism, cellulose nanocrystals, so that's at the colonial scale, they form a cholesteric structure, and indeed they also undulate, or even ferromagnetic domains that are lamellar in structure. And so a little bit more about my group, future directions, since we've only really been working for two years. Now I will start to introduce preliminary data, all stuff that's unpublished. And so we have different directions. So we have different directions. We're working on looking at particle assembly at the interface of the liquid crystal, seeing how the assemblies change with shape. And so we were also interested in probing if you change the shape, you also change the arrangements of the chemistry at the surface and how they interact with the liquid crystal, and how does that then affect the elastic field to get them to assemble with one another. We're also moving to the colloidal scale, working with cellulose nanocrystals, and so this. Nanocrystals, and so this is a colloidal liquid crystal that forms a choleceric phase because the cellulose itself is a chiral molecule. It crystallizes to form these also chiral crystals, which then if you concentrate them, then you can get them to form this ordering. And the same thing actually happens with chitin, which is why Mohammed had flashed this before. Beetles, the chitin that makes up the beetle shell also forms these double spiral focal conic domain structures. Spiral focal conic domain structures, and it's the reason why they're so brightly green. And the reason why, also, the color of the green is sort of angle-independent is because they're forming this vocal comet structure. So that's something really interesting, and we want to be able to reproduce that in the lab to maybe make structurally colored pigments. And then lastly, we're also thinking about active liquid crystals and having them in confined systems to sort of better understand what's happening at these large scales. Better understand what's happening at these larger length scales and how confinement is important, confinement and activity. And so, yes, I guess also one thing to point out is that in terms of activity, if you have a activity within a cholesterol liquid crystal, then that can also introduce these undulations. And there isn't an experimental system of an active cholesteric yet, but I dug into the literature since cholesteric ordering is very prevalent in biomaterials. Here is the cell wall. Here is the cell wall of a Hmong bean seedling, and in the elongation zone where the Hmong bean seedling is expanding and growing, indeed, you also see these undulations. And the undulations, I mean, from the pictures that I saw on their paper, do seem to be about twice the size of the bridge. Okay, and so I had already explained this. The beetle has these polygonal domains. The polygonal domains are formed from the focal conic domains of the cholesteric, from the Cholesteric from the chitin ordering itself. And so, using a higher resolution microscope, an atomic force microscope, you see these double-spiral patterns. And then, because it's chiral, it's also sensitive to circulating polarized light. So, this has a circuit wave polarized filter, and that's why it appears black. And again, you do see this in synthetic cholesterol, also. And so, one project that we're working on now is going from moving from the small scale to large scale using what we know. To large scale, using what we know from this small molecule, trying to understand how we can form these focal conic structures with this larger system. And so here is an electron microscopy photo of a cross-section of the dried up crystals formed from the cellulose. And so you can see the twisting structure very nicely. The twisting here from the scale bar is on the order, it's sub-micron. And so then that shows that it can have photonic response. So, then that shows that it can have photonic response. And so, that's why you're able, if you take it and you condense it, you can form light and so form color. And so, this is a project from my graduate student, Diogo. And so, working also with Marioline Dijkstra here, if you take it and you condense it, this is photos that he took in the lab, where if you just dry it, then indeed you can get this very iridescent feel. And we're trying to control the iridescence. One thing that's interesting, though, is that Mario Line had looked. That's interesting, though, is that Mario Line had looked at if you take just the single crystallite and had that be chiral and have it twist according to what you would see, what you would see in experiments, that's not enough to capture the pitch that you would need to get this photonic structure. And so here we're now working and looking at the bundles of these rods together, which is formed natively in the plant material. And so that allows for it to form, to twist enough and To twist enough and see how the chirality transfer works so you can sort to get a new structural. Can you say this again? What is the part about the two-lane scales being wrong? The two, yes. If you don't have, like here, these are rods that are twisted with respect to each other, so they have a much larger twist than, say, if you take the single rod, what you would measure is that it twists very lightly, like maybe two microns twisting. And then, if you do simulations of just Twisting. And then, if you do simulations of just the rods that aren't attached to each other, then they don't form a cholesterol, but it's a massive pitch. And it's only if you have like a different geometry, which indeed in experiments you see them clumping together. It's a very messy polywhisper system. So you need to, right now we're still trying to see exactly what is the twisted structure in the experiments. But yeah, using this model, you can get shorter pitches. And so understanding chirality transfer from the cellulose model. Transfer from the cellulose molecule to this. It's like a chromatic cholesterol. Yeah. Yeah, you could say that. It's polydispersed in the same way, too. Okay, lastly, I know I'm running out of time, but just showing a little bit of colloidal work where I was interested in the confinement of colloidal pneumatics. You're able to grow silica nanorods. And so here is work done from my postdoc, Ethan, where if you do Where, if you just have Teos and then you hydrolyze it, it can hydrolyze in an asymmetric way to form these rods, which is nice. And this is work also with Alphons and Blaterin. And again, with Marioline, we were trying to see what happens if you take this, sediment it, so that you can put it within wells that are these rectangular wells so that you can force in these defects. And so I was interested in looking at the defects that are formed to try to see: well, can you back out elastic constants of these colloidal systems? Of these colloidal systems. And the reason why we were interested in that is because I'm ultimately curious about controlling the anchoring of colloidal liquid crystals. So for molecular liquid crystals where you have rubbing of polymer on a glass surface, you can, from elastic interactions, have the molecules want to align parallel to the rubbing. And so that's because if it's perpendicular, then you see here there's a lot of splay, here there's a lot of bend, and it's only if they're parallel to these undulations. If they're parallel to these undulations, that there's not so much distortion introduced. And so this is called the Behrman model. But if you start to have features or undulations that approach the size of the messogen, you can't apply that. What elastic model can you use to describe this? It's more from excluded volume interactions. But from excluded volume interactions, can you say, given the periodicity and amplitude of these features, Amplitude of these features, what anchoring strength would you ultimately get for the colloidal liquid crystal? And so, this is something that we're interested in looking at. And so, here we fabricated this using lithography, having just a confinement feature that has these corrugated walls. And we can change the amplitude and the pitch of that. And from simulations from Marline and her postdoc, we can see from varying the pitch and the amplitude: here you have planner anchoring at the Here you have planar anchoring at the wall here, so it's only on one side, and blue indicates parallel to the wall. At some region, you also start to get perpendicular anchoring, but there's some region in between where you actually get mixed anchoring. And so the fact that there's mixed anchoring kind of implies that it's comparable to the elastic energy that's within the bulb. And so we're trying to see, can you look at the structures that are formed here, back out what are the elastic constants, and maybe see from that? And maybe see from that when you have this mixed anchoring regime, it has to be pretty comparable to the anchoring to then back out from the excluded volume that's here whether you can determine the anchoring constant. Okay, and so with that, I'll just leave up my conclusions. Thank you very much to my collaborators in this work, Max, Teresa, who will speak later in the week, Randy, and also Christophe Bluff at Walt Later. And of course, you for your attention. Thank you. So we have a few minutes for questions. When you put the collagen crystals, remember that you form a pneumatic test. Do you shake them? What do you do? Just from sedimentation, you can control the concentration of them within the solution. And then, yeah, since it's sort of like a lyotropic crystal, just with colloids, if you have a high enough concentration, and depending on the aspect ratio of the rods, you can get. On the aspect ratio of the rods, you can get a pneumatic to form. I mean, sometimes when we use rods that are too short, we get stuck in smectic. And then we don't. They form a smectic. They can, yeah, even at too high of a concentration. And until you show the pictures of the blue, I mean, are they confined in a square? I mean, in a rectangular shape, right? Here? Yeah. Yeah, so here the idea. Well, this is just a simulation, a 2D simulation. But why you say that this one is property on the layer? Oh, against this wall. Against the wall. So it's planar here, but up here, I mean, there's a region here where there's this corrugation, and that has perpendicular anchoring. And then here, that has planaring. Yeah. Saying at the top, it's heterogeneous. Yeah, it's heterogeneous. Anchoring at the top. Yeah. This was my question exactly here on the previous one. Say it's mixed. So I don't understand very much. So I don't understand very much what favours planner ongoing, especially because it looks to be perpendicular to the congregation that you show. Well, the previous slide, just the previous slide, no, or the next slide, sorry. Yes, this one. The planar one is perpendicular to the congregation, so there is not any specific planar direction that is favourable. So I wonder, do you tweet, do you consider that? Do do you tweet do you consider that as a mixture or do you consider that as a that way to tilted alcohol? But it's not very clear to me, I guess. Yeah, I mean it's not clear to me if it would be tilted anchoring and maybe if you think about tilted anchoring for a mixture between plana and homotropic, I don't understand very well. And is it enough wedge tilted or it's value mixture? Well the the I mean the corrugations are symmetric. I mean, the corrugations are symmetric. There's no tilt in the angle, so it's not like we're putting in a preferred tilt. So that's why I sort of just called it, yeah, heterogeneous anchoring. It seems to not have an excluded volume that's preferable for having all of the molecules to be perpendicular to it. It's still ongoing right now. But if you have any ideas about maybe taking from this discrete model and thinking. From this discrete model and thinking about it in terms of the continuum elasticity models, I would be interested in hearing your thoughts about that. Yeah. The question about the uh this cellulose now, the cellulose crystals and everything. So, if you want to create something like a cholesterol carbonic. Something like a constructive carbonic, or eventually maybe use this ability. Do you have an idea of what you can use as a map for the encryption? That's true. Because you can't just use a surfactant. There's no colloid that will preferentially want to be at the colloid-air interface. So we are looking at taking some of these cellular sanitarystals and doping them with. Those standard crystals and doping them with iron oxide, so that then some of them will be actuatable with a magnetic field. Some, but not all. And so then, if you do that, then maybe only some of them will form these homeotropic regions in the stripes, and then you can force these focal tonic domains to form. But the synthesis is tricky. We've been spending a few months trying to perfect those synthesis. Yeah. One more question. So, you did this experiment with. Question. So, you did this experiment with the color crystal, right? The one with the silica rod? Do they do a Brownian motion? Yes. Brownian diffusion? Experiment. Yes, you see them fluctuate. If they're too large, though, I mean, I guess here, this is one of the larger rods that we've made. It's true you have to worry about the gravitational length of the particles. Are they able to hop over each other? And for the much larger ones, they struggle. The width, the gravitational length is maybe. Width, the gravitational length is maybe only half the size of the rod, and so that's trouble. But you can make some of them thinner, and that's also something that we've been trying to perfect the synthesis of these rods. And if they're thinner, then they are able to really fluctuate and populate. That is something that's important for you to not get a kinetically stuck system. Any more questions? Any more questions? Thank you for talking. Thanks to everyone in the room for a great first day, and to those of you who are still online, thank you for sticking it out. I know it's quite late for some of you. And we will reconvene tomorrow.
