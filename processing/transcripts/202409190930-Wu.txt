And today I will talk about some recent results about the Navy stocks Cahillia equation for the two-phase flow with the interaction with chemical species. The Navy Stocks Cahiller equation belongs to the framework of diffuse interface for the two phase flow or the Two phase flow or the binary mixtures. And in this model, the free interface between the two components of the fluid mixture is approximated by a thin layer with a very small constant epsilon. And the diffuse interface model can describe the motion of free interface in the Euler coordinates, and it has. Coordinate and it has some advantages both in the mathematic analysis and also the numeric analysis. And the model I'm going to talk is about the binary mixture of incompressible physical synew fluid and also with soluble chemical species. So basically speaking, the whole system consists of two parts. The first part is the Navy stock. The first part is the Navy Stocks calculated system for the fluid mixture, and we have another additional equation of the advection diffusion reaction type for the chemical species. And this type of model is also closely related to some recent work about tumor growth modeling in the literature. First, let me introduce the basic setting. The unknown variables. The unknown variables is the difference of volume fractions of the binary mixture. So, physically speaking, the value of phi should take its value between minus one and one. And the average density is very simple. It can be viewed as a linear average of the density of the two components. And here we use the average velocity, which is average. Velocity, which is average according to the volume, so it is also a linear combination of the other parameter phi. And finally, we have unknown variable sigma, which denotes the density of the chemical species. The model is based on the following total energy. The energy consists of three parts. The first part is the kinetic energy for the Part is the kinetic energy for the microscopic fluid. And the second part is the mixing energy for the two components of the fluid. And we also have the interaction energy for the chemical species. Especially, probably the most simple case for the interaction energy can be described in the following form. And the first part is the density for the chemical species. For the chemical species, and the second part characterized the interaction between the chemical density and also the fluid mixture. And here, chi sigma and chi phi are some parameters which is non-negative. And of course, we require chi sigma is strictly positive. And the interaction energy reflects the effect of chemotaxis and active transport. Texas and active transport in the system. This can be seen easily from the mass flags of the system. For instance, the mass flags for the fluid mixture is given in the following way. And we can see that the generalized diffusion is also driven by the gradient of the chemical species. And we call this part is the chemotatic effect. And on the other hand, in the diffusion of the chemical species, Diffusion of the chemical species, we see that the mass flux is also influenced by the gradient of the order parameter. So the density or the composition of the binary mixture also can influence the diffusion of the chemical species. And based on the total energy, we can use a variation method. variation method based basically based on the mass mass conservation and also the second law of thermodynamics to derive the flowing full system. So it's too complicated and just mentioned that it consists the Navi-Stokes equation for the fluid mixture and it consists of the fourth order conhelier equation to describe the separation. Separation process of the two components, and also the last equation for the dynamics of the chemical density. And our model gives a full Navy-Stokes description of the fluid mixture. And actually, in the modeling for the tumor growth, the fluid equation can be replaced, for instance, by the Darsis equation, or it's a realized version. We call it bring. Realize the version, we call it a Brinkman's equation. And the second remark is that the mixing energy is up for Ginsburg-Langdown type. And in particular, the non-linearity psi usually takes the following form. The most typical form is the one with the logarithmic potential. And we call this potential singular because it's derivative. Derivative is singular near the pure phase minus one and one. And due to this singularity, we have some difficulties in the mathematical analysis. So in the literature, it is often approximated by a polynomial. Or sometimes we take the deep quenching limit, let the parameter zeta go to zero to have the double obstacle potential. Double obstacle potential. So let's look at a simplified system that we are going to study. We assume that the density of the fluid is a constant and we do not sink the mass exchanger outside with the environment. So, and we assume that the mobility coefficient are constant. So, then the system can be reduced to the Can be reduced to the following form: the Navi-Stokes equation, coupled with the incompressibility condition for the mixture, and coupled with the Cahelian equation for phi and also the advection, diffusion, reaction equation for sigma. And of course, here we need some boundary conditions to study its well-posedness. And here, and I also would like to make Here, and I also would like to mention that we simplify the possible mass transport by a linear term. This term is closely related to the so-called Onong's term for the separation for block copolymers in the literature. So, for simplicity, we just consider the simple boundary conditions. For instance, for the fluid mixture, we consider no slip. Mixture, we consider no sleep boundary condition. And for the other variables phi, mu, and sigma, we just consider the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. And of course, in the modeling, other types of boundary conditions can be also analysis, but here we just focus on this simplified one. Let us recall some literature. First, our system can First, our system consists of the classical Navy-Stokes-Cahillier equation for the incompressible two-phase flow in the literature, which is referred to as model H. There is a huge literature on the mathematic analysis and also numerical analysis. And in particular, our system also consists of the Navy-Stokes Congo-ONO system as a subsystem, which has also been an Which has also been analysis in the literature, for instance, by Bossier, Glassili, and Milabia in 2012 for the case of regular potential, and also by Milabia and Roger Tai Mang in 2016 for the singular potential case. And we would like to mention that due to the mass transport term of the ones type for the case of singular potential, they are For the case of singular potential, there are many open problems concerning the well-posedness and the long-time behavior of the system. And for the system under consideration, we have the first results about the global web postness for the case with regular potential in 2019 with Professor K-Feng Lang from Hong Kong. And in that case, And in that case, we can prove the existence of global weak solution, both 2D and 3D, and also the existence and the uniqueness for the global strong solution in 2D. But we were not able to prove, for instance, the uniqueness of global weak solution in 2D. This is because of the coupling structure. For instance, in the sigma equation, we also have the cross-dipped. We also have the cross-diffusion structure. And this is not so easy to handle. And on the other hand, another difficulty comes from the use of the regular potential. Although it is easier to be solved. However, the conhelier equation is a fourth order one. So it cannot keep the parameter phi belongs to minus one and one anymore. And this brings extra difficulties to obtain useful estimates. For estimates. So the solution is we go back to the original physical potential of the, for instance, the logarithmic type. In this case, we can keep the order parameter takes its value between minus one and one. So in this case, my student, Jing Ying He obtained the existence of global weak routing in Of global weak solutions in both 2D and 3D, and also the uniqueness of global weak solutions in 2D, which is similar to the Navy stock case. And later, with my student Jeannie Hu, we also proved the existence and the uniqueness of a global strong solution. And in particular, we can show that the order parameter is always strictly separated from the pure. Strictly separated from the pill phase during its evolution. This means that the global strong solution can be actually smooth if we assume, for instance, the boundary, the domain is smooth by the regularity theory of the parabolic equations. So the main topic of today is how about the global weak or strong solutions in three-dimensional case. And to achieve this goal, we find And to achieve this goal, we find that we need some further understanding of the coupling structure of the system. In order to achieve the goal, we found there are some problems in the original system. So we propose the following modified system in the following way. So here you can see that I rewrite the chemical potential into this form. And here, capital N is the inverse of my N is the inverse of minus Laplacian subject to the Neumann homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. And at the same time, the Massour's term in the Kahelian equation has been replaced by this non-local one. And here, phi bar means the spatial average of the order parameter. And by the definition of the operator capital N, you can see that if alpha and beta equals to each other, Alpha and beta equals to each other. Then in the Cahelian equation, we recover the ornament. But here, we have some additional contribution in the chemical potential mu. And this is the first modification. And this modification has another consequence. For instance, in the Navy stocks equation, in the force, we have the non-local effect due to this part. This means that in the capillary. That in the capillary force near the free interface, the non-local effect also takes place. So, why we need to do this? We will explain later. So, to form our results, I just present a set of standard assumptions on the physicality function and also on the singular potential. You don't need to look into details, just remember that this set of assumptions is valid for the logarithmic potential that we are interested in. And finally, we have some basic assumptions for the coefficients of the system. So, what is the effect of the structure? So, the first one is: if alpha is larger or equal than zero, we have Is larger or equal than zero, we have a nice dynamics for the mass of the system. We can see that the average spatial average of all the parameters satisfy this very simple relation. And if the spatial average of y0 equals to z0, or if alpha equals to zero, we have the mass conservation. Otherwise, if alpha is larger than zero, then we see that we see that. we see that we see that the spatial average of the parameter will decay exponentially fast to the given constant z0 so this is the math dynamics and also we have the energy relation recall that we have modified a little bit our system this modification actually comes from the modification of the free energy and here we Energy and here we have additional non-local interaction in the original free energy. This corresponds to the well-known Ota-Kawasaki interaction for the binary mixture. And with this modification, then we see that the energy balance of the modified system has a better energy production rate. For instance, if you look at this, we already already. If you look at this, we already showed that the coefficient phi bar minus Z0 is either zero or exponentially decaying. So if we can control the spatial average of the chemical potential, then this part can be controlled. It will not cause you any difficulty. But without this modification, we see that the energy balance is not so good and we Is not so good, and we do not have the nice behavior of the energy of the system. So, the first result is about the global well-posness considering the global strong solution. So, this is a joint work with my student, Jeannie He also. So, basically, because our system contains the three-dimensional Navy stocks, we cannot Dimensional Navy stocks, we cannot expect the existence of a global strong solution for arbitrary large data. But so we consider the small initial data. But because the system has many non-trivial steady states, so we cannot say the small perturbation of zero, but a small perturbation of a local minimizer of the free energy. So if the initial data is sufficiently regular and And be close to zero for the initial velocity, and also phi and sigma be close to the local minimizer of the free energy, then we have the unique global strong solution, which still stay close to the local minimizer. And moreover, in the three-dimensional case, the other parameter is still strictly separated from the pure phase minus one and From the pure phase minus one and the plus one. Moreover, we have the following long-time behavior, such that the velocity will convergence to zero as time goes to infinity. And other parameter, also the chemical density will converge in a certain steady state of the system as time goes to infinity with a certain convergence rate. convergence rate. And here, phi infinity and sigma infinity is the steady state of the system. However, I would like to mention that because the free energy is not convex for our system. So we may have many steady states in the high dimensional case. So in order to prove this type of long-time behavior, we need to use the energy dissipation structure. The energy distribution structure I have mentioned before, and also with the Fossi-Saugeimo approach. But this process is a little bit involved, so I just skip the detailed proof. So our next result is about global weak solution. First, we can show that based on the energy relation, if the initial energy is bounded, then we can prove the Bounded, then we can prove the existence of at least one global weak solution for all time. And those regularity properties basically follows from the energy relation for our system. And the proof is many based on the energy dissipation structure and also the semi-Galaging scheme. The next question is: how about the The next question is: How about the regularity? Because we already know that the global strong solution can exist under some special assumption of the initial data. But for the global weak solution, can we say that it will become regular after a certain time? So, our expectation is that it's like Navy stocks in three-dimensional case. So, the solution will be The solution will eventually become regular after sufficiently large time. But this is not straightforward. For instance, for the Navy-Stokes equation, you need a weak strong uniqueness to prove this. However, for the system consisting of the Alan-Kahn equation, no, the Kahillier equation with a singular potential, we need the strict separation property of the solution to. Solution phi to obtain the weak, strong uniqueness results. But unfortunately, for the three-dimensional Cahidian equation, the strict separation property is not for free. Especially for the logarithmic potential, we don't have that. Of course, if you walk close to the steady state, it's fine. But here, for the global weak solution, we do not have such kind of restrictions. For restriction on the initial data. So, the idea of the proof comes from the recent work of Abel Gag and Georgini for the Navy-Stokes-Cahelian equation. But here, we need to further consider the interaction between the equation of sigma. So, the result is like this: all the parameters, chemical potential, and the chemical. Chemical potential and the chemical density will regularize immediately after time is positive. And next, after sufficiently large time, the other parameter will be strictly separated from minus one and plus one. And then after that, we can show the regularization of the fluid velocity and again on the chemical species. So let me just quickly. So let me just quickly give you the idea of the proof. First, we can work with the fluid velocity of the low regularity like the Lurie-Hoff solution, which is the global weak one. And we study the Kahelian diffusion system with the confraction term. For system, we can say that the order parameter and also sigma, the chemical density, regulize immediately if time. Immediately, if time is positive. But however, due to the second-order nature of the sigma equation and the low regularity of the fluid velocity, the sigma only partially regularizes. But its regularity is sufficiently for us to prove weak, strong uniqueness for the solution to derive the regularization effect. Effect. And then we use a dynamic approach by the omega limit set to show that after sufficiently large time, the other parameter is strictly separated. And then this enables us to use a relative energy method to derive the weak-strong uniqueness. And finally, we can apply the results. The equate the result for the Navy stocks to conclude that after sufficiently large time, our fluid velocity will regalize also. Okay, so basically we have presented some results on the global web process and the regularity propagation of global solutions in three-dimensional case for the Navi-Stocks calculated system. And of course, we And of course, we are just working in the simplified case, and there are many open problems to be worked in the future. For instance, the case of unmatched densities. The calheelated dynamics has the non-local events itself, and also we consider more complicated mass source terms. Okay, my talk is thank you very much.
