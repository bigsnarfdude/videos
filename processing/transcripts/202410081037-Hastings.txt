Welcome. Our next speaker is Alan Hastings, UC Davis. And I'm sure everyone knows who he is, but he's going to talk today about spatial synchrony and spatial temporal dynamics. So welcome, Alan. I will stand up and go like this when there's five minutes left. Okay. All right. Thanks. Thanks, Mark. And thanks for the opportunity to talk. And I'm really sorry. Opportunity to talk, and I'm really sorry I can't be there in person. So, seeing the talks that surround mine, I decided at the very last minute to switch what I'm going to talk about. And this is a little bit daring because usually I can't explain this in even a longer slot. But so I may kind of go quickly through a few things and then you can ask questions or look at papers later. Or look at papers later. So, oh, now the acknowledgements for collaborators and both current and past. And if we're going to talk about synchrony, I need to define what I mean by synchrony. And here it's shorthand for spatial synchrony. So think that there's multiple locations with oscillating populations. Oscillating populations. And at any location, we can assign a phase to the oscillator. So, synchrony across space means that oscillating populations at different locations have the same phase. And there's lots of cases in ecology where you get two cycles, up, down, high, low. And so, there there's just two phases, and that will be featured prominently here. So, I'm going to mention just three quickly. I'm going to mention just three quickly, three different approaches one might use. You can, there's well-developed mathematical theory for coupled oscillators. There's a lot that's actually focused on weakly coupled oscillators that was developed in the context of neuroscience applications. And if you have a large number of oscillators with two cycles, those are things that have been looked at in statistical physics. And so to amplify what I've just said, To amplify what I've just said, look at the red, two are a small number for coupled oscillators. The neuroscience is relaxation oscillators, and the classic physics model is the Ising model. And I could, if I could see better, I would ask for a show of hands of how many people are familiar with the Ising model. And maybe I will do that. I think I can see enough. How many people are really familiar with the Ising model? Some are, some aren't. And first, though, this is one of the things that I'm going to do. First, though, this is one of the classic examples of synchrony in an ecological system. And this is measles, and these are counts of measles in cities in England and Wales in data collected by Brian Grenfell. And on the bottom half, there's a color coding that I'm not giving you. In the very top, that graph is for London. And what you see, if you can see this blue line here, that's when vaccination, quote-unquote, That's when vaccination, quote unquote, started. It wasn't obviously instantaneous. And measles went from synchronous to non-synchronous or much less synchrony across space. And then we can see the synchrony to the non-synchrony. Another example of synchrony in ecology that's well developed is a bit still in Canada, but east of where you all are. In eastern Canada, this is the outbreak of the eastern. Is the outbreak of the eastern spruce budworm? And what you can see is the number of cells defoliated as a function of time. And what you're seeing here is that these are dramatic. This is a log scale. This is a dramatic oscillation, and it's synchronized over a fairly large geographic area. And why is this? Why is this not? Let me. There we go. An older review paper by Sandy Leibold and colleagues emphasized the idea that synchrony is found in ecological systems across scales ranging from even somewhere there's well laboratory systems, there it is, microcosms up to essentially thousands or thousand kilometer scales. One of the prime examples. One of the prime examples of synchrony is what's known as masting in plants, where they alternate or go between or among very heavy years. And these are lots and lots of acorns illustrated here, the years when there's very few. So lots of examples in nature. One that's in the headlines in the U.S. recently, there are periodical cicadas, depending on the location, every 13 or 17 years, and there are a bunch of others. And there are a bunch of others. And it would be very little to explain if everything just synchronized, but some do and some don't. Some childhood diseases, for example, I showed you that measles went from synchrony to asynchrony. Actually, pertussis went the other direction from asynchrony to synchrony. And so there is something to explain. And it's potentially important, both because of Both because of basic understanding and also in terms of applications. And so I'm going to go further and point out that we have some good data. Todd Rosenstock was a grad student in the class I taught, and that's how I first heard about this fantastic data set that he collected working with Patrick Brown, who was his supervisor for his PhD. And what this is, and let's see if I can get this to play. And this is sad. I don't seem to be. Let's see. Maybe if I do turn this off. New. How do I get this to play? Well, this is sad, but saves some time. This is how pistachios are harvested. This machine comes along. This machine comes along and shakes the trees. A little bit of physics or mathematics, it shakes at a frequency, which is the resonant frequency of the pendulum formed by the nuts. Pistachios are small, so they actually catch them, and therefore you can measure the yield from every tree. And so, this is the data set: 4,000 trees over a six-year period, individual yields. These are grafted on the top. Grafted on the top onto an outcrossing or dioecious rootstock below the graft. Above the graft, they're genetically identical. And sort of a technical bit is that means that some earlier explanations don't work, is that in pistachios, they're separate male and female trees. To give you an idea, this is to an ecologist would be a very good two-cycle. This is a subset of the trees, obviously, and obviously. The trees, obviously, and obviously it's not a perfect two-cycle, but highs tend to follow lows. Now, I'll give you a better reference to this paper that we and model we developed, led by Shadi Ezmaili. We're looking at the description of how masting in plants works. There was an earlier There was an earlier model that had some issues that didn't seem to work right for what we were trying to do. And here to illustrate conceptually what's going on in this very carefully illustrated model, the carbon the next year as a function of the carbon this year, it's shaped like a Ricker model because, and many insects have population dynamics, but of course, here we measure the nuts. We measure the nuts. And first studies were done with the Ricker model in our studies. And then we developed this better model, which basically has a bifurcation diagram like the Ricker model or the logistic model or lots of other similar models. And we're going to keep focusing on parameter values that put us in the two-cycle regime. This is the dynamics through time, either mentioning, measuring nuts. Either measuring nuts or the resources, and as we increase the amount of noise or stochasticity, environmental stochasticity. Now, this is the data set of the trees. The missing bits are because of this data was collected by somebody. Actually, this is a commercial orchard, and the data was collected not for the period purpose we're putting it to, but to understand what's called. To but to understand what's called precision agriculture. And so this is the yield per tree. They actually get, as you see, a huge amount per tree, 20 to 50 kilograms. And basically, ecological data is noisy, and you see that this is pretty noisy. Dynamics are complex. So we'd like explanations that are detail independent. And that is what statistical mechanics is all about. Statistical mechanics is all about, and concepts that physicists like to talk about called universality. And so we're going to do this with, and we're going to use the ISIM model, which talks about magnets. And this part, the first part of it was developed in collaboration with John Makta at the University of Massachusetts, and then Andrew Noble, who was a postdoc on. A postdoc on the project and then a research scientist. This was our first attempt where we attempted to write something understandable to both ecologists and physicists. I think we, by trying to make it understandable to both, maybe it ended up being understandable to neither. But here we go. So the IC model emphasizes the idea that a magnet at a macro scale is achieved by having magnets at the micro scale. Having magnets at the micro scale be synchronized. And magnets, as you probably are familiar, have two states, up and down. And that corresponds in a way that I'll indicate in a little bit to a two-cycle. And lots of fruit trees do this, actually, alternate bearing, not just pistachio. Olives are one extreme example. So the simplest would be, in keeping with what Yuan was mentioning beforehand, to have just two. Was mentioning beforehand to have just two coupled systems. So we have two configurations. This, one of them, either one is either a plus one or a minus one, with one representing up, minus one representing down. And we can get the global measure of synchrony by taking the average of the states where we assign one to up and minus one to down. Keep that in mind. So we have. So we have four possible configurations. Two are magnetic, two are not, magnetic if they're aligned, non-magnetic if they're not. And the energy, well, it takes energy to put things into the non-magnetic state. And so these two have require more energy, these two require less. And for the physicist, the energy. Physicist, the energy is thought of as being represented by temperature, and you can define the probability of a configuration that depends on the energy in the system. And there's the energy, which is the temperature, and Z is just a normalization constant. And so order prevails at low temperature, and disorder prevails at high temperature. This also makes intuitive sense. Skipping a bunch, we can do the Skipping a bunch, we can do the same thing for a system with an arbitrary number of sites. And in this case, we assume that the energy required only depends on the sum of the interactions between nearest neighbors. Order prevails at low temperature, disorder at high temperature. And once again, we have this global measure of the synchrony. The synchrony in the system or the order in the system. And so for large n, and this is a physics representation that for small temperature, things are completely ordered because there's not enough energy to make anything but have all the sites aligned at high temperatures. Every site behaves independently, and there's a critical temperature at A critical temperature at which you have correlations of all orders and a bunch of other things. So, what we first did is we used the Ricker model. It works for others. This is the standard Ricker model that I'm sure is familiar to most, if not all, of you. It assumes non-overlapping generations and well-mixed populations. You can see that the The bifurcation diagram is very similar to what turned out to be our better model for seed production of a carbon-limited plant system and for some reason we need to hide that. And then what we have is the spatial dynamics or noisy coupled 2D map based on local dynamics given by the Ricker model and exchange with the four nearest neighbors. And you get incoherence when noise is large. And what this is doing is flipping between successive generations. Collective synchronization when noise is small. Noise is small in a 256 by 256 lattice, and this is again successive generation, so it's either up, down, up, down. And then at the critical point, at a particular value of the noise in our model, you get something which visually looks very much like the Ising model at its critical point. And basically, one of the things is. One of the things is that the ecological model has a continuous variable. So we have to discretize this. We call values of the model above one high and below or below the mean. Above the mean we call high, below the mean we call low. And this is a crude representation of crude data, which is probably the right thing to do. We can then define a synchronization order parameter. A synchronization order parameter and note the stuff in red because I always have to remind myself that whether or not a particular location is up or down is not whether the population is high or low, but is it high in an even year or is it high in an odd year? And so we use the phase to define the state of that site. So the phase So the phase has two possibilities here because we're in a two-cycle. And once we do that, then we can look at the order parameter for the Ising model and four different versions of ecological models, and we can do two different comparisons. One is, in some sense, the order parameter against a control parameter, and the other is the correlation. And the other is the correlation length against the control parameter. And the fact that the ecological models line up perfectly with the Ising model suggests, more than suggests, it basically demonstrates that in the vicinity of the critical point, in some sense, only in the vicinity of the critical point, but at least in the vicinity of the critical point, we have essentially recreated the Ising model with these dynamic. With these dynamic ecological models. And what's interesting, as I will emphasize in a little bit, is that this is interesting because the Ising model is not dynamic. It's just the same sense, the absymptotic behavior. So this is another way of emphasizing what I just said is that the onset of synchronization in cycles in population biology corresponds to the onset of magnetization in statistical physics. In statistical physics. If we go back to the agroecology and look at that, we have the results for the coupled Ricker map and other models imply that we might expect similar behavior for these masting plants because of the bifurcation diagram and the overall structure looks a lot similar. And so we do get things for the data. Things for the data that look very much like things near the critical point in the IZ model. We normalize the tree production. We then look at basically highs and lows, and there's lots of missing data. Now, at this point, what we've done is figured out and shown that That something that has local coupling would produce dynamics that are similar to what we truly seem to observe in this orchard. And I will ask you, and since I'm not there, I can't really do this. And last time when I asked this, I got answers I was surprised at. What do you think the coupling between neighboring trees must be? Neighboring trees must be. And I'll give you 10 seconds to think of the answer, and then I'll go on. And if you said competition, well, that goes in the wrong direction because the coupling has to be positive coupling. And so this is one of the things that is really intriguing here is that there has to be Really intriguing here is that there has to be some positive coupling. And there's two positive aspects. One are mycorrhizae, little organisms that live on the roots, essentially, and have to do with fixing nitrogen. And the other would be root grafting, which is roots that actually exchange. Roots of plants are not sort of like humans. They sort of are things which are a little bit more vague between. A little bit more vague between what roots are and soil is, so they can actually come together. And what's really intriguing here is that two genera that prominent examples of root grafting, pines and oaks, these are the same two genera that are the most prominent examples of masting this idea of spatial synchrony of production in natural systems. So you can now use these to look at other questions, these ideas. Other questions, these ideas. And for example, what's the relative role of random events and the deterministic aspects in producing population cycles? So in the last few minutes that I have, I'm just going to sort of tell you things without even giving you as much detail as the limit I have now. Is that we showed that and compared noise-induced. Noise-induced versus intrinsic oscillations in ecological systems. That's a very big question. And what we're able to do is to show that if you look at an individual oscillator, you really can never tell. If you looked at two oscillators, it's harder. But if you look at collective behavior across a whole orchard, you can distinguish. And this uses ideas based on what we did in the Isingman. In the Ising model, we have the synchronization order parameter. If you have an isolated pair against the noise level and a parameter that measures the deterministic tendency to cycle R in a, say, a logistic model, excuse me, a Ricker model or our carbon model for plant masting. And if you look at the whole lattice, what you can quickly see. Lattice, what you can quickly see is that the shape of this surface is very, very different. And so it becomes much easier to tell. It's much sharper delineation between the cases where it is synchronized and not. And that relates to being able to much more easily tell. As I mentioned, many challenges remain. And I mentioned that the IC model is static and not dynamic. Dynamic and some couple of papers led by Vahini Narelli, who was as well involved in the project, that we had a dynamical Ising model of spatially coupled ecological oscillators. And what we have here is something that, if you're familiar with state-space approaches to thinking about time series, we're almost doing something like that, where we take Where we take an underlying data for our spatially coupled model, we extract the local phase and we have a transition between them. And we ask whether or not the Ising model dynamics and the metapopulation dynamics behave similarly. And so And so when we do that, we essentially again have this, and this is where it seems to look similarly. We have the Ising model representation. We project forward the Ising dynamics to see those have a well-defined projection forward. We can project forward the metapopulation dynamics. We can do the same discretization using the isolation. Discretization using the Ising representation, and then we can compare them using something called forecast scale, which not surprisingly actually first came out of thinking about meteorological systems. And so prediction seems to work well, but apparently the data may not be near a critical transition. And so we're still working on that. And the very last thing. And the very last thing that I want to mention very briefly, because it seems that every talk has to have a paper from the Journal of Mathematical Biology with current and former editors in attendance. And this, again, is in some sense very much like this idea. And I'll just do this with two pictures. We have our observed data. We can have a variable, which is a two-cycle. A variable, which is a two-cycle variable. And we can then, when we do this, we can represent the data by a two-phase system, a three-state system where we have high, low, and right at the in-between. And what we end up trying to predict is not the future state, but the future phase, and ask ourselves how well we predict the future phase of the system, which is sort of like. Which is sort of like time series analysis, but a bit different. And so, just to kind of summarize, this is, I think, going to be a very different way of thinking about things, is that what I hope I've given you is some of the ideas that universality as defined by or used by physicists can be very, very useful. And we also have this intriguing idea that something Idea that something like the Ising model, which is developed to look at physical systems, really explains to us something potentially about ecological systems. And what's striking here is that this is actually like a lot of work in mathematical biology where we borrow from other kinds of models. So thanks for your attention, and I'd be happy to answer questions. Answer questions. Great. Thanks, Alan. So we do have time for questions. Yeah, Bill. Hi, Alan. A couple of questions. You were asking about what the coupling might be. Is there any indication that there's some kind of spatial correlation structure in the soil in terms of nutrients or rock mineral characteristics? Do you know anything about that? Characteristics, you know anything about that? That is a great question, and uh, in this case, there is uh essentially none of that, but that then leads to one of the things that we're obviously looking at right now. We're continuing, we've been very lucky to every time we think we're not going to be able to get new funding from NSF, they seem to have some new call that we seem to match, which is lucky. And in that sense, that's something that we're looking at now in a variety of ways. And there's essentially physicists who call it an external field, and that's obviously a very, very good question. Another thing that we're looking at is what role a little bit of long-range connectivity would have, too. And I was just curious: did the farmers keep doing these tree-by-tree surveys after this six-year period? After this six-year period? I mean, is there a longer data set available now? No, there's not. We are now working with somebody who does remote sensing, and we hope to get some other data sets to look at. But as you probably recognize, that this particular data set is absolutely insanely good from an ecological standpoint. I had a question, Alan. Alan. So there was this criticality that is well known in the Ising model. And then with your Ricker model, it was fascinating you got, when you couple things the right way, you've got something that was very similar and you could try to connect it back. But then, like, does the icing model give you anything more? Like, why do you keep using it? Except to. I'm keep using it because there's there are other features that are present in it. For example, one thing that it's given us, and there probably are more that were, one thing that's given us is the order parameter, which ends up being one of the better ways to think about synchrony in the system. Synchrony in the system. It's very hard to do. You can look at pairwise, but if you try and do more than that, even at pairwise, it gets harder and harder to do that in ways that make sense. I see. So you're saying that there's sort of technology associated with the Ising model or the fact that it's discrete spins that allow you to get more insight as to the dynamic than you could just by doing a de novo on your, say, on the right. On your, say, on the RIC or on the couple, couple. Yeah, there's lots of other structures of the IC model that play a big role. And related models. So once you go to more than two states, as we try that, that's something called the Bloom-Capelle model. There's also something that has oscillators which are continuous. So you would have an XY model if the local states are not just too. States are not just two phases and not the discrete topic because the discrete number of states. Well, thank you. We do have time for one or two more questions. If there are any, maybe if there aren't, I'll ask one more question. Could you apply this to synchrony in salmon populations where the rivers tend to be The rivers are tend to be synchronized with autumn, even year cycles over large geographical scales. So that is something. It turns out that the transition, so one of the things that we do have some data on is up and down the Pacific coast on things. You there, though, if you have something which is one-dimensional, the behavior is different. But yes, you could. People have looked at the IZ model on all sorts of Model on all sorts of structures, not just on the lattice. And we can look at that. And that is something that is in the back of our minds. In a different context, I have looked at some of the structure with salmon, but actually this was some with four-year classes, not just two. But you're right. That's another example to look at. Thank you for a fascinating talk. Thank you for a fascinating talk. And yeah, thanks for attending. And too bad we can't talk to the person, but it's great to hear your talk. So our next speaker is Yisheng Shui. And we'll just take a moment.
