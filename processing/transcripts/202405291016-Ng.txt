Let me give a talk. Yeah, so I'm going to talk about the result that we wrote up five years ago with Carolyn Abbott and David Espiano. There's the statement, just so we know where we're aiming. Just for simplicity's sake, I'm going to suppose that all of the HHGs we're thinking of are torsion-free. I know there are some that are not virtually torsion-free, both of Sam Hughes. But the goal is that, right, actually. The goal is that, right, actually, it's kind of convenient from the last talk, right, there are these kind of two behaviors, either asylumric or hyperbolic or virtually cyclic. So we can think of, there's sort of this sort of dichotomy that we're observing, where in this case, we'll see that HHGs either have uniform exponential growth or will be quasi-asymmetric to a product. And we should think of this as sort of the same framework as some sort of dichotomy like the TITS alternative. Alternatively, what that is. Also, stop me at any time for questions. Yeah, so just a rough outline of where we're going. First, I'll say some things about growth. I'll say some examples. I'll talk about algebraic tools. I think I'll get through all of that without actually saying anything about HHGs. Because that's how I kind of started working on this project. I didn't know that I was going to do hierarchical anything. And then, actually, I think. And then, actually, I think I can we'll go through a sketch of the whole proof and then see where things are today. Okay. Right. So, first of all, growth. We take a finite generating set and you look at the size of balls in our Cayley graph. Here I've sort of sketched out what happens in a free abelian group. You see that you get something polynomial, right? This you could understand from Gromo's polynomial. You could understand from Gromo's polynomial growth theorem, which is maybe taking a nail and hitting it with a much too large hammer. Right, and then if we look at the free group, I think it's not so hard to see, but sometimes it's fun to just draw. One kind of color in all the points and the ball. And then after you do this enough, you see that around each point, you add three new things. So you can do that. So if you do this, I'm going to go on forever. And we have to stop at some point. People yell here. Oh. Can I stop? You guys are very quiet. Yeah, sorry. Okay, so you get something exponential, right? So here we're seeing uniform exponential growth should have something to do with exponential growth. And so we can define the exponential growth rate, which if you if your growth is an exponential function, extracts the base of the exponent. Extracts the base of the exponent. Okay, and so right, we say that something has exponential growth when this exponential growth rate exceeds one. And so then, just what is uniform exponential growth? Well, we can ask what happens when we vary the generating set. Right here, I've drawn two kinds of standard generating sets. You might think that these are the best generators of these groups, but there's plenty of others. And so then you can ask: well, look at the growth rates of each of those other generating sets. Is this, can we find a uniform lower bound for all of these generating sets? The general idea of what uniform exponential growth is. Okay, and what's nice is then it doesn't depend on the generating set. This is something you can associate with your group. Okay, so Gromov asked: does exponential growth imply uniform exponential growth? The answer is no, unfortunately. But the only example Unfortunately, but the only examples we know are not finally presented. These are due to John Wilson, and then there's been a bunch of others since then, all not finally presented. And so it seems that with enough negative curvature, the conjecture ought to still be true. And so you should think what happens for HHGs or your favorite other form of non-positive favorites. Okay, so before we get into Okay, so before we get into using geometry, there's a few algebraic things that sort of like you should try first. So when I was getting into this, I was like, oh, I love right-angled arcing groups and cube complexes. So I wanted to understand uniform exponential growth for special groups. And then I didn't realize that every non-abelian special group surjects the free group. Right? Okay. Yeah, so now I know that. Yeah, so now I know that. And if you're trying to show exponential growth, you should first see what kind of much nicer quotients your group has. Okay, because if you have a quotient, then the growth of the quotient is a lower bound for the growth of the original group. Great. Okay, so first do that. Then, if you're feeling really ambitious, you can try to, like, we've been seeing these talks about geometric finiteness, you can try to fit your group into a short exact sequence, right? For the exact sequence, right? In quotients, you can ask about the kernel. What if your kernel is finitely generated? Well, if your kernel is finitely generated and you know that the quotient is small enough, right? So for fact one, you think, find a big quotient. What if you find a small quotient? If you find a small quotient like a cyclic group, then you can often control the growth of the extension using the growth of the kernel. This is something that I was working on with Rob Cromwell. I was working on with Rob Kronkuller and Riley Lyman. And so I won't get into the details of that because, well, it doesn't use anything hierarchical. But one nice consequence of that is that if you take a one-ended, relatively hyperbolic group that has virtually abelian peripherals, that's a mouthful. You can take a hyperbolic one-ended group. Any finitely generated subgroup will either have uniform exponential growth or will satisfy a law. File ball. Like, you know. It was very surprising. We were not trying to prove that when we set up. We were trying to understand three bicyclic groups. This is like... Thomas? Yes. Can you relax the merge label with, say, the satisfaction? No. Okay. No. Why? Because you need to understand the automorphism group of the peripherals. That's going to show up in the That's going to show up in the you have to do a whole bunch of JSJ theory. Virtually potty side. I think so. There is. I was. I was. Okay. Well, we should let me just do that. I love this project, and I'm very happy to talk about it. But I think the answer is yes. I think the answer is yes. And I was told that we should make the paper. The paper is 16 pages long, and I should make it 25% longer to add something. But yeah, I know it's okay if we say milk. Okay. It's not written in the paper, so I shouldn't actually claim it. Okay, but what's the issue is that, right, we want to study HHGs, and this is great if you have quotients, but right, there's this result of. But, right, there's this result of Berger-Moses, and then Verstakena Sisto showed that the Berger-Moses group and many others like it are HHGs, and these have no proper quotients. So, okay, this quotient idea, good, do this first, but if you're working with something that doesn't have so many quotients or you don't understand their quotients, do something else. So do geometry. Okay, this is the publication date. The paper was out earlier. And so before we started. And so before we started thinking about HHGs, right, Carolyn Davide, we didn't start talking about HHGs. We asked about asylumricly hyperbolic groups, which were trying to prove this conjecture. If a group acts asylum on a non-elementary hyperbolic space, then it must have a uniform exponential growth. Such a group has free subgroups. It has lots of free subgroups. And that's witnessing some sort of exponential growth. So you should just, like, you should have lots and lots of exponential growth. It should be uniform, right? It shouldn't matter what generating set you choose. What generated executive you choose. So let's try to prove it. It's been five years, at least. So fix a generating set, arbitrary. And so the first case is, suppose you have something that's loxodromic in this asylum action. Oh, that's great, right? So then you have a nice quasi-axis that you're acting on, that's two fixed points from the boundary of the space. And then, right, like if your group wasn't Like, if your group wasn't virtually cyclic to begin with, then Dominic Garadel and Ozen say that there's some other generator, C, which will conjugate and move that axis off of itself. In fact, then you have the first element and its conjugate, and those two elements are not commensurable. They don't have a common power. Well, that's lovely, because Koshi Fujiwara said: if you have two elements that are not commensurable, Have two elements that are not commensurable, it's a lot of drama, then he finds a uniform power k, depending on your eccylentricity constants, that generate a free subgroup. C here is uniform as you can see. C is a group element. It's a generator. Yeah, C is sometimes a constant. Sorry, that's you read my papers. That's good. Yeah, right? So, okay, we didn't start with generators. This free group is not generators that can be that. generators that can that generate a free subgroup, but the the uniform words of uniform word like. So then we don't get three, we get uh the kth root of three. Okay, still greater than yeah. Still uniform exponential growth. So that's it. That's great, right? So that's that's we're feeling pretty good, right? We were like 2015, we were probably feeling good about that. So then what happens? Oh, right. And alright, suppose that every generator is not oxidromic. So it's bounded orbits around for each of your generators. So what should you do? Well, we understand, for example, actions on trees. You take two elliptic elements, they don't have the same fixed point, you push things around, you just build a lot of drama. How hard could it be? Right? So we're about to prove the conjecture. That's great. Different results of Manasian ozone. There are asylumrically hyperbolic groups, there's sort of a sequence of them, where arbitrarily large balls in specific Haley graphs are all torsion. So if you wanted to build a short infinite order element, forget being loxodromic, we're in big trouble. Right? Okay. So it took a while to realize that that was never going to work, this outline. Okay, so I want to fix this. But don't do that line, right? No, no, no. Please. I've been saying that for years now. So it's a finite key generated in a GPSA. Yes, yes. These come from small cancellation constructions. Yeah, that's right. Right, maybe if we ask for finally presented asylumrically hyperbolic, there's still a chance that this will work. A chance that this will work, actually. Oh, that's right. I'm being a little too much of a downer. Okay, so eventually, like, what's the problem here before I move on? We want to understand what happens when all our generators are elliptic. And so what we would love is that, I'm assuming that all HHGs are torsion-free. So we would like to see that these elliptic generators should act on some other hyperbolic space. It would be great if we had some way, start with one hyperbolic act. Some way. Start with one hyperbolic action and pass to other ones so you can see all the other elements. Well, that's exactly an HHG. Okay, so we start with an HHG, we start with some finite generating set of it. So then, sort of originating work of Dereham-Hagan and Sisto, as in particular, they proved that it's alternative for HHGs. Then there's this more effective found of Abhagin adipinzoloom. Add it in the loom. So, what happens is you take an infinite order element in your HHG, and there is some uniform bound tau so that you can find some space where you have translation, stable translation length in the curve graph of that subspace, which should be CS, CU, exceeding that minimal threshold. So, this picture is indicative of what happens in the mapping class group. You should think I start with a partial pseudo-Nossov, some reducible element. Partial pseudo-NOSOF, some reducible element, there's some lower bound on translation length for the translation for that element on the curve graph of the subsurface. But you don't need to say mapping class group to have that fact. Okay. And so what's the idea? Is that now, right, we have the, we have, pick your favorite generator, take this subsurface associated to it, start pushing it around by the other generators. So now we have sort of one subsurface that we're going to push. And now we have sort of one subsurface that we're going to push around, or one domain that we're pushing around the group. Okay, so take sort of the sequence. You can think of that as a growing sequence of subspaces. And part of the other lovely thing about the definition of HHG is it's not just that we have hyperbolic spaces, but they're related to each other. They're related using one of these three criteria. And so, yeah, this is what we prove. Yeah, this is what we prove, I guess. I decided to call it the main proposition today. We find a uniform number so that either this sequence keeps growing forever, or it stabilizes at this threshold n. And it stabilizes exactly when what happens, you could never see any transversality in this collection, right? Again, with subsurfaces, this is what happens when you get a maximal distribution. This is what happens when you get a maximal disjoint collection of subsurfaces. We fill the surface. Any other translate would overlap a previous translate. That would see transverse outward. So these are now two behaviors which are going to go into our. I forgot what time I started. Great. Can I see the first question? Please, is that a thing about that manga business theorem and the map of buttons? This one up here? Yeah. It follows from work, I think, of Bodic. Mangas uses it. Yeah, I didn't say this, but much of this is sort of based on Leah. Right, so this is just having this minimal translation length on curved wraps. Remember actually, like, you guys proved the serum before that four-author paper came out. Don't worry about that for now. I mean, yeah, so so, so, okay, well, here you are. So, okay, well, here you are. So, it's version two. Well, version one, we didn't, we thought this was always true. That's right. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, so there's two papers here. So, this is version two of our paper after version whatever of someone else's paper. Right, somebody else's paper said this was true. Yeah, okay, we clarify that. Good. Clarify that. Good. What's the idea? Just to have a. I think it's sometimes nice to have cartoons. You start with some space. Here I'm calling it W. You have some element that's translating a lot through it. That's what's coming from that proposition above. And so there's a relation that's missing here. What if you didn't have transversality or orthogonality, had nesting? Well, if that was the case, then you can push it. Well, if that was the case, then you can push it by that element of some bounded length, and you'll get something that's transverse. Here that's transverse. This is sort of the key point other than, well, yeah, there's a lot more work into it, but that's a good starting point. And so, what's the idea is that when we have transverse domains, you should expect to see something that's like a free group. That's our way of accessing uniform exponential growth. And then, when we have a pairwise orthogonal, And then, when we have a pairwise orthogonal collection, we want to go further down the height. This is the idea. So, let's start in the transverse case. And so, again, this is very much inspired by work of Manga Haas on the mathematical class group. So I have two spaces. I'm drawing them as if they're their curve graphs. They're transverse. Transversality axiom says that I can, well, first, we know that the projections are bounded to each other. Projections are well defined between these two spaces. Projections are well defined between these two spaces. And you have your whole group, your mystery Cayley graph, which is projecting to these two spaces. And so the transversality axiom says that things that project far away from the projection of W in V cannot be Do not project, have to project close in W. Anyways, it's the picture. Sorry. So this is sort of a generalization of the Versock inequality for the Mackelfast group. What happens is that if you were a point in the original group that projected far away from So, what's the idea? The idea is that when I apply this element B, so something translating here on blue, that's going to move this projection off of itself, pretty far away. And so when you move that point back in the Cayley graph, you had to move far, far away from the set that's projecting, sort of the realized set back in the Cayley graph that's mapped into the other space. So you really. Space. So you really have moved the other space far away. Okay. Yeah. And so, but what's the point is that you have these two, you can find inside of your group these two disjoint subsets and high enough, high but uniform powers of A and B are pushing them between each other. So this is exactly the ping pong lemma. We can see that we have a free subgroup, which is what we wanted. So let's revisit the So let's revisit this main proposition. We can rewrite it. We don't have to write transversality anymore. We say we have uniform exponents for growth. The uniformity is coming from that exponent that's there. And so we still have to deal with the second part, what happens when we have this invariant collection of subspaces. Alright, so we now have orthogonal domain stabilized by our group. Orthogonal domain stabilized by our group. Here's a cartoon. Okay, so there's kind of a few behaviors. First of all, it could be that in one of these spaces, I have two generators that both act oxidromically in that subspace, and they have independent axes. And so then we can use this bound, and I'm going to. Can use this bound, and I'm going to hide some details here and say that you can get exponential growth there. Two independent axes in a hyperbolic space shouldn't be so surprising. Yeah, something to be a little bit careful there is that it's so tempting to try to just use asylndricity on this lower level domain. So you have to use slightly different techniques. Okay. So we then have to now get into really like understanding more about the structure of an HHG. What is it that lets us sort of handle all these cases? So what happens is in this space, if you have a single generator that's stabilizing an axis, then you can ask what do the other generators do to that axis? So suppose then that you don't have this other axis B, this other element B, the whole group stabilizes the endpoints of A. Stabilizes the endpoints of it. If I have a pair of boundary points in some lower-level domain that's stabilized by the group, then we can prove using hierarchy stuff, realization, and a lot of projections, to say that in fact that space had to have been a quasi-line. Great, so then we should update the picture. The picture should look like that. Should look like that. We have a quasi-line. And then what else? Like, well, we have a space that's a quasi-line, but maybe there's other spaces below that. And so that maybe is contributing not just a line to our space, but something much more complicated. So we worried about that for a while. And then we thought, oh, but wait a second. The whole group is fixing the endpoints of this A, so it's fixing the domain. So you have a domain that's being fixed by your whole group. That just That just screws up everything with your projections if you have unbounded things living below it. All your projection maps stop working. Okay, great. So then what we show is that nothing lies below this quasi-line. So the quasi lines are sort of, we're seeing them at the bottom of our hierarchy. And right, what were we aiming for? We wanted to say that our space is quasi-asymmetric to a line times something else. Line times something? That's great. Okay, that's the main idea. So we did it. We made it. Now, wouldn't it be nice if we could understand now what happens in this mystery space? Yeah. Unfortunately, now, this element A is still acting on that space. So we don't have something, we would like to have some sort of statement where, okay, I now want to break. Okay, I now want to break my group into something that's lying-like and something that ought to still be an HH. We know there's an HHG, it sort of has a HHS type of structure. Yeah, so that's what we got. And so, right, what do we see from that is that we see that any HHG that does not have uniform exponential growth has to look like a product of this form. Okay, so if we go back now, there's these examples of Berger and Moses, these infinite simple HHGs. Well, their Cayley graphs are products of two trees. Well, their Cayley graphs are products of two trees. And, well, that doesn't, that's not quasi-symmetric to the space. Okay, so this is a very, like, again, hitting, using a sledgehammer to hit a, I don't know if we call that group friendly, to say that that group has uniform exponential growth. Okay. Questions so far? We did it, we proved the theorem. Far, we did it, we proved the theorem. So that was. Is there anything else that number two is really the same as being central extension? Yeah, right? You want to know what else could we do with this? Like, understand this better. Maybe for your favorite HHGs, this is not so bad. You want to put them into a short exact sequence and then see what happens. It's a good idea. Yeah. I wanted to study special groups. So I'm going to dodge your question. But we didn't write it up. We didn't notice this. So then a little time passes. And then Rodhika Gupta and Harry Pettit came along and said, wait, that theorem that you have, what happens for tensor Q complexes? Well, you need the group that's acting on them to be an HHG, so you want that Q complex to have what's called a factor system. Have what's called a factor system. Yeah. And so then they show, right? All HHGs are torsion-free, so freely, the freeness of the action comes for free. That group acting code compactly. Well, then, if you have a cube complex that has this product structure, then they can argue that actually you can continue to simplify. And in fact, you get that the cube stabilizes a Euclidean cube complex, and so then it has to. Cube complex, and so then it has to be virtually. Okay, so that's that's great. That was that sort of was that line of inquiry. Yeah, and so now what comes next? Right, well we have these invariant orthogonal nest maximals bases in our hierarchy, and that's uh right, we like saying that over and over again. Well, some people didn't. So, uh Some people didn't. So Harry and Davide came along and called these Aries and used them to prove a whole bunch of nice things. I've just picked two. One is that you can never have an infinite torsion HHG. Certainly makes sense if they're all torsion free, but it's not true. And then, right, they get this very particular structure. I quite like the structure of virtually abelian, diagnosically hyperbolic. Abelian hierarchically hyperbolic groups. In particular, what they can see from that is that if you take a HHG, if you take a finite index supergroup, there are examples where that supergroup stops being an HHG. Not such. So like, you can see this with Euclidean triangle groups, which is lovely. Yeah. And a whole bunch of other results. You should read their paper and see what they prove. Okay. And so, right, like this. And so, right, like this proving this was heavily inspired by things that Mango has proved in her thesis. And one of the things that comes after is that, right, in the mapping class group, you can not just get uniform exponential growth, you can get uniformly short pseudo-Nosops. And so then Abdul came along and said, well, couldn't you do that in your case? Well, it doesn't make, you have to have Morse elements to begin with. Elements to begin with. So suppose you had Morse elements, then you can sort of follow a procedure to find one quickly. And so then we should then only be working up at the top. That's sort of saying that our outline for acylindrico hyperbolic groups works in this case. Great. What's next? Well, we still want to understand this product picture and And right, so you could try to ask: well, like your group is, first of all, it's acting on itself, so that's a proper action on itself. And the original space is quasi-symmetric to a product. And so you can now ask: what happens when you have a group that's acting properly on a product of spaces? So that gets used, we'll hear about it tomorrow. Used, we'll hear about it tomorrow. Results of Warren and Yan to see that they can really upgrade this main result to have it apply much more generally for colorful HHGs, and then even they can use that to study product set growth, to generalize some nice work of error. So that's what I got. So if these hierarchically hydrobolic groups generally have universal exponential growth, would that mean their kale graphs are expander graphs? No, I don't. So trees are not expand groups, right? Okay. Yeah, and trees are. Tree groups are pretty good. HTGS. Okay, so. Okay, so yeah, uniform exponential growth is not quite so connected to being an expander as far as I'm aware. Okay, so now I guess we'll continue the art group discussion that was already begun.
