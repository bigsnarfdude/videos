Sure, be present. Okay, okay. I have first time. Okay. Well, all right, so for our first talk this morning, we have Eric Wall from London University. He'll tell us about special waterways with work. Thank you, Daniel. And thanks to all the organizers for inviting me. It's great to be back in Matt. So let me start by apologizing that I haven't listed all my collaborators here, but I realized there were so many. You will see them during the talk. The talk. And it will be so it will be a survey talk, but I mean it's such a big area that I had to make a selection, of course. So it will be mostly on existence results. And there will be more emphasis on things that I've been involved in myself. Just apologize for that. And I had the the same pictures as Dave and Dave and Bastian, but decided to change. So I don't know if anyone, so instead I switched to pictures of a photo I've taken myself. I don't know if anyone recognizes where this is from. Yes, it's Kern. Yes. So this is from thesis defense. So I thought this is nice because here you can see both. So this is of course See both, so this is of course two, but the distinction between two-dimensional and three-dimensional waves. And here you see a bit of both. I mean, the two-dimensional patterns here and something which looks three-dimensional here. Of course, maybe not exactly traveling waves here, I don't know. Okay, so I mean, I have the standard slides, a version of the standard slides, which we see now a couple of times, but maybe just to get the notation right. Alright, so let me start. I mean, I will not assume that the surface is a graph everywhere in the talk, but now for simplicity, let's assume that. So, I'm mostly going to be considering waves with finite depth. So, the bottom is flat, and that's level minus t, and the vertical variable is z. Okay, and I'm mostly going to be focusing on well, I'm exclusively. Well, I'm exclusively going to be focusing on traveling waves, but that is part by the general time-dependent problem. So, the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and missid with constant density. And well, so the restoring forces are gravity and, in some cases, surface tension. And so, we have the incompressible Euler equations with the usual. With the usual kinematic boundary conditions on the bottom and the surface, and then the dynamic boundary condition on the surface, which just tells you that the jumping pressure from the air region into the water region is proportional to the mean curvature. Right. And then going to steady waves, we make the usual traveling wave answers. Travelling wave answers, and here I'm going to switch from B to U. So, if we also do this kind of shift by adding C times the, so I'm assuming that the waves are traveling in the X direction. And then, if we make this shift, we just get the stationary order equations. And of course, we have the usual problem. So, it's now a stationary problem, but it's in In an unknown, so it's in a domain which is not moving in time, but the domain is unknown. And to begin, we'd assume that the upper bound is given by the graph of a function in the graph. Okay, so vorticity was in the title, and let me remind you that in 3D, the vorticity is a vector rather than a scatter quantity. So, one thing which will be important later, and so it's related to what Bastian said yesterday about why these Vetrami flows are actually solutions to the steady Euler equations. So, we can see this by reformulating the Euler equations using what I would call, it's a version of Bernoulli's equation, it says just this: that the cross product of the velocity and the aborticity is the gradients of the total head. Total head or the Bernoulli function. And this is actually equivalent to the Euler equations if you make the following interpretation. So u solves the Euler equations if and only if u cross omega is the gradient of some function. And then once you know that, then you simply define so if you want to go in the opposite direction, if you start with this equation, then you simply define the pressure. The pressure using this formula. Okay, so that will be important later on for the 3D model. But let me begin by going to 2D. So I want to kind of give you an overview of some recent developments in the 2D theory. And there will be special emphasis on Barch amplitude solutions and also solutions with interior stagnation points and critical layers overhanging risks. Overhanging risks. Okay, so in 2D, well, we assume that there is no flow in the, let's say, the y direction, and also the velocity field is independent of y, so it's just uniform in that direction. And then, as you probably all of you are familiar with, the vorticity is then just a scalar quantity. Or we identified with one component, which the non-vanishing component, which is in the y-direction. I should use this. I should use this. Okay, and we can then also introduce the stream function formulation. So, since u is divergence-free, there is a stream function. And okay, so yeah, so one way to prove this is that u cross omega is locally gradient if and only if psi, I mean you have this relation between the gradients of psi and omega. So, this means that essentially this means that if. Essentially, this means at least locally that psi has to be, sorry, the vorticity has to be a function of psi. So, and in most works on 2D auto waves with vorticity, you assume that you have this relations sort of locally. Okay, so to see what this function, sorry, to see what this function gamma does, we can look at shear flow solutions. So, I mean, the simplest solutions to So, I mean, the simplest solutions to the steady order equations are given by shear flows. So, I mean, any such function small u, or u, then this fold u will be a solution to the Euler equations. But, of course, we want to see what is the relation between the shear flow and this function gamma. So, if gamma is zero, we get the simplicity shear flow, which is just uniform. Maybe you wouldn't actually call. Maybe you wouldn't actually call it shear flow, there is no real shear. But then, if you take constant vorticity, you get a linear shear or red flow. But of course, for a gender, you can, if you take gamma to be general, you can get any kind of shear flow that you like. And in particular, so this is unidirectional in the sense that you, I mean, the flow is all going to the right, but you can also have it by. it bidirectional so with the then you have a disinterior stagnation sorry this interior stagnation one okay so I mean the typical way to construct 2D water waves is to start with these shear flows and then do some kind of local bifurcation and then go to large amplitude to do some local bifurcation. So first the formulation then, if so, we already had If so, we already had this elliptic equation for the stream function. And then, in addition, we need the boundary conditions. So, we had the two kinematic boundary conditions, which were that essentially that the surface and the bottom are both streamlines. So, if you formate this in terms of the stream function, so the level curves of the stream functions are all streamlines, so then this means that So, then this means that the surface and the bottom have to be level curves of the screen function. And then this condition is a reformulation of the dynamic boundary condition, which you get by combining the dynamic boundary condition and the Bernoulli equation. And so here Q is a constant, someone's called the Bernoulli constant, M is the relative mass. Is the relative mass flux. And okay, so now I've reformulated this as, so I didn't say now that Z is that the surface is the graph of eta. So I mean this will hold generally just assuming that we can more generally assume that the surface is given by some curve. And so it's a plain curve, and I want to focus on periodic waves, so I will assume that this curve. Periodic way, so I will assume that this curve is periodic, well, periodically repeating an x. Okay, and I think I forgot to say previously that sigma is the coefficient of surface tension. So, this will be a non-negative constant. So, sometimes it will be zero and sometimes it's a stretch tension. Okay, so let me review a little bit about what has been done. I mean, this problem has a very long history. So, first, in the irritational case, then we Rotational case, then we see that ψ is harmonic, and there is a harmonic conjugate, the velocity potential. So we can reformulate everything in terms of that. And we can also use complex analysis methods, combining phi and psi to an analytic function. So I mean, this goes back to Stokes, who did formal expansions, and had the famous Stokesian. And we have the famous Stokeshung conjecture about a peak wave of greatest height. Okay, then sort of rigorous analysis started about 100 years ago now. So we Levachivita, Struik, Nekrasov, who constructed small amplitude waves using power series expansions. And then it took a while to get large amplitude waves. So this was about 40 years, 40-50 years. So this was sort of So this was sort of so this you could say was was sort of the development of non-linear analysis essentially. So this using degree theory, global verification and so on. And then about a hundred years after Stokes made his conjecture it was proved independently by Amy Fenkel and Toland and Proptikov. Okay, so this is my sort of artist's impression of this. Sort of artist's impression of the high Stokes wave with 120 degree angle. Okay, so that was actually with, I forgot to say, that was with zero surface tension. There is less done on the case with surface tension, so at least if you want to look at large amplitude solutions. So the local theory, okay, I think there are. Okay, I think there were results prior to this, but maybe let me highlight what is different in the case with surface tension. So one thing we've already heard about in this conference is that you can get multimodal waves then because you have this resonance with the dispersion relation making a sort of a local dip. So multimodal waves were proved by Jones and Toland and By Jones and Toland in the 80s. And then for globe, I mean, in particular, there is less global theory for waves with surface tension. So the sort of one, yeah, I mean, if you ignore gravity as well, so do you look at pure capillary waves? Then there are these explicit solutions due to crack. So this is for infinite depth. So, this is for infinite depth, and then Kinosby, for finite depth. So, these are actually explicit solutions. So, you get them by using conformal transformation. And so, you see that what you get is these kind of overhanging waves where eventually the surface profile starts to self-intersect. So, this is actually from stolen pictures from your paper. I took stole the pictures from the paper with uh with Manosphere. Um okay, and then later on, I mean we will hear a bit more about these solutions later on, but uh Akers, Ambrose and Wright also proved that you can get waves with so gravity capillary waves by taking these solutions and then adding a small gravity constant. So there is a sort of non-degenerate non-degeneracy result. Non-degeneracy result is quite obvious. Okay, so now let's go to the problem with vorticity. And so there's actually the rigorous theory, or I mean here the theory actually predates in some sense the irrotational theory in that there is an explicit solution by Gerstner from the early 19th century, but this is in Lagrange in Courtney. So, this is in Lagrangian coordinates. It's with infinite depth. But then, sort of, for other than that, the theory followed much at the irritational theory. So, a bit later than, I mean, Levichivita, Nekrasov, and so on, there was a proof of existence of small amplitude periodic waves with small vorticity by the great Jacquard time. And then later on by Guillain and Tyler for general vorticity. But then the theory really sort of took off about 20 years ago with a paper by Konstantin and Spraus where they did global bifurcation with a general roticity function. And after that, many Peter, I mean, there was a kind of explosion, and many people who are in the audience contributed to the theory. So I will. Theory, so I will be a bit more detailed later on in the talk. But maybe let me say something about what happens when you have zero surface tension. I mean, what is the big difference compared to the irrotational case? So it turns out that in the case with vorticity, you sometimes take You sometimes still get the highest wave, and which has the same angle as in the irrotational case. So, this has been proved by Wavaruka and Koslava Lucaro. I should say that there are still some small details missing here, or at least not published. So, it's about there is one. I mean, so if there is an angle, what can happen is either that it's 120 degrees or it's actually zero. So, there are. zero. So there are, and this you can even see in the sort of if you look at the shear flows, so there are shear flows which have stagnation, but for which the whole surface consists of stagnation points. Okay, but there is an unpublished work at least by Kozlov and Lucaro where they eliminate this possibility under some assumptions. Okay, but what has been seen. What has been seen for quite some time numerically, I think, and what this has also been proved in preprint by Koslov and Caro, is that if you go to the... So I mean the angle is always the same, but vorticity enters sort of at the next order in the asymptotics. And this affects sort of the I didn't mention it before, but there is this second Stokes conjecture about the convexity of the highest wave, which was The highest weight, which has also been proved in the irrotational case. But if you add vorticity, then I think it depends on the sign of the vorticity, then you actually can get non-convex solutions. So we will see that in a picture later. So that is one thing, but maybe the more dramatic change is that you sometimes Change is that you sometimes get overhanging weights. So far, this has been shown, I will talk a bit more about this, in the case with constant voices. So it turns out then that you can actually have this slide, yes. So this is numerics by Vera and Yoshchenko. So it turns out that you can actually start. Uh you can actually start with these uh solutions by Crapper. And if you use uh the exact same uh formula for the surface, but uh you have different stream function, then you get the solution to the problem with constant vorticity and zero gravity and zero surface tension. This was a very nice observation by so then, and the next nice observation is that. The next nice observation is that again you have this non-degeneracy of the solutions, so you can perturb them by adding a small gravity, and then it gets gravity capillary waves. Sorry, gravity waves with constant vorticity, which are overhung. So Vera and I did this for a fixed solution and then we had a master's student in Lund, Pado, who sort of showed that you can do this uniformly along the whole branch of solutions and then you get really get Of solutions, and then you get really get solutions with a fixed gravity going from shear flows to overhang waves. Okay, and this is all for infinite depth so far, but you can also, or I mean, the explicit solutions are with infinite depth, but then you can also perturb them by going from infinite depth to very large but finite depth. Okay, so here are some solutions. Okay, so here are some solutions, sorry, numerical solutions computed by Vira and Dyashenko. So where they follow this is with constant vorticity. And you see again this, I mean you see here the self-intersection, they start to become overhanging and then self-intersecting. What is interesting here is that the formulation of the problem which Viran Sergei used. Vira and Sergei used, actually allows for self-intersecting solutions, even if they're not physical. So you can continue the solutions. So you have these sort of non-physical solutions over here, and you continue them and continue and continue. And then after this point B, you eventually reach a point C here where the waves again become physical. And then you can repeat this and you get these more and more bubbles. Okay, and what happens here is that you so if you continue that, what happens eventually is that you actually get these solutions with a corner, so highest ways with a corner. And the angle here is 120 degrees, but you kind of see here that they are not correct. Okay, and now you might ask about the sort of the physical motivation about Physical motivation about, I mean, so mathematically, it's nice with these overhang waves, but you can also ask about the physical motivation. And this is the picture I usually show. So this is at least some motivation. So this is from Telesta, Silva and Peregrine, who argued that these kind of overhanging mushroom type waves might be a good model for something you see in the in backwash on a beach where there will be a lot of ogicity. Beach where there will be a lot of logistics. I don't know. You can either accept this or just think that these are interesting solutions. Okay, so one thing I want to point out that these overhanging waves, they require that we also have interior stagnation points. And this is very easy to see. So imagine that we have something which is. So imagine that we have something which is one of these mushroom waves. So then we know that it should be symmetric. So then we know that the psi is constant, so assume that it's zero on the surface. So it's zero here and zero here. So then the derivative has to vanish. The vertical derivative has to vanish somewhere. Okay, so what this means that waves with or solutions with which are overhanging are intimately connected to interior stagnation and critical layers. So if you have sort of a curve where the horizontal where you have horizontal stagnation, then this is sometimes called a critical layer. Okay, and you can kind of imagine. Okay, and you can kind of imagine two different ways of obtaining solutions which have these interior stagnation points. One is that you could sort of start with a solution which doesn't have any stagnation, so you start with a shear flow which is all unidirectional, and then you do global bifurcation, and then eventually you might end up with a solution which responds stagnation points somehow enters the fluid. The fluid. The other way is you could start, which is simpler, I think, is to simply start with a shear flow. Remember, I showed you an example where there was materials. So you start with one of those and then you proceed. Okay, so this... Yeah, sorry, I don't think I understand your proof unless you're in a line of symmetry. I mean, I understand psi z is zero somewhere in that line, but that doesn't mean it's a stagnation. That doesn't mean it's a stagnation. No, no, no, yeah, so it depends on, so I call it horizontal stagnation. Oh, horizontal stagnation. Which is, I mean, you will have typically have interior, you will have horse, you have true stagnation points as well. But yeah. Okay, right. So, I want to give you a bit more details about. So I want to give you a bit more details about the history of sort of waves with interior stagnation, so interior horizontal stagnation, critical waves. So this started at least the model theory with a paper by Arnstrom and Villary where they looked at the linearized problem and obtained solutions, so it would just be constant vorticity and obtained solutions with one critical layer. So you kind of have one of these curves where you have interior stagnation. Where you have interior stagnation, horizontal stagnation. And then shortly after, I and then also Constant and Varuca, we considered a non-linear problem and using slightly different approaches proved the existence of small amplitude solutions to the full walkway wall. So I'll get back to the difference between these two papers and then And then Arnström, Escher and Villery, they looked at the problem with a fine vorticity and obtained multiple critical layers. So, I mean, you can, yeah, essentially, then you can, your sort of background shear flow that you start with, this is oscillatory. So, you can get as many critical layers as you like. And then we looked at the non-linear problem together with Azure, and then later on. With Azure and then later on on our own. So this we looked at the non-linear problem, small amplitude, but with the emphasis more on these kind of resonances. So where you have get, I mean, so the kernel is not one-dimensional, and you get this kind of mixed multimodal solutions. Okay, and then continuing this. Okay, and then continuing that so this was all with small amplitude and then the first uh result about large amplitude solutions was by Konstantinswalds and Barbara Ruka, so in the case with constant vorticity and they could what they could do then so they used global analytic global bifurcation theory this was the paper which Bastian mentioned uh yesterday as well um and what they can prove then is well so their their theory uh allows for uh overhanging solutions. For overhanging solutions. And so, one of the options which can happen is what you see in the numerics: that you get this kind of self-intersection above a trough. But the result doesn't actually guarantee that there is an overhanging solution. So, this was with constant vorticity, and then the first result with general vorticity. Salt with general vorticity was by Barham. So he allowed for a general vorticity function gamma, but it has to be analytic. And he allowed for, so this allows for multiple critical layers. So a difference between these two, I mean the difference between this paper and the one by Konstantin Swasimar Baruka is that Vorham used the formulation which requires this surface to be. Which requires this surface to be graph. Let me also mention, I mean, there are more works, but let me mention one paper as well by David Henry and Anka Matiov. So they looked at the gravity capillary problem with stratification and the critical layers. Again, did a large global bifurcation, but assuming that the surface is a graph. But why I mentioned this is that they also had a refuge. But why I mentioned this is that they also had a reformulation of the body as uh in this one identity plus compact which Blastian mentioned. Okay. Okay, and here is a picture as well. So this I think I stole from our paper as well. So here you can see these critical layers where you have so you actually these are actually uh stagnation points and then you have so you have these kind of cat side vortices here and then these green dashed lines I think are Green dashed lines, I think, are uh critical layers. And you can get so this is with two uh critical layers, but you can get as many as you like by just changing the parameters. Okay, so something we've already heard a lot about yesterday, but I will discuss this again today even more, is about various ways. is about various ways to map the domain to the unknown to a domain to a fixed domain. So I mean whenever you want to do some rigorous analysis for these problems you have to do something in this direction. I mean you could of course in some cases you can also reduce everything to the boundary so that's an alternative way. Okay so let me discuss three different ways of doing Three different ways of doing it. So, one way which we heard about yesterday is to use conformal mappings. So, this is classical in the irrotational problem. Because then, as we already mentioned, the stream function is harmonic and there is the velocity potential, which is the harmonic conjugate. So, if you combine these, you get the conformal map. So, this first takes you to, in this problem, it first takes you to. In this problem, it first takes you to a script, and then it's common also to map that later on to an analysis. If you're in infinite depth, you can first map to a half plane, and then you go to a disk. Okay, but that's for the irrotational problem. So, then for the rotational problem, there is another approach which was pioneered by LeBray and Jacotin. And this is to use, so you can think of this as a So, you can think of this as a conformal mapping as a holograph transformation, where you change the roles of the independent and dependent variables. So, here you would use, so the new dependent variable here would be x and z. But so, when you have vorticity, what you can do is to sort of go halfway. So, you keep the x variable, but instead of using the screen function, you use the Screen function, you use the height set as the new dependent variable, and you use the screen function as an independent variable. So, this was used by Dubai Jacquet, and then it was also used by Constantinas Rouse, and it's been used by a lot of people since. So, it's very useful, I should say. One nice thing about it is that a very nice feature is that instead of having gamma of psi in the problem, so you have a semi-linear problem. So the semi-linear problem in that sense, I mean, what you get is just gamma of, gamma is just a function of p. So one, so I mean we said with the conformal variables works for irrotational flows. So the I mean the downside of this change of variable is that it requires the flow to be unidirectional, so it can't handle internally. Shows. So, it can't handle interior stagnation. So, I mean, you kind of see this that for this to actually be a change of variables, we need psi to be a monotone function. Okay, and then we had heard yesterday about this name flattening, or eight has many names, so it's sigma coordinates, et cetera. So, the advantage with this is that it So the advantage with this is that it can handle flows bidirectional flows with critical layers. So it was used by myself and Emats and Azure, etc., and also by Bar on in the global biification here. Okay, so of course the disadvantage of this is that, okay, I forgot to put this in, but the disadvantage is what you see. But the disadvantage is, well, you see it here. This requires the surface to be round. Okay, so then the question is: what do you do if you want to have solutions with vorticity but allow for overhanging ways? And one thing you can do is actually to go back and use conformal change of variables. So, okay, we don't have the velocity potential. We don't have the velocity potential, so I mean we can't combine the velocity potential and the spin function to get a conformal change of variables. But you can kind of forget about that and say, I mean, we just use a conformal change of variables anyway. Okay, so this was used, so that's the difference between my paper and Constantine and Barbaruke. They used this already in the case with constant forticity. And then later on, in this large, this global bifurcation resulted by Konstantin's Barbara. This global bifurcation was solved by Konstantin Swas and Warburuga. But so there is a special structure in the case with constant roticity. So you don't have the velocity potential, but you almost do. So I mean it's just that if you sort of add this term to the screen function, then you get the harmonic function. And so you can use this. There is a generalized positive adjustment. So if you combine that with a conformal change of variable, A conformal change of variables, it turns out that you can reduce everything to a non-linear pseudo-differential equation for the surface profile, which you can think of as a sort of generalization of Labenko's equation. Okay, so that was with constant vorticity, but you can still use the idea of doing conformal gentle variables, even if the vorticity is less constant. So, I mean, you just the idea is to. I mean, you just the idea is simply you start with a reference domain, which is a script, and then you have a conformal map F from the script to the run on flu domain. And then these components U and V will be uniquely determined by the value, the restriction of the vertical component to the surface. Okay, so in particular, you can, just like in the irrotational problem, you can write. Rotational problem, you can write, you can parameterize the surface in this way. So we have this W, so the vertical components, and then the horizontal component will be related to the vertical component by a Hilbert transform. And this is the periodic Hilbert transform for a street path with the. I don't know if this is the same as the Tilbert transform. Okay, and then the nice thing. Okay, and then the nice thing is then, okay, so we had the stream, we had this semi-linear freedom function before, and with this conformant change of variables, we still get an elliptic PVP for this new screen function in the transform screen function. And the principal part is still, because it's a conformal chain of variables, the principal part is still a lot much better. Okay, so now in this formulation we need to start with the yeah, so with the first with some shear flow solutions, solutions, and then bifurcate from these. So these will still be shear flows. But it works a little bit if you have seen sort of bifurcation done using this debris arcutane transformation, then it works a little bit different here. We work. We work. So we have to define the shear flows as solutions of this ODE. And then we need some bifurcation parameter. And what we do is we, one thing we can do is to kind of fix the value. So psi, we already fixed psi to be zero at the surface, but then we use okay, this is kind of classical that we use the derivative of Derivative of the stream function at the surface of this will actually be the relative velocity. And then we just impose conditions on gamma so that this OD has a solution. I mean, where we forget about these two conditions. So just the OD with these two initial conditions at the surface. And then we define these two parameters n and q in terms of N and Q in terms of this band. Okay, and then we can find non-trivial solutions as perturbation of these trivials. Okay, and we can start with a local bifurcation. If the kernel of the linearized problem is non-trivial, then we expect to get bifurcation of trivial solutions. And then we want to continue these to total solutions. So, this is what I did in. So, this is what I did in two works with Jurg. He's in the audience. So, we proved that for any fixed vorticity function, we can work either with, we have two papers, one for the gravity capillary problem, one for the pure gravity problem. So, what we proved is that this can be reformulated in the form, if we use this form a change of variables, and then we can reformulate it as identity plus compact, which is W phi. Is W and phi. And this is then amenable to Rabinovitz's global bifurcation theorem. And well, as always, you have to impose some technical assumptions, which I will not get into. There exists a global solution. So let me just afford it. I will not go into the derivation of this reformulation as identity plus compact, but it looks like this. So the one part is kind of easy to guess, and that is just that, well, we have an elliptic problem, so we just kind of invert. Problem, so we just kind of invert the Laplacian. So it's environment that has a fixed point problem. So this is kind of similar to what Sebastian did yesterday for the stiff curve problem. What is more complicated is how to reformulate the boundary condition for the surface. But it looks like this, where R is explicitly given by this expression, and then there is an inverse Hilbert transform. And let me make some remarks about this. So, we, just like in the count of Konstantin's Rauss and Barbara Rucker results, our results allow for both interior stagnation and overhanging waves, but we can't generally guarantee the existence of overhanging waves. So, with stagnation, we can get just by starting with the white shift. Yeah, so in fact, what we can do, and this is also inspired by a paper by Konstantin Strasen and Barbaruka, is that we can prove that under some conditions on the vorticity function, the solutions don't overhang. Okay, but so what we know about overhanging solutions is if we have zero gravity and surface tension, then there are these explicit overhangs. Tension, then there are these explicit overhang waves due to Kinnersky in the irritational case. And then, by the result by Maias and Vira, we know also that with constant vorticity, with zero gravity, or possibly small positive gravity, no surface tension, that there are those order. Okay, and let me also maybe say something about. I mentioned that there you can think of two different ways of constructing solutions within theory. Of constructing solutions with interior stagnation. So, one wants to start with a bidirectional shear flow, but you could also start with a unidirectional one. And there is a recent pre-print by Lucaro where he proves that if you start gravity waves, you start with sufficiently large adverse vorticity. So, it's this combination of the vorticity. I think this is with constant vorticity. So, if you have this combination. If you have this combination, then waves which start out unidirectional actually develop the stagnation points at the bottom. So, what you would expect then is that this stagnation point kind of moves into the flow, into the fluid region, and then eventually you get these overhang waves. Okay, and I should also point out that there is about the same time as Jurg and I wrote our papers, there was a paper by There was a paper by Susannah Haseot and Miles Wheeler about solitary waves with constant vorticity. So it is for constant vorticity, but they use similar ideas to us. There is a remark that the same method would apply with general vorticity, but they just didn't carry out the palpitations. Okay, so that was what I wanted to say about 2D waves, and now let me Waves and now let me continue to 3D and let me get back to this reformulation of the Euler equations in the form of Bernoulli's equation. So this leads to an interesting dichotomy. So this is someone has called Arnold structure theorem, which tells you that there are essentially two kinds of three-dimensional stationary oil flows. One is Uh one is a beltromi flows, which we heard about yesterday, which is when the vorticity and the velocity field are uh parallel. So you see then that the left-hand side will then vanish and the Vernon function must be constant. So these solutions can be chaotic with streamlines dense in an open subset of R3. So a classical example, explicit example is this APC flow, which you might have heard of. And there I've forgot that is There I've forgotten that some references, but there has been a lot of interesting work by NCIS on Haraltasadas and others. Okay, the other case is when you have this kind of integral flows, which, so when they are not parallel, so because in this case you have these Bernoulli surfaces which I mean the so the the Bernoulli function is then uh non trivial and these Bernoulli surfaces are invariant. And these Bernoulli surfaces are invariant, and the flow on these is either periodic or quasi-periodic. And I should say, so in general, if you leave the realm of the Tromi fields, then there is not the whole of the theory, even if you forget about the free surface and just try to construct stationary Euler flows in the boundary domain, say. And there is also There is also a famous conjecture. This comes more from plasma physics, so by Grat, who conjectured that there are actually no solutions with sort of a non-trivial Bernoulli function, and so where you're standard to the boundary, unless you impose some kind of at least not in continuous values. Okay, so now I want to talk about periodic solutions. Now, I want to talk about periodic solutions, and we heard about this already yesterday. So, then periodic in 2D means that you have some kind of will be periodic with respect to lattice generated by two wave vectors, say lambda one and lumbar two. And then you can then further expand the surface with respect to the dual lattice. Okay, so let me heard this already. So, let me heard this already a bit yesterday, so let me go quickly through this. So, in the irrotational case, you get then, well, there's no stream function in 3D, but you have the velocity potential that you can work with. So, and that of course is, of course, harmonic. So, there is quite a lot of theory for that, not quite as much as in 2D, but still. So, the dispersion relation looks like this. And yeah, I mean there are some different cases depending on the size of uh uh the surface tension, but uh let me not go too much into that. Um all right so the first result that we heard yesterday is by Rieder and Schimbrod who constructed uh symmetric solutions. So as Paska pointed out you then have this so you're assuming essentially that lambda one and lambda two have the same size. Number two have the same size, and then by rotating, you can assume that it's they're aligned like this. But you also, in addition to that, you also have to impose symmetries on the solutions. So this is like the evenness of a surface in 2D. So we impose that eta is even both with respect to x and y. And then there are similar relations for the results of the potential. Okay, so in this case, I mean, what happens if you invoke those symmetries is that again that the kernel is one-dimensional for the minimize problem, and then you can use sort of bifurcation from simple eigenvalue. Okay, so readership in both is not formulated using quantum BNMIS, but you can just rewrite everything just like that. And then the first result about non-symmetric solutions was by Craig and Nichols. So they allowed for an arbitrary fundamental domain. This looks still quite symmetric, but so these are not symmetric in X and Y individually, but they are actually symmetric if you combine. So if you look at. So, if you look at kernel, so what Water and David did was to use a variational Lapano-Schmidt reduction and then with the velocity vector the velocity appear as Lagrange multipliers. And then there are also other approaches using spatial dynamics and also. And also this recent variation of hydroelastic waste by Amal Groves and Essel. Okay, so this was touched upon yesterday, but what happens if you forget about, so if you set surface tension equal to zero, is that you get small devices. So you can see this from the dispersion relation. So you have this quantum, you no longer have this term with the surface tension, this mean curvature term. And so this involves. And so this involves, I mean, you see, this is quadratic in the wave number K, but actually, if you go in certain directions, so this will not be bounded below by something which is, say, quadratic in K1, K2. So if you go in certain directions, this can be made like or square root of the magnitude of the The magnitude of the wave vector. So then, I mean, you see kind of that if you want to invert this, then we will run into problems. Okay, but nevertheless, Joseph and Potnikov, using Naxmoso theory, managed to prove the existence first of symmetric solutions and then of asymmetric solutions. Okay, so I would just not say much about this because we heard a lot about it yesterday, but maybe let's. But maybe let me just say that, yeah, okay. This was pointed. I said it's already over here. This kind of explains what Bastian was saying yesterday. So, I mean, so if we take omega to be a constant times u, then this left-hand side will be zero, and then the oil equations are satisfied. Okay, so the first results about So the first results about first constructions of feeding waterways with vorticity or using the Cromie flows. And then you kind of, you still get what's nice then is that you still have an elliptic rather than a scalar equation. And we heard this already yesterday. So there was first a local bifurcation result by myself, the Carl, and Roglas, who saw us in the audience. And then there's this Larsian. And then there is this large amplitude paper in progress. What I also want to mention is that there is another ongoing project, which is about the zero surface tension case. So this is by myself together with Mark, Dog, Stefano Coswelli. So where we are doing a sort of what Joss. Sort of what Joss and Protnikov did in the irrotational case, but with electronic clothes. So we have the first paper published which lays the groundwork for this, but the actual existence result is still too clear. Okay, and I should maybe mention, so I think we will hear more about this in Mark's talk. So you can also, so this last result uses a reduction to the boundary. So, this last result uses a reduction to the boundary, which is similar to the Zakarov Craig Sule formulation. This formulation is due to close and yes or and I should also point out that there is a multi-layer version of what we did by DOTLAS. Okay, so finally, let me mention another construction of waterways wind vorticity, which does Does not use this atromi assumption. So, and this goes back to a work by Lords, which is in plasma physics. So, I should maybe have mentioned this already, but then I mean, we heard already a little bit about MHD in Daniel's talk, for example. But there is a very nice and simple Nice and simple relation between steady order solutions and stationary MHD, the stationary MHD equations. Or rather, if you look at stationary MHD, but you also assume that the velocity field vanishes. So then you get magneto and hydrostatic equations. And the equations of the velocity are the same as the stationary order equations. Variations. So that's why there are lots of links between the two subjects, even though they are in two different physical settings. So Lord was interested actually then. So this and this question about magnetohydratic equilibria is connected to fusion reactors and plasma confinement. So there you want to confine plasma in some kind of you know uh solid torus. Solid tors. So if you if you actually have a sort of a real axisymmetric domain, then you get the tokamak reactor. And if you have something which is a bit twisted, then it would be a stellarator. So Lorz wanted to construct something which was not just not not axisymmetric, but it has a symmetry, so it has a reflection symmetry, but not a continuous symmetry. Symmetry, but not the continuous symmetry. But I will describe his idea in the context of walkaway, so then the symmetries are a bit different. So we look for solutions which are symmetric in X and Y separately, just like in the irrotational case. And if you also assume that the horizontal velocity component is strictly positive, then the streamlines are periodic in the sense that they reduce. Periodic in the sense that they repeat each period. So then there is a natural Ansatz, which is, I mean, sort of goes back to Klepsch, the Klebsch potentials. So whenever you have a divergence-free vector field and it's not, it doesn't, at least if you look at away from stagnation points, then you can always rewrite it as a cross-border. We write it as a cross product of two gradients. So, if you do that using the Bernoulli function and another function tau, then it turns out that this function tau must have this property. So, I mean, by just massaging this, you get this equation for tau. And if you, in addition, set tau equal to zero at the symmetry plane, then from this, you can actually. Then, from this, you can actually interpret tau as the travel time along a streamline. So, I think I have a picture. Yeah, so this is, I have to give credit to Christoffel for this, Christoffer Warham for this picture. So, if you imagine you take a point in the fluid here, X, then, and you measure the time it takes to go from the symmetry plane to this point along the streamline, and that is our function of time. Tau. Okay, and you can quite easily prove that this tau has various symmetry properties, so it will be periodic in the y direction. It will not be periodic in x, because of course, I mean, when you sort of, sorry, I mean, when you go over here, then the travel time is not the same as the travel time to here. But what it will be the same if you add the travel time from this symmetry plane to the periodic plane. Symmetry plane to the periodic copy of it. That means that if you go lambda one in the x direction, you will get back to tau, but plus a function q, where q is the travel time between these periodic copies of the symmetry plane. And then the smart uh thing that uh Bros did in his paper was uh to make this unsuch that the Bernoulli function is uh a function of this q. Of this Q. Okay, so with this, we can reformulate the order equations as it looks almost like what we have for petromy flows, but instead of alpha times u, we have this function in the right-hand side. And this is much more complicated. So here tau depends, we can think of tau as a sort of function or operator of u, which depends on u for this transport equation. Transport equation. And the difference here, I mean, one difference then is that this is actually going to be, I mean, in the Petronic case, we can think of the right-hand side as a lower-order perturbation, but we cannot in this. It has the same order as the left-hand side. So this is then an elliptic hyperbolic system, whereas in the Veltrani case we got an elliptic system. And this leads to a number of technical complications. Of technical complications. So, one is that whenever you, I mean, if you want to take the, I mean, if you want to do local bi-focusation using, say, panorama riddwitz, then you have to compute some Foucher derivatives and so on. And when you start to compute sort of formal Foucher derivatives of tau as a function, so if you try to differentiate tau with respect to u, you kind of see here that this is the formal relation for the Relation for the Foucher derivative. The problem here is that you have a derivative of tau here in the right hand side and you won't regain that from, I mean you cannot invert this operator because it's hyperbolic and not elliptic. So if we had an elliptic problem, we could invert this and get the same regularity that we started with, but here we cannot do that. So in general, if you solve this kind of So, in general, if you solve this kind of transport equations, uh then you don't improve the regularity. I mean, tau will only be as regular as u, it will not be there is a we managed to prove the existence of small amplitude solutions. So, this is the paper by Douglas Lee and Christopher Warhol. So, for a large set of parameter values, we have small amplitude, W period. small amplitude, double periodic gravity capillary waves with non-zero vorticity, bifurcating from uniform. So yeah, so I should say that we're always bifurcating from uniform flows here. And these solutions are symmetric in X and Y. So the vorticity here will be non-zero under some additional assumptions, but it will be small. Okay, so let me end with some open questions. Some open questions and further ideas. Okay, so in 2D, I think a large. Okay, so an important open question is to have conditions leading to overhanging waves. In 3D, large amplitude solutions is a large open area. I mean, we heard something by Bastian yesterday, but so that's. Yesterday, but so that's with surface tension. I mean, without surface tension, there is looks very difficult to do something, but I hope we will get there. But even with surface tension, and it's difficult to say what happens concretely with the solution. I think you need to use a combination of analysis and numerics. But I know even the numerics is quite difficult in reading. Then, okay, so the last result was for bifurcation from uniform. Bifurcation from uniform flows. I mean, a very natural question is to what happens if we start with an arbitrary shear flow. So what we can show, so this is a work which will hopefully be finished soon, is that these solutions, if you bifurcate from a general shear flow, then the solutions have to be asymmetric. So have a non-existent result in form of symmetric solutions. So what I mean here is this: that they have to be. mean here is this that they have to be they cannot be symmetric in X and Y simultaneous okay and then finally overall I think it would be interesting to have more numerics all of these problems thank you thank you Eric and now we're standing for questions
