So, this is the title of my talk. So, I will start with the notion of a strongly minimal set in a differentially closed field that Dave Marker defined in the second part of his talk. And so, a strongly minimal set is an infinite definable set so that every definable subset is either finite or co-finite. And to give you some examples, so there are differential equations which are strongly minimal for obvious reasons because the set of initial conditions is Because the set of initial conditions itself is one-dimensional. And then you've got differential equations that are strongly minimal for more subtle reasons because the space of initial conditions is two-dimensional. And just to give you a concrete obstruction to be strongly minimal, is that if your equation is strongly minimal, what does it imply? It implies in particular that you cannot find a change of coordinates which give your equation a triangular form. So this is a concrete consequence of strong... Is a concrete consequence of strong minimality, but this is not equivalent. So I'm going to describe a structural description of the strongly minimal set in differentially closed field, which was mainly attained in the 80s and 90s. And so for that, I will identify a differential equation with the associated definable sets to make it a bit simpler to express. And the first kind of equations are all the algebraic equations, which when after modding out by When, after modding out by the rational integrals, you admit a differential Galois theory in the sense of Colchin. And so, there are many well-known examples of such equations, such that linear differential equations, Wiketi equations, and equations that live on abelian varieties, such as elliptic differential equations and higher dimensional variants. And so, the second part of this description is what I call the purely locally modular strongly minimal set. Locally modular strongly minimal sets. And what are they? They are the principal homogeneous bases for the action of a strongly minimal modular group. So, if you don't know what all these words mean, the thing that will be important for my talk is that they are called main kernels. So, this is how I will refer to them. They have been antally classified, so we have a complete set of equations for these differential equations. And why are they hard to notice is because they don't appear in small dimensions. The simplest example are two-dimensional. The simplest example are two-dimensional non-autonomous differential equations, which are part of a three-dimensional autonomous equations. So they are equations that do not appear in small dimension. And the third part, there are the disintegrated strongly minimal set. And there are the strongly minimal set which have the most degenerated structure. And an example, of the first classical example that was shown to be disintegrated and strongly minimal are the first Panova equation by Ronin Aglu and Ann. By Ronin Aglu and Annan Pillay. And so we will think about the solutions of such equations as highly transcendental or new transcendental functions. And I will describe a little bit later what I mean by that. And so what is the structural decomposition? It tells you that if you start with any algebraic differential equation, you can solve your differential equation using only four operations. The first operation deals with rational integral, it's just adding a constant. Integral is just adding a constant, right? So, what you've got a sequence of operations, right? And every time you've got an elementary operation, so the first elementary operation is just adding a constant. The second elementary operation is solving a differential equation, which admits a Galois theory in the sense of Colchin. The third operation is to solve a main internal. So, as I said, these are exceptional differential equations, and we have a good understanding of them. Or the last part is to add a new transformation. The last part is to add a new transcendental function that satisfies a minimal disintegrated differential equation over the parameter that you already defined. And so you can solve any differential equation with these four operations. And so what I want to do is to put in front of this theorem lots of examples that are given by classical mechanics and try to express exactly how you solve them using these four operations. So the first example I'm taking is the Hamiltonian. So the first example I'm taking is Hamiltonian systems with one degree of freedom. So I'm writing it like that. Hamiltonian H of PQ has a kinetic energy plus a potential. And your Hamiltonian always have a rational integral. So you're led to study after adding a new constant. So after using your first operation, you're led to solve a first order linear equation. And then you do what people do usually, you use the method of. What people do usually. You use the method of separation of variables and you get an integral formulation for this equation. And the classical question is: when can this make a change of variable to reduce this integral formulation into a rational or elliptic integral? And in our setting, the interpretation is that if you can, then the Hamiltonian equation is solvable only with the operation of adding constants and solving linear differential equations. Rame? So there have been. So there have been a number of questions raised in the chat, but I think that the basic sense is that a number of people are asking that you slow down a little bit and maybe go back and explain what it is. So the most recent question was just asking, what is the equation that we're solving right now? It wasn't entirely clear to us. In the previous slide here? No, on the slide that you're on right now. No, on the slide that you're on right now. So it's the Hamiltonian equation associated to this Hamiltonian system. So you've got symplectic coordinate PQ, and you've got a unique vector field on your parameter space, which is associated to this Hamiltonian system using the Hamiltonian formalism. And so you're looking at... So it's a two-dimensional equation with coordinate pq. This is dp over dt is equal to, if you want, I can maybe write it down. Don't the equation here is dp of a dt dq of a dt is equal to p and dp of a dt is equal to minus v prime of q so when you're and so in saying that you're solving this equation you're looking for uh you're looking for p and q so for for looking at solving this equation is to find p of t and q of t okay thank you Thank you. There is something, okay, there was something wrong with this because you were derivating over T and over X, I guess, or you just mixed Q and P. You just have twice P I have twice P and twice rice. You have DP over DT twice, so it doesn't, it wasn't like this. So it's anyway. DQ over DT is equal to P and D P over dt is equal to p and dp over dt is equal to p v oh okay minus minus p thanks is the usual thing that of classical mechanics right it's the usual formulation of classical mechanics in term of energy okay but it's just an example right and i want to say that it's just that this classification here reduced to a classical question which is when you can solve this kind of equation using a rational or an elliptic integral and if you can then you And if you can, then your equation can be solved only with the operation of adding constants and adding the solution of a linear differential equation. And this is what happens when you have a small degree for your potential. This is what happens in the simplest cases. And if the more complicated cases, as soon as the degree of V is greater than 5, what you need is to add a new transcendental function of degree 1, of order 1, to solve this equation, but you cannot only use operations. But you cannot only use operation 0 and 1. Okay, is the picture clearer? And so, what I want to talk about is what happens for higher-dimensional Hamiltonian systems appearing in classical mechanics. And so, an idea of my PhD is that a good test problem to study this question are the geodesic equations of a compact Riemannian manifold with negative curvature. And there are two reasons. And there are two reasons for that. The first thing is that it's an integrable Hamiltonian system, which is not completely integrable. So you cannot write down the solution of this Hamiltonian system. Of course, if you can write down the solution of your Hamiltonian system, then the question become easy. But here, you cannot write down explicitly formulas for your solutions. And at the same time, we have a good understanding of the dynamics of this kind of equations in the real locus. And in particular, it's easy. And in particular, it's easy to make dynamical arguments with this kind of equations. So, this is this that makes it very interesting. We cannot write down the solutions, but we have a lot of information about the dynamic. And so, one constraint that is given by what I was discussing before is that we need to work with differential equations that are written as algebraic differential equations. And for that, you need to work with algebraically presented Riemannian men. Work with algebraically presented Riemannian manifold. And it's not a standard notion. People usually study Riemannian manifold in differential geometry, but not in algebraic geometry. But you can basically copy all the formulas by working with etal coordinates. And so the setting is the following. You start with a pseudo-Riemannian algebraic variety over R. So you think about it as its complex point. You've got on it a non-degenerate symmetric. On it a non-degenerate symmetric two-form, and you assume that the real points are not empty, I wrote zero, but should be empty set, are not the empty set, which implies that it's there is kidneys in X. And you assume that the real point of your Riemannian manifold is a real analytic Riemannian manifold with negative but variable curvature. And so the equation looks like that to give you exactly the same formalism that you didn't like before. The same formalism that you didn't like before, so you will not like it again here. Is that it's it's so you're just given a function and you've got a vector field which is naturally associated to this function using the formalism of Hamiltonian mechanics. And this vector field has a particular property that the Hamiltonian itself defines the first integral. And so the equation that I'm studying is the equation whose underlying manifold Whose underlying manifold is the sphere bundle of your Riemannian manifold, and the dynamic of the geodesics is given by a vector field, which is the restriction of the Hamiltonian vector field on the tangent space to your sphere bundle. So let me describe what the dynamics look like. Describe what the dynamics look like if you assume that your Riemannian manifold has everywhere negative curvature. Then you've got a decomposition of the tangent space of your sphere bundle into three line bundles, continuous line bundles. So the E0 is the direction of the vector field itself. Okay, so you assume here the vector field VH. Okay, so in particular, VH has no steady states or no singularities. No singularities, and on one of these line bundles, the flow is exponentially contracting, and on the other of this line bundle, the flow is exponentially expanding. The second thing you know is that you have many periodic orbits. You've got periodic orbits everywhere in the sphere bundle of M. And the third thing you know is you have information about the dense orbit of your flow. So, you know that there are many periodic orbits, but there are also. Many periodic orbits, but there are also orbits which are not periodic orbits and which are dense orbits. And in particular, we know that this dynamic is what is called topologically weakly mixing, which means that you have a dense orbit in one copy of your differential equation, and you've got a dense orbit in two copies of your differential equation of your flow. And this implies that you have a dense orbit in all higher products of your flow. But you see that it's not enough to do all. not enough to only know that you have a dense orbit in one copy of your flow, to know that you have a dense orbit in all copies of your flow. You need to have this information inside the flow and two copies of the flow. And so in practice, how do we work? Really, everything that matters is this picture here, is that you've got an orbit, right, which is here phi t of x, and you've got at every point of this orbit a frame that is given by your hyperbolic structure. Is given by your hyperbolic structure, and something that you have to be careful about is that the regularity is often very low. And even if you start with something which is real analytic or algebraic, like we do, in general, this frame depends only continuously on x. And so the CRM, what it does, is that it takes this picture, this dynamical picture that I gave before, and it produces an analysis of the definable set associated to this differential. Set isotates to this differential equation. And so the theorem is the following one. If you start with the previous hypothesis, so you start with a pseudo-Riemannian variety over the real numbers. So you really think about it as its complex point. And if you restrict to the real point, you've got a compact non-empty connected Riemann surface with negative curvature. Then what can you say about the geodesic differential equation? You can say that the genetic type of D is minimal and disintegrated. Is minimal and disintegrated. Okay, and if I want another formulation of this statement is that you cannot produce a solution of your differential equation in a differential field where each step is given by applying one of the operation, the first operation, the second operation, the third operation, and the fourth operation only for this for differential equation living in dimension less than three. In dimension less than three. So it tells you that the generic solution of the geodesic equation in negative curvature is a new transcendental function of dimension three that doesn't appear as a linear as a solutions of linear equations over differential equations of smaller dimensions. And this is what I mean by highly transcendental function or new transcendental function. So this explains what happened at the general. This explains what happened at the generic point, but I have very few information about what happens in the non-generic locus. In particular, okay, it's possible to show that the non-generic locus is small, that it's the atmoscantable union of proper closed-invariant sub-variety of your variety. But it's hard to describe it exactly. And the reason is that dynamically, there's no real obstruction. There's no real obstruction to have algebraic subsets because the geodesic flow is far from being uniquely ergodic. You've got many minimal subflows. And for instance, I told you that you had all the periodic orbits. And so to study the non-genomic behavior, you are led to this kind of questions, which are questions about algebraic Riemannian manifold and that are, I mean, that I have no idea how to attack. And it's the same thing if you want to make precise what is pairwise algebraic independence in the disintegration property. Dependence in the disintegration property, you are led to questions about algebraic presented Riemannian manifolds that seem difficult to solve in practice. So the last thing that I will do is to compare with over geodesics. So the case of smooth quadrics, it's an old result of Jacobi and that was improved by Moser. That if you have an Euclidean ellipsoid, so it's well known that the geodetic flow is a completely integral. The geodetic flow is a completely integrable Hamiltonian system, so you've got the second rational integral. But in that case, you can realize the generic fiber of your second integral as an invariant sub-variety of an abelian variety endowed with a translation invariant vector field. And so this equation is always analyzable in the constants. And if you look at the surface of revolution, so it's also known that because there's a lot of symmetry, you also have always a second rational integral. Always a second rational integral. So the generic type is never minimal, like we were, like it was the case in a negative curvature. But in some cases, like the one of ellipsoid of revolution, you get a type which is analyzable in the constant. And if your surfaces of revolution is complicated enough, you will get something where you still need to solve to add a new transcendental function, but of order one. And the last case, which is interesting to study, and I don't know. Interesting to study, and I don't know exactly what happened in that case. Is the geodesic of an almost sphere? So you start with the real points of the sphere, and you look at a small non-integrable perturbation of the usual metric on the sphere. The usual metric on the sphere, it's like the case of geodesics on a smooth quadratic. It's always analyzable in the constant, but you expect that when you add a small non-perturbable integrable perturbation, you should get something similar than in negative. Something similar than in negative curvature. And so to explain what kind of theorem we use to do this thing is the following theorem. Let's say if you have a differential equation which is autonomous, so presented as an algebraic variety on a vector field, and of dimension whose dimension is this prime number, if you assume that the generic type of this equation is orthogonal to the constant, and that every foliation on x, which is invariant under the vector field, has a zaridiskidens. Vector field as a Zaridskiden sleeve, and that if every web of foliation by curves on X, which is invariant under the vector field V, has a Zariskiden sleeve, then the conclusion of the main theorem holds, which means that the generic type is minimal and disintegrated. So you see that I'm going to apply this theorem in, so here I'm giving the definition, I'm going to apply this theorem only in dimension 3. So when p is equal to 3, and in that case, you want to understand. And in that case, you want to understand what is a three-web of foliation by curves on X. And so, just to conclude my talk, it's exactly this picture here. But in the algebraic setting, you want to define this notion of frame of three foliations moving with the point X in the algebraic setting. And so, where it's given by algebraic equations and you allow singularities. Okay, so the notion of three web is really generalizing this notion. I mean, an algebraic. Notion, I mean, an algebraic analog of this notion of frame that is given here by the hyperbolic structure. Okay, thank you for your attention. Okay, thanks. Should say that you actually still have some time if you wanted to if you wanted to you started it's uh it's It's 40 minutes. I think you have another 10 minutes if you'd like to actually go into a little more detail. Yes. Okay. So let me describe a little bit what's going on in the inner. So, okay, to give the formal definition, so what is a foliation on X? Okay, so this is a notion you want to define that this is a sub-line band, I mean a sub-vector bundle of the locally free shift that is stable and does a Libracket. This is usually the definition that is taken without singularities. And to get singularities in the algebraic setting, you relax this assumption that this is a sub-vector bundle, but you assume only that it's a saturated. But you assume only that it's a saturated coherent subshift. So, this is the part where the singularities are taken into account. In the second thing, so what is a web of foliations on curve? You define it as a closed sub-variety of the projectivization of the tangent space, such that all the irreducible components dominate x. So, you see, and the projection is generically finite. So, w lives in the projectivize of Lives in the projective eyes of the tangent space of X. Since the vector field V exists on X, you can show by functorial arguments that it extends, it has a unit extension to this projective tangent space P of Tx. And so from this vector field on P of Tx, you can define what is an invariant web as a sub-variety of this projected T-variation tangent space. So now where are Tangent space. So, now where are the singularities? Is that this application is not finite, it's only generically finite. So, there are some fibers which are infinite, and you've got some fibers which are ramified, where every point appears more than once. But if you throw away this point, what you get analytically is a non-ramified covering. So, every point of X admits sections outside of a closed Zariski subset of X. Zariski subset of X, this projection from W to X admits R sections, R being the cardinality of the generic fiber. And so what does that mean is that at the generic point of X, a web is nothing more than sections from X to P of T X, R section from X to P of T X, which are exactly R foliations. So at the generic point of X, So, at the generic point of X, a web is a collection of R foliation. And so, what you need to take into account that is not true everywhere. You've got some points where this foliation can be not transversal and some points where this foliation have even singularities. This corresponds precisely to the point where the fiber of this map are ramified, and the point where the fiber of this map are infinite. Are infinite. Okay. And so here, in the real picture, we have a clear picture of a natural real web, which is invariant, which is given by this hyperbolic structure. But of course, this real web is only continuous. So what needs to be done in the proof is to take this three web that exists on the complex structure to show that one of the direction is a real direction, so lives in the real. Real direction, so leaves in the real points, and then analyze this web in terms of this hyperbolic structure that is given on this picture. And so, yeah, so okay, let me comment about this slide too, because I was going way too fast. About these slides too. And so what is interesting here, and I think is an interesting question about the almost fear, is that by definability of types in DCF0, you get that if you've got You get that if you've got a family, a moving family of Riemannian manifold, the condition for the geodesic equations to be minimal and disintegrated must be type definable in the parameter space. And what this theorem tells you is that the condition here given by this theorem is only a real analytic. It's only a semi-algebraic set because being of negative curvature is defined by inequalities. So, necessarily, this theorem that tells you something about negative curvature has to tell you something also about positive curvature, because the condition, the conclusion of the theorem holds on a parameter space which is type definable in DCF0, in ACF. And so, you can see that it's very natural to expect that in this kind of generic situations, close to a sphere, you can also find. You can also find a differential equation that have a very similar description than the one I described above. Okay, and I will step here. Okay, so thanks. Yeah, so there were quite a few questions that were raised during the chat, and maybe this would be a good time for individuals just to raise them publicly now. So you can unmute yourself and raise your hand. So you can unmute yourself and raise your questions if you like. In dimension three, how did we decompose the tangent bundle into a sum of three line bundles? So the sphere bundle has dimension three here. Yeah, so I think what was happening in that question is it wasn't. So let's just make sure that we understand what you were assuming. You were working on a two-dimensional space and then Ten-dimensional space, and then when you went to the sphere bundle, it became a three-dimensional space. Is that why it's a the Riemannian manifold at dimension two, but the geodesic equation lives on the sphere bundle? So the geodesic equation at dimension three, we think about the geodesics in the tangent space, so with their derivatives, and not written on M yeah. I think that the hypothesis that the envelope manifold was dimension two wasn't so obvious to some people. Yes, it's. Yes, it's a main surface. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, of course I should have been more careful. There was a question at the very beginning of the talk that maybe you want to address now as to what the motivation for studying these kinds of problems might be, especially addressed, say, to somebody who's interested in applications of differential equations to modeling. Of differential equations to modeling. Why would this kind of what kind of information could one derive from the kinds of results you have? For me, the main motivation comes from a model theoretic side, is that we have this beautiful structure theorem, but very few examples. And so it's more an application of modeling to model theory of differential equation that to provide many natural examples where we can study this very powerful structural statement. And so, of course, in some cases, I mean, in many cases, you can get from, you can go in the reverse direction and from a statement about model theory, they use a statement which is interesting with respect to other questions. But here, my motivation is really that we have this very beautiful statement, but it's an abstract statement, and we want to feed it with examples. And that's where do many examples of differential. Do many examples of differential equations appear in classical mechanics? Maybe would you say during the coffee break more on the other direction, how you would help modeling applications? Maybe could you make some comments during the coffee break about that? Yes, yes. Okay, thank you. So, you have this, you are working under this Hamilton regime, right? I mean, the UK. Right? I mean, you gave this example with Hamilton regime and George. And did you think about Lagrange regime and using it with, I mean, mixing it with the George? Yeah, I mean, it's so in many settings, both statements are always equivalent, right? When you have a Lagrangian formulation, you have a Hamiltonian formulation, and conversely. So for me, it's a Conversely, so for me, it's about this kind of questions that are about what kind of formula you choose to define your definable set. Oh, no, it's not like this. So, the Lagrange formalis is more geometrical. And if you are working with geodesics, then all this, you know, so some of these physical principles, they are easier to understand by looking at the Lagrange, like the principle of action or something like this, of least action. Yes, I was thinking that you are interested in the geometric, you know, like a geometric way of expressing it because then you skip to the manifolds and also to the, you know, there is the strong background with geodesics. So I was thinking that maybe the Lagrange is a little bit better here. Yeah, but there's a third option, right? It's to define Levitic Vita connection. You can look at the so these three point of view in the case of geodesic different. The case of geodesic differential equation, they will give you at the end the same differential equation, just written differently. But so, of course, each of this way of thinking has its own interest, but the thing that they are all equivalent in this setting, it's not really about how to write down the equation. It's very hard, in any case, to give any example of a compact Riemannian surface with negative curvature. Hi Manian surface with negative curvature. If I ask you to give you concrete equations, it's almost impossible. Okay, okay. It doesn't live in R3. It doesn't live in R4. I think it's possible to show that it lives in R to the power 10 or R to the power 11, but you immediately have a big number of variables. All right, do we have other questions for the speaker now? May I ask a question? Go ahead. Yeah, so I just would like to check whether my understanding is correct. So to summarize the main result, there was some equation. And there was a theorem saying that every equation can be solved using four elementary operations. Three operations. And what you have shown is that it's important for certain given equations, it's impossible to use only first three. Is it right? First three plus the fourth restricted to differential equation of smaller dimension. Right? Here I'm working with a differential equation of dimension three and I'm proving that it's not possible by applying the operation, the first three operations plus the fourth operation. Plus the fourth operation, which is restricted to a subclass of differential equations, those which are simpler, that are living in smaller dimensions. And this is why I'm saying that there are new transcendental functions that do not appear for differential equations of smaller dimension. Because you can take any equation of smaller dimension, you can look at linear equations with parameters in this differential equation with smaller dimensions, and you will. Dimension, and you will never be able to generate a generic solution of your equation here, which has dimension 3. Okay, okay. Yeah, thanks for qualifying. Nice question. Go ahead. And so, in all your talk, but at the end, you need a prime number. Can you say something about this? Can you say something about this critical condition? Yeah, so this is related. So, of course, this is a bit. I mean, I like this formulation, and the idea is that I was working with p equals 3, and then I realized that the only thing I was using is that 3 is prime. But the idea is because of the p webs of foliation by curves. If you have a notion of web, so because I wrote down only the definition for webs of foliation by curves, but if you have a definition for web of foliation, A definition for web of foliations by higher dimensional variety, by so web of foliations of rank R, then you can look at all the decomposition of n into two numbers, and you will get every k web of foliations of rank R with k times r is equal to n. Is that clear? Equal to p to the dimension of the variable. To the dimension of the variety. Yes. So there is this. So, what I'm using here is that if you already know that you have no foreation, so if you already know the first two conditions, then you already know a lot of information about your type. And then you can use the theorem I wrote here: the theorem of decomposition of differential equation, this one. Equation, this one to already use your information to describe what your differential equation should look like. And from a model theoretic argument, you can show that if you satisfy one and two and the dimension is prime, the only thing that can happen is that you are a finite cover of a symmetric power of a curve. Power of a curve. And so, this is this information that I'm using here. Because if you are in dimension four, there's two kinds of decomposition that can appear, two times two or four times one. If you are in dimension P, then there's only one decomposition that can appear, one and P, and P and one. But there should certainly be a version of that which do not use that p, the prime number. The conditions to write down are a bit more complicated than that. All right, then. So maybe we'll call off the rest of the questions and move them to the coffee break. Let's thank Remy for a nice talk. And we'll start again.
