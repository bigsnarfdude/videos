belongs to a a r a very rude little girl who intrudes a peaceful household of three bears and then she eats their porridge and she tries well there is a big bear there is a middle-sized bear and there is a small bear and she eats all three and then judges that well um one of them is is the best one and then she feels tired so she sits on the chair of the big one and then the middle one and then the small one and then she decides the little chair was the most comfortable. But then she was tired of all this choosing. But then she was tired of all this choosing, so she decided to lay down. And the bed of the big bear was not comfortable, the bed of the small bear was too small, and the bed of the middle bear was just right. And then the bears come back and then they realize that the porridge has been spoiled and it's a mess and the grill escapes. And so that's the story. But the moral of the story is that, well, apart from guarding your porridge, because someone might just gobble it off. Couple it goblet it up if that well she chose she tried the big uh the porridge of the big bear and that was too hot and the porridge of the small bear was too too cold and the the middle one was just right. And so the story is going to be about fluctuations that are just right for in this case for Luke formation. And so it's almost like a family gathering because most of the authors of the work are here and the one that's not here did most of the work of course and this is my student Work, of course. And this is my student Crados. And so I'm going to praise his work in here in this student property. And so the question we start with, and we're back to large scales, is that some coastal networks do have loops, like this one. There is a river going to the sea in Indonesia, and you can clearly see that this estuary has loops. But then some don't, or have them read. So there are these guys here who are sinuous, but then who are sinuous but don't have many loops. And so the the flow conditions they're under seem to be fairly similar because the distance between the two is about one hundred kilometers, but they look different. And the question is why. And spoiler, well, this one has a river to feed the system and this one doesn't. So these are purely tidal. And so it was known or it is a well-known fact that fluctuations or the presence of fluctuations Promotes the formation of loops in networks. And there's numerous examples of that, and that has been studied really well. But then, and if you look at natural systems, well, then it turns out that fluctuations between different hydrodynamic regimes, for example, constant discharge by rivers and then tidal fluctuations, are required for loops. And if you look at natural data, Loops. And if you look at natural data, so this is data from a paper by Eleni and John. If you look at natural data, if you look at some measure of fluctuations in the system, where the low values of T means that these systems are fed purely by discharge, and the high values mean that they're purely tidal. So there's not really much fluctuations and lots of fluctuations. And then loopiness, some measure of loopiness of the river delta. Then you find out that. River delta, then you find out that there is an, might be an optimum. So if there is an interplay between the two, then you find a system with loops. So we asked the question of what characteristics of fluctuations would make a particular system of loops or a particular loop stable. And we wanted to answer this question in a very simple setting. And so we will focus on, well, from that complex network, we will pick just one loop and we will try to consider. loop and we will try to construct a simple model of that of flows fluctuating flows in that loop and try to understand what really controls the stability of it. So if you choose this one triangular loop it has three inlets and there's flows feeding that loop. So there's a vertex A, B and C and flows QA, QB, QC, which are in general time dependent that feed this system. And then there are well these links AB, AC and BC have their length. AC and BC have their lengths, and there's some geometric characteristics of the loop too. But for now, let's focus on the fact that the system is driven by fluxes. So there are these flux sources, three Qs, and then each of these links is characterized by a conductivity. And this conductivity will tell us the relationship between the pressure gradient that induces the flow and the flux that you get. So this conductivity enters the flow constant. The flow-constitutive relationship by, and this is just K here. And this form of Darcy's law, or a linear relationship between the flux and the pressure, is appropriate for laminar flow and for small vessels and capillaries. But in fact, there is a lot of evidence that it also can apply approximately to shallow water coastal flows. So it's a bit more general than that. And then these networks, well, we think of river networks, but what I'm going to tell you is if we But what I'm going to tell you is it's going to be slightly more general. They tend to adapt somehow to flow conditions. And so they optimize some quantity. And well, that's a different question of what quantity gets optimized. If a network minimizes its power dissipation, then it means it minimizes the following quantity. So the flux squared divided by conductivity. So, motivated by that, we assume that there is. We assume that there is in a stationary state there is a linear relationship between the conductivity and some sort of an average flux, because these fluxes fluctuate throughout the evolution. So we assume that k is proportional to average q squared to some power gamma. And so this is an approximate empirical relationship. And we're going to simplify it even more in a moment. And so the evolution equation, so we can write an evolution equation for the conductivity. Revolution equation for the conductivity of a particular link in this channel system. And the time derivative of this conductivity will be just proportional to this nonlinear term, so Q squared to the power average, Q squared to the power gamma. And so that in equilibrium, this relationship I've shown you before is going to be satisfied. And there are some time scales associated with the approach to equilibrium, which we will skip for now. We'll skip for now. And then this gamma here, well, for coastal rivers, we can estimate it empirically to be about 0.6. However, here for simplicity, we're going to assume that it's exactly 0.5. And this will bear consequences for, well, the model is maybe less true, but more elegant. So it's all for the mathematical elegance of it. No, no, it's not. But in this case, you can get an analytical solution for this model, which is very. Solution for this model, which is valuable. And so, this is a particular case of a network that is scale-free, and we will come back to this fact. Now, if you write, well, if you introduce flows in these links, so QAB will be the flow in the link AB, and so on, well, the conservation of mass relates these flows in the links with the inflows into the system. And then for the flows, we have this Darcy relationship, and well, what I will call conductivity. And well, what I will call conductivity from now on, I will rescale these k's by the respective lengths of each announcement. So the conductivity of C will be conductivity of your particular length divided by its length. And so if you do that, you can put all these equations together and you can get a fairly lengthy equation for the evolution of conductivity of a particular length. Because what we want to know Because what we want to know is that whether this loop will be stable throughout the evolution, whether so whether all links will have positive conductivity. And so you can write a similar equation for K, well, not only AB, but also AC and BC, so by just the permutations of these letters here. But then what really matters in the context of this talk is that it's the fact that we have these equations and we could solve them, but this would be rather ugly. But this would be rather ugly. But we can get some nice conclusions about if we look at these three conductivities as if we regard it as a dynamical system, we can ask what are the fixed points of this dynamical system. And this will tell us whether loops or trees are stable in this context. Because if a conductivity of a particular link goes to zero, that means that this link vanishes, and this loop effectively becomes a tree. And so it turns out that a tree-like solution might be stationary. And so, in this case, when you have a tree, so one of these links is missing, so this conductivity is zero. So, this is a stationary solution of the system of equations that I've shown you. So, what we're going to do is we're going to perturb this, and we're going to see whether the perturbed solution is stable. So, if it is stable, whether this fixed point is stable. Whether this fixed point is stable. If it is stable, then a loop will eventually become a tree. However, if it is unstable, that means that the system will live and the conductivity of the third link will grow. So that means that the system will exhibit loops. And so this is what we do. We do, in fact, a linear stability analysis of these equations. And so it turns out, well, you do the math, it's kind of Well, you do the math, it's kind of messy, but then you get you arrive at a fairly elegant result. That, in particular, for the link AB, it's stable if and only if there is a certain relationship that has to be satisfied that is between the flow fluctuations, so Q, average Q's that characterize the fluctuations of flow, and the geometric qualities of this particular loop. And this relationship between fluctuations and geometry. And geometry is significant because precisely because of the scale-free character of the network. So, because this, well, both sides are invariant on the scaling of all flows or all lengths by a constant factor. And so, this is particular for these scale-free networks. Now, a case that is particularly interesting or demonstrative is the case when we have fully correlated fluxes. So, this is so far general. So, this is so far general. But if we assume that our fluxes are fully correlated, and by that I mean, well, that they, for example, that they change, that all of them change in time in a similar manner. So, this should be appropriate for tidal forcing. When you have a river system that is forced by tides, then all the lakes experience tidal forcing roughly at the same time. Well, this might be appropriate for a day-night cycle of leaf stomach. So, when the environmental conditions change for all of us, Environmental conditions change for all of them in a similar time-temporal fashion, rush-hour traffic patterns, and so on. So, we think of strongly correlated fluxes, and then we can divide the signal, so this flux into a mean flow component and some sort of a well, some measure of fluctuations. In this case, it can be mean squared variation. So, in that case, you can write this average QA, QB. This will be. This will be just a constant, and so then the system will have a very elegant interpretation. And so, for these mean flows, then you can represent these flows, each of the flows in the vertices A, B, C, by a vector in the space of constant component and fluctuating component. So, each point will correspond to a particular flow situation at a given vertex. And so, now the question that you can ask is whether you've given That you can ask is whether, given these points, so given these vertices forming a triangle, what will emerge as a final situation? So, will this loop, will this be an unstable loop, or will this stabilize into a tree? And so, well, for example, you can solve this system starting from uniform conductivities and edges of an equilateral triangle, and then under this particular type of forcing. Under this particular type of forcing, so points A, B, C distributed as in this graph, you can solve the temporal evolution equations and you find out that all these conductivities evolve to non-zero values. And in equilibrium, in particular, the ratio of the lowest to the highest conductivity is non-zero. In this case, it's 0.136. But that means that all the conductivities being non-zero, the system is a loop. Now, if it were Now, if it were, if delta was zero, then the system would be a tree. And so, for these strongly correlated flows, it turns out that if you do this decomposition into a constant and fluctuating component, this relationship can be written in a more elegant way, that this link, this particular link AB, is stable if and only if the angle between these vectors in the constant fluctuating component space. Component space, this angle is smaller than the geometric angle between the links AC and BC. And of course, similarly for, well, so that you can permutate that to find out about the stability of other links. So if all three links are stable, so if all three conditions for a given pair are satisfied, that means that the system should contain loops. contain loops. Or to formulate it differently, loops should not form if all these if the flow vectors are too collinear. So if any pair of these vectors are looking in the same direction in this space of constant and fluctuating component, that means that your system won't show loops. And so this is the case, for example, when we have a system controlled by a constant discharge. So then the constant component will be similar and the fluctuating components will be small. Fluctuating components will be small, so these vectors will become fairly collinear, and then you won't see loops. And well, also in the case, in the completely opposite case of a system control purely by fluctuations, so very little discharge, think of a tidal marsh, then, well, again, you will have a strong fluctuating component, but very little of the constant component, and then your vectors will be collinear or reasonably collinear. Or or reasonably collinear, and you will you will not see loops either. And so we can look at different well so we can from that through that lens we can look at different flow conditions by looking at the at this decomposition into constant component, the fluctuating component. And well we find out that In this case, there is a minimal angle between the vectors that determines whether a particular length is stable. So, in this case, it turns out that this angle between these vectors, if it's smaller than 60 degrees, in this case of an equilateral triangle, I discussed, then you will always end up with one of the links being unstable, so you will always end up with a tree-like structure. Now, if there's a minimal angle between any of the two vectors, Minimal angle between any of the two vectors is larger than 60 degrees, then you will end up having a loop-like structure that is stable. So we formulate a criterion, a geometric log, geometric and flux criterion for the stability of loops in a given system. And so now we can come back to this idea of Goldilocks fluctuations. So if we look at the system by fixing the constant component at two A constant component at two vertices and the fluctuating component at one of the vertices, and we vary the fluctuating component in another vertex, we can look at stability exponents, and we find out that, for example, that if you start off with a system that has a very strong fluctuating component, so at the link A, the fluctuations are very strong, then the Then the well, these vectors A and C will end up being fairly collinear, and then you will only the stability exponent will be corresponding to the link AB will be negative, and so the link AB will vanish. And so you will end up having a tree. On the other hand, if your fluctuating component at this vertex is very strong but positive, But positive, then we end up in a similar situation, and the link AC is unstable, and then we end up having a tree again. So there exists a sweet spot here, so a range of fluctuating components for this particular vertex A, which promotes the formation of loops. And so this is the meaning of Goldilocks fluctuates in that they have to be just right. They can't be too strong or they can't be too weak. So there is a regime where the There is a regime where the system likes them and then produces loads. And well, of course, it's a very nice intellectual exercise, but then the question really is whether we can see that in natural systems. And so this is the idea of John, who got access to flow data in Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. So here's San Francisco, and here is a river delta with many loops. Some of them are now. With many loops. Some of them are natural, some of them are human-made. But it seems to be a stable loopy network. And in particular, we have maps from early 1800s and today. And you see, this particular loop has been there ever since. And so the plan is to look at the flow conditions inside this loop. So this is not a loop with three vertices, it has seven vertices because it has some. Seven vertices because it has some connecting channels, but this framework can be generalized to not only a triangular loop, but something more elaborate. And so, in particular, we have flow data from these measured at different points of that loop. And so, there is a two-day average and two-week average. And you can see that in some of these points, we have strongly fluctuating flows. Flows with a bit of a systematic average, but on a daily scale, they fluctuate very much. So, what we hope to see is we hope to see that the generalization of this approach will show us that this loop indeed is stable. And so, to sum this up, although we knew that fluctuations are known to promote deformation of loops, we propose a very simple model which works. Propose a very simple model which works in a particular case of scale-free networks that has a very nice geometric interpretation. And so the criterion for the formation of loops involves both the character of flow, so the fluctuating character of flow, and the geometry of these loops. And it turns out that we find that there is a sweet spot, a Goldilocks regime for fluctuations that promote the formation of these loops. And so the interesting bit of connection with field. The interesting bit of connection with field data, well, that I guess that John will say something about it, and if he doesn't, we'll ask you. Because he has lots of interesting data to share. And let me finish this off with an inverse job address, because the guy who did all the hard work is now here, and he's soon graduating with a PhD, and he's going to look for a job. So, if you want someone brilliant, this is him. So, his PhD was on a completely different matter. Completely different matter. He worked on the diffusion of elastic micromolecules, but he just started randomly chatting with John when John was a Fulbright Fellow in Warsaw, visiting for a year. And out of these random chats, this paper was born. So if you're looking for someone great, there he is. And so with that, thank you for your attention. So I think that's the right one. So if you have any questions, please go. So I was exactly curious about the loops you get more than speed uh uh vertices, right? So the stability condition then that you have there. Is it going to be then more because you have this like nice angle like the uh right? So is it going to be then actually more stable because the beta angle would be probably like larger in general in these curves? Right, that's a very good question. Right, that's a very good question. Well, I'm not sure whether such an elegant geometric interpretation will be feasible anymore. So that's a kind of a question I'd have to think about for a moment, not to say something stupid right away. I'll say something stupid later on. So so your position is that the lack of should be skillful and clearly um teacher by to skill they'll have studied skills. That's why it's fine. skill for networks, but can you give us a sense of what that kind of networks look like and where else they may may occur? Like what is that scale for information? Right, so an example of a scale-free network. Well I guess someone might have a better answer than I do. But if you add scale to it, the solution space where loops exist. Solution space where loops exist gets swimming on. Well, but that's right, but so that's answering: well, we could solve this model for 0.6. But this has been purely numerical work. But then the question was whether we can think of examples of scale-free networks in nature that this could be applied to. So I'm tempted to say that some vascular networks do follow this scaling, but there are. But there are surely people who know more about it than I do. There's always going to be some small scale place where it doesn't apply anymore. Sure, sure. I mean, not universally, for sure. There might be local regions of the dimensional space where it is of some a reasonably wide range where likely space well forgets. Yes. This was all for uh in phase fluctuations. So uh what if it's not in phase? Well then of course then we're left with numerics. We lose I don't think that well if you perturb this slightly then well you'll have some extra terms maybe you can quantify how your face space would be that's probably the way to put it might not be hopeless. No, no it's definitely not hopeless. Even if you are not. Yeah, yeah, that's definitely worth a try. There is still one minute. Okay, so there will be a lot of things that I would like to discuss maybe later with you, but the first thing that is but is your stability criteria related to the like the formation of loops, but not how Formation of loops, but not how they evolve in the long term, because you are not taking account any morphological changing. So, you are talking about, from what I understood, that it's more related to the formation, right? To reply safely, it's more related to the stability. So, if you have a loop in a system, the question is what will happen to it? Will it evolve into a tree? So, will one of the links vanish or not? So so d and then because I'm thinking auto related Because I'm thinking how to relate these kind of works with let's say the framework that we have developed and that I presented in the first day that was related to stability. And in particular the fact that at least in rivers, we find that it seems that there exists a characteristic landscape. It's not a scale-free landfill, but we have shown that in loops in coastal systems, they are scale-free apparently. So it would be nice if we definitely merge the two pieces. Sure, let's talk. Okay, so no, I think it's very interesting. And maybe at the end of the session. That's great, yeah. So thank you very much. Thank you.
