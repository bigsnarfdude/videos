It's a pleasure to be here at this workshop, at least virtually, unfortunately. So first of all, I'd like to extend my thanks to the organizers for this possibility to present my results. And more and special thanks go to Francis for inviting me to participate. Inviting me to participate and give a talk, and also to Peter, the discussions with whom some long time ago have provided an initial impetus for this research that I'm going to present. Okay. So in a sense, this talk is related to Is related to what Oleg has presented just now. But I take a somewhat, I dare say, an opposite approach in that instead of starting with a given PD or a partial differential system and trying to uncover. Uncover its luxury if it exists. I go in an opposite direction. So, in this talk, I'm going to present a certain construction which provides a large class of integrable partial differential systems in four independent variables. All right. And even though we have already seen quite a few Have already seen quite a few mentions of integrability and integrable systems. I'd hopefully, without any major problems on your part, I would like to provide a short introduction to the subject for those who are not actively involved in it in the present time. So Well, on a very general level, one could say that integrable systems are nonlinear systems with tractable nonlinearity, with a non-linearity which we can do something about beyond establishing existence results and solving things numerically. So, So, for the case of ordinary differential equations or systems of such equations, we have perhaps the most obvious instance of integerability, which is integrability by quadratures, which basically means that we can write down a general solution of the system under study using quadratures. And well, it could be. And well, it could be either implicit or explicit. That's one of the simplest examples you can see right now. So, if we take this second order ODE, it can be readily integrated by quadrature and its solution in implicit form can be seen here. Well, if we move on to a partial differential system, Partial differential systems, things become far more tricky, but interesting, but tricky, in that, of course, it would be way too restrictive to demand that we are able to write down the general solution of the system we are studying. And be it as it may, at the moment, there apparently is no There apparently is no consensus as to a generally accepted definition of integer ability for partial differential systems. So I will stick basically with the same definition that the previous speaker used. So in this talk, integrability will mean existence of a legs pair. Of a lex pair satisfying certain conditions, although I admit that I'll use the term lex pair in a slightly different fashion than OLEG. And also, well, he has already provided, so to speak, some advertisement as to which remarkable features do integrable systems enjoy. So Systems enjoy. So, in addition to what he listed, just let me reiterate a couple of important points. So, typically, we can expect from an integrable system that it has a rich symmetry algebra, and we are able, in one way or another, find infinitely many explicit exact solutions for such a system. And under certain conditions, we can also. Certain conditions, we can also find infinitely many conservation laws. All right, and now let's move on to the Lex pairs per se. So the idea dates back to Peter Lex in late 1960s. So his idea was basically that he suggested to He suggested to move, so to speak, one level up from linear equations to over-determined systems of linear equations, so that the compatibility conditions for such overdetermined systems provide non-linear equations for the coefficients of the linear equations. Coefficients of the linear equations under study. Okay, let me be a little bit more explicit. So in a slightly different fashion, Lexus idea can be presented as follows. So suppose we have a pair of linear partial differential operators L and M, and let's require that these two operators commute. Then this commutativity condition would obviously give rise to Obviously, give rise to a non-linear system for the coefficients of these linear operators L and M. And this non-linear system, filming that certain technical requirements are satisfied, is called lex integrable and enjoys a number of nice properties and also a bit of terminology. So in such a setup, In such a setup, L and M are referred to as Lex operators. This linear system L equals zero, M equals zero is referred to as a Lex pair. And we should also refer to this condition of the vanishing of the commutator of L and M as to the Lex type representation for our non-linear system. Okay, so again, let me just reiterate that in this talk, integral. In this talk, integrability will mean lex integrability. So, a system will be considered integrable if it has a nice lex pair. And let me bring to your attention one important point, which is that nothing prevents the operators L and M from containing independent variables which are not present in the nonlinear system whose lax representation. Lex representation we are exploring. And also, nothing prevents L and M from containing partial derivatives with respect these additional independent variables. So this is basically the idea behind what is known as non-isospectral Lex representations, to which we shall get in a moment. All right. All right, just very quickly to give you a simple example of a Lex pair, so and also the most famous one, the Q equation. It looks like that, and its Lex pairs, Lex operators L and M are here. And computing also, it should be stressed that the operator. The operator L involves a parameter, Lam, that's a so-called spectral parameter, but it does not involve derivatives with respect to this parameter. So the Lex pair of the KDV equation is the isospectral one. And as I said already, we shall get to non-isospectral Lex pairs a bit later. Okay. And again, just And again, just let me quickly recall that Lex pair is really helpful too. And if certain technical conditions are met, the Lex pair can provide us with infinitely many explicit solutions for the associated nonlinear system through the usage of the inverse scattering transform of all related methods. And also, it can provide you with infinite hierarchies of symmetries. Infinite hierarchies of symmetries and conservation laws. So, once again, a Lex pair is basically an overdetermined linear system such that the compatibility conditions, the set of compatibility conditions for this over-determined linear system is our non-linear system. Okay. In the rest of this talk, I shall concentrate on the so-called dispersionless or hydrodynamic type systems, which are just first-order homogeneous quasi-linear systems, like three. So S are matrices, strictly speaking, not necessarily square ones. U is a vector of unknown functions. X is a vector of independent variables. Variables. Well, such systems occur pretty often in fluid mechanics. So that's where the term hydrodynamic type systems come from. The study of interoperability for dispersionless systems has a long and distinguished history, and I'll very slightly touch upon it in the moment. Touch upon it in the moment. Such systems were studied by many different people, so I will not try to mention all of them. And even at our workshop, there are at least two people who worked on integrability of the specialist systems, namely Boris Kruglikov and Ole. Boris Kruglikov and Oleg Morozov. A bit of notation. So the notation like this: Dd indicates the number of independent variables in our system. So 3D or as it is common in the theory of integrable systems to write plus 1D stands for integrable systems with three independent variables and likewise four. Variables and likewise 4D or C plus 1D indicates the case of four independent variables. Okay, so for the case of three independent variables, there is a very large number of integrable dispersion systems, well, of the form four, that have lex pairs. That have Lex pairs of the form 5, where this guy formally looks like a Hamiltonian vector field for one degree of freedom with the Hamiltonian small A. F and V in this setting are called Lex functions and P is this called variable spectral parameter. Let me stress that the dependent variable U in our non-linear system does not depend on P. Depend on P. And also, let's take note of the fact that the next pair five involves derivatives of i with respect to p. So unlike the case of, for example, the KDVL experience we have seen before, which involves a spectral parameter lambda, but does not involve derivatives. Does not involve derivatives with respect to it. So the presence of these derivatives with respect to p is the reason why the lex pairs like five are referred to as non-isospectral lex pairs. Okay, let me provide an explicit example. Well, so consider what's known as dispersion. What's known as dispersionist KP system, which has the form six, and it's readily checked that it has it meets a leg pair of the form five, which is written here. The associated leg functions, f and g are written here. And just a small side note: if one eliminates v from six, one gets the DKP equation. The DKP equation, which has a number of important applications, and also up to a simple change of variables, is related to the Khokhlaza-Bolotska equation mentioned by Oleg. Okay. The main focus of the present talk is, however, not on the case of three. Not on the case of three, but rather four independent variables. This case is distinguished in a certain way, at least from the point of view of physics, because as we all know, in general relativity tells us that we live in a four-dimensional space-time. Okay, and if we try to look at the big To look at the big picture, what we see is that integrable dispersional systems in 3D, that is in the case of three independent variables, can be constructed in a systematic fashion through the construction I've shown before. Again, let me remind you that at least to the best of my understanding, this construction is some three decades old and is Than is due to Vladimir Zakharov. And okay, and these constructions presently use a huge number of integrable 3D dispersionless systems, far more than the number of integrable 3D dispersive systems. Now, again, let's Now, again, let's turn our side to the case of four independent variables, 4D. And it turns out that nearly all previously known examples of integral 4D systems, including the two most prominent ones and I'd say the most physically relevant ones, namely the anti-Surdio-Yang-Muse equations in vacuum. Equations in vacuum and the anti-soft dual Einstein equations in vacuum with zero cosmological constants can be written in dispersionless form. So what one sees is that the majority of known integrable 4D systems are dispersionless. However, in previous research, no construction like the one we Construction like the one we have seen for 3D involving Hamiltonian vector fields and producing a huge number of examples was known so far. And the goal of this talk is to fill this gap. And also let me know that while the construction I'm going to about does not involve Does not involve moving frames per se. But closer to the end of the talk, I'm going to discuss some open questions associated with this construction. And some of those open questions are classification problems for which perhaps moving frames could help with dealing with them. Dealing with them. Okay, so let's proceed to the key definition of this talk. So a linear contact lex pair is the following over-determined linear system 7. So chi here depends on X, Y, Z, P and P. Okay, F and G are again no. Here, again, known as the Lux functions. And this guy XH here formally looks like the contact vector field with the Hamiltonian H with respect to this contact form. And again, in a similar fashion to what we have seen in 3D case, P is the variable spectral parameter and vector of dependent variables of non-linear. Non-linears of a non-linear system resulting from seven does not depend on p. All right. So, and what I claim is that there is infinitely many pairs of lex functions f and g such that the systems for you associated with lex pairs of the form seven are new genuinely integral 4D. 4D integrable nonlinear systems that can be transformed into Kauchy-Kovalevsky form. And the following theorem provides us actually with two infinite series of such systems. So again, so we have here two doubly infinite sequences of pairs of lex functions f and g. Functions f and g labeled by pairs of natural numbers m and n. And the claim is that for any pair of lex functions from this list, plugging with pair FND into a linear contact lex pair of this form would provide us with a fully integrable system for you. Integrable systems for you. And moreover, we shall see later on that the resulting systems will indeed be transformable into Koshi-Kovalevsky form. Okay, but before we move on to that, let me make a couple of remarks. So, one thing is that One thing is that the examples presented in the theorem from the previous slide certainly do not exhaust all examples of integrable 4D systems resulting from the Lex pairs of this form. On the other hand, these Lex pairs belong to a broader class of non-isospectral Lex pairs, namely to the class star. And so one can hope that. And so, one can hope that these flex pairs should be enabled to an appropriate version of the inverse scattering transform. Well, just like the 3D legs pairs from the Harov construction we have seen earlier. Okay, and let me also make a small geometric detour just to explain. Detour just to explain where this guy XH come from. So the thing is that if we consider three manifolds with local coordinates exit and the following one form, alpha, turns out that this form is contact, that its wedge product with its exterior differential does not. Differential does not vanish anywhere on n, then the following happens. So, okay, on a slightly more general level, if we have a contact manifold, a vector field is said to be contact if the derivative of the contact form with respect to this vector field is proportional to the contact form itself. It can be shown that a contact vector field is. That a contact vector field is uniquely determined by its contact Hamiltonian, which is just the value of the contact form on this vector field. Okay, and well, for one, contact vector fields form a Lisbon algebra in the Lie algebra of all vector fields on our contact manifold. And in particular, once again, if we take this one form on form on a manifold with local coordinates xzp, we can readily see that it is contact and we have the following explicit formula for the associated contact vector field with the contact Hamiltonian H. And formally which looks exactly like the operators H we had in the lex pairs from our construction. So that much for the geometric background. For the geometric background behind this construction. Okay, now let me show you again some explicit examples of what the construction question can produce. And our first example would be a 4D integrable generalization for the DIK AP system. So if you make this choice of lex functions f and g, This is basically the first non-trivial case in class one of the theorem I've shown you before. Then, if we allowed the associated leg spair, it would look like that. Okay, and the associated system, the compatibility condition for the Lex pair equations will take the form A. Will take the form 8. And I claim that system 8 is an integrable 4D generalization to the case of four independent variables for the DKP system. Okay, and so how can we see that? Okay, if we assume, if we drop the dependence on Z in the 40 systems where The 40 systems we have just looked at, and also make a further reduction shown here, then it would boil down to the following system, which up to rescaling is precisely the DKP system 6. And again, just a small reminder that eliminating gives us an equation which, up to a rescaling, is nothing but the DKP equation and. Equation and which has a number of applications and modular potentialization rescaling. It's also known to the different research communities as the Lin-Ray-Sneritzkian equation or the Bolovska equation. Okay, and on actually, on a slightly more general note, let me point out that if we take our loose Take our linear contact leg pair in 4D, which just let me remind you is given by formula star. And we assume that everything is no longer dependent on Z then our star will boil down precisely to a 3D leg square of the type we have seen earlier. We have seen earlier, namely the one from the Zakharov construction involving Hamiltonian rather than the contact vector fields. Okay, and now let me get back to what we have seen in the theorem. Let's explore in a bit more details the first class of examples mentioned in this theorem, namely the case when F Namely, the case when f and g are polynomial. So f is, okay, so let m and then be arbitrary natural numbers. F be just an arbitrary monic polynomial and g be an almost arbitrary monic polynomial with a next to highest order term of a special form. So if we take these guys differently and substitute them into Into the equations of the linear contact like sphere, we have obtained the following rather complicated system for u's and v's. Okay, so it's readily seen that this system is determined, it has the same number of equations as it has of unknown functions and. And what is more important is exactly as I claimed, it can be shown that this is actually an evolution system in disguise. It can be solved with respect to Z derivatives for all U's and Vs. Okay, now let's take a somewhat closer look at the second class of examples from the theorem. So again, let The theorem. So again, let m and then be arbitrary natural numbers and consider the lex functions of this form. Okay, so in this case, the vector of unknown functions of our non-linear system looks like that. And okay, if we write down the associated like fair and write down its compatibility condition. We have got a huge, rather complicated system, which you can see here. But again, it is still quite reasonable in that one can bring it into Kochi-Kolvsky form, for example, by passing from time small t to a new independent variable capital T of which form and skipping. Of which form and keeping all other variables intact. And also, once more, remark that if we drop dependence on Z, this system would reduce to a special case of a non-integral 3D system found by Zakharov almost 30 years ago. Okay, okay. Now, another point I would like to reiterate is that there is There is, so to speak, plenty of fish in the sea beyond the examples shown in the main theorem. So, let me show you one such example of a where the lex functions f and g are algebraic rather than rational with respect to p. Okay, so if we take f and g to be of this form and assume that the vector of dependent variables in our Of dependent variables in our system looks like that, then if you write down the compatibility condition for the associated linear contact lex pair, we show that dispersionless system shown on the next slide, which, to the best of my knowledge, is the first known example of a fully integrable dispersionless system having a non-isospectral legs pair. A non-isospectral lex pair such that its lex operators are algebraic rather than relational in the spectral parameter. Okay, let me just show you this resulting pattern. So, okay, so it again has seven equations, well, rather complicated ones, I admit. Further details can be found in this paper of mine. Let me just Let me just note that this system actually is also an evolutionary system in disguise. Okay, and now, as I promised you, let me move to some open questions, which perhaps some of which involve classification problems and that perhaps would have an appeal to some of you. So, one One and perhaps the most important open question is whether one could move beyond even the case of algebraic Lex functions, that is, more explicitly, whether we could find lex functions f and g which are, let's say, more complicated than algebraic in P and such that the association. Such that the associated contact leg square of the form star would give us a non-overdetermined genuinely fully integrable dispersion system. Okay. Now the next problem is the first one involving classification. So if we fix the number capital N of dependent variables, it would be nice for upon fixing. Nice for upon fixing with n to classify all pairs of lex functions f and g such that the associated contact lex pairs yield again non-over-determined genuinely 40 integrable systems. And a closer related and at least in my opinion quite interesting question is whether it is possible to find any such pairs when n is smaller than a N is smaller than 4. I should admit that I've put quite a bit of an effort into that, but somehow at the moment I was not able to find any such examples with capital N more than four. Okay, and the last open question is the following. Is the following. So, could one find Lex functions differently of this form? No, that is slightly different from what we have seen before, such that the associated contact Lex pair would give us a genuinely fully integrable second-order equation for V. Okay, so now let me summarize. So now let me summarize. So the main point of this talk is that there is a large new class of integrable systems in four independent variables with Lex pairs related to quantum geometry. So input one particular consequence of this is that there is significantly Is that there is significantly more integrable 4D systems than it appeared before? Okay, and more specifically, this new class contains two new infinite families of 4D integrable systems with polynomial and rational Lex functions. And well, the reference for these results is my paper in Letters. My paper in letters in mathematical physics, also available on the archive. And at this point, let me thank you very much for your attention. Any questions for Arthur? So, if not, then we'll take Arthur once more time. We'll thank Arthur once more time. Now, the next event on the schedule is a coffee break. So, we have a 30-minute break until the next talk at 11 a.m. mountain time. Hey, Arthur. Yeah, I do have a comment.
