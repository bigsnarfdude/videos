Goya University, who is right now in Japan. So he's at 11 p.m. So we're really grateful to have him here to speak this morning. He will talk about mutations, the logarithms, and pentagon relation. Okay, thank you very much. And thank you very much for the organizers for the introduction. Very much for the organizers for the invitation, and I'm so happy to give a talk in the occasion to celebrate the 60th birthday of Bernard. Congratulations. Okay, let me start. So I think everybody know about cluster algebra, but not everybody know cluster scattering diagram. No cluster scattering diagram. So I give some introductions. So there are two important references which I want to tell. First one, is a GHKK, gross Hakanki Konsevich paper. Also, the paper by Konsevich Seberman, there are many of them, but especially this one is important. And so let's just compare the principle of. Just compare the principle of cluster algebra or cluster pattern, which I don't distinguish in my talk, and a cluster scattering diagram, which I light CSD for simplicity. So both actually is uniquely determined by the same initial data. It's just a familiar skew symmetrizable integer matrix. And that's it. integer matrix and that's it and as for a cluster algebra or cluster pattern uh we attach uh variable x or y or both of them and uh so they are initial variables and we do mutations yeah and this is only principle of construction we have no no other extra data at all and this is uh At all. And this is about cluster algebra. And on the other hand, a cluster scattering diagram is uniquely determined by exactly the same data. And we attach some lattice and its basis. And the principle of construction is not mutation, but consistency. And there is one important difference between. Important difference between two things, namely, there is some structure behind it. We call it a structure group. So it's a group. And the most basic result in GHKK is that fastball, a Z-fan or a G-vector fun of a cluster pattern is embedded in the corresponding cluster scattering diagram. Therefore, a C cluster scattering diagram knows everything. Knows everything about the cluster pattern. In addition, the CSD contains a highly complex structure outside the G1. It is called the padrons. And let me give a illustrate an example. So consider the rank two case and take the following initial matrix B. And so G fun is just the geometric presentation of Geometric presentation of a set of G matrices. And it's a tropicalization of cluster pattern. And by the tropicalization, the cluster pattern can be reconstructed, constructed from it. So, for example, we start from initial G matrix, which is just identity matrix, and we have two G vectors which span a cone. And we make a mutation of a G matrix. So we have a mutation. G matrix, so we have a mutation of a G cone here, like this, and we can repeat. And so there is very sing, but here we have additional cone. And we can make a mutation again, and we can't see it, but it's very, very degenerated in this picture. But there is some additional con and repeating this, we have such graph, and this is very Graph. And this is very precise graph. But schematically, as there are infinitely many layers, like this, it converges to this irrational ray from both direction. Yeah, so this is a G-function. On the other hand, a cluster scattering diagram is constructed inductably on the degree with consistency. With consistency principle. And so, as for degree one case, so this is an initial word, and this is already consistent up to degree one. But if you see it up to degree two, this is not consistent. So we have to add one word here. And up to degree three, to be consistent, we add two other words. We add two other words, and up to degree four, we have actually one, two, and also there is another word here added, and we continue this. And after all, outside this ray is exactly the same pattern with G5. But also in this dark region, called the patterns are raised densely. Is a density, yeah, like given. So, and this denseness was proved by Davison and Mandel. So, we see that G-Fan and these patterns are kind of balanced. So, the force is balanced between the right side here and the dike side. Are you following me, by the way? Okay. Following me, by the way. Okay. And so it is natural to regard the cluster pattern and the CSD, actually, whole diagram as one inseparable object. Okay. So by the way, this is the picture of the button if you never been there. So let me set the goal of this talk. Set the goal of this talk. So, goal is: I explain the laws of the dirogarism or dirogarism elements, which I will explain later soon, and the pentagon relation in cluster algebra and cluster scattering diagrams. And my conclusion is very simple. So, first, the diagram interpolates the two principles: mutation and consistency. And moreover, the diagram elements. However, the diagram elements and the pentagon relations are everything for cluster scattering diagram. This sounds a little bit extreme, but it is exactly so. And this point of view was implicit in a GHKK paper and clarified explicitly in my recent review. Okay. So first I explain where you find a diagram in mutant. A diaromeris in mutation. So, this is connected with a focal control of decomposition or mutation, which I now explain. Let's take a y seed, yeah, be y. I gave an initial y seed. We consider a sequence of mutation for any arbitrary direction, k0, k1, and so on. And we regard each mutation as a field of isomorphism. Field isomorphisms. And from this picture, the direction is in an opposite way. So S1 to S. And this is usual mutation formula for y variable, but when we look at other field or isomorphism, the direction is opposite. By the way, here, Epstron is in. We have Epstron is the right-hand side, but this But this expression is independent of Ypsil. And we especially choose the sign of the corresponding C vector for the direction of mutation. So it is called tropical sign. Then after that, we consider the decomposition of a mutation into two parts. The first one, tau, is a transformation, monomial transformation. And second one, law. And second one, law, is the following, things which is automorphism. And we call this fork control of decomposition. And the first map we call tropical part, while the map law is we call the automophysis part or mutation. And then we can consider a composition of four quantity of decompositions as follows. So first, Compositions as follows. So, first, consider just a composition of from this to in this direction because of this tropical parts. And thanks to the choice of the sign, we have the formula. So, the generators, y variable, is sent to a monomial whose power is C. Power is a C vector. And we have a commutative diagram. So each triangle is for control of decomposition. And we can also have this tau. And we can identify this local variable to initial y variable. And then we can send this automorphism to the automorphism of initial y variable. And in this way, this Q. And in this way, this Q was defined. And by commutativity, using this formula, we see that Q actually acts in the following way. So for Y variable, we have such transformation here. In a C plus R is absolute vector of a C vector. Of a C vector. Okay, so this is the formula which I just wrote. And now we consider the following things. So first of all, following Gest Man Shapiro Weinstein, sorry, Weinstein, yeah, Weinstein. Consider a Poisson bracket on Q for Y for initial Y variable. So it's just a familiar one, yeah. A familiar one, yeah. And where D is any rational skew symmetrizer of B. And also, we recall the Euler diagram, which is defined by this formula, by this power series. And this is, so two correspond to this one. Yeah. And why this is relevant to our problem? This is especially by through this formula. Especially by through this formula, yeah. So we just put minus sign and minus sign here. So then we have this factor here, and we make a derivation and then times x. Then this operation remove this factor just to one. Yeah. And then this is just a Terra expansion of log 1 plus x. So this is a full. So, this is a formula which is very important. And also, we recall the following facts. So, the B matrix, mutation matrix, is related to the initial one by sandwiching by the C matrix. And we just use this three formula. We can just calculate this Poisson bracket and we. And we have the following lighthouse formula. So, except for this log factor, this is exactly this automorphism. And this Hamiltonian here is written here, is usually describe the time derivative of the function. So you can exponent it. So this is just a derivative. And you can And you can integrate it by time one, it is called time one flow, then this logarithm will be removed. And this exactly gives you our automophiles Q. Okay, so this is where the logarithm is hidden in mutation. Okay, so by the way, Folk Koncharov used this observation to quantize mutations with a quantum diagram. With a quantum diagram. But here, I don't want to discuss with quantum case. Now, let's change our point of view and we introduce a structure group, which I mentioned in the beginning of my talk. So because even we start from skill symbol matrix B eventually, but temporarily, forget. But temporarily, forget about this B matrix. But instead, we consider just a skew symmetric rational matrix, omega. And this is initial data. And also, we attach some auxiliary data, lattice of rank R, and its basis. You can choose arbitrary. These data determine the followings. First of all, the school symmetric bilinear form. Symmetric bilinear form on n, just by taking basis, and this is defined by the component of omega. And also, it simultaneously defines semi-group of positive elements, and plus it is just a positive, say, osant in the lattice, yeah, like this. Having this. Like this, having these two things, we can construct a structure group. But first of all, we construct Lie algebra. Yeah, it's a plus graded Lie algebra denoted by G omega, and it has a basis. It's just we denote it as Xn, and it is spanned by the foreign. And then we define a rebracket. A D bracket is defined just by Is defined just by this skew symmetric bilinear form, just defined. And that's it. And it is checked that it is easy to check that this satisfies Jacobi identity. So we have n plus graded real geography. And for our purpose, we have to make a completion of this one. It's easy. We just for n for positive element, we define a degree. Uh, we define a degree just by uh taking the summation of coefficients. So then uh we have a completion with respect to dig, which means the element of g has the same form of not completed one, but now we admit a formal infinite sum. Yeah, okay. So this is the element or in this. This completion. Now we can make a group associated with this G hat. And it is defined in the following way. So first of all, so this is just exponential X. But what is exponential? It's nothing. It's just a symbol for this one. So it's just a formal projection. So for X, we just assign formal. Just assign formally x. Now, but we want to make it as a group. So this means we have to define the product. And this product is defined by so-called BCH formula, which is a famous one for L theory, the correspondence between the argible and the lead theory. So it's the actually. They are actually written in the following way. So, exponential, product of exponential are described by exponential of Libract here. And the right-hand side is an infinite sum, but thanks to this N plus graded structure, so those becomes higher and higher. So, those formal sum and make sense. So, this is a very different approach. sense so this is a very defined product okay so now we we just uh from omega uh we have a group yeah so this construction is due to consequence sobioman papers and uh there is no specific name of uh of this group which is inconvenient so we call it it it's not the name name of the group itself but the um how this group uh work in a scattering A group work in a scattering diagram, so we call this a structure group of the forthcoming scattering diagram. It's kind of a structure group for our fiber bundle. Okay, now we have we want to have an infinite product, so we define a little bit more. So from now on, we just write g omega as g, yeah, when there is no confusion. When there is no confusion, and first of all, we can define a normal subgroup with L as for so n is any positive integer, it's a degree actually. And for this symbol, which means it's a positive beta positive element with a degree more than L. And let G L be the set of elements of G having. So remember that element of G always has. Element of G always have exponential, formal exponential of something, infinite sum. But we give a restriction for this one. So higher, higher, which the terms of a degree greater than L. And it's easy by BCH formula, the normal subgroup. So we can just take the quotient and we can define the We can define the quotient which I denoted. This procedure is just repeating the completion in the group level again. So in fact, this one is G is recovered from G smaller than L by inverse rate. What is important is now we can talk about infinite product in G. About infinite product in G, which is given by the limit of just a finite product in each L, but compatible with the canonical projections. So when you cut at degree L, then it is stabilized. So that's things. Okay, now it's not we consider dialogue as event, which is a main role of my talk. So, which is My talk. So, which is algebraic formulation of dirogarism function. So, I just repeat the Euler diagram here. So, and I repeat this important property. Somehow, I want to mimic this in algebraic way. So, diagram element is defined as follows. For each positive element, we define psi n as follows. So, it's formal exponential of some Exponential of some over infinite sum. And we have exactly the same form here. But not as a power, but xjn. So n and its multiples. So this is some element in our structure group. So what is good about this element? I explained. For that purpose, we consider a representation. We consider a representation of G, which we call Y representation. This is defined by defining the action of generator of each Lie algebra on the former power series ring of QYY is actually correspond to the initial Y variables. But so it's a monomial and you can act just by this point. One can easily check. Easily check that this is a representation of a Lie algebra, and then take the formal exponential, we get the group homomorphism. But moreover, this action is a derivation, which means that this is a group automorphism as an algebra. Okay, so now. Okay, so now anyway, we call it wipe representation. So we can now act this dialogue as an element to say a basis of this formal power series ring. And then using this formula and this formula, just by that, you can obtain this one. So in fact, this is a formal derivation of this one and Of this one, and just doing exactly the same calculation in this terminology, then we obtain this one. But notice that there is no no logarithm, but directly this formula. So we can adjust this more. So in particular, we recover the automatic spot of the folk control of decomposition I explained earlier just by considering a little bit. Consider a little bit power and putting this C plus vectors. C plus vector is a positive fight or C vector. And we have the formula. This is exactly this one. So summarizing, diagonalism element is just correspond to the time one flow of Hamiltonian Ly2. You don't have to care about this one. This one, it's harmless. And so the point is now we don't need Poisson product anymore, but we have this is replaced with a group and it's action or representation. And what is good for this? So advantage of working with a group is we can study the relation among this diverse element in group itself. In gloop itself. Okay. And also infinite products are available in scrop. And also all relevant representation, y representation, correspond to y mutation, x representation, which I don't explain, but there is, and it's correspond to mutation of x variable or principal x variable and so on, are treated in a unified and more intrinsic way. You don't have to study case by case, but just Study case by case, but just study this element in the group. That's the main idea. Okay, now, is there any good relation about this dialogue element? Yes, and that's there is a remarkable relation which I explain. So let's take n plus n n element and c prime any rational number. Suppose the scale. The ski metric form is zero, then are they commutative? These are just commutative. It's easy because the generators here is zero, so they commute. It's trivial, but very important. And also, suppose if it is not zero, and let's set it as C, then we have following. We have a following relation, which I call pentagon relation. So we have one over C here. And so you can exchange this like this. Then we have one element inside here. So this is a penta formulation. And to prove it, directly prove this is maybe very difficult. So I usually prove this taking a y representation, x representation. Y representation, x representation, and so on. Anyway, also I want to mention that this is an Arisberg formulation of the pentagon identity or also called Abert identity for the Eura diagram. So it is written here. This one and this one looks very different, but actually they are the same things. I don't have time today to explain it. Have time today to explain this, but from this, you can derive this. Okay, now that's it. So now we talk about cluster scattering dialogue, scattering dialogue. Okay, so now there are several concepts I want to explain. Maybe some of you know very well, but You know very well, but nevertheless, I have to explain. So, as I mentioned, we start from omega, not yet P matrix, but Omega. And from this, you can construct the group, as I explained. And also, now I need to introduce several things. First, M, which is a dual lattice of N, and M R is a tensor of R. Of R and a scattering diagram will be defined in this space. Also, we have a canonical pairing for these things. And also, for each end, we define hypersurface in a dual space, just by using this canonical pairing. Also, for N, Also, for n positive element, we say it is primitive if it is not divisible by any integer greater than one in this lattice. And n plus PR denotes a set of all primitive elements. Also, for primitive elements, we introduce a group which is Aberian, a subgroup of G, consisting of all elements of the form. So for The form, yeah. So, for for n, it's uh the scalar multiple of n, uh, and they are abelian, uh, commute, so they are abelian, and uh such a group is called parallel subgroup of 4n, and it is denoted by this way. Now, uh, having this, uh, we first of all we define wall, which is uh ingredients of a scattering there. So we There. So we formulate war as a triplet. It's not exactly the same as GHKK formalism, but essentially the same one. So, first of all, n is a normal vector. It is written here. It is written here. Okay. And then we take a support. Support is taken. It's inside of. Taken, it's inside of this hyperplane, and it's a cone of codimension one, yeah, dimension alone. So something like this, but not necessarily strongly convex. So it can be whole plane or half plane, whatever. Then for such a support, we attach an old element. This war member is taken from the this So, uh, this parallel subgroup which I introduced. Okay, so uh, once again, a war is something with a normal vector support, and for war, some element is attached, yeah, but it is on in this parallel sub. Yeah, there is an example. So, as a simple, you just take whole plane. Our plane and put a dialogue element that is a word. Okay, so now we now define scattering diagram. It's a collection of words and satisfies the finiteness condition. So, for any positive integer F, there is only finitely many words such that if you uh if you take a projection to uh the one greater than uh smaller than l then uh it is it is not trivial yeah so it is okay so that's uh such things there are only finitely many such things is a finiteness condition so uh in other words uh for each positive integer we take the following subset of words Of words, just satisfying this condition. Then there are only finite zero. So this is a finite subset. We call this a reduction of scattering diagram at degree L. So okay, so also the union of supports of words is called the support of scatter intact. Now, what can I do? Now, what can I do with a scattering dialogue? You can take a pass-ordered product. So, for a scattering dialogue and a smooth curve satisfying certain generic condition, which I don't explain detail, it's called admissible curve. One can define a pass-ordered product along the curve as follows. So, picture is here. So, we take some curve. Some curve. First of all, we first fix a positive integer. Then there are only finitely many worlds in DL. And we just take a path, gamma. Then there are the paths intersect finitely many worlds in this way, W1, WK, and so on. So each world, there is a world. War, uh, there is a war element g1 to gk. We just multiply it, but with some factor which is called intersection sign, and the intersection sign is defined as in the figure. So, when we come from the top to the bottom of the wall, uh, then we just put one. If we come from the bottom to top, we set minus one. Okay, and uh, now we take uh. Now we take the limit of this one. This is then this gives you a well-defined element in a G thanks to the one finiteness condition. Okay, so pass-order product is defined. And having this, we have several notions. First of all equivalence to scattering diagrams are equivalent if for any atomic curve to this This pass-ordered product are equal. And I want to mention that for a given scattering diagram, we have infinitely many equivalent scattering diagrams by splitting and unifying the supports of wars and war elements. So here, if there is a war, you just split into two supports. Or if you have some element, then you can split it into two. Then you can split it into two words like this, and they are equivalent. So there are several ways to represent the same type scattering. It doesn't matter. So what matters is this pass-order product. Okay, now most important notion for scattering diagram is consistency. So scattering diagram is consistent if for any other measure. If for any other measure closed curve, this pass-ordered product is identity. Now, now I'm going to give a first fundamental theorem on scattering diagram. So let's C plus and C minus with positive and negative sound. And that gamma plus minus. Let gamma plus minus be any atmospheric curve starting in internal of C plus and ending in the internal of C minus. Yeah, so it is written just like this. This one. And for any consistent scattering diagram, any wall of D does not intersect with this internal. internal internal internal of C plus minus. So an element defined by this pass-ordered product is well defined. It doesn't depend on the choice of this point or any other point because it is consistent. Okay, so for given consistent scattering diagram, we have one unique element in G. Okay. Now, G. Okay. Now, and also it depends on equivalence class. Yeah. Thus, we have a map that for from equivalence classes of a consistent scattering diagram. So, this is the equivalence class to the element of G. So by this correspondence. And the theorem is this: this is a bijection. So, any for each element of G, there is a consistent scattering there. Scattering data. This is as a proportion, as is the first fundamental fact on scattering data. And the proof of concept semi depends on some observance decomposition object, which I don't explain. Now, that's good, but this abstract decomposition does provide how to construct these things, but this But this decomposition is abstract. So we don't know what is exactly the resulting scattering diagram correspond to the element. And now we have a following question. So how can we construct cluster scattering diagrams more explicitly? So I actually don't explain cluster scattering them. So scattering them. So some specific. Some special consistent scattering diameters can be constructed only from diagonalism elements and the pentagon issue. So, this is the main point of my talk. Let me explain. So, throughout our example, let's consider lang two cases and omega is taken as follows. And so it means this is a 2, 1 element. So, E2, E1 is 1. E1 is one. Then we apply the pentagon relation. And it has a four and four. And now this is interpolated as a unique consistent relation for the following consistent scattering. Yeah, I explained it here. So W1 is. E1 is here. So this has normal vector of E1. So here. And W2 is here. And W3 is somehow have a foreign normal vector. And we have two paths here: gamma one and gamma. And they may. And garments, yeah, and they make a close sub curve. So, uh, consistence means uh, this does not depend on this gamma one and gamma two. Yeah, and uh, along this first uh curve, you have first crossed this wall and this wall, and uh, with uh this war wearing, yeah. And uh, for this curve, we have three walls and which cross W2. And which cross W2 first, then this curve, and this one. So this is exactly the consistency relation of this diagram, and this equality means this is a consistent scattering diagram. So without anything, we have one consistent scattering diamond, and this is indeed a cluster scattering diagram of type 8. But the definition of a cluster. The definition of cluster scattering them will still give later. Now, we also observe that the support of this D can be interpreted as a G1 type 8. And what about type B2 case? So we can repeat this procedure. So we take two in here one. So these two can be a Split it into the product and the first product we apply pentagon identity and you obtain this one. Then you still have a chance to apply a pentagon identity once again. And we have this one. But this is not end. Why? Because we can still apply a pentagon for this one. And applying this, we have this factor and the one one. Uh, this factor and the one one is here, zero one is here. So we have such one, and this one is ordered in the following sense. Uh, we see that if you see this vector as just a rational fraction, so one over zero over one is just zero, this is infinity, and we have such things, and here we have infinity. We have infinity, one, one half, and zero, and so on. And we have, and having this ordered means you can have ordered in this direction. And this order means this is ordered in a counterclockwise. So we call this anti-ordered and ordered. And so And so we have one consistent scattering diagram, and this is exactly cluster scattering of type bits. And also these are coincide with the G Fung of type bits. And one can play this game once more. So let's consider take three here, and you can split it one and two. Two, we have already did it for B2 case. But this is not. But this is not yet ordered because we have unordered, anti-ordered pair. So you can apply a pentagon relation for this. And I think after some calculation, you end up with ordered product. And we have one, two, three, four, five, six times here and correspond to six words. Six words here, and this gives you a cluster scattering diagram type g once again. I only use Pentagon relation, and that's it. Anything else? And also, it's nice to mention that we have all positive roots with this operation. So, Pentagon also knows about root system. It's interesting. Okay, now time is limited. So, we now Is limited, so we now are finally introduced cluster scattering, yeah. So, in five minutes, yeah. So, uh, now we take our skew method of integer metrics. This is the initial data for cluster scattering diagram. What should we do? So, we consider a decomposition into two parts: one is a skew symmetric part, and one is a diagonal part. Yeah, and for skew symmetric. For skew symmetry part, we can define a group as I have already taught. And with this diagonal part, you can define some additional data. N0, which is a sub-relativist of N, which is a familiar notation for GHKK. And M0 is a dual. And also, it is not written in GHKK, but the following is important. important. For n positive element, delta n be the smallest positive rational number such that this one is inside this n zero. It is called normalization factor. For example, if you for this basis, this delta is delta by definition. Also another thing we need is a homomorphism of aberrant group P star, which is sent n to its Which send n to its element in M0 or MR. Okay, now with this map of P star, a notion of incoming and outgoing is defined as follows. So, first of all, I note that this P star satisfies the following property. So, a P sty N is in the uh and also gonna uh play to to to vector n so p star n is sits somewhere here so when uh the world contains uh this point it is called incoming and when the world does not contain this it is called outboard yeah and now finally uh the definition uh theorem about cluster scatters so uh is this is uh by ghk that uh for any skew symmetry Uh, for any skew symmetrizable or integer matrix B and its decomposition, there is a unique up to equivalence consistent scattering diagram with a structure group satisfies the following condition. The set of all incoming words in D is just given by the following finite words, very special one. So delta is here. And a consistent scattering diagram satisfying our condition is called cluster scattering diagram, associated with B. Associated with B and denoted by DB. And, okay. One more piece of ingredients, which is important to my talk to finish. So it is called ordering. Let's temporarily concentrate on the Lank II case. And we say that a possibly infinite product of a diagram element is ordered if each adjacent factors are satisfying this condition. Factors satisfying this condition and otherwise anti-order. So, this is explained in my example already. And then, the theorem is as following. I call this ordering theorem. Any finite anti-ordered product of dilogue with this power of normalization factor is rewritten as a possibly infinite ordered product of, again, the same form, di-logarism, by applying the pentangle. By applying the pentangle relation, possibly infinitely many times. And a proof is done by giving an express algorithm. And also there is a program for SageMass. And so I give an example. So we concentrate on length two cases. So this is a general skillsy method for integer matrix. And we can decompose this into two parts. So we can use this. Parts so we can use this familiar omega, and then so scattering diagram corresponds to this one delta two is correspond correspond to the identity of this anti-ordered product with this power. And then we can by using pentagon identity, relate it in the ordered product, and this gives a pentagon. Pentagon cluster scattering type of type A1. And no affine type, for example, you can calculate by my program and up to any given degree. And for example, if you do it up to degree five, then we have the following product formula. And you see that this is a degree. That this is a degree of each normal vector. So that's why we have this diagram here, this diagram here, this diagram here, and this for not only this one, but also here, and so on. Okay, and so this is how I wrote this diagram. So I can construct this by applying the pentagon ratio. Now, the last pen. Now, the last page of my talk is a summary of what I can have on cluster scattering diagram. First, theorem A is called positive realization. For any skew symmetric matrix, there is a cluster scattering diagram such that any war event have this diagonal element. So, to prove this, alternative construction of CSD was introduced in GHK. Introduced in GHK. So the second theorem for CSD with minimal support, the corresponding G-fun is embedded in the support using the identification. And this theorem B actually follows from theorem A in the first in between, we need to prove mutation invariance. And theorem from theorem B, also the sine coherence of the C matrices obtained. Uh obtained and also together with A and B, zero run positivity is proved. And finally, modify the construction of this one with ordering lemma on mine and obtain the following result. Every consistency relation of a cluster scattering diagram reduced it to the trivial one by applying the commutative relation and pentagon relation, possibly infinity. So this is a Infinity map. So this is a result. So having this, so we have one element, which is diagonal logarithm, and the consistent relation is pentagon relation. So diagram elements and the pentagon relation are everything for cluster scattering. So this is my conclusion. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for the speaker for this wonderful talk. Are there any questions from Are there any questions from the virtual participants? It doesn't seem to be the case. Are there any questions from the in-person participants? Yeah. Hi. So that looks like a really elegant way of computing scattering diagrams in rank two. So I'm wondering. In rank two. So I'm wondering if you go to higher rank, is there some way of dealing with this ordering or generalizing this? Yes, yes, yes. Possible. For finite type, one can, for lung three case, it's easy to implement. But to do that, not only ordering remote, but also we need this alternative construction. So this is a combination of this one. So there is an So there is an algorithm, and we can follow this algorithm and obtain a lung three finite type of affine type. And also, I just wrote this non-affine type of this one. I somehow calculated. And this is example of bad round in lung three here. Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions? Yeah, Misha So can you also in some way describe data functions in terms of dialogue in some, you know, maybe more elegant way? I never considered the problem. What can I say? Well, probably not, because to calculate the diagrams, the set function, you have to go to X representation and And in that case, how to say the action? Let's see. So action of diagram is just say very, very similar, but just exchange this p to something. And this formula itself is the same as what GHKK already. GHKK already written. So from this point of view, I don't have any more information other than JHKK at this moment. Yeah. Are there any other questions from the presidential or virtual participants? Yes, this is David Hernandez, who will. Yes, this is David Hernandez, who will ask a question in a second. Hi, hello, Tomochi. Just a question about your last slide. You wrote it's a fractal in which can you make this precise? This one or this one? Yes, yes. Yes, the last example you computed. This one? Yes, yeah, yeah. Yes, you wrote it's a fractal. Is there some precise sense for this statement? This statement in terms of Hattle theory, or yeah, you know, you see the boundary, yeah, is a fractal, but it's simple because you know, three diagram T3 is fractal. So, you know, it's kind of a three diagram here. So it's inevitable that it should be fractal. So this just originated from the fractal of this tree diagram when this length is greater than two. And are there such kind of geometric properties of the diagram that you can prove using your algorithm? Yeah, yeah, so this algorithm does not stop. So this one, this shaded area is not completely worked out. It's impossible. And whenever you add wall, then it creates a new wall here and so on. And this process never stops. That's a fractal structure. It's just a fractal structure. Okay, thank you. Lafrie is speaking, yeah. There's a question in the chat by Greg Musicker who is asking if your Sage code is already available in version 9.4 in Sage, or how do we use your program? It's version 9.4. And you can just take a call. And you can just take a copy of it from my paper. It is in the appendix of my paper. You take a cut and copy. Copy and paste. Yeah. Thank you very much. Are there any other questions from the audience, virtual or presential? Well, if not, let's thank Tomocha again for this very nice thought. Thank you so much.
