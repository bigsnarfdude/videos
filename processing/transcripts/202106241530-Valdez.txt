Thanks also, Jennifer, for the invitation to this conference. I guess I'm going to switch gears in my talk. I'm going to go the opposite direction of our previous talk and talk about some very, very simple and fundamental objects. These are certain circles in the boundary of a genus 2 handle body. So I'm interested in this because I got interested in this because of a problem that I'm going to discuss later on. And then it turns out that, well, this I happen to find a few more applications that may be of interest. So let me see if I can discuss some of those. So all the objects are going to be orientable manifolds. And when we talk about an object inside of a manifold, we're going to assume proper embeddedness. So a circle is primitive in the boundary of a Is primitive in the boundary of a handle body algebraically if it represents a primitive element in the free fundamental group of the handle body. And geometrically, well, one has to be able to find a disk in the handlebody that intersects the circle in one point. To be a power circle, where we just replace the condition of representing a primitive element of the fundamental group, we ask that the circle represents an untrivial power of an untrivial circle. Trivial circle. But then we actually get a little bit more of a structure, which is kind of like represented in here. The idea, let me see if I can add on a little bit to this picture. The idea is that when we have a circle, let's say this is the boundary of the handle body. When we take a circle in the boundary of a handle body that is a power, it is possible to find an annulus in the handlebody. In the handle body, which is five non-trivially by the given circle gamma that is a power. So this circle, sorry, this annulus, the boundary of the annulus is two circles parallel to the circle gamma. And again, the circle gamma runs at least, well, more than once around the solitaurus. So this is what is called the companion annuals of the power circle. And it's a unique object. Circle. This is a unique object up to isotopy in the handlebody. So that's what we can say in general. But if we have a genus 2 handlebody, then it is easy to tell whether we have a primitive or power circle just by looking at whether the complement of the circle in the boundary. So you take the boundary of this genus 2 handle body and then look at the complement of that Genus 2 surface. Genus 2 surface, the complement of the circle gamma in it. And if that complement compresses in the Himblebody, then, well, you know that you have a primitive or power circle. The compression of the complement of that power circle can take place along separating or non-separating disks, but the compression along a non-separating disk is unique. There's a unique disk, Aptoisotopy, that compresses. That compresses the complement in a genus to Himbobody of a primitive or power circle. It turns out this uniqueness is rather handy for pinning down certain situations. We also noticed that if we have a power circle, then that circle actually has to be a power of a core of the handle body. So it has to be. Of the handle body. So it has to be a power of a primitive circle. And the other thing to know about primitive circles that is also very useful is that in Genus2, you know, when we talk about a primitive circle in a Genus2 handlebody, so algebraically represents a primitive element of the rank 23 group. And I think that's the only rank where primitive circles can be classified by group three. By group theoretic restrictions. So, because of that, when we look at a word in a free group in two generators, it is possible to tell whether that word is primitive or not. And that also is very handy for, or it has been very handy for topological constructions. Cipher circles. Oh, by the way, from now on, I'm going to restrict to just talking about Genus II handle. Talking about genus 2 handle bodies. So at this point, we don't worry about handle bodies in general. And by the way, all these other results that I have mentioned before they follow quickly from basic topological arguments and sometimes two-handle addition terms. So we're going to say that a circle in the boundary of this genus two-handle body is a cipher circle if attaching a two-handle to the handlebody along The handle body along the circle gives us a cipher fiber space over the disk with two singular fibers, kind of like Polus-nut complements, something like that. And algebraically, we can tell that we have that by just looking at the just filling the circle in the fundamental group and then obtaining a presentation that looks like this. That looks like this. So here's a quick picture of probably one of the simplest. Actually, this is the simplest ciphered circle we can sketch, this circle that represents x squared, y squared. It's the black circle. This is the boundary of a once functor Klein bottle in this handle body. The handle body is a regular neighborhood of that, actually. So if we kill this circle, we're going to get, what is it, the twisted eye bundle. What is it? The twisted eye bundle over the time bottle. And of course, that's a cipher fiber space with fibers of orders two and two. So here's a cipher fiber circle. And of course, this can be complemented with other curves. Here's a primitive curve in the complement of this cipher fiber space. And these two curves provide a Higger diagram for the circle across the sphere. There's a theorem that I know. There's a theorem that I'm not sure if it's folklore or not, but I find it very useful in order to help better understand a cipher circle. We can tell that we're looking at a cipher circle in the boundary of a genus 2 handle body. Let me just keep track of that. I insist. This is genus 2 only. So, to check on that, what we do is we look at the complement of that circle in the boundary. So, we get this twice functor total. So, we get these twice functor torus, and in there, we need to be able to find a power circle. And let me see if I can walk through this construction. So here's the boundary of the handle body, and then here's the circle gamma. In the complement of this boundary of the handle body, we have to be able to find a power circle. So that comes with an associated companion number. An associated companion amulus. And then, if we cut the manifold, the handle body along this amulus, then we get a new handle body. And we ask that the core of this cutting amulus, which is this curve over here, not be primitive in the solid torus that we get by killing the circle gamma in H prime. The circle gamma in H prime, by the way, has to be primitive. The way it has to be primitive in this complement of the companion analysis. So it is geometrically possible to tell whether you're looking at a cipher circle or not. And so that gives an opportunity of constructing interesting cipher circles. For example, you can start off with this primitive circle gamma in this Genus Tuhindel body. This Genus2Handlebody. This primitive circle happens to be disjointed from this green curve we're looking at here. Let me see this curve over here. And we attach a solid torus to the handle body along this curve, this primitive curve, so that the green curve runs at least twice around this solid torus. Then we're going to get a new handle body where the circle gamma. Where the circle gamma will represent a cipher circle, and it's going to be represented by this element of the fundamental group, which doesn't quite look like something like u squared vq, but it's equivalent to it. So by choosing this word in a more interesting way and these exponents also in a more interesting way, it is not clear that how many power disjoint power circles we can get in the complement of a cipher circle. The complement of a cipher circle, but there has to be at least one. Sometimes there are two. Now, so the first application is a topic that I haven't really talked about anywhere. And it's what motivated this analysis of primitive power and sample circles in genus 2 hymn bodies. It has to do with genus 1 hyperbolic nuts. And as Nathan said, well, we would. And fed, well, we would like to count the number of cipher tori in the exterior of the nut that are non-parallel and, of course, disjoint. So, how many of those can we get? Of course, this question is related to the constructing the katiniso complex of this knot, and that will be a second application. But so, here's a picture of this. We got this hyperbolic knot, so like that, and around it, you see. That and around it, you see this punctured tori, the cipher tori, and we're assuming they are disjoint and non-parallel. The boundary slope, the longitude of the knot, is going to be noted by the letter J. And you can see that this puncture tori, this cipher tori, they cut off the exterior of the knot into various pieces, and all the pieces have a boundary of genus 2. So here's an example. If you take this Take this torous T1 and T3, then the region that they co-bound on this side, this one that is tainted yellow, well, the boundary of that region is genus II surface. And in that Genus II surface, you spot the longitude of the knot, which caps it into two punctured torid T1 and T2. And this is just a band. True, and this is just the boundary of this. Now, this region could be well, it's just a three-manifold with a boundary of genus two, but this is a hyperbolic manifold. So, if it just happens that this the boundary of this region is compressible, then it has to compress all the way down and make the region a handle body of Genus II. And otherwise, this surface, Genus II, has to be incompressible in the exterior. To be incompressible in the exterior, and whatever happens, this region has to be a tolerable. So we call the region, this manifold, this region, along with this separating circle in the boundary, we call it a pair. It's just a simple name to refer to these pieces. So there are different pairs we can construct once we have access to all these punctora, these eipher tora in the exterior. Spectra in the exterior. Now, if it just so happens, oh, by the way, I forgot to mention again when we look at one of these surfaces, one of these regions, like the one that I'm highlighting here, we look at this union of these two boundary tori, we get this genus two surface over here, and this is in the exterior of the nut, this is actually in S3, so that surface has to compress to one side or the other. To one side or the other. So that means that either this side of the genus 2 surface is a handle body, or the other side is a handle body. So one of the two sides has to be a handle body, maybe even both. If it so happens that one of these regions is a handle body and you spot a third torus inside it, like this one, well, in a handle body, every surface is boundary compressible. So of course, you're going to. Is boundary compressible. So, of course, you're going to be able to boundary compress this torus all the way down to an annulus. And because this torus and this torus are not parallel, this annulus won't be parallel to the torus T1. And therefore, it will be the companion annulus for some power circle. And that tells us how to construct all of this region, this sub-region of the bigger region. Region of the bigger region. That region is constructed by taking a product, you know, created by the boundary compression, a product of the torus T2 with an interval, and then attaching to it this companion solid torus along a primitive circle. Oh, well, all the circles are primited in a, in a, in a, in a product of a torus in an inner way. So, this particular region constructed, obtained by Constructed obtained by performing this boundary compression of the torus t2, we can call it a simple pair. It's a special type of pair. And again, to construct this simple pair, we pretty much start off with a contract torus, cross an interval, and then attach a solitaurus, fiber solid torus on a curve in one of the two, in the top or the bottom. And then we can push in this solitorus inside. This solitaurus inside and then make the picture look nicer like this. So you see this solitaurus in the simple pair and you see these two annuli sticking out connecting it to the bandary tori T182 and these circles are power circles. On the other side of the ambulus these circles run more than once around this orbitori. So that's kind of like what a simple pair looks like. Now Pair looks like. Now, if you actually want to get a picture of a real picture of one of these simple pairs, well, it's not that hard. All that we need to do is grab a hold of a power circle in a Genus2 handlebody, look at its unique non-separating compression disk of the complement, and then construct a circle, a separating circle that is disjoint from the power circle and in Circle and intersects this disk at two points. So that's easy to do, actually. And there's many perhaps different ways of doing them, but all of them are pretty much unique up to homeomorphisms. And when you look at the complement of the, when you cut the handle body along this compression disk of the power, of the green power circle called Giga Solitaurus, and the core of that solitaurus is called Of that solitaurus is called the core of the pair. And that will happen to be an interesting object to play with. So going back to this question of how do we count the number of cipher tori, disjoint cipher tori in the exterior of a hyperbolic genus why not, back in 2003, well, that's quite a bit of time by now, Tsuzuni proved that the largest number you can get is seven cipher to. Seven cipherpora. That can be improved slightly by looking at graphs of intersection arguments. We can intersect this incompressible surface, you know, this joint incompressible surface of cipher tora, the union of this cipher tora. In the history of the map, we can intersect that with the Kappai sphere obtained from thin position a la Gordon-Lucy. Use arguments a la Gordon-Lucy. Actually, we don't need the machinery, that much machinery of Gordon-Lucy. Machinery of cordon logi. We just need to analyze that graph of intersection. We have to have graphs of intersection that are nice, you know, the edges are not parallel to the boundary. And with that analysis and properties of simple pairs, it's enough to show that, well, we can have at most six cipher torrent, disjoint cipher torn in the exterior. So the question is whether we can actually have this six. And it turns out that's not possible. The reason is that The reason is that if you assume there are six cipher tori in the exterior, then most of the small regions produced by the cipher tori are going to be simple pairs. And if you spot a triple region like this one over here, if you spot a triple region that is not a hangover, it turns out that at the ends you have to spot this core. You have to spot these cores, these simple pairs, whose cores are hyperbolic nuts. They are L-dalinial hyperbolic nuts, and that's a very strong restriction. That forces actually all the pairs that you see here, you know, the six pairs, to be simple pairs. And even more, you can prove that certain circles, which are powers on one side, are actually cipher circles on the other side. And that's enough information. The other side, and that's enough information to have a very good idea of what this, what a Hager splitting for the sphere looks like, because it turns out that this side can be assumed to be a handle body and this other side also a handle body. So once you put together that, well, you have this six cipher tori produce a figure splitting of the three-sphere, but it doesn't work that way. It turns out that all the options produced by the cipher tori now By the cipher tori, none of them give a diagram that belongs to the three-sphere. Let me see. So then, so what about this Katimisa complex for this unus one act? Well, this is the complex generated by a graph, the graph where the vertices are the isotopy classes of minimal cipher surfaces. So in this case, puncture. Puncture tori. And the simplist is collections of vertices that can be simultaneously realized by this joint puncturectori. So you look at this graph, and the flag complex generated by that was proved to be the Catiniso complex by Schultens, by Jennifer. And we have several other properties, you know, for them. But one of the properties is this one: that the diameter of That the diameter of this graph, the one skeleton of the Kachimisub complex, is actually two, at most two, and the genus is one, and the number two is optimal. So that means that the Kachimisub complex could potentially look like this, and you could have some triangle leads that are connected at one edge. But it yourself, when you look more closely at the possibility. Closely at the possibilities, it turns out that no, there can be at most two top-dimensional synthesis in here. At this point, I think, I'm not sure, but okay, there it is. At most two top-dimensional synthesis. Of course, the graph is going to have at most five vertices because you can have at most five disjoint cipher surfaces. And when you have five cipher surfaces, cipher tora in the exterior, then the Exterior, then the Cartimesal complex actually has exactly one simplex. So, how does one go about this? Why would that be the case? So, here's a picture of, or pretend that in the exterior you can get four disjoint cipher surfaces. If you want to have a fifth cipher torus, well, it's going to have to intersect some of these four cipher tori that are already present here. That are already present here. And it turns out that for some reason, every time that you try to intersect this new camera with this old cipher to there might be a chance of producing really long annuli of intersection. And that's something that can be proven that does not happen by using properties of primitive pairs. And simple pairs, and this other type of pair that is called a primitive pair. So it turns out that the intersection actually has to look kind of like this. It has to be generated by this primitive pair is a handle body where on one cap, on one torus, you have a primitive circle, you have another primitive circle on the other one, and they are connected by an annulus. And then that connects to this simple pair on the other side this way. And again, these two pieces. And again, these two pieces are handle bodies necessarily. And then you can just do sort of like a swallow-follow construction and end up producing a fifth cipher torus. So and that's the only way. That's the only way you can add to a maximal collection of these joint cipher tori. So the complex in this case would look something like this picture over here. One final application, really fast, because we One final application really fast because we have to go, I think. How about primitive cipher notes? So we take a genus II Hager surface for the three-sphere, sketch a non-separating circle on it, the knot K, and we ask that the knot K be a cipher circle on one hindle body, one side of the surface. One side of the surface and be primitive on the other side. That essentially means that this level surgery that you see here on the knot will have to be either a lens space or a small cipher fiber space. So I'm interested in this case. And some of the questions that would be nice to answer quickly would be: well, what kind of slope can produce a second cipher space over the sphere with three fingers? Space over the sphere with three singular fibers different from this surgery. So, is there a different surgery that can produce one? And if there is one, is it an integral surgery or can it be non-integral? Of course, this question is for hyperbolic nerves. And well, again, we have to go. So, let me just tell you roughly what is the end of the story. So, if we do come up with a different surgery. A different surgery coefficient that produces a cipher space over the sphere with three singular fibers. And well, we know that this surface F, the original surface F, is the Higger surface for the three sphere, that's going to continue to be a cipher surface for after the surgery. That's if we push the cipher circle downwards towards the Downwards towards the primitive side. And if this surface produces a vertical Higger splitting after surgery, then we actually end up producing a picture that looks like this. We have the surgery torus, surgery nap down here, and then we can find a circle in the Higger surface, which is a power to both sides. To both sides, on both handle bodies. Of course, in the bottom handle body, the companion annulus is going to intersect the knot. And when you look at this situation from the point of view of the link formed by the core of this companion annulus, this core and the original NATK. And you look at that link. Well, that puncture annulus that I was. Puncture annulus that I was pointing at over here is going to be an incompressible surface which can be intersected again with a Gabai surface for the link and produce good graphs of intersection. And actually, this argument has been played before, assuming that this NOT L, which is a fiber of the surgery, if that is a trivial NOT in S3, then it is known that the denominator of the surgery S has to be a Surgery S has to be three or less. The question is whether three and two, you know, those denominators can occur or not. So under what conditions? And this construction seems to say something about that. All of this can be obtained just by looking at properties of primitive power and cipher circles. And they open up a window, a possible window of analysis. All right, so I'm going to stop here so we can go on with the next talk. Okay. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? A quick question. Well, a couple, but let me just ask one. You were saying, like, so there are these cases where you have four disjoint once-punctured torus ciphered surfaces. And you said that's the max possible. Do any of those have other incompressible? Do any of those have other incompressible ciphered surfaces, like hyogenous? Oh, well, actually, the maximum number is five. And do they have other ones? Actually, I haven't thought about that. Let me see. I don't see why not. Yeah, I don't see why not. But I don't really know. Let me see. Because there's the other Kakamitsu complex where you're looking at it like incompressible surfaces, not just minimal genus. And I was just curious. Genus, and I was just curious. Maybe that's the reason for restricting to minimal genus. And actually, the restriction to genus one is because of this handle body, genus two handle body game that is possible to be played. You try to go up to genus two and the magic is gone. But yeah, I guess I was hoping if you leverage the fact that you had all of these genus one surfaces, then you could say you put a higher genus surface in relation to those and see what happens. Relation to those and see what happens or something. But yeah, I think it's possible. I would say it is possible. And the reason is because, well, are you talking about the exactly that or just fewer? I mean, look, I mean, when you have just a single genus one, I think you probably easily get a whole bunch of higher genus other incompressible surfaces. But say, like, you're in the case where you have the maximum of genus one surfaces. Genus one surfaces. Say you got five. I guess you said it was five is the most you can have. So what happens? Is it possible there are other incompressible ciphric surfaces rather than just the five genus one surfaces? So that's equivalent to having incompressible closed surfaces in the continent, I guess. Yeah, I don't really know, actually. I barely have an idea what these nodes look like other than their properties. What these notes look like, other than their properties. Yeah, that's going to be another question: what do they look like? Yeah, well, there are pictures, some of them, but the pictures are rather artificial. In other words, they don't capture the level of complexity of the family of these types of things. And we're saying that not only for number five, but for pretty much any number. I can draw a few with when it's one. Okay, unfold your pulse, please. Okay, Mario. Okay, so we should start, say, in two minutes.
