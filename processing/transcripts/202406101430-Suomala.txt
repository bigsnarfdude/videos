Our first speaker in the afternoon session will be Vida Solmala from University of Oru and he will talk about three dimensions of land of escapes. Thank you and I also want to extend my thanks to the organizers for setting up this very nice meeting. Everything is perfect so far and thanks also for the very nice invitation. So before the lunch break John Frazier in his talk gave a very nice In his talk, he gave a very nice introduction to Fourier dimension. And John also mentioned that it's often quite complicated to compute the exact value of the Fourier dimension. So in my talk, which is still a bit ongoing work with Chang Hao Chen and Ping Li, I would like to discuss an example where there is actually a exit formula. A formula you can complete it explicitly the fully dimension for a certain random family of measures, which is this matter called cascades. So, here you can see the main definitions: the Fourier dimension of a measure with reference excise, just given by this primarial integral. And this already this condition if μ is absolutely conducive with respect to Lebesgue measure. With respect to Lepec measure, and by the in magnetic memo, we know that the transfer goes to zero at infinity. But if we have some fractal measure or some singular measure, it's not necessarily the case. So, already this property that mu psi goes to zero and psi goes to infinity is some somewhat important regular property of the measure. John explained this already a bit, and I think we will hear about this at Hear about this at least in Malapica's mini course later this week and probably in some other talks. And this Fourier dimensional, so here you can see the definitions of this quantifies the optimal polynomial Fourier of the measure in question. And also we heard, we recall this very nice formula. This is a very nice formula for the S-energy of a measure expressed in terms of the square of the modules of the Fourier transform, which immediately gives us a relation between the decay of the Fourier transform and then the finiteness of this energy. So for any measure, if the S-energy is finite, If the s energy is finite, then this s will be a lower part for the Hausdorff dimension of the measure, and this implies that the Fourier dimension of any measure is always at most the Hausdorff dimension. So there's a slight difference or a different flavor maybe here if we consider this for measures than for sets. So for measures, so the supremum of those values of S for which this energy is finite. Energy is finite, doesn't have to be equal to the Hausdorff dimension. It's quite often strictly smaller than the Hausdorff dimension of the measure. So, this quantity is called the correlation dimension. So, for measures, we know that this Fourier dimension is at most the correlation dimension, and the correlation dimensions have most alpha dimensions. And in some, I would say, very rare cases, all these. Rare cases, all these dimensions agree, and in this case, the support is a solemn set, and this measure is called a solemn measure. And while the surface measure on a sphere in Rn is a classical example, and then there are other well-known examples, but most of the known examples are random, and there are still not that many that many, I mean. That many, I mean, examples of solemn measures. And I would even say that there are not that many examples of measures where we even have some information about the Fourier diamonds. Even this condition that the Fourier well, I mean, this this this co condition that the Fourier dimension is positive, of course, not that strong one, so there are a lot of examples, but One, so there are a lot of examples, but in this point in this talk is that we will consider this motherboard cascades and we will be able to compute it, determine explicitly the poli dimension. And somehow for this to motivate this is that at least most of these examples of these salon measures, which I'm aware of, they are actually monofractiles. There are actually mono fractals. So the Curie altars or the local dimension takes a constant value, not only almost everywhere, but in many cases, everywhere. So the multifractal spectrum is kind of degenerate, just one point. And for multifractal measures, this correlation dimension is strictly smaller than the House of Dimensions. This is already some kind of indication of multi-fract dimensions. Multifractal measures. So, for multifractal measures, you really don't have any hope of them being solid. The best you could hope for is that the Fourier dimension equals the correlation dimension. Okay, so some examples of multifractal measures with positive Fourier dimensional, some Fourier decades. Also, there's a paper by Falcon and Teanfour a couple of years ago, where they studied the Gaussian movement. The Gaussian multiplicated chaos on the plane, and they, using a projection method, they show that the Fourier dimension is strictly positive. I think there's a quantitative lower point here as well. In a joint work with Pablo some years ago, there are some generic examples, and some of them are multifractal measures which satisfy some. Measures which satisfy some of these conditions. And then there's a recent work from maybe October last year, Carl Panavarkas, who studied this Gaussian multiplicative chaos on the circle in the plane, and they saw that it's a Ratzmann master, so that fully transformed close to zero. And Carpo and Marcus actually later pointed out that there are not that many examples of multifactorial measures of any kind. Factor measures of any kind on the sphere which have decay. So, in the end of the talk, time permitting, I will discuss this cast case of the circle and so that there is, at least we have a lower part for the degree dimension of the circle as well. Okay, so the model, this is actually a very classical model. So, we start with a fixed random variable, w. Random variable, W. Expectation is one and it takes only non-negative values. And then we consider the dialect was of the unit interval. For each dialic interval, we attach an independent copy of this random arrival capolet. And then, if we take an interval of level n, direct interval of level n, it has n, or n plus 1 maybe, ancestors, dyadic ancestors. And for each of them, there is a And for each of them, there is a random variable attached, and we take the product of these random variables. That will be the density of my measure of this interval variables. And then there's going to be a weak limit, and this week limit is now the product of this cascade process, this technique that I want to study. So here is a picture. So it's quite often, at least for me, it's convenient and helps to. Convenient and helps to think about this as a direct tree. So we have a direct tree. For each of the vertices, we attach an independent copy of the independent random variables with the same law. We take a vertex of the tree. We look at the path from the root to the vertex. So there are n plus 1 vertices. Everywhere there is this random arrival. I just take a product of these four random arrivals that will be. Random variables that will be the density of my measure and this corresponding dielectric. So, this is a quite well-known family of measures because actually the paper Monday brought exactly fifty years ago, so this is the fiftieth anniversary. Well, I was preparing the slides. And there's The slides, and there's an enormous literature on this. And as far as I know, no one computed the Fourier dimension before, so let's try to do it now. Some very basic properties. So, of course, we would like the limit to be non-zero, otherwise that makes very much sense. The condition for this limit measure being non-zero with positive probability is the expectation of W log W strictly less than one. Strictly less than one. In this case, the Hausa dimension, so the almost sure value of the local dimensions of the limit measure would be one minus this number. And apart from one very special case, this measure will be multifractal. So, this leverage edge of the local diamonds on map will be non-empty for a range of values of value. And as a result of this multifractality, Result of this multifractality, the correlation dimension will be strictly smaller than the Hausdorff dimensions. This is not going to be the fully dimension, except in one very special case. I like simple examples, so here's a simple example: just two values for the random variable. Because the expectation is one, one of them has to be less than one, and the other one has to be larger than one. And these values also determine the probabilities because of the condition of the expectation. A special case of a special case which is of interest, one of the, if it takes only one positive value, so this corresponds to the model which is called father operation or rectal population. So in this case, you basically just consider the diademic tree and it takes probability of killing each vertex independently of. Independently of the each product. And then the diadit, the sub-tree corresponding to the, which is the connected component of the root transfers to the nuclear size, will be the fractal coefficient state, and this cascade measure will be the natural measure. And in this case, actually, with Pablo, we observed some years ago that this natural measure of the practical population, which is a very special case of a cascade measure, is a sub. Special case for cascade measure is a solid measure. But this is just the case, exactly the case where these cascades are more factor. All the other non-degenerate cases they will be moving. Okay, if you like symmetry, here's another special case of a special case. Take one plus lambda, one minus lambda, it's probably one half. Some unbounded examples, you cannot take. Uh you cannot take normal uh the normal distribution because you want to have monomatic values. So uh you could take the half-normal or which is kind of the one of the main examples in this business is that if we take the exponential logonormal, this is the log normal distribution and take your favorite example. And in all these cases, or in general, what is the dimension? What is the Fourier dimension? This is the question that I try to This is the question that I try to answer. We assume, so we have to assume something, we assume that this W sub Gaussian, so the tail decays as fast as a Gaussian random variable. So, in our examples, all these bounded random variables satisfy this condition trivially, and so does the half-normal, but unfortunately. And so does the half-normal, but unfortunately, this log normal, which is one of the main examples, doesn't satisfy this. So we don't have a result for that so far. But under this assumption, so if the random variable is subclassion, then we know that the Fourier dimension is the maximum. So it equals the correlation dimension. Okay, I promised a quantitative value, so let's discuss that. So now, suppose we know that these values exist. We know that these values exist. We can just then just try to compute the L2 dimension. This is well known, and at least the first part is actually plus well. So the correlation dimension equals the L2 dimension. This is something that you might know already. So you can express it as the log of the sum of the squares of the measures of the level n-diabic intervals divided by minus. So it's basically giving the scaling exponent of this. This is for any measure, any finite measure, the two dimensions, the correlation dimensions are the same. In our case, cascade case, it's easy to see that the expectation of this guy inside will be 2 to the minus tau and this value tau 1 minus o of the expectation tau squared. Expectation W squared. And it's then reasonable to expect that this would be actually the L2 dimension. And it is in one case. So if we now normalize this sum with this 2 to the tau n, this would be a marking here. It has a limit. The limit could be zero, but if the limit is non-zero, we know that this would be tau two dimensions. We know that this will be the two-dimensional. You can also express this sum as a total mass of a Monday port cascade, but you have to switch the random variable, the original variable squared, and then normalize it so that the expectation is one. If this cascade if the cascade corresponding to this random variable is subcritical, then the rhyme L to rhyme is clear by this one. Is clear by this value. Otherwise, there actually is some freezing effect that happens. So there will be a unique Q which is between 1 and 2, so that if you look at the cascade, which corresponds to W to the Q normalized, so that the expectation is 1, that this is critical. And then there's a formula for the L two dimension of the orange dimension in terms of this. I hope I get the computation correction yet. But anyway, there is a formula in both cases. Of formal line volt cases. Okay, so now we want to prove our theorem. So we know in general the Fourier dimensions at most the correlation dimension. We just have to show that the Fourier dimension is at least the correlation dimension. We know quite out of the correlation dimension. And then momentarily we fix a frequency. So we split this difference. So now we remember μ is the weak limit of this approximation. Approximate approximations mu n. We look at this marginal difference sequence for a fixed ψ, the Fourier transform of mu n plus 1 xi minus the Fourier transform of mu n xi. So it is an integral of this chi over the unit interval. We express it as a sum of the integrals over the dyadic intervals of level 2 to the minus n. So then t. The minus n. So then these integrals here, conditioning on the end stage of the process, this will be independent random variables, these guys here. They will be independent random variables and the expectation is zero. So we have a sum of independent random variables with expectation zero. We want to know how much they positively deviate from the mean. And now assuming we have this Assuming we have this subcausion condition for this original random variable, we can write down all cases, we can write down the definition of the subcausion norm of this random variable xi here. That's just the definition. And you can check that it's actually comparable to the measure of the now the conditioning on the sigma algebra which is generated by the first m in the in the tree the the In the tree, the random variables correspond to the level n sub tree. Collision on that, this subcausion norm of this xi will be comparable to the measure of u n measure i. And then we can use Huptin's inequality for subcausion random variables, plug in the information there. And we have a bound. So this is just this mapping editor. This guy here is this guy. This guy here is this guy. So, the probability that the smarting n difference will be much larger than the square, the L2 sum of this mu and i's. Square root of that will be actually super exponentially small. So, what is important here is maybe that if you remember that this mu n i squared, the sum, this sum is supposed to scale at 2 to the minus. supposed to scale like two to the minus n tau two. So then this guy here is is I mean we are basically aiming at this. We are basically aiming at this kind of estimate for all psi for all n. That's our goal. But now for a fixed xi and for a fixed n, we have some probabilistic estimated things going wrong, the probability is super exponentially small. We can, of course, repeat this finally many times. So now, still fixing M, repeat this for like a discrete but still reasonably dense family of frequencies, collection of frequencies. So like all sizes are less than 2 to the n and push differences 2 to the minus n double 2 over 2. So this is like an exponential, there are exponentially many of this size estimate we have. This size, the estimate we had was super exponentially small. So, the probability that this happening, this estimate going, I mean, having this estimate in the other direction for all this size, for this fixed n is still one minus some limit super exponential, n. And now we use this that basically just the definition of the L2 dimensional t. The dimension of the L2 dimension in this cascade case. So we know that this L2 sums will behave like 2 minus n tau. So we plug that in here and replace this by the 2, the minus n tau over 2. And then we have this for like finitely many, but like a delta dense for this number, delta and a collection of size. We can use the continuity of the Continuity of the ellipsoid continuity of this mu xi. Here I'm using the fact that the total mass is a marking, so it will be uniformly bound. We can actually extend this for all xi, where the morals is less than 2 to the n. And then if xi happens to be and actually even for all n, just using Pora Cantelli. So we can just sum this over all n and we can we actually have this estimate. O n, and we can we actually have to estimate for O n for all ψ which are less than 2 to the n. Okay, now if xi happens to be larger than 2 to the n, we just use change of parameters beyond the line, which works. So we will have instead of this, we will have the following relations. So this mu n plus 1 Fourier transform of psi minus the corresponding mu n will be this frequency xi mod 2n divided by xi times this thing which we have on the left hand side. thing which we have on the left hand side. So depending now on the value of ψ, whether it's less than 2 to the n or larger than 2 to the n, we will have two estimates. We use telescoping, we sum everything up, we use the fact that this measure that we started with is just the characteristic function thing we integrate, it's very big decay, and this will add up and we will get the we have the required decay for the retraction. For the proof this The return. So the proof is quite simple. Okay, so that's it for the unit interval. So then something can be said on the circle, for sure. This is very preliminary. I mean, it's something I took up for the talk, because I wanted to have... So it's correct. I think it's correct, but it's also like the first thing you can have in mind. So it's quite likely that this can be improved. Can be improved. So we try to just imitate. So we do the same model, but instead of the line, we consider a cascade of the circle. The probabilistic estimate is exactly the same. So there's no difference. There's no difference. We can have for the small frequencies, and we can put an upper bound, just 2 to the n, but 2 to the n q for some q larger than 1. We get that this, we get exactly the same estimate with extremely large probability. With extremely large probability for all n. Now we can split the, we can do the same telescoping. I skipped this part, but we can do this. So we basically have to, well, I should have done this, but I don't have time. So basically I have to, so I'm looking at the difference. How much does this equal from what we start? So I compute this in steps with respect to n, use the triangle inequality. I split the sum into two parts, from n to capital N, and then From n to capital N and then from capital N to n or infinity, essentially. When the xi is small compared to this value n, I can use the probabilistic estimate. So the latter part here, no problem. I have additional parameters q here so that I have to pay a little price here. So I get psi to the minus tau over 2q. The first one, I have this change of value. First one, I have this change of barato trick. That doesn't work on the circle, but we can use one that corpus lemma. Basically, it's just that if I take a characteristic function of an arc on the circle, then the fully transformed decays as 1 over square root of psi with uniform constants. I just plug in that to estimate the first sum. I arrive with 2 to the n total measure at scale n size of the. size of the minus one half. This guy is bounded because the total mass is I'm working it. So I will arrive into just summing up, I will arrive into something like this. I did some selection in the beginning. I think I selected psi to be, I selected this capital N, so that psi is about equal to the QN. And then I have two estimates. For the first one, I have this bound. This pound for the second sum, I have this pound, and then I just optimize over Q, and I will arrive at something like this. This is now a quantitative path for the Fourier diameter of the cascade on the circle. Most likely can be improved. Whether one can be sure that it's actually equal to the L two dimension, so I don't know, maybe there are obviously twice, but don't comment on that too much. Comment on that too much. Final remarks. I assume that we are dimensions one. This is not necessarily necessary. We can put this in higher dimensions. There's an obstacle. We cannot show that this, I mean, the Fourier dimension will never be partial two. This is basically because of the dyadic structure. If you are in higher dimensions, you look at the projection in the principal directions. There would be a lot of discontinuity. So that would imply that the green dimension can never be large in this model. With this model, we can do the circle thing on the sphere, possibly in other curves, where you have something to replace the one that causes level of it. Also, I believe the method is quite robust. So, I mean, for sure it doesn't have to be a cascade. This marketing property of the cascade is essential. Some kind of independence, that if you are looking at things which are part of A and you conditional level NT should be independent. And then, of course, in order for this to work. And then of course, in order for this to work, I mean you should have some almost all value for the for this uh L two dimension, correlation dimension, and some geometric information. Now we had something very trivial, we had this change of variabletrix on the line, one of the cobalt on the circle, something like that should hold in order to keep my lower part for the three dimensions. But I think there are there is like there are many models where one can apply this simple idea. This simple idea. Some final comments. So there's another group, Jen Han, Q and Wan, who reported that they worked on the same, at least partly in the same problem. So they told us that they have some Fourier decay about polynomial or desire. So we're trying to To schedule this so that it would be beneficial for both of us because we don't have agreement yet, and they don't have agreement yet. They are not trying to make it a competition. Ruo had also some random solar instead of the parapola. They are not cascades, but they are, but the proof is method of the proof is similar, so I want to add some similarity. I have something already. I want to mention that. Also, this these main methods kind of originate from the or or at least uh part of it originates from my joint work with Patlo, which I mentioned earlier on the practical calculation. But there are some mild differences here compared to that case. I think I will stop here. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Are there any questions, comments? Yeah, any guess as to what happens if you don't have the sub-Gaussian assumption, like in the normal normal case? Is it just a technicality or maybe the different behavior? I mean, this method rests on the on the lastimate for the sum of gain dependent on the variable phase. So so so I've done some investigation what is known, but Investigation: What is known, but so far I didn't find anything would be useful. I think this log normal case should I I don't know if I think or I hope, but I kind of think that in that case, hopefully it will work out. Any other questions? Ask, is that assumption only used in the application of the concentration inequality? So, Hofdeen's inequality is that the only place. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, and that, so that would be, so if you replace that with something like Azuma's and it follow here, you would still run into the same problem, right? Well, the point is that we need, I mean, we need this exponential bound. So the. Right, right, right. So that bound. Basically, that much is to deviate from the, at most from the expectation. Okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Thank you. So, no more questions according to the bell. So, can I explain the speaker again? And we have a coffee create.
