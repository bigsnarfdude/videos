However, let's see. When we looked in neurons very carefully, what we could see is that we see two types of structures labeled with EB1, these fast-growing plus ends and also these very slow growing minus Ns that grow in the opposite direction to plus N's. And this is what it looks like. So again, this is part of a dendrite. The pink arrow labels the minus N. The pink arrow labels the minus end, and you can see it's growing away from the cell body in the opposite direction from the plus end. Okay, and then if we look early in development, what you can see is that there are plus ends zipping into the cell body, and then there are a whole bunch of little minus ends growing out into this developing dendrite. And what we found is that this minus end growth is mediated by a minus end binding protein called petronin. Binding protein called petronin. And that helps minus ends grow for really long time periods, up to 10 minutes for a single stretch of growth. And this sustained minus end growth is important for setting up this type of polarity in dendrites. Okay, so we can get minus ends into dendrites by growing them out there. You could also imagine that you could make minus ends far from the cell body if you moved the nucleation sites or gamma-tubulin ring complexes from. Tubulin ring complexes from the center some out into the dendrite. So, if you look at gamma tubulin, the most abundant member of this gamma-tubulin ring complex in neurons, what you can see is that it's abundant in the cell body, as you might expect, but you also see these patches of gamma-tubulin and enriched at branch points. And we spent a number of years trying to figure out how it's enriched here and what it's on. And what we ended up with is that endosomes. That endosomes recruit nucleation sites to dendrite branch points and nucleate new microtubules there. I'm going to show you a movie of what that looks like. In this movie, endosomes are green and EB1 is green. You can distinguish them based on the behavior. So you'll see three endosomes and we'll be looking at a single branch point kind of like this. And it should be clear what you're looking at. Okay, so here we go. You have three spots here that are all endosomes, and you can see. Here that are all endosomes, and you can see that that comet originated from one of them and pulled it around a little bit. So, that's a new microtubule growing from an endosome in a branch point. And so, what we figured out is that you can generate in dendrites, new microtubules from endosomes. If they're generated in this direction, they maintain polarity. But, okay, so you can make them out here. Here. But if they are made going this way or this way, you disrupt polarity because you end up with plus end-l-microtubules. So by looking at this mechanism, it led us to a new question, which is what happens to these new microtubules? If you look at them, above 60% do head in the right direction, but you have sort of 40% overall heading the wrong way out of these branch points. So in this example, we're looking. Points. So in this example, we're looking just at microtubules that grow from here. This is one that's growing the wrong way out of the branch point. Okay, so our next question was: why don't these disrupt polarity? And so what we did was to track these microtubules as they left the branch point to figure out what happened to them. And what we found is that the ones that grow in the right direction towards the cell body have a much higher Body has a much higher probability of growing through the two microns leaving the branch point than the ones going in the opposite direction. So the ones going in the opposite direction tend to fail and undergo catastrophe. So in a collaboration with Will Hancock's lab, we showed that this is due to the action of this kinesin V, KLP61F, that promotes polymerization of new microtubules if there is an existing microtubule in the parallel orientation. You built in the parallel orientation. Okay, so we have two ways to generate minosins in dendrites. You can grow them in, you can make them locally, and then we have this mechanism that reinforces correct orientation based on the polarity of existing microtubules. There's one more mechanism that I have to introduce quickly that plays a huge role in controlling polarity, and that also occurs at branch points. Occurs at branch points. So in this diagram, we have a single branch point here with the cell body down at the bottom. These are the stable microtubules, and you can have new microtubules growing in from the cell periphery. When they reach this junction, they have a choice. They can turn towards the cell body, and this maintains polarity. No, that's fine. So we are back at the dendrite branch point. We're thinking about what happened. We're thinking about what happens to new microtubules when they come in. So, if they grow down towards the cell body, no problem. This is still a minus end-out microtubule. But if they grow in the opposite direction, now you've generated a plus end-out microtubule and you've perturbed polarity. So, we observed this in vivo a long time ago. This was my first project when I started my lab, and found that most microtubules do this, so 98% of the time. And we identified Time. And we identified the machinery that allows them to do that. And what happens is kinesin 2 is hooked onto the plus end of a microtubule with its motor domain out through APC and EB1. And when this new microtubule encounters a preexisting one, the kinesin can recognize the polarity and will start walking towards the plus end. And this drags the growing plus end down towards the cell body. And once we figured this out, Will Hancock. Once we figured this out, Will Hancock's lab was able to reconstitute this steering process in vitro. Okay, so what I've told you then is so far we have these four mechanisms that contribute to the minus and out polarity in dendrites, and three of them take place at dendrite branch points. So to give you a feel for what that looks like, I'm going to show you this movie of a couple of branch points with microtubules growing into them being made in them. Them being made in them. Okay, so you can see that the branch points really are quite dynamic spots where microtubules are constantly choosing what to do. Okay, so this was way more complicated than I thought it would be when I started to think about this problem when I started my lab. So we have all these independent mechanisms that use different machinery to control polarity. And I think you need And I think you need all these mechanisms for a couple of reasons. First, as you saw, the microtubules are dynamic. So you have to constantly reinforce polarity for very long time scales. Second, as you'll see at the end, this polarity has to be responsive to other things going in on the cell. So it's not fixed. It can be maintained for a lifetime, but it can also change. Okay, so this is a So, this is a complexity that is difficult for us to assemble just by sitting here and thinking about it. And so, this is where our collaboration with Veronica and Scott came in to try to put this together into a framework that will allow us to understand it more deeply. All right. Thanks, Melissa. So, as Melissa very clearly outlined, this is a very nice system for modeling. It's essentially a 2D geometry. It's essentially a 2D geometry, but really, if we focus within a branch or if we focus within each of the trunk or each of the branches of the dendrite, we really have one-dimensional geometry even. And so what I'll show you in the first few slides is a very preliminary, like version 0.0, if you want, kind of model that we used to sort of establish our common language and vocabulary with the lab. And even this very simplified model that you will see had a lot. Simplified model that you will see had a lot of assumptions helped us make some biological insights. So, what we did here is we basically constrained the spatial dynamics to these compartments. So, you can kind of tell there's four compartments in the trunk, the way they're drawn there, and there's a couple compartments in each of the dendrites. And so, the way that the microtubules were navigating this in this model, the dendrite, was by jumping essentially between these different compartments. Different compartments, but abiding by those mechanisms that have been identified in the lab. So they had different probabilities and stochastic transitions between different states to do so. And so what you're kind of seeing here is establishment of polarity in that wherever you're seeing this thicker rectangle, there were more microtubules in the model that were localizing there with that minus and out polarity, for example. A big, big assumption here was that we had these microtubules. Was that we had these microtubule sticks? They were fixed-length microtubules. And that's a huge and unrealistic assumption. But we've heard some talks in the conference so far, and Bill yesterday talked about a model where it's okay to make that assumption, that there's not, that we don't include essentially polymerization, depolymerization dynamics. And what you'll see here is that I'm not going to make that point. In fact, our version 0.1 will show you how we don't do that. But for a first attempt. But for a first attempt, this is how we decided to approach it. So, the couple of insights that we got from this simple model were that we were expecting in vivo in experiments to see the polarity of microtubules in the tips of branches to be pretty much mixed. In our model, what we were seeing is that the plus ends, which makes sense, right, they were growing into the tips of the branches and they were accumulating there at percentages that were not. Percentages that were not seen in experiments. And so that made us think about whether there's something that happens at those tips of the branches that we're not capturing in the model. And in fact, in Vivo, in the Rawls lab, they were able to confirm higher catastrophe rates at the end of the tips. And now they're new hypotheses that they want to test that there might be an enzyme, maybe a deep polymerase that destabilizes those ends at the dendrite tips. So that was right. So that was one of the first insights. Another was that, again, in vivo, in situations where they're able to interfere with steerings, to take steering out essentially, so that mechanisms that seems to be pretty important for polarity establishment, they would see about 50% minus end down polarity. In our model, we were still seeing more than half minus n-dip polarity, so predominant minus n-dipolarity, despite taking that mechanism out. So that made us think. Mechanism out. So that made us think that some other mechanisms in there we might need to refine. So instead of potentially using these percentages of how new microtubules are nucleated with a bias towards the cell body, instead we want to look at a feedback mechanism of how they're growing in the correct direction by building on the tracks that are already there and the polarity of the tracks that are already there. And I will tell you a little bit more about that. And I will tell you a little bit more about that in future slides. And so now, in the new version, what we're trying to do is actually go back and understand the dynamics of microtubules, their turnover. And so microtubules have dynamic ends, just like Melissa introduced. To me, it was very clear from before, from my work on cargo transport on microtubules that plus ends grow and undergo catastrophe. But frankly, it was kind of mind-blowing to me that minus ends can do that too. And even though there's Can do that too, and even though they're slower, it's a more sustained growth. And not only that, but it's very important for establishing this polarity that's very important in neurons. And so the way that we are modeling this essentially micro-scale microtubule dynamics is that we have a minimal stochastic model, a Markov chain model, that switches between growth and shrinking at each end. And as you can imagine, these two stochastic processes are actually coupled. Stochastic processes are actually coupled to each other because you might imagine those two ends shrinking or one of the ends shrinking into the other, and that leads to complete catastrophe of that microtubule. And I will say here that I know there's people in the audience who have worked on more complex tubulent assembly models at either end of microtubules, probably more the plus end. But we, for now, don't think that that kind of complexity is really needed. And we're focusing our detailed modeling effort. Detailed modeling effort more into the navigation and spatial organization of microtubules in the branch points. And so, in this new version of the model, we are incorporating this dynamic microtubule ends. And so, what you're seeing here are climographs of both a plus end growth and shrinking and minus end growth and shrinking. And what is really, really exciting to me about this is that we are able This is that we are able to get parameters from this for this system. We essentially have an idea of what the speeds and even distribution of the speeds are for both plus ends and minus ends. We have an idea of the average amount of time that is spent in either the growth or the shrinking phase for both a plus and minus end. So that's really exciting that we don't have to have that many free parameters in this micro scale model of microtubule dynamics. All right. All right. And so this new model incorporates this dynamic microtubule turnover, and it has these variable-length microtubules that are now living in two dimensions. You can see how they can be within the trunk, they could be curved at the trunk into the branches, and so on. Very important to us in this kind of model is to make it modular. And what I mean by that is that we can vary the number of branches and branch points. And that's because in Vivo, Points. And that's because in vivo, it is observed that different neurons have different number of branch points in their dendrites. And so that's something that we want to understand: the impact of that kind of parameter on polarity. And so on the right, you're just seeing maintenance of polarity in one single simulation. So what this kind of model incorporates is all of those four, all of those four mechanisms that Melissa talked about. So one of them is the minus incorporation. So, one of them is the minus end group, which we talked about, but essentially, you can look at these orange microtubules. Again, the arrow is the plus end, the other direction is the minus end. And so they can either grow with the minus end at the cell body, and so we're incorporating that in the model now, but also they can grow at the minus end and encounter branch point and have to make a decision there. So, that's one of the mechanisms we're incorporating. Another one is that nucleation at branch point that we talked about already. That we talked about already. In the first round of this model, we were using the actual probabilities from observed experiments, observed in experiments of nucleation biases in each direction. But now we're incorporating feedback from existing microtubules. So say if you're looking again at that orange microtubule, its decision to basically nucleate towards the cell body to have its plus end down and minus end up would be based on a probability that weighs how many. That weights, how many tracks are there with that orientation in which it's trying to grow? So, for the third one, we know that once they do nucleate, there's also this catastrophe zone or survival probability for these microtubules. And we actually have never really used the exact percentages or probabilities. We, from the start, have been using a sort of feedback mechanism, though we're probably adjusting that moving forward. So, so far, what we're doing is if this orange So far, what we're doing is if this orange microtubule nucleated and is going towards the subbody, we allow it to survive and continue its polymerization, depolymerization dynamics, if there are any available right tracks in that direction. It might be more realistic to use a probability instead, and that's something we're looking into. And finally, steering is very important. And again, here, as this orange microtubule comes in, what we want to do is we want to get a sense. want to do is we want to get a sense of locally at that branch point at that spatial location what kind of tracks can it encounter for a can easen motor to steer it in any given direction so again we're incorporating a feedback mechanism based on the available existing tracks all right um i think this is the video so this would show you what what the dynamics looks like right now with um minus and plus send down microtubules and i think minus and down Microtubules, and I think mine is send out our light purple here. And what you'll see here is that it kind of maintains the polarity, but it turns out if we run this for longer, that can switch. And so that's why we're revisiting all of the mechanisms that I've talked about and we're trying to incorporate more and more of our understanding of what happens in Evo in the file. So, some ways in which we'll validate this dynamics, and in particular, the microtubule turnout. And in particular, the microtubule turnover dynamics, so that growth and epolymerization at the plus and minus ends will be by using some exciting experiments on tubuling photoconversion. So here there's a window that is chosen along an axon or a dendrite, a section of an axon or a dendrite. And so you can see that red tubelin protein that's being trapped there. And then it's being observed as time goes on. And so you can see, for example, in the axon that Example in the axon, that both at zero and at one hour, the amount of fluorescence in that windows seems to be relatively about the same as the microtubules in there are very stable. In the dendrite, you can see how some of that fluorescence goes down. And in fact, the goals lab has chronification of this. This is just for illustration purposes. But what you're seeing there, that there's more dynamics. This would be a way for us to validate our model, to basically take a section in our model. In our model, and essentially model this experiment. One of our very exciting goals, perhaps ambitious, but very exciting, is to combine this model with all of these in vivo experiments to understand this fascinating experiment. So it turns out that when the axon is injured right under the cell body, so where Melissa is pointing right now, what happens is that What happens is that a dendrite will essentially convert into a regenerating axon. What that requires, though, as you've seen in the previous slides of what the microtubule polarity looks like in a dendrite versus an axon, is that really all the microtubules in that previous dendrite have to flip their polarity. So they're now plus end out instead of minus end out. So that's really fascinating, both from the point of view of the biology that it's able. The biology that it's able to remodel itself, but also from a dynamical systems point of view. And so we are interested in understanding what parameters and individual mechanisms might be at play and might help us understand that kind of reversal. As the polarity flips, you can see what happens is there might be a transition stage where the microtubule polarity is mixed, and then one of the dendrite is selected to convert into that regenerating axon. For generating axon. And it turns out that some preliminary work in the lab is showing that what's happening at those purple zones there at the catastrophe zones might be very important in determining and selecting the dendrite that's essentially going to convert its polarity, flip its polarity entirely. It tends to be that the simple dendrite that you see on the bottom right is the one that converts its polarity rather than the most comb dendrite that you see on the top. Most comb dendrites that you see on the top of this figure. So that's interesting. And we don't really understand if it has to do with the number of branch points, with the branch angle. And certainly these are things that we're going to look into. We're also interested in whether there's any bi-stability in this dynamical system. So is it equally likely that we could get a plus send out and a minus send out polarity, and there's some tipping zone in the middle where decisions are made based on some stochastic fluctuation. Some stochastic fluctuation? Or is it that if we start with an initial asymmetry, say with plus and dial polarity, then the feedback mechanisms that we understand are just going to consolidate that polarity through time. And so we definitely will be exploring that kind of question with a stochastic model. But hopefully in the future, as we understand this better and as we try to coarse grain it, we could also approach it with partial or stochastic differential equations. Or stochastic differential equations that would be easier to analyze. So, with that, thank you so much for your attention. These are the people who contributed. And missing from here is Melissa Rolls' group that pretty much took any of our suggestions and went and tested them and gave us parameters. It's been just an amazing collaboration. And we're looking forward to trying to answer some of the many open questions that exist in this problem. So, thank you very much. So, thank you very much. Thank you. That was a very beautiful example of collaboration. And I love how you tested all the different in vivo mechanisms. So, are there any questions from the online participants? I don't see anybody with a hand raised, so maybe I could ask a question. Yeah, beautiful talk and also a beautiful collaboration between experiment and computational modeling. My question is about more on the structural level in terms of this mixed polarity or same polarity interactions between microtubules in that polarity reinforcement processes. Is there anything known whether just microtubules themselves prefer to be next to each other? Prefer to be next to each other in the same polarity direction, opposite direction, whether there are cross-linking proteins that somehow would help to determine that. Yes, so most microgebial cross-linking proteins don't care about polarity, but the one that I had on that we've identified as part of this, the branch point exit, Trim 9, is the fly version of TRIM. The fly version of trim 48. And Casper Hoganrod's lab has shown that that is a very special microtubule bundling protein that will only bundle parallel-oriented microtubules. So they're probably, I mean, we heard earlier in one of the talks about this idea that you can zipper up filaments to kind of reinforce them. We have not looked much at that type of mechanism. Type of mechanism. So that may also play a role in controlling organization. And the only place we've looked at that so far is with the term nine and that kind of probability success probability. But yeah, that's it. That's another potential missing piece. Thanks. Any other online questions? Okay, let's go to the in-person audience. Hi, this is Leah. Beautiful work. Is there any evidence of an angle dependence at the branch point? Yes, there is. So the place where we looked at this was with the steering mechanism. And what, so there are different types of sensory neurons in this Drosophila larval skin, and they have different branch angles. So the one that I've been showing, that's the one we've looked at the most. Been showing that's the one we've looked at the most has very right angle branches. And so you have this anything coming into the branch really geometrically has almost equal probability of each direction. There are other dendrites that have acute, and this is actually much more normal acute angle branches. And so if you get rid of that kinase and two mediated steering in the neurons that I showed with the right angle branches, you go about 50-50 mixed. In the acute angle dendrites, it's 70-30. So there definitely is a geometric effect. We've looked at it with respect to that one mechanism. I think one of the things that we're planning on doing is building that into the model and going back and looking at some of the other dendrites with different branch angles to see which mechanisms are influenced by geometry. Because I think that's a really interesting direction. Really interesting direction because the geometry of dendrites is really important to their function and may make some of them more susceptible to losing polarity than others. Yeah, that's a great question. Currently, we don't have it in the model because we didn't know which mechanisms would be affected by it, but that's something we're interested in. Yeah, if I may add, I seem to recall Eric Sichenbaum was that UBC had a model of market to be organizational. A model of mercury tubular organization in plants where the probability of catastrophe depended on the angle. Okay. And I don't know if that's something that's also seen in this system or not. So I think that's an encounter angle between microtubules maybe? Yes. Angle dependence. I can't remember. Yeah, here, because we so we do see when we have collisions, I think it's a collision. When we have collisions, I think it's a collision scenario. When we have collisions, because we have kinesin II, they don't catastrophe. But if you get rid of that, you do see some catastrophe. So I think it depends a little bit on the machinery that's there. And we haven't looked at too much at whether there's hotspots for a catastrophe other than those branch point exits, which would be kind of interesting to look at as well. Okay, great. I see Alfred Chang has a question. Hi. Have you considered whether Have you considered whether microtubules bumping into like the cortex at the tip of the dendrite, that physical mechanism might cause a microtubule to shrink? I think that's what's being thought in Pomby at least. And also, when microtubules have to go into a dendrite date, there's this bend. And I wonder if there's mechanical effects there on the dynamics. Yes. So, okay, so the tip, again, that's something that. Again, that's something that our initial round of modeling made us think we should look at more. And you're right, there's the potential for physical interaction and also maybe local depletion of tubulin. And all we know so far is you do have sort of longer pauses often at the tip than elsewhere and increased catastrophe. And we don't, we just haven't looked a ton at that yet. Haven't looked a ton at that yet. In other places, like at the branch point when the microtubules come in, we considered originally that they might hit the plasma membrane, but in fact, they seem to be grabbed almost always because of having motors associated with the tip by other microtubules. So there are a lot of microtubule-microtubule interactions and less microtubule cortex ones, as far as we can tell. And then the angle, yeah, so. We've taken that into account really only when we think about sort of probabilities of going in each direction. And again, we haven't really implemented that into the model. The strain, I mean, the microtubules seem to be able to bend pretty well. You obviously don't see sharp bends, but they can accommodate some interesting geometries. So we have another question in the room. So we have one, we have another question in the room here. Yeah, hi, this is Dave Odi. Really nice talk. I was wondering about microtubule transport generally. You showed the tip being moved by kinesin, a kinesin to steer it appropriately, but just generally do just it looks like the model currently just kind of ignores transport otherwise. It's all the movement of the comets is attributed to polymerization. Yes. The photo conversion may. Yes, the photo conversion made it look like if they're not moving that much, but when you talk about long time scales of days, um, yeah, just be curious how you think about the experimental system. So sliding. So you're, yeah, so microtubule sliding. In mature neurons, sliding does not seem to be a major contributor to moving at least any of the microtubules that we can visualize around. It's possible that small pieces of microtubules can be transported, but the long ones really are locked in place. ones really are locked in place. And in flies, that's due to action of kinesin 6 pavarati that counteracts kinesin 1-mediated sliding. And in mammalian cells, let's see, the motors that counteract that, I think, are kinesin 12 and 5. That's work from Peter Boz's lab. So, yeah, so we tend to ignore sliding, but that's because there is some biological reason to ignore. Because there is some biological reason to ignore it. So that's, yeah. And I don't know if David's question was also about other kinds of cargo transport. I mean, we're interested in sort of combining this kind of modeling with transport of various signaling molecules moving forward too, in case you were getting at that as well. Thanks. Okay.
