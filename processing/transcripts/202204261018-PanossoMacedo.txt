Yeah, hopefully I was still in the presentation. So yeah, just also to pay my homage to Marcus, who should also be around. I mean, many of the tools were put forward by him. So just an outline quickly, I will review black hole perturbation theory and QNMs. I mean things that Colin already said in the previous talk, and then talk about the notion of this spectrum to the spectrum that we are introducing. Some technical interlude. Some technical interlude to talk what we use for our calculations, this Hyperloido approach, and to finally talk about the black hole to the spectrum. So essentially, where we are right now, as Colin was saying, is it the very last phase of the binary black hole merge. So we are relying on black hole perturbation theory, where, as you know, I mean, we just start with some fixed background, here can be whatever. And we are treating the equations doing the Leonardo chain. The equations in the Liang regime. I can go quickly here right now, like the audience. And we all know the importance for this in GR. So, yesterday we had talks on model stabilities and everything. I mean, the linear stabilities, that's how we start everything. I went from the physical side. This is how the very first point to talk about rotational waves and cosmology and everything. So in our case, we're going to focus on black hole perturbation theory. So essentially, the background is a black hole. And And particular spherical symmetric Schwartz, essentially. And we can work out the equations. This is known for quite a while, and eventually, at the end of the day, it's kind of enough to deal with this nice wave equation. So this looks like really a nice wave operator with a potential where xi is the perturbation field. So whatever is propagated in this background, the potential describing, I'm capturing the geometry. Capturing the geometry, which kind of field you are talking about. So, in this example, here we have how the potential looks like for a scalar field, on shore architecture. My focus at this point is more to think about a bit of the coordinates that we are using here. So, essentially, this is already using coordinates freedom that we have in GR by choosing a very particular set of coordinates to describe this basis. Describe the space-time. And in this case, we are dealing with the ordinary textbook Schwartzhood coordinates, where so this T-bar is just Schwartzhu time, I mean dimensionless over the horizon radius. And X is also a textbook quantity, the totalized coordinate normalized to 2N. But my focus here is on the geometrical part: that this T constant slice, when we go to the Penrose diagram, When we go to the Penrose diagram of this black hole, they intersect the black hole at 2m, at the horizon, but at this very particular point here, which is the bifurcation sphere. And as we go to infinity, we are reaching this particular point here, which is space-like infinity, I naught. So essentially, what we have to do is whenever we're going to r equals 2m or x minus infinity, we do need, as I say, we have the right sphere and going to. We have the right sphere, and going to plus infinity, we have space atom. So, at this point, we need to provide boundary conditions to really tell what physical scenario we want to study. So, essentially, when we are at the bifurcation sphere, we want to talk about a black hole scenario and not a white hole thing. And we also, when we want to go to plus infinity, we want to see waves propagating out to the wave zone. We don't want at this moment to study, I see. Want at this moment to study a scattering problem with things coming from minus, from past, so from non-infinity. So we do need to impose boundary conditions to say that, well, whatever reaches this point here really goes into the black hole, and whatever goes to the far zone, to the weight zone, is propagated out into the weight zone, which is quite plus. So whenever we do this, we can solve the equations, we can prescribe some initial data. Can solve the equations, we can prescribe some initial data, and the typical behavior is: first of all, we have these exponentially dumped oscillations, the quasi-most decay. This was observed already in the 70s by Bishopishara. And then there is a later power law decay that was identified shortly afterwards by Price in 72. So, this is a kind of a standard behavior that we see, these kinds of things. And then we get nowadays. And then we get nowadays my very naive and superficial sum-up of my takeaway from calling stock. So we want to do now by calling spectroscopy. So essentially. So essentially, as I said, we are looking at the read now phase of the merger. And this is a very nice and clean noise, sorry, clean signal without noise. Without noise, taking from we can really see almost by naked eyes here this final exponential decay with the oscillations. So essentially this gives us what we called the fundamental mode. We can almost see by naked eye that a very characteristic decay time scale and an oscillatory frequency, which we call the fundamental mode. But as Colin was saying, within the signal, Within the signal, we also expect to see overtones, which decays faster. And then also we want to observe these things, which is a very challenging problem, as we just heard. So here is a signal, for instance, way more noisy, and reviewing the literature, as Colin was saying. Viewing the literature. As Colin was saying, I mean, there are some works talking about detecting the 2,2. He also showed the tables from the LIGO verb regulation with all the basic factors. He was talking about all his studies with the 330 mode. There is his works by Hoberto and Legorio also trying to get there is just systematics and the counter-arguments by Max and Lu. So there is a huge So, there is a huge debate right now in the community, and we are keeping the theoretical part. So, the most naive, I mean that the very naive, the very first approach to solving the equations is to assume the Fourier position, where we just say that, yeah, well, my field has an exponentially time frequency there, and we map this into an OD just. Into an ODE just on the radio direction. And then again, whenever we are at this stage, we have to think about: well, still, x minus infinity is the horizon. At the bifurcation point, x plus infinity is baselike infinity. So we still need to think about including boundary conditions here that we are picking up from the previous discussion. And at this stage, the most common approach for everyone just picking up undergrad kind of knowledge and tools. Knowledge and tools is to look at this equation and say, well, you can compare this to your neural modes. I have here an operator acting on a function, giving us a value times a function. So, well, this is just an eigenvalue problem, as we all know. So, thinking about normal modes, eigenvalue problems, let me just review a little bit what normal operators are to talk about spectral theorems. Talk about spectral theorems. So, quickly definition: that if you have a matrix and you have it's a joint, this will be normal if and only if L and L data commute. And examples here are symmetric, Hermitian, orthogonal. So quantum mechanics is based on Hermitian matrices, right? And there is a very strong theorem in this context that says that if L is normal, if and only if is unitarily diagonalizable. Diagonalizable, sorry. And we talk about matrices, of course, but this theorem can be also extended to more complex scenarios like human space or Banach spaces. But I think the important message here, at least for me, that takeaway is whenever we were talking about Hermitian physics, well, whenever we are dealing with self-adjoint operators, there are two results coming from these theorems that are crucial, that are essential, and that we've been using in the back of our mind. And that we've been using in the back of our minds at every study: that first of all, the eigenvectors are orthogonal and they form a complete basis. And the eigenvalues, they are stable, meaning that if we perturb alter by a tiny little bit epsilon, then the eigenvalues should also change by the same amount of this tiny little epsilon. People on Zoom have lost the other track. Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. No, no, that's fine. It came back. The last slide for a minute, but then that's how it came back. Oh, come back, come back. Okay, okay, okay. So did you lose this? So the conclusion here, just about whenever you are doing Hermitian physics, let me just recap this. I mean, this theorem kind of gives us this structure to know that, well, the eigenvectors of this problem, they are orthogonal, and they do form a computer basis. And we can also be sure, we can. And we can also be sure, we can rest assured that the eigenvalues are going to be stable, meaning that if we just perturb a tiny little bit the potential, the eigenvalues are always going to change by this little amount. And by moving a bit further, what happens if the operator is non-Herminitian? So, whenever we are dealing with non-self-adjoint operators. So, first of all, talking about completeness is something that's way more difficult to study and to assess. Difficult to study and to assess. So, these eigenvectors are not orthogonal. So, this is something that Colin also brought at the beginning of this talk. And it is within the theory that we may face spectral instabilities. So, let us again just review some equations around this theorem. Okay, so here I'm just perturbing the operator by this small epsilon. So, epsilon is. Why this is small epsilon, so epsilon is more than one, and we are trying to keep track that this perturbation part here is of size one, so we can control the size y by this small factor epsilon. We can open any quantum mechanic box and follow what's going to be the eigenvalues in this case, and the eigenvalues is going to be bounded by this combination of here. So, of course, it's going to be smaller than epsilon, as expected, but there is this. But there is this kappa number, which is the conditioning number, which is format out right and left eigenvectors. So if we think about quantum mechanical languages, we can think about this as the bra and the get vectors. So essentially the right eigenvector is the eigenvector of the matrix itself, of the get itself, and the left eigenvector is the eigenvector of the adjoint. Okay, I mean, as I was saying, if we have a self-adjoint operator, then A self-adjoint operator, then L and L dagger are essentially the same, they commute. Well, they're the same in the self-adjoint case. Then, right and left are parallel to each other, meaning that in the end of the day, kappa equals to one. So, here it's kind of really seeing that if epsilon is small, then because kappa is one, the change in the eigenvalues is also going to be bounded, so as small as your epsilon. Conclusion here, a small perturbation of the operator is going to give you for sure a small displacement in the eigenvalue. Now, in the non-self-adjoint case where we don't have anymore this behavior, that L equals L either, so we can no longer be sure from the beginning that the right and the left eigenvector are parallel. So, we might come up with cases in which this conditioning number is bigger than one. Is bigger than one. They can even be orthogonal, making this kappa even very, very large. I mean, reaching orthogonality, reaching the energy. So it could be that even if epsilon is small, this feature here is going to spoil the stability part. So and the eigenvalue signal. Okay, okay. So can The camera system is automated. There's no way I can fix that at this moment. I'm not too sure how we could switch that. Yes. Perhaps I can just log into Zoom and share my Can you still hear me? Yeah, now we see. Now we see it. Sorry? Now we see your screen. Yeah, we see my image. Oh, this is annoying. So I don't know where you guys got lost, but I think this was fine. The next one. Okay, so so I as I was saying, I mean in the North African trend case, this right and left angle vector, they they don't are not necessarily orthogonal, and this kappa can be big. Now, and this kappa can be big. So, a small perturbation of the parator might lead to a large displacement in the eigenvalue. So, this is the conclusion, the takeaway from the slides: that small perturbation of the parator may lead to potential large displacements in the eigenvalue. Another tool that we have also for the theory is that just review quickly what we mean by spectra in a very naive way, but still that's the practical way that we do the studies. If I can ask a question on that please, for the standard approach to this, so what is the condition number for the cause of the problem the standard data? The conditioning number for so I'm going to show some results where I have the this number for the personal modes. Roughly hobby hub as the worst case? We are always comparing with the fundamental one. So they grow exponentially. I mean, the conditional number for the first number of tones is already, I mean, I don't know, 10 or 2. 100 magnitude higher than the first one. So I'm going to show you the pods afterwards, just to be sure. The other concept, well, we are looking for the quasar modes or the spectra of this operator, which is essentially these points in the complex plane where is the Complex plane where this notion here is zero. I mean, if you think about matrix, we are calculating here the determinants where this is zero. But of course, I mean, we could pick up some number slightly off this vector, calculate this value here, and we would get a number which is perhaps close to zero, but not exactly zero. You only hit zero when we are at the spectra, but if we are slightly off, then this quantity is not zero. So the spectra So, the epsilon spectra kind of starts capturing this notion of moving apart from the spectra in a way that, well, let's fix a small number epsilon, not zero, but slightly bigger than zero. And let's look at the region in the complex plane where this norm here is smaller than epsilon. So, what happens for the self-adjoint operator is that the region in the complex plane where the norm of this, of the resolvant, this is for the result. Of this of the result of one. Is it this for the result of point essentially or yes? Yeah, this is not. I will go for the for this one. Sorry. Ooh, now there is an infinite loop here on my screen. Is it connected or the laptop? No, now I'm just sharing my screen. So I think you can see my screen right now. Yes. And you can hear me. So I'm seeing the back. You can only see the bottom of the screen. You can see the top of the screen. Yeah, let me just now go full screen. Can we settle through that? Okay, so now I'm putting I I'm back in the lockdown finish. Back in the lockdown feeling? No, you should be the video conference. You should be a video offers. No, because I am in the video conference. Yeah. So. I'm not sure. I'm not sure why. Because the cameras are automated. So yeah. The difficult of going back to the old style. So, okay, as I was saying, let's recap. The telescope is this notion capturing the region in the complex plane where the norm of this quantity, essentially one over the reservoir, let's call this quantity here, is smaller than epsilon. And in the self-adjoint case, we can see that this region coincides with the ball around the eigenvalue. So this means that whenever we try to calculate the eigenvalue of this new perturbed operator, the new perturbed eigenvalue is going to be within this region, it's going to be within this ball, so this is distance epsilon of the previous eigenvalue. So this is again, so this is a result for instance, an example of a salvage operator. It's just a wave equation on a sphere. The result is spatial nothing, so the wave just goes round and round and round and round. Northern round. And we see here the eigenvalues. They are real because the operators of a joint. They are essentially related to the Lagen numbers. The conditioning number is one everywhere, as expected as well. And we see really, if you so in here, we see the circles of the spectrum. If we pick up, so here is the atron that I'm talking about. So if atron, this is a log scale. If eptron is tension, scale if epsilon is 10 to the minus 1 we have a circle here of order 10 to the minus 1 as well and if we were to calculate ligand values of some perturbation these niggas values would be within this ball here and just to imagine this result is a numerical result and getting constructed this whole thing is not so trivial so I mean this is really a kind of a benchmark to be sure that I mean the numerics is working properly as it should for a controlled case. As it should for a controlled case. And it also is a nice example of the whole theory for the self-adjoint operator. Now, the non-self-adjoint operator, what happens is that it's a spectra region. Again, the region, the complex plane where this quantity here is smaller than epsilon, may be way bigger than the circle of radius epsilon around the pier signal. So in the non-sulphatroid case, it can be that, well, it's a spectrum. It can be that, well, the total spectrum of value epsilon extends along the complex plane, meaning that at the end of the day, if we calculate the eigenvalues of the perturbator, it could be really further apart from the original value. So we cannot guarantee a priori the stability issues in this case. So my takeaway message here, first of all, the unperturbed operator already has all information that we need to assess. Information that we need to assess if we are might find potential spectral stabilities. And the tools to measure them is this conditioning number and the total spectrum. Just a side note here that, as I was saying, there is a norm concept here. So the tele spectrum and all the stabilities is a norm-dependent quantity. So we need to provide a measurement of how far and how near, how small and how big things are. What we are using What we are using to construct this norm is the notion of energy to the system. So, think about this color fields energy. So, we have the image momentum tensor, we can have the energy. I think in terms of mathematical terms, I don't feel comfortable to talk about a lot of the analysis limbo, but I think it's a Solov norm, it's a norm that involves the field itself, first derivatives in time, first derivatives in space. But this provides a physical. But this is this provides a physical relevant measure to calculate what is big, what is small. I mean, small here means it's most energy, small perturbations, small energy that we are putting to the system. But Edgar, I think, is going to probably talk a bit more about this tomorrow. And yeah, I mean, here is a review from twenty twenty that reviews many of these aspects and and many fields in physics where we have to deal with non remittent physics. Have to deal with non-hermitted physics, where we have to deal with non-self-adjoint operators. So, if you can see here, there are all areas in physics, I mean, from quantum measurements, nuclear reactions, mechanics. So, there are examples of classical and quantum systems. Here are the examples of what causes these non-soft attractions. I mean, the non-soft attractness comes whenever there is some flow of energy, particle information, something that goes out of the root space, and they And the equations, the theoretical methods that give rise to this part of the theory. So you can be dealing with Maxwell equations, Newton equations, so classical systems, Fokker-Point equations, we are now quantum well, quantum trajectories, so I mean, it is everywhere, but gravity is not here. I mean, they didn't cite gravity in this table. But essentially, a black hole theory, black hole perturbation theory, is also within this context. Also, within this context, we have fields, we have energy that leaks away from the system, we have energy going to the wave zone, going to infinity, we have energy falling into the black hole. So we expect it to be in the same kind of setup. And the way we are going to introduce this notion of the energy leaking away is by treating the notion of the wave zone, the far distance wave zone, and the black hole horizon a bit more geometrically. Whole horizon a bit more geometrically in terms of the coordinates, and this means by employing hyperboloidal coordinates. So, the idea is to use a new set of coordinate system that instead of the usual traditional standard chuartu time that I was saying goes to bipolar sphere and go to INOT, we are going to use a time coordinate that penetrates the black ball horizon that goes up to sky plus. To square plus, but this is still a space-like surface. And this idea here is because this becomes precisely, geometrically, the region where we want to study the phenomena. And so, employing this freedom, it was back there already in the literature since Brent Schmidt, as far as I know, in the 90s. In the past decades, Anil pushed this a lot. So, for instance, he quoted this framework. This framework resolves many problems regarding the representation of the Poisson modes eigenfunctions. So essentially, this sentence says that the Q and M eigenfunctions, they grow up at the bifurcation sphere, they grow up at I0, but they are finite, they are regular at the horizon, and that's Y plus. So there's a bunch of works that I did with Marcus over the last years as well. And eventually, Pose El Ris also joined us, and he has this. And he has this amazing insight that, well, this compactified approach also allows us to cast the black hole perturbation theory in terms of this spectral problem, and then we can import all tools from the theory of non-self-added predators. So, what happens is the following. As I mentioned, the equation looks rather simple in the standard coordinates. It's just looks like a flat Looks like a flat operator with a potential. What we are doing is we are going to change the coordinates t by an ultimate tau by a function height, so a function h, which we call the height function, which essentially bends the time slice such as asymptotically it goes to the regions that we want. I mean, it asymptotics goes along the light cone. And we are also going to commodify the radio direction. To concise the radial direction, so this g function is going to bring the infinities to a finite point. So, this way, of course, that is how to pick up the best or the most useful height function. But essentially, when we do this, the equation can be recasted into this form. So we still have the second derivative in time, in tau here. And now there is just differential operators acting on the function itself. Acting on the factor itself, an operator acting on the first time derivative of the field. So it's not as simple as this one, but we still can have this in a kind of a compact form. And especially if we make now a further reduction in time, so if we recollect the state vector, the field itself and the first derivative, we can really write down this as just the generator of the time evolution. Delta T e to this mu is equal to the T each of this u is equal to the operator acting on u. So L has a structure of 0, 1 with this L1, L1, L2 operators here. And L1 has a very nice form. It has this form here. It's a well-known form. It's essentially solved. So to begin with, there is this red part, which is what we had previously as a potential. So it's just a rescaling of this potential within a perboloidal context. Context and we also have this function p here, which vanishes by construction of this the whole scheme at the boundaries. So L1 has the form of a storm review operator, actually a singular external review operator. And L2 has also some form that I mean don't have to keep in mind. So the message of L two is that L two is the part in this setup that is encoding the energy dissipation at the boundaries. Energy dissipation at the boundaries. So it's not as visually simple as the previous equation, but has a nice structure, I think, as well, in terms of a structure of the operator plus something that has its patient part. Yeah, now we can just proceed with our eigenvalue problem. We can just go on and perform a Fourier or a Laplace transform and eventually end up with a problem which will have the matrix, well, the operator acting on the function equals the function equals the value of the function and it turns from just that I have a column here. So what's happening here at this level is that previously what we were talking about ingoing and outgoing boundary conditions were coming as an external condition. So we were imposing external conditions to make sure that our scenario had a black hole and had the wave zone. Now we have a broad slices, we are not taking this geometric into account. Count and when we look at the differential equations, this physical scenario again emphasizes that we want to look at the black hole, in the red zone, is going to be described by the equations, regular solutions. So we want to look at these equations, we have these ODEs, these PDs, and the physical scenario is given by the regular solutions to these equations. So here's the example for Shuar2. Let's go for Shuar2. Let's go for Shuar2. And already expressing all these things, these loose coordinates, what I want you to look is, so sorry previously, as I said, the red part here is just the potential, as we have for those who are converted, so this is the rejubular potential. L is the angular number for the harmonic decomposition. S is the speed of the fusion. S is the speed of the field propagating. And in blue is this p-function that I said that's going to vanish at the boundaries, that's going to give this singular factor to the equation. So sigma here runs from 0 to 1. And 0 is crime. So 0 is for general infinity. So you see that vanishes at 0. And 1 is the horizon. So if you get to the horizon as well, as I mentioned before, L2 is not 0. I mean, it doesn't matter what it looks like. I mean, it doesn't matter what it looks like, it's non-zero, so there is distribution. And this is the result for the conditioning number, as Pari was asking, and material spectra. First of all, the conditioning number of the overtones with respect to the fundamental one, you see how I mean, this is the log scale, it gets massively bigger than the fundamental one. I think so. Nobody has ever been able to calculate this stuff in the other formulations. Why is that? Because of the boundary condition, I think. I think it's possible. So what we are dealing, so we have the operators in the continuous form, and we are discretizing together the numerical results. In our case, the whole matrix, the whole formalism, it already contains all It already contains all the information. So, because of this function here, it vanishes at the boundaries. The equation provides us the regularity conditions by construction. We want to get the regularity solutions to this equation. In the other schemes, you have to cut at a large distance, and at this distance, provide the other conditions. And when you go to the numerics, to try to do this, I know that people were trying to do this previously. Tried to do this previously and they failed on the numerical part. So I think it's possible to play around it with the numerics and get results in other approaches. But this has already been done. This is out defining what is meant to look. So it cannot be a conceptual thing. When you do this not that much interesting in the eigenfunctions. So here you need the eigenfunctions of the eigenfunction of that joint. So first step was a very hyper choice. So it's not a tangible, but in this hyperbolic scheme, people are really working in a van space from scratch. Here, again, violence, the functions are normalized in a vanax space. In the standard Cauchy approach, we don't enough. And that Cauchy approach we don't enhance. So since we cannot normalize those certain functions, that's what you can do. There are other ways of normalizing if you make a region. But this is the the picture that will come in mind, not the yeah, like it was almost explodes on the mark. So here they don't explode, they normalize. You can apply the theory. You can apply the singularity on a healer space. We need to be working on a hydro space. It's an approach that didn't think of completing the initial enough. Yeah, and also the two spectral lines, we don't see any these nice tiny circles around the eigenvalue, so they are they open up in this shape here over the complex plane. The complex plane. So takeaway message here, partial conclusions is that by looking at the conditioning numbers, by looking at the extra spectrum, it's already indicate some potential instabilities if we were to perturb the operator. We would like to try to assess these instabilities and another way to do this we are we will try to do this as close as as possible to a physical scenario. Possible to a physical scenario. So we are just going to modify the piece in this operator that contains the potential of the system. And it's an ad hoc modification. We are just adding by hand something there. So there is no a priori previous model for anything. We are just going to change the potential to see if we can access the instabilities. So, as I said, we are going to change the potential bit of the paradigm, which is this red part here, by adding some small perturbation. By adding some small perturbation to it. And we choose to work with a perturbation that oscillates this direction, so that is cosine 2π sigma profile. And the idea is that, well, we don't have a full theory, a full astrophysical description for what should be there, but at least this could capture the Fourier analysis of a potential video scenario by this. Scenario by this wave number here, by the oscillations within the perturbation. So, yeah, let me just zoom into the results. So, here's what we see when we go about and we actually calculate the values of the perturbed operator. So, first of all, the red dots are the values for Schwartzhut. So, these are the QNMs for the Schwartzhu spacetime. I don't have it here, but these are the L equals 2. But these are the L equals two modes, I mean the quadopole modes for a gravitational perturbation. And the first perturbation that we put is a very tight perturbation. So this here captures the amplitude of the perturbation, so it's 10 to the minus 8. It's a kind of a small perturbation with a rather low wave number, one. And we see that the adding values coming from this perturbed potential Coming from this perturbed potential, they pretty much lie on the top of the unperturbed one. So, I mean, we don't see any. Of course, there is a difference, but they can't see this by the eye here. But as soon as we increase the wave number, even if we keep the amplitude very, very small, these higher wave numbers is triggering already these abilities. So, this is the These abilities. So, these are the blue diamonds, and we see that now how they are opening in a kind of the same shape as this spectral line here. And we can go further, we can try to get even higher wave numbers and we see the diagonal values opening up in a stronger way. But keep in mind that the amplitude of this perturbation is pretty small. So, this is a very tiny perturbation. As I mentioned, this notion of energy norm. Notion of energy norm. This is a very small energy that we will be putting into the system, but with a high frequency, with a high wave number character. And this is changing a lot the eigenvalue structure, the neural nodes. And we could achieve this as well by keeping a lower wave number but increasing the amplitude. So this up and down blue triangles, they are all along this line here. And no matter how hard we try to push, you see that I mean here in the bottom. To push, you see that I mean, here in the bottom line, it's a bit hard to see, but we have all of them on the top of each other. We have the red dots, we have the blue squares, we have the blue diamonds, and everything. So, this is the fundamental mode, and they are still there, so they didn't change a lot. I mean, the overtones are very sensitive, but the fundamental mode is there, it's not changing. So, again, partial conclusion here. So, we are seeing that the fundamental mode is stable. Mode is stable. It's important to note that our perturbations are respecting the asymptotic decay. So they are respecting whatever happens really far away from the source. So this stability, we see this as an ultraviolet effect. The overtones are stable under low wave nano perturbation. But the overtones, they are unstable if we go to higher wave nano perturbations. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We can reach the n equals one with a rather moderate setup. But it's true that I mean the one is slightly more stable than the second, which is. More stable than the second, which is slightly more stable than the third. I mean, but this is a very college results and the ending for you might be stable, and I still get that. Yeah, so one thing that when I was listening to Colin say, I was with respect to these results now, this shift in the first overtone, the value. The values are different from care. I have read the sentence. The values might be different from care for whichever reason. My question is, are they different from GR? I don't know, because this is a full classical GR result. So if what Collins is seeing, first of all, the numerics, everything, I mean the systematics is completely under control. Let's take this as a detection. Let's take this as a real detection observation. A real detection observation is the conclusion that is this value is this are we breaking GR or are we just breaking care because of surrounding things? So let's say yeah so let's say if we take the result of the can equal to what the the local analysis right was shifting from the maximum can I take that shift interpret that in this way? Is it possible or? Is that possible or? I think so. I mean, this is a. I mean, I can't be sure what's the source of this shift. I mean, if it's, is it the stars around the black hole somehow? Is it dust there? Or what's causing this shift? Could be. Is it GR which is changing? Or is it some environmental setup around the black hole? Sorry? A high-frequency phenomenon, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. To disentangle this, I mean, but yeah, but it could be just a GR result, a classical GR result coming from a high frequency perturbation of the potential. This could be. So yeah, let me just now, since we are running out of time, I think, I'd like to do a quick historical review on that, because these results were in the literature. Because these results were in the literature since the 90s. Of course, without the framework that we are reading about right now, but we can go to a paper from Novart, for instance, 1996, that well, for whatever reasons he was studying, so he had his own agenda in mind back then. But what he was doing is he was discretizing the potential by these step functions here. And naively, the idea was: okay, I mean, this. Was okay. I mean, this is a rough approximation, but if I increase and increase and increase the number of steps, I'm going to get a better and better and better approximation of the potential. And eventually, naively should expect that the spectrum would go back and converge to the continuum value. And this is not what he saw. I mean, he saw already that, well, there are these values here in red, which are the unperturbed, the Schwartzhut value. Unperturbed the Schwarzschild values. And then he saw that: well, no matter which scheme he chose for the disputation, no matter how many number of points he chose to complete the potential, the Q and M values were completely off the original values. So they were showing again the same kind of structure that we saw before. And even if we increase the number of ends, this wouldn't converge. Hence, this wouldn't converge to the expected Schwarzschild values. So, this is something that we saw back in 1996. And recently, we also found this quote. I'm not going to tell from whom it is right now, but let me just go over the quote. So, the idea is that, well, they have studied the sensitivity of the questionnaire modes. And the motivation for this is to see, well, the perturbing influence. For instance, another. For instance, another radiant source that might alter the effect of potential. Conclusion: We find that the fundamental mode is in general insensitive to small changes in the potential, whereas the higher overtones, the higher modes, could alter drastically. So it's quite reassuring for us that who said this is Bishop Shara in in his in this uh review. Also for nine five six. Also from 1996, so a bit before or a bit after Nuller published his work. And there is also this work, Athens Lar A, from him with Akira Gulia. So these results were there in the literature. It has, I don't know, just a few citations, this work. So it was hidden there. I mean, even when we were learning about this about two months ago, and he even goes further. And he even goes further and says, the fundamental mode would therefore carry an imprint of the black hole, while higher modes might indicate the nature of the perturbing source. So well, we are now on our own personal journey with PRL. So I mean, kind of trying to convene a bit of this message as well and doing push this idea a bit further. But so these things were there already in the literature. And again, we just brought some new tools, new geometrical perspectives to this. So, just to sum up here, as I showed, whatever North was seeing, so he was seeing these new modes opening up in this way here, I mean, reaching higher imaginary, so real values, which is the same thing that we are seeing here. So, you see that essentially what Lauder was seeing is that What NALA was seeing is that the moles are following the telespectral lines. So they are following this underlying structure, which is the telespectral. And so the telespectra already tells us a bit of how this behavior could be. So that's why we are tending to call these branches Nolar Price branches, because they already saw this back then. So the nuclear names, they show the same tendency as extra-spectral control lines. Spectral control lines. So let me conclude because I think we are a bit on time. We introduced here this new tool to study black or magnetization theory called the Tel Spectrum that we import from the framework of the theory of scattering resonances. And the hyperbola approach was really fundamental to start this. Oh, making the connection with Constable, there could be potential impact on the Impact on the gravitational wave astronomy field and skill for speed. Of course, I mean, finding these instabilities within numerics or within the data is still an open question. I mean, why there is this plot by Will and the data you're showing that mismatch, if you include more and more overtones, the care overtones, you get a better and better mismatch. So it is a result, but the question about systematics, I think it's still. Systematics, I think it's still into this discussion. I would be fair to say that that's a standard NR simulation by the Macodes. Is that in some sense closer to the non-hyperbolic slices? I think we can we can the question. So, the question about extraction the waves from the numerics, right, there are also two approaches. The one that we just cut the simulation at the right radius and then we read side four over there. This would be just kind of the previous also perturbation theory approach. We just go to other radius. But I suspect that also this group, they are also the Kaushikai physician expression. I suspect that they are using this tool of simulating up to a large radius and then turning. Radius and then turning into a fractalistic approach. So they are matching the large radius evolution to no surface where they go to a boundary sax coordinate and they go to scry. So but I think for most cases this tangent goes in the dark Cauchy hydrostatic also looks fine on this point. For the forget the QNMs? I think so yes yes yes yes yes therefore it's not a question of just the Cauchy hydrogen sticker. No no no I no I think I think I think for me, naively from outside, I mean, it's really controlling the systematics of the analysis. So I don't think it's it's it's a problem on on the on the the formulation of the of the of the the full GR for the f of the full numerics uh For the effect of the phonomerics. So, we can keep the discussion, but some further perspectives. Of course, as I said, I mean, there could be an impact in astrophysics cosmology via black holes spectroscopy. Measuring these perturbations also could give us some assets in an agnostic way to some Sunday-Blanket scales, an assessment, some. And I say some sort of theoretical questions. But also, there is also room for some more robust and formal statements because, as I said, I mean, the results are numerical. I mean, there is a kind of a geometrical approach behind it, there is some analysis. But whenever you have to do the nice colorful plots, there is numerics involved. And for some formal statements and theorems would also be very Would also be very fruitful and useful for the future. So, yeah, I think I hope we went smoothly now, the online version, and happy to get the questions. Thank you very much. If people can hear me, so questions for you. So, I think I have a couple of questions. Can I go ahead? Yes, please. Yes, please, my point is. So, um first is that I think the actual person was a very readable team work. The actual plots that you showed us were for a very specific kind of coordination.
