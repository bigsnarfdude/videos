Talk of the workshop. It's an honor to introduce Misha Gettman, who will talk about generalized cluster structures and periodic difference operators. Thank you, Alfred. So thank you for organizing the thing and being so persistent with it and having me here. So this will be about joint work with my usual collaborator, Misha Shapiro and Alex. My usual collaborator, Misha Shapiro and Alec Wenstein, and also ongoing project with Chris Fraser and Trey Tramble. So I want to start by saying that I do remember when I first met Bernard, maybe he doesn't, but this was in 2001 in Cambridge during NATO conference or school on convenience. So cluster algebras already secretly existed, but not in the open. And this was so NATO conference. And this was so NATO conference. So, this was this blissful time when NATO had no other worries than to decide which mathematical conferences to fund. And what I'm going to try to talk about in the end actually is very influenced by explanations that Bernard provided to me generously in Kyoto in 2018, in December when we talked there. So there are some papers. So, there are some papers that already appeared, and this one is in progress. Maybe it will somehow the stock will jolt it to completion. And this is work with Chris and Trey. So, what are the main characters in this story? So, first of all, periodic difference operators. This is a well-known classical object or infinite periodic finite band matrices. For example, try. Matrices, for example, tridiagonal matrices of this kind are called Jacobi matrices, and they are well known in spectral theory, an integrable system, things like periodic toddler's discrete Kadamsov Titliashvide, where he lives there. And so they also appear, maybe not so secretly, in recent work by Greg on quasi-periodic sequences, because this. Quasi-periodic sequences, because this is what, yeah, so maybe he will have some corrections or comments in the end. Um, so uh, another uh, well, player in this story are Poisson varieties with group actions, Poisson League, Poisson homogeneous spaces. So these are varieties whose rings of regular functions often support cluster structures or generalized cluster structures, and this is part of our general philosophy of this mission. Of our general philosophy, philosophy and others, and they also appear in all these subjects: integral system representation theory, quantum groups. And then, finally, generalized cluster algebras, well, no worries here, so I'm not going to go through all these lists if you're everywhere, as is well known by now. So, let me just start with reviewing this philosophy. You heard me speak about this many times, but I will just repeat. So, suppose I Repeat so. So, suppose I don't know about cluster algebra, I just deal with a Poisson variety appearing naturally in, say, Lee theory, and its variety supports usually complicated Poisson structure. And we want to cover it with charts which behave nicely with respect to this Poisson structure. So, what would we want to do? So, it turns out that the simplest thing you can do in situations where you only In situations where you only allow the rational operational transformation, is to find charts which are not derbut charts like in usual Poisson geometry, but kind of simplest possible quadratic charts, sometimes called diagonal quadratic Poisson structure, where the Poisson bracket between any two functions is what we called, unfortunately, log canonical, right? So a Poisson bracket of the two functions is just their product. Functions is just their product and some constants, some integer constant. But we are not content with having just one of those, we want to cover the whole variety with as many charts of this late possible. And we want any of these charts to be connected by Laurent polynomial transformations, which is a very strong requirement, especially if you want it to be Laurent polynomial in both ways. And also we want any regular function to be Laurent polynomial in terms of every of this coordinate chart. So this is what usually is called the cluster. Usually, what is called the cluster structure? Well, here we don't specify cluster, but this is a nice structure on a Poisson variety. So, how this relates to cluster series. So, let me just remind you this as well. So, what do we have? On the Poisson side, you have again variety with usually with toric action, which reflects somehow the structure of frozen variables. Structure of frozen variables. And then so we have this coordinate with the nice Poisson properties, as I discussed, like this Poisson properties. And so on the other side, we have initial seed, as we all know very well, quiver without loops and then two cycles. And so the main combinatorial objects that in this That in this situation records Poisson properties is just a matrix of structure constant of a Poisson structure, and on the other side, it is adjacency matrix of a quiver. So I'll just stick with the skew symmetric case. And to make the whole thing consistent, you need this. Yeah, so sorry, so you need this relation, this simple relation, which A simple relation which ties together the structure constant of a Poisson bracket with adjacency matrix of equivalent, which actually allows you some freedom in choosing Poisson brackets between or say frozen arrows between frozen variables. All right. So this is also the same relations that appeared in early work of Bernstein and Zelawinsky on quantum cluster algebra. Levinsky on quantum cluster algebra. Exactly the same relation was needed there. And so, well, okay, so I think I can easily skip definition of quiver mutation and things like that. But well, since we're talking not about abstract cluster algebra, but cluster structure of Poisson variety, we need some additional restrictions. What we want is the following: what all our functions are. Following what all our functions after all the mutations to remain regular functions, and this usually requires additional conditions, but in all the examples of interest, it works. And then what we would like to have a completeness. So as I mentioned, you want every element in a ring irregular function, which is well, not only, yeah, to be expressible as a Laurent polynomial in terms of any of this coordinate shirts. So, in other words, we want during a regular function to be natural isomorphic to, generally speaking, upper cluster algebra. Sometimes, if we're lucky, it is cluster algebra. We all know that it's not always so. So, let's consider an example. This is a well-known example. We all know it. It's one of many realizations of type A finite cluster algebras, but I will have a generalization of it later. Have a generalization of it later, so I'll go over it. So, one of the ways to represent A n or A n minus one in this case, finite type cluster algebra is using tri-diagonal matrices of Jacobi elements in GLN. In this case, they are also identified with certain Coxster double Brea cell. So, you take a Coxer element, take C C inverse cell, and this is what. Cell, and this is what you will obtain just a set of these finite Jacobi matrices with non-zero determinant. And you can define then very explicitly initial seed corresponding to oriented Dinkin cover. This is just consistently oriented by just picking principal trailing minors of this matrix and using the off-diagonal entries of this. Of diagonal entries of this matrix as frozen variables. So it is regular, the regularity is just another realization of Pluki relations, which, well, or Denanoya Korbi, you name them, all of Tollenby relations, which appear throughout this theory. And it is regular and complete, but moreover, since this is a finite type cluster structure, you then have very nice identification of all cluster variables as also of. Variables as also objects related to this matrix. So, namely, all cluster variables are just dense principal minors appearing that just fit in this matrix. Okay, so this is what happens in the finite case. Now, another example that I want to talk about is Drintville double of GLN. So, but let's start with n equals 2. And this one is to illustrate that sometimes you cannot avoid. Cannot avoid generalized cluster relations. So here we have just a double of GL2 when n is equal to 2. So just pairs of 2 by 2 matrices. The Poisson structure I'm going to suppress for now, but it is a Poisson structure on so-called Drinfill double, which is associated with standard Poisson least structure on GL2 itself. And you can And you can find this coordinate chart that I depicted here, which has this nice Poisson property: the Poisson bracket of any two of this function is the product times a constant. And then you try to do the usual machinations with trying to restore cluster structure from it. You can compute the quiver. And then you find out that one of the variables, the ones that I put in a hexagon instead of a circle. Put in a hexagon instead of a circle doesn't want to mutate according to usual cluster rules. So you can force it, but then you lose regularity. But there is a way to help this if you allow for slightly more complicated cluster transformations. And I presented it here very explicitly. So we have this strange function, which is like a mixed determinant. And if you multiply it by another mixed determinant of a similar Mixed determinant of a similar nature, then you will see that relation becomes a three-term on the other side with frozen appearing as coefficients, the frozen that are already in the picture. And then also there is one more function which serves as a coefficient. It is not in the quiver because it's not connected to anything during, so using usual quiver rule, but it is a casino for our Poisson structure. So you're not. So, you're not going to mutate it anyways. And so, it appears as a coefficient in this longer extended relation. So, this is a typical generalized cluster transformation. Once you introduce that, you can actually see that what the thing becomes is a generalized cluster structure of type B3. So, it's still finite type. Okay, so this is so generalized cluster structure just appears naturally, and again, Just appears naturally. And again, the coefficients of these generalized relations have a Poisson meaning, as in the case of a usual cluster structure. So let me just show how this looks in general. So now if n is arbitrary, so we're again talking about the double of GLN. So we have this quiver. This quiver everything but this one vertex number well that is that is in white mutate normally and then we have a generalized relation of lengths n plus one in this case and coefficients of this relation come again from casimirs of the corresponding Poisson structure on the data. So and here you have some functions which are you know Are you know normal functions that we are used to? So, these are very familiar functions like flag minors appearing in work of Bernstein, Famine-Zelinsky, depending on one of the two ingredients in the double. Here, flag minors complementary of the other element. Inside, we have some mixed determinants, and the functions in gray are very, very strange. So, I don't want to describe them. They're really. They're really strange. And so, what I will talk later maybe will help to explain what they are. But I also want to say that this picture contains several cluster structures which are familiar to all of us. So let me just list them. It contains regular, complete, generalized cluster structure on the double. So this is the whole thing. But you can actually find within this picture. Find within this picture well familiar to all of us standard cluster structure on GLN. Just imagine that you just cut away this rhombus in the middle and glue the wings together. And this will be, well, picture that is familiar to us all. This is, well, not anybody's, but my favorite quiver for the structure on GLN or end-to-end, if you wish. So it also contains So it also contains regular complete generalized structure on the dual Poisson group or the image of the dual Poisson group in GLN. So this, yeah, I will show this picture for that. And also similar structure on the conjugacy classes in GLN intersected with B plus, B minus Buracelles, intersects, well, structure on B plus W0 with respect to dual Poisson brackets. So a lot of Dual Poisson brackets. So, a lot of things are combined in this single picture. And we here have just one generalized variable, right? That mutates in generalized way. Okay, so yeah, so this is for illustration. This would be the structure on the dual group, the query for the structure on the dual group, where variables will be functions of, so this is a map that sends a double into the dual group. Double into the dual group with respect to standard Poisson discharge. All right. So the dashed arrows are there just to make it easier to see. So yeah, they're real arrows. Yeah. Yeah, this is just, otherwise the picture becomes too easy. So they don't have any mathematical meaning there. Just focus matters. Just for cosmetic purposes here. All right. So to understand all of the structures, one should understand how exactly this special vertices mutate. And so as I mentioned, as we all know very well, usual mutations in all geometric examples, they are based on determinantal identities one way or another, on the generalization. So the reason. So there is an identity which, well, for several years we were asking people if they know it, but they don't, this matrix identity also, which seems to be a prototypical identity for generalized relations in this. And so let me just list it here. So this is just metric series, nothing to do with the previous, but it works in all the examples. So what you do, So, what you do, you take any, say, complex matrix and then you build so-called circulant matrix, I think it's called. I just, well, you take a vector and then consider powers of matrix acting on this vector. And then two matrices of a similar nature, right? So, the whole thing depends on just one n-by-n matrix and two vectors. And then you will build this very strange relation. So it looks like a characteristic polynomial of A, except that you multiply the matrix itself by certain determinant and identity by certain determinant. And usually you don't expect the thing to factor because, well, we don't know how to solve equations of high degrees, but it does. And so you have this identity with some sign. This identity with some sign, you have determinant of the circulant matrix and some other thing which is polynomial in A, U, and V. And that's important because what we want is regularity. So in all examples that I'm going to present, this is the key identity that is hidden beyond generalized cluster relation. And so I want you, well, I don't want to be very forceful about it, but I think that it plays the same role as a Spluker type relations. Role as a spluker type relations play in the usual cluster algebra. So let me just, because there will be other talks about generalized cluster structures, so I'm going to perform some public service and go over the definition, one of the definitions of generalized cluster structure. So it will be different from Chechov Shapira because in Chechov Shapira coefficients of generalized relations are all a constant or something. Are all constants, are some numbers. And here we want them to be functions as well. So, how do we define generalized cluster structure here? So, we have each degree of our H-non-frosten vertex in our quiver now has a multiplicity and a string of coefficients of it. And these coefficients can be numbers, can be something external, or they can be, say, Laurent monomials in frozen variables. In frozen variable. And so you have this generalized exchange relation, then, which, well, it looks a little busy, but in fact, you will recognize main ingredients of the usual exchange relations because, well, we have products of variables over all arrows pointing from the fixed one, product of non-frozen variables that appear in a similar way. In a similar way, the strange part comes with what do you do with frozen variables attached to this variable k? And unfortunately, you have to put them in some powers which, well, normally because we have to divide by degree, degree greater than one, well, you would get fractional powers. You don't want to get fractional powers, and this is where this floor functions appear. And I must emphasize that this is. I must emphasize that this is one of the possible definitions. There are some variations, but this works in all the examples that I am going to present. Okay, so this is a generalized mutation. It can be written as in terms of y variables, and it will be just a polynomial of a non-frozen part of the y variable times some monomal. And coefficients mutate in a very well simple way, just switch the order of coefficients. Just switch the order of coefficients and then modified quiver mutation. So it's familiar quiver mutation, but what happens is if you have degree of this vertex greater than one, then you will add the corresponding number of arrows. Okay. And you do it if well, if this the usual two paths connects two non-frozen variables or or or at least one of them is is non-frozen. Least one of them is non-fraud. Okay? So that's how quiver mutation works. And then you retain all the nice properties of cluster algebras, Laurent phenomenon, and so forth. And this was explored in works by Chekhov Shapira, Rupil Nikanishi, Nikanishi in our work. Okay, so yes. No, so here, if, yes, thank you for pointing that out. For pointing that out. So, if one of these vertices is frozen, then it is DJ. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Okay. So you have this complicated definition. So you need examples. And the source of examples comes again from objects in metric theory. And I'm going to consider kind of a reduced, well, more simpler situation, but I will comment later on more general one. So here's this example. This example, so-called periodic staircase matrices. So, what it is, is just bi-diagonal block toplets matrix with, say, n by n blocks. So, it's infinite in both directions. And we say it has k inner diagonals. So, with double infinite matrices, you don't really know what diagonal is if, well, the main diagonal is unless somebody tells you. But so what is an inner diagonal? So, what is an inner diagonal is a diagonal such that if you view this as a main diagonal of a matrix, then the matrix is irreducible. Okay, so for example, for tri-diagonal matrix, there is one inner diagonals, and two are not. So that's how we define it. So, in this particular example, there are two inner diagonals. And what we want to do, usually, when if you think about it in a simplistic way, when you look for natural cluster. For natural cluster candidates for cluster coordinates, right? You find some convenient point in your matrix and consider minors growing out of there. But this is double infinite, so there is no convenient point to start with. And so we're going to remedy it in a very naive way. So we have, you know, this matrix is built of this repeating block rows. So I'm going to remove the first row from each block row. Draw from each block row and then the matrix kind of gets squished, right? So I illustrated it on this example. So you have this one, two, three, four diagonal band matrix. You remove the first row from each block, it becomes square.
