Okay, perfect today. So, our next speaker is Professor Zhang Zheng Lei from Captain Normal University. The title of his talk is on the estimate of complex Mongolian equation on Manifold. Okay, let's begin. Okay, thank Professor Xi for the introduction. The introduction and thank the organizers for the invitation so that I can have the opportunity to plant recent work. Actually, I learned a lot of conformal geometry here. So sanction organizer again. So here my topic is about a complex one-year equation. And so let's start. Okay. Okay, so I will focus. First of all, I will focus on my talk on global estimates. So I will not concern a lot about the local theory like magnetic equation on a domain in the Euclidean space and so on. So here, let's start with some basic headman posts. Kevin manifolds. So let M to be a compact kind of manifold of dimension N and G zero to be a color metric. And then we let omega zero to be the color form. So in local coordinate, omega zero equals square root minus one gij bar dz i what dz j bar. So here d i j bar is So here d i j bar is the action of g0 on Ï€ z i and pi pi z j bar. So gi j bar can be seen as a Hermitian matrix. Then you can define a space of various sub harmonic functions associated to the Kai La metric G0. So it's defined to be upper semi-continuous functions so that on So that omega plus pi pi bar phi is not negative in a sense of currents. So then you consider the following Manyami equation. So it is raised as follows. So in formula two. So here on right hand side, capital F is a non-negative function. So we always assume it belongs to Assume it belongs to L1 space, so that the right-hand side is integrable. So you can also admit, you can also add a normalization so that the average integral of the right hand equals one. So this is a normalization so that the equation is solvable. Okay. Okay, so in general, the solution fly is not smooth, but so we first of all we have Yaus seminal theorem. So if assume if the function f is positive and ck so here k is bigger than or equal to 3, then you have c k plus 1. Have a CK plus one alpha solution, phi, so that the omega zero plus pi pi power phi defines a columnetry. So well, so the complex boundary equation relates close to the prescribed rich curvature problem, which you know as the Clavi conjecture. So, well, so just recall that due to Chengvi theory, a rich culture. V theory, a rich culture of any colour metric belongs to a person class. Then, if you choose any representation bait, say bet, and you want to solve the equation, so the formula for here. So, it's an equation of the chiral metric, so that it's associated with Richie because. Is associated with equals bet. You can restrict the color metric in the fixed colour class, Omgelero. So then because eight and reach of Omgelero belong to the same cohomology class, so they are difference. They differ by pi pi bar or something. So here I write I write it. Here, I write it as u, which is a smooth real valued function. Then the solution omega can be written as omega zero plus pi by bar phi for some plaris of harmonic function phi. So the function phi, if omega satisfies so the red trace So, the rich prescribes which equation, then the function satisfies the complex Manual equation. Okay, so this is a problem related to the Banyam equation. Okay, so there is an important consequence of your theorem. So, it's known as So it's known as a Clavier theorem. If the Fletcher class vanishes, then you can find any in any class, a unique which flat metric. So the flat metric is called Clavier metric. So Yao's proof applied the continuity method. So you consider the family of equations. So where? Where on the right hand side, the function is given by a family of functions e to the minus tu. So t belong to the integral from 0 to 1. If t equals 0, then you have a trivial solution. Then you want to apply a continuity method to solve this equation for NT. So then you should. So then you should use openness. You want the openness of the solution and the closeness of the solutions. So the closest step to this problem is to show the closeness where you need a product L infinity estimate here. Well, so. Well, so we move to the air infinity estimate. So, another important approach is clauses is due to clauses. Well, here we consider a more general equation where capital F is just defines a measure. So, here I just quote the theorem of Clausi. For convenience, I assume here capital F belongs to F L P, where P is strictly bigger than one. Then the formulation will be easier. So if you consider this complex Monday equation, then you can have Can have a unique solution file if you add the normalization so that the superman equals zero, then you have the air infinity estimate. So the air infinity estimate can be bounded by the constant dependent on some geometry, so like omega zero and the L p norm of the function f. Of the function f and furthermore, you can see you can see something more. For example, you can have a holder estimate. For example, you have a constant R so that the C R norm is bounded by a constant also depending on N P only and L P norm of F. LQ norm of F. But okay, so Clausi's estimate depends on the capacity calculation in Clausi potential series. And here, the holder index alpha in the holder estimate, so it is computable in closes estimate. So the holder estimate relies on the previous estimate, a previous theorem of closing. So it's called a stability theorem. So here I assume F1 and F2 are two LP functions so that their LP norm is bounded by A, capital A. is bounded by a capital A and then let phi i be two solutions to this complex Monday equation and assume that supermark of phi i equals zero then and for a precise constant gamma which equals one over n plus three then you have the following estimate so phi one minus Phi one minus phi two the area printing now is less than the right hand side. So well so just you I just mentioned that on the right hand side you just need the L1 norm of F1 minus F2. Okay, so you do not need the Lp norm. Need the LP now. It's a very precise estimate here. So later on, then Daniv and Zhanzo considered this stability problem, and they showed that in order to get a stability theorem. A stability theorem, the background metric omega can be relaxed to be a big and the same positive closed form. And this index gamma can be chosen as any positive constant strictly less than one over n. And then Gaia and Zraki show that the stability still, the main score in B class. Called in B class. So here in B class, the B class means that it is a class which has a regulation of positive volume, but may not be same positive. Okay, so later, Guy and Clausi and Ziraki noticed that the holy index in the shoulder. index in the in the shelter estimate uh so can be taken as any positive constant strictly less than two over nq plus one and they also uh construct the kind of examples to show that the index can never be bigger than two over nq so the constant in the holding index in their estimate is almost sharp uh and And finally, Demai, Danif, Gai, Fa and Clausi, no, I'm sorry, this name should be fee, I think. It's not Han. The Clausi anthropology shows that the hold SME holds in a uniform way with the same hold index, with the same holding dex. Well, then Clausius approach to the L infinity estimate is actually more flexible and it can be extended to more general settings. So there are lots of work in this to this approach. And I cannot give you a full list. So I just mentioned some typical examples. I just mentioned some typical examples. So one example is due to Zhang, Danish Zhang. So they consider the case where the background is it and it's a smooth, non-act big closed form. Then the associated complex model equation has affinity estimate. A infinity estimate and continuous solution phi and it also set five stability. The second example is due to Boxon SE2 and Gai israki and Zen Gai israki. So they consider the big case. So the form it, background form it is smooth, big, but may not. But may not be non-negative. So the solution also admits a uniform air infinity estimate. So up to a utmost function, it means that through the function, the solution phi minus v it here has a uniform estimate. The v eat is defined to be the extreme function. So it's taken as Um, so it's taken as a supremum of psi or n in the plus sub harmonic functions, and well, finally, Gaia and his ratio also showed the stability property of this equation. Well, besides this estimate, we also can see some uniform properties of the complex monitor micro gene. Of the complex monitoring regime. So, following clauses approach. For example, here are several examples. Well, you see the Guyanese and Clausian Tian, consider the following case. So, if you have a holomorphic submerging from a compact telemetry fold X onto another compact telemetry fold Y. And if you have two kind of forms, only x and omega y, x and y, and then you define a family of backgrounds, omega t, which equals pi star omega y plus t omega x. So t is a positive constant. So, well, the interesting case is that the constant t The constant t approaches the zero. Okay, so when t approaches zero, the background omega t tends to the degenerate background pi omega y. So then you consider the equation omega t as omega t as the background where on the right side, on the right hand side. On the right hand side, so the volume is also normalized. So it's equals t to the n minus n f t omega x n to the n. Well, so under this normalization, so the f t, you always assume the ft has a uniform L T bond here. Then you can Then you can have the following uniform error point estimate to resolution y t. So another estimate is due to Fu, Wu and Song. Fu is Fu Xin, Gu is Gu Bin and Song Jin. So they consider the big case and here the background omega t equals 8 plus T omega 0. T omega zero, where omega zero is a kind of metric on the manifold, and it is a smooth, close, and nav, and off numerical dimension M where M is strictly less than M. So then you consider the following equation. So it has almost the same formula as above. up then the solution has the solution to this equation has a uniform infinite bound so up to the extremal function v omega t so here v omega t always vanishes if the if the background omega t is positive okay so here the the the background omega t may not be positive when t approaches When t approaches zero. Okay, so if t approaches zero, there will be an additional term v omega t here. Okay, then dynamics and you guys like it should a uniform holder estimate. So in theory, So, in their theorem, a bounded geometry condition is required for the manifold. So, here the background omega S has bounded geometry in the sense that they have a bounded curvature and bounded diameter and bounded volume from below. Then you consider the family of compact marginal equations. So, here you always So here you always you also need the LP uniform bound of Fs and then you can have a uniform CR bound of phi s well so now so that's let me state a theorem about the uniform infinity estimate You can estimate on the uniform stability. I'm sorry, my computer looks it looks out of power just a minute. I'm sorry. Yes, I mean, I'm sorry. Okay. So here I I as the I add the domination to the background metric. So the domination means that it's another color metric, omega hat. So it dominates the background omega zero in the sense that, so in the sense of forms, omega zero is bounded by omega hat and in the sense of measures. Uh, mirrors so that the second condition is a condition of mirrors on the background only zero and the domination only hat. So I assume this domination condition, then you consider the complex Manyman equation with background omega zero. So you also assume the function on right-hand side. With a function on the right-hand side, so the capital F belongs to Lp, then you have a uniform estimate of the solution phi. So the L infinity norm depends on the domination omega hat, but not on the background omega zero. So it's the main point in this estimate. And it also depends on the average integration of LP. integration of of LP of LP integration of the function f but may but it's it's not the uh the yo-yo LP norm it's the average LP norm so the first estimate so appeared firstly in the lecture nodes of Feng Storm and Sundian and besides this we also have a stability Ethereum so you suppose you have Uh so you suppose you have two functions f i i equals one and two so whose LP norm every L P n is bounded by A then the associated solutions phi I satisfy the stability condition so the difference has an infringement norm bounded by a constant times the average The average L1 norm of F1 minus F2 up to some power. Okay, so the constant also depends on the domination omega hat, but not on the background omega. Okay, the second theorem is about a uniform CR estimate. So here, in addition to the domain. In addition to the domination condition, I also need a requirement about, I also require a condition about the plastic encoder, but so assume the plastic coaching is bounded from below, then the solution to the complex mind of magnetic has a uniform hold estimate. So the holder estimate, but the holder norm is bound by a constant depending on the low bound of bison culture. Low bound of bicep culture, the domination omega, and the average F norm of POF. Okay, so here are two examples of dominations. So the first one is that the background equals H plus T only hat. So here it only hat is a smooth color metric and H is taken to be a smooth and non-negative one form. Such that you have. Such that it has a positive volume. So, as T tends to zero, it becomes so omega zero tends to smooth, negative, and big form. So, the second case is you consider a submarine from X to Y, and it is taken as the pullback of the catalog on the Y. So why? Well, so in either case, only they're redominated by only hat. In the shelter estimate, so the bisection culture log bond is restrictive. For example, if you take the product now, y cross. Now, Y cross Z, where Z has an amicable basic concern, then you shrink the fiber Z and you have a female background with a uniform robot on bicep culture, then you can apply the shelter estimate. So, this is the only case I can find to apply the shoulder estimate. Applies a shadow estimate. Well, I think I have no time maybe. So the proof, one word about proof. So in the proof of the stability theorem, we can do nothing beyond the clauses. Beyond the clauses. So, as for the short estimate, one K step is to prove the following approximation property. So, here I take the proposition by H equation. So, in classical works of Clause and Demay, they take another kind of approximations to the price of harmonic functions. So, here I take the approximation by height equations, and then you can find some basic properties of the functions phi t. Okay, a final remark. So, in the case of background, which equals it, there it plus t on your head with Plus T only hat with it same positive B and close. So this stability covers the theorem of Danif and Zhanzhou. While in other case, where it coming from a submachine, so the free estimate covers the theorem of steel guy and Irani. Okay, thank you. This is my talk. Thank you. Okay, because let me. Thank you. Okay, because limit of time, you're not asked questions.
