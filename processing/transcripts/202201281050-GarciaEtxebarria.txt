It's a wonderful workshop. I've been really fun. So I suggest that since I'm the last speaker, we could all thank them. Thank you very much. All right. So yeah, I want to talk about symmetry theories from string theory. And this is based on some papers I wrote with Ben and Dego, and then with Fede, Nichele, and my student Sagar. And then more recently, a paper with Fabio. And then, more recently, a paper with Fabio, Federico, Zagara, and Sakura. And I will mostly focus on this last one that introduces the notion of asymmetry theory. You'll have to define it. All right, so one of the first things we saw this week in Miguel's Meister View is that there are no global symmetries in quantum gravity, or at least that's the expectation. And this is an interesting statement, to me at least, because To me, at least, because for different reasons, perhaps that recently we have learned a lot about what asymmetry means. So, I think these new developments, if you put them together with this statement, they lead to some new things that you can say. So I'll try to review part of it. And I will focus on the bits that interact with string theory and geometry. Of course, you can talk of symmetry much more generally, but I'll try to stay within the area I noticed. Within the area I noticed. So you might think that this is a sort of a silly topic for a talk because I am not going to say otherwise. There's no global symmetries in quantum gravity, as it's really true. But still, there's a lot of things that you can learn by using string theory to study symmetries. And then at the end, I will say something more speculative about what you can say about the string theory itself, not just about. Not just about not using strain theory as a tool to learn about free theory, but these ideas I'll simmer tell you about the stream theory. And I should say, please interrupt me at any moment. I have the chat open, but if you speak up, maybe share for me. Okay, and mostly in this talk, when I say discrete symmetry, I really have in mind, sorry, when I say symmetry, I really have in mind discrete symmetry and high enough dimensions. And mostly because discrete symmetries make everything. Because these cursymetries make everything much clearer. One of the things I will try to do is to gauge things. It's important to see what happens when you start gauging symmetries. Gauging a discrete symmetry is fairly harmless. Locally, you don't see much. But if you start gauging continuous symmetries, then of course you change things quite a bit. It may be that what I'm doing with these Q symmetries, if you understand it well enough, is enough to understand. Understand it well enough is enough to understand continuous symmetries. I'm not very sold on this, but some people tell me this might be the case. In any case, I think it's interesting to study discrete symmetries by themselves. And this is because often they can do more things than continuous symmetries can't. As an example, if you are interested in studying higher form symmetries, like two-form symmetries in 5D or 6D, let's say you have a superconformative theory, in this paper by Cordova metric interlegator, they show. By Cordova, metric score interlegator, they show that there's no such thing if you're talking about continuous two-form symmetries. But there are many examples by now of superconformal field theories in five and six dimensions with discrete two-form symmetries. So you can find more structures. So they're more interesting. So let me start by sort of reviewing what we all know: what is a symmetry classically. So the traditional definition is that in the classical theory, Definition is that in the classical theory, you have a group of transformations that act on the fields of the Lagrangian and they leave the action invariant, maybe up to some boundary terms. In the quantum theory, you ask for a little bit more, you ask that additionally measures invariance, we call these anomalies, but you don't have anomalies in the theory. This picture is true as far as it goes, but there's interesting situations in which you might want to consider a more general notion of asymmetry. Of a symmetry. For example, in the paper with Miel, we studied something that other people have also studied that sometimes you find anomalies in your models that only become visible when you go to non-trivial spacetime topologies. And this is not something that you can detect with the usual methods. You have to use the Bordersome ideas that Ralph was mentioning before. And also, as we saw in Magderna's. And also, as we saw in Magerna's talk, symmetries don't need to act on fields, they might act on extended operators. So, this gives rise to a real higher control. And they may not even form a group. For instance, you can have symmetry generators, which do not have any burdens. And you may have very complicated structures. Remember from McDernas talk that these days we think of symmetries as topological extended operators. If you put two of those, If you put two of those together, there's no reason why the effective operator you're constructing can be expressed as a single extended operator. It could be a sum, whose coefficients could have rather involved the structure. So you can do many, many things. We are starting to have many examples which are rather exotic. And one thing that attracts me to this game is that the starting point of this whole discussion, transform of the fields in the Lagrangian, is very often not available. It seems to be that in string theory, most It seems to be that in string theory, most of the things that we don't have to do, in some way of counting measures, we don't know how to construct the Lagrangian for them. We have a geometric definition of some CFTs, and very often we don't have a Lagrangian that flows to the CFT. So of course, this is a bit of a problem. Symmetries are one of the fundamental things in physics, and somehow very often we don't even know where to start computing. So, this is a reason why, well, these are some reasons why people have started extending the idea of symmetry. You would like to have an idea that extends to all these, encompasses all these phenomena. So, if you forget about gravity for a minute, I will try to come back to gravity later. The right answer seems to be some version of the symmetries and anomalies of D-dimensional theories are encoded. Theories are encoded in a D plus one-dimensional topological field theory. So, most of my talk will be trying to unpack this statement: why this should be true and how do you obtain this kind of theory, this kind of d plus one-dimensional topological situation. And the slogan here is that symmetries are categorical. This is not a formalism I will go into, although I'm happy that Charlotte brought the word categorical, so I'm not the first one to do it. To use. So, the reason for this is that topological fit theory, a natural language, is category theory. So, there's a way of packing this knowledge. But I won't use that for my answer. So, as I said, I would like to motivate this answer and I would like to give you some idea of how you can start computing these topology theories. We don't have the full answer, I should say, but we are starting to be able to assemble the piece. All right, so what are anomalies? All right, so what are anomalies? All right, if you open a textbook, it tells you that anomalies are, when you have a symmetry of the classical Lagrangian, that's not the symmetry of the full quantum theory. And for gauge transformations, this is of course a problem. You shouldn't try to gauge anomalous theories, anomalous symmetries. If you have a global symmetry, then it's often useful to have anomalies because they take the information out of you. If you're doing things like dualities, it's a nice thing to be able to compare global. Able to compare global anomalies, so anomalies of global simulations. Of course, it's not the only thing you should compare, but this is a good PC calculation very often. So the economical example of a theory with an anomaly is the variable fermion in four dimensions charged under a U1 symmetry. So you have something like this. And classically, this looks fine, but we all know mechanically this is inconsistent. So, I'll try to rephrase this a bit more geometrically, and in fact, I'll go in the direction that Roar was discussing. So, one concise way to state the problem is that it may not be possible to define the phase of the partition function in a well-defined way. That means that as a function of the background fields model of gauge invariance, so you might take the background field, do a gauge transformation, and you might get a phase, and this phase you can call the anomalous phase. So, whenever you do this in the old formalism, you will say, I have an anomaly. So, recent papers by Tyam Frison, by recent, that can be sort of popularized again, starting with some work by Witten maybe, around that time anyway, in which it has been given some reformulation of anomalies. So, you have learned some new ideas, some new viewpoints on Ideas, so new viewpoint on anomalies, and the region of many of these things was condensed matter. But there are also many interesting consequences for high-energy physics, string theory, and so on. So, how do Diamond think of anomalies? So, you consider the case that, say, the spacetime in T dimensions is the boundary of some manifold in one dimension higher, and you assume that all the structures that you have on X extend by structures. I mean, you may have a connection. I mean, you may have a connection and some bundles, so this extends, you may have a spin connection, this extends, and anything that you want to put an X, you assume that it can be extended to Y. This is not always the case, but when it is, and you can take it off. So whenever this happens, whenever you have a picture like this, you can define the path integral of a fermion on X, on the manifold that you're really interested in, in the following way. You compute the modulus of You compute the modulus of the partition function in x. That's unambiguous. So, anomalies are phases. So, you compute the modulus of the partition function in any way that you prefer. This will give you a well-defined number. But to fix the phase, what you do is you compute something known as the eta invariant on y with appropriate boundary conditions on x. So, what's the eta invariant? It's this combination here. You look at your Dirac operator. At your Dirac operator of a fermion coupled to whichever connection you have in Y extending from X, and you solve the eigenvalue problem in principle. In practice, you can never do this, basically. And once you have eigenvalues, you compute this combination. The dimension of the kernel plus a sum of the signs of the eigenvalues. So plus one when there is positive, minus one when this is negative. And of course, this requires some tribularization, but I'm But at the apathetic and singer proved that this was a reasonable regulations. Okay, so as I said, this is very difficult to compute. I'm not going to try to compute examples. There are a few cases where you can compute it, but the general statement is that you cannot. And we only know expressions for vis-it-in-variant in a harmful examples. But it behaves very nicely. So if you change the orientation. So, if you change the orientation of the manifold, you can show that the phase of the partition function changes size. So, remember, the phase of the partition function is the exponential of the eight-invariant. So, if you change the orientation of the structures on your manifold, you get an extra minor sign. That's fairly quite nice. And it's also local, even if the suitable sense, even if the definition of data invariant is a very Of data invariant is a very non-local in principle quantity. It refers to the spectrum of the Dirac operator, which is something you need to look at the whole manifold to determine. If you put two manifolds together, if you glue them with appropriate boundary conditions, you find that the product of this exponentiated eta invariant is equal to the exponentiated eta invariant of the sum manifold. So it glues nicely. You can think. Nicely. You can think it's not really true, but because these properties are true, you could think of it in my enter as the integral of something of local density. It's not quite true, but if you want to think of more familiar terms, that's a problem. So anomalies in this language come from situations in which the phase of the partition function depends on the choice of the expansion. So the prescription that I am free to give you is, okay, find some manifold such that your manifold is the boundary of that one. But of course, typically it's more than one. If there's one, typically it's more than one if there's one there's you know infinity of them you can we've got the connection you will you can define the manifold and so on um so if your choice for the phase depends on your choice of manifold sorry if your expression for the phase this two pi a eta depends on your choice of manifold which you have extended this is an anomaly in this diaphragm language so these two manifolds y and y Yeah, so these two manifolds y and y prime have the same boundary, they are different manifolds though. So, if the calculation of the exponential determined variant gives you a different phase, then you say that you have a nanomanify. There's a slightly nicer way of formulating this, because these two manifolds y and y prime have the same boundary, x. What you can do is change the orientation of one of them, say y prime. And now, because you have two manifolds with opposite boundaries, you can glue them in a way that they don't have a boundary anymore. A way that they don't have a boundary anymore. So the picture is down here. Now you have a closed manifold. And the fact that these two phases have to agree is the statement that the exponentiated time variant on this joint closed manifold, which I call w, has to be one. So the statement of lack of anomalies in this particular context is that this exponentiator invariant should be one on any W. Any W that you can choose, it should give you one. It should give you one. So now this is steady or closed manifolds. And for lack of time, I will not go into connections of this formation with Bordism and so on, but there are some really nice connections. This thing I'm computing here is an example of a Bordersome invariant. And as Broad was saying, there's a close connection with K theory. So you can think of this eta invariant not as a number. invariant not as a number but as a theory. So this is a theory whose partition function of d plus one dimensional manifolds, so this is a d plus one dimensional theory, is the exponentiated eta invariant. And this is an example of a topological field theory in d plus one dimensions. This is known in this context as the anomaly theory. It's a theory that determines the anomaly and it lives in one dimensional higher. So in this language we say that the theory in D dimensions is anomaly That the theory in D dimensions is anomaly free if its anomaly theory defining one dimension higher is trivial. If this theory exponentiated eta invariant evaluates to one on every manifold. Okay, this might seem like a lot of formalism for doing something that we knew how to do already, but it's rather useful because you have turned a computation into an algebraic object that has a structure and you can start talking about it. A structure, and you can start talking about it, you can compute in different ways and analysing different ways. Um, but for the moment, let's just stay with this. Let's keep this in mind that anomalies are, in some sense, a topology theory in one dimension higher. And the sense in which this is true is that you have this Bluing construction of your manifold and you view it as the boundary of something else. And this theory lives in this something else. So, you can do this for many other field theories. A few theories. I did this here: the example of the fermion coupled to the connection, but of course, you can do it in many cases. So, later on, I will give you an example of anomaly theories for bound-for symmetries. In general, any symmetry has an anomaly. At least in most examples, you can put an anomaly theory attached to it that determines the anomaly. Right. Let me go back to a related topic: symmetries, or higher form symmetries. So let me start with the classification of a harness ebony kawa of n equal to four theories in four dimensions. So n equal to four theories in four dimensions are classified by a choice of gauge group, g, with algebra small g, and some discrete theta angles. So a typical example here was already done by Gotten Manetsky a bit earlier, is the Sd2 theory, or I should say Sd2 algebra, which can be associated to a Which can be associated to Ethereum with gauge group SU2 or Ethereum with gauge group SO3. And this SO3 theory comes in two variants, which are called plus and minus. So the distinction is subtle. The local dynamics are totally identical. So if you are scattering fluence or something in this theory, you get the same results, but if you have an SG2 and SO3. But you can, these theories are really different. You can obtain the different global forms by studying the partition function of four manifolds. Function of four manifolds with two cycles. Or you can study the properties and characters of extended operators. In this talk, I will focus on the first point of view. I'm thinking of the choice of global structure as a choice of partition function in some sense. So let me elaborate a little bit on that. Abstractly, if you have a Lagrangian, say when you compute the partition function of n equal to four, so you don't compute the partition. So, you have to compute the partition function M4. What you do is you do this path integral over the fields, and one of your fields is A, the connection of some bundle, and then you have to sum over bundles. And the question that whose answer distinguishes between SG2 and SO3 is which bundles you are summing over. And this is a choice, there's no priority way of deciding this. This sum over bundles was classified in slightly different language, but they do, but they do address this point. They explain some of the bundles you need to take in this paper by a harness hyper and patika. And one way of characterizing it in this context is as a choice of H group with H algebra and additional theta angles. So let me do an example, SG2. As I said, there are two SG2s, SG2 Lie group and SO3. They both have the same algebra. Three, they both have the same algebra. If you give me an SG2 bundle, I can always interpret this as an SO3 bundle. But if you have two cycles in your manifold, then there are SO3 bundles that you can put on your manifold that cannot be understood as SU2 bundles. And this can be interpreted quite physically. What I'm saying here is if you were to try to couple a fundamental of SG. Fundamental of Sg2 to an SG2 bundle, you have no problem because it's a fundamental fermion, not in that bundle. But if you try to couple it to an SO3 bundle, you obtain an inconsistency. It's like trying to couple an electrically charged particle of charge one to a half-integer quantized U1 bundle. You run into trouble. All right, so more formally, this obstruction, this impossibility to understand. Impossibility to understand some S3 bundles as SU2 bundles is known as the Stiffer-Windney class. It's an element of H2 of the manifold with coefficients S2. So if you have a bundle whose second Stiffer-Windney class is different from zero, then it cannot be understood as an SU2 bundle. Okay, so here comes the distinction, a little bit more formally stated. When you do the sum over bundles in the SO3 theory, In the SO3 theory, you sum over all SO3 bundles, and when you do the sum over bundles in the SG2 theory, you sum over those bundles that have SG2 bundles, meaning those that have the second distribution with me class equal to zero. Okay, so this is the real distinction, or this is the distinction, or one way of understanding the distinction between the SU2 and SO3 and equal to four fields. In terms of matter content, they are identical, but when, for example, computing the partition function, the sum of rebuttal The partition function, the sum of rebunders is different. And well, similar story holds for RSUN. And in modern language, we will describe this in a slightly different way based on these papers by Capustin-Seiber and then Gayoto Capustian-Seiber and Willet. We would say that what we are doing is choosing a different one-form symmetry structure for a theory. So the SUN theory, so this done a lot of SU2 before. Of SU2 before has a set n electric bomb from symmetry which counts Wilson lines in the fundamental. So this is what Magdalena was discussing the already. But whenever you have a symmetry, you can introduce a background for it. So what's a background for this one-form symmetry? It means that instead of considering SG2 bundles, you consider SO3 bundles with fixed Stifel-Windy class. You're not summing over all, you're fixing the Stifel. Over all, you're fixing the Stiffer-Widney class and summing over all bundles with that Stiffer-Widney class. That's what having a background for a one-form symmetry means. But what you can do now, as argued by the South Force, is that if you want to gauge this one-form symmetry, well, gauging a symmetry means or implies summing over the backgrounds for this symmetry. So if you start summing over all these backgrounds, you obtain the SUN mod set n-theory. The n-equality two case. The n-equal to two case would be the SO33. So, if you sum over all bundles with all Stiffer-Widney classes, you go back to this ESUN theory, and additionally, you obtain a magnetic, in this case, one-form symmetry, which counts top loops. So, this is a more modern way of stating the previous discussion. Okay, let me discuss a little bit about photography. So, what's the photographic interpretation of So, what's the ethologic interpretation of these choices that you have? And with an answer of this many years ago, what he did was to view the five-dimensional theory as a theory of a four-dimensional manifold times the radial direction considered as time. And this is the qualitation of this five-dimensional theory with the radial direction considered as time. And then you view the possible four-dimensional theories that live on the boundary as states in the As states in the Hilbert space of this year. So, more precisely, what happens is that in AVS5, you have, no, because you type to be a reduction in S5, you get the coupling of this form. And then the equations of motion coming from this Lagrangian are simply that B and C are flat. Okay, so that's not very exciting. They get massive, they need this five. But the more interesting. But the more interesting bit is that they are canonically conjugate to each other. So, this is like your PQ dot coupling in classical mechanics. So, B C being canonically conjugate means that in the quantum theory, they don't commute. In particular, you cannot set both to zero in the same way that in quantum mechanics, you cannot just set both P and Q equal to zero simultaneously. So, in order to specify the boundary condition, So, in order to specify the boundary conditions, in addition to specifying the usual local ditch invariant operators in ADS5, you also need to give me the periods of B and C. And these are non-commuting operators. And the non-commutation relation is given here, which you can derive easily from this, which again comes from the Lagrangian protocol. So, again, a state cannot be a boundary state, the choice of boundary conditions cannot be a simultaneous eigenstate. Boundary conditions cannot be a simultaneous eigenstate of both alpha and beta whenever the surfaces that have been wrapped, the surfaces when you're measuring the periods, are intersecting mobile. So you can have fixed boundary conditions for both B2 and C2. And then you can go and classify all the possible boundary conditions. And you see that the possible boundary conditions are in correspondence with the possible global forms that the Harrison Cyber and Tachikawa are found in region. How many cyber entical are found in region between the lines? So, this whole graphic discussion reproduces the free theory result. Okay, um, so this was a slightly long discussion, but uh again the punchline is fairly simple to state that all this symmetry structure that you see in the holographic picture is associated with a topological field theory in one dimension higher, which in this case has a form NB2 versus DC2. B2, which DC2. And choosing to gauge higher form symmetries going from the SUN to the SUN mod set N theory corresponds to choosing different boundary conditions for this theory. So again, we have mapped the problem of understanding the structure of global symmetries in our theory to some property of a topological field theory one-dimensional height. And that's satisfying in ADS. That's satisfying in ADS for a UN, but unfortunately doesn't answer all the questions that you might have. So not every theory of interest admits a tractable large energy meteor, of course. So there are theories that we don't know how to trigger in any useful way holographically. One example is an Adesix Tucomasio superconformal field theory. This is an example of a Tuka Macier superconformal field theory, which has Which has two-form symmetry and cannot be treated holographically. So, even if it admits different choices of higher-form symmetries, we can understand that just by looking to a holographic dual. And even theories that admit a reasonably well-understood holographic dual are not fully understood in the sense of understanding which topology. The sense of understanding which topology theory gives you the choices. An example is then equal to four theories with algebra SON. There's no issue in constructing the holographic dual. We understand what it is. It's ADS5 times RP5. But nobody yet has worked out the precise rules for deriving the trite couplings of this form for the SON theory using these holographic methods. We know the answer. We know the answer, we know where we want to compute it, but we don't have the right tools. And the issue is that because of the identifiable projection, so when I say RP5 that involves a minus one f omega, there's no identifiable projection acting on the RP5, B2 and C2 are both projected out in supergravity. There's no continuous B2 and C2 fields that you can use to write the coupling of this form. So, okay, there's no more efficient way of doing this, but Much more efficient way of doing this, but if you were just trying to reproduce Witten's argument, then you have to find the right way of formulating what B2 and C2 are after being predicted out, they're discrete fields, and formalization something like differential reality theory. I'm not saying this is the easiest way of solving this problem, but if you were sort of going totally straightforward, that's the kind of computation you would like to look at. And if you do more computation, If you do more complicated things, instead of thinking about orientifaults, you think about more general faults. I don't really know what the words for these are. You want some sort of differential generis commodology, but it's not. Tominology has a new construct. So this is a thing that you want to look at one dimension higher, but it's not clear what to do. Right, so let me introduce a notion. Let me introduce a notion. We call it the symmetry theory that sort of puts together all these observations and it generalizes to cases which don't have a tractable holographic dual. And I gave you some fairly exotic perhaps example of a theory without a tractable holographic dual, the A62, zero, but there are simpler examples. We could put M-theory on C2 mod gamma. This still becomes free in layers, so it doesn't become super conformal, doesn't become a superconformal field theory, but still you have the same sort of structure. You still will have one-fold symmetries, and you can choose a global structure, at least in field theory. So how does this go? If you put M-theory on situ mod gamma, you obtain a seven-dimensional super Jam Muz with gauge algebra G gamma. So I have listed them here. Here are the gammas that Here. Here are the gammas that are in SG2, so they preserve supersymmetry. There is the usual AD classification, and these are associated to these algebras here, as we all know. And then these algebras have a simple connected form, a simply connected form, sorry, which is here. And these simply connected forms have centers. So the one-form symmetries in this theory are the centers. You would take this global form for the theory. We take this global form for the theory. So, all these theories except E8 have non-trivial structure of one-form symmetries. And of course, whenever you have one-form symmetry, one thing that you can do, as I mentioned before, is you can gauge it. So you can go from SUN to SUN mat 7. And this theory, in the same way as before, we got a magnetic one-form symmetry in 4D, in 70, you get a magnet. In 70, you get a magnetic four-forms in it. All right, so you have to well, we want to develop tools for understanding this choice of gauging and string theory. And one thing that doesn't give you this information is the local form of the singularity. That only gives you the algebra and not the global form of the digital. You don't know if you have a ZUN or a GL mods of them. So your favorite. So you're facing the choice that either there's a preferred global form of the gauge group, or you can state it as having a preferred set of high-form symmetries, or there's some extra data that you need to specify when constructing the string theory model. In this paper with Ben and Devo, we argue, based on some observation, a paper by Frigmu and Siegel, that lag in holography is the second option I have realized. You can choose any global format you like, SGON, SGOMACN, or any other. Sgn or Sgmax L, or any of that. And the way you construct this in string theory, they're all possible, and you construct them by choosing boundary conditions of the infinity. And there has been a lot of work in this area. I highlight this paper by Michele, Jonathan, Daniel and Tom, which they use a different approach based on extended operators, but they reach the same conclusion. Right, so both anomalies and the choice of simple. And the choice of symmetries or global form can be understood in terms of topological dimension, one dimension higher, so topological theory, one dimension higher. But it makes sense if you start thinking about it to think of an object that includes both in some sense. And the reason that you have this sort of robolos or nectar, you cannot really gauge symmetries if you're anomalous, so you need to know the anomaly theory before you start talking about gauging, but you cannot really talk about anomalies. But you cannot really talk about anomalies until you have chosen the symmetry. Anomalies are a property of a set of symmetries. So these two things tend to be in tension. And the way this tension is resolved is by the following picture that Don Fritz I just did. Of course, there's a much more precise mathematical construction thing I'm just drawing the cartoon. But we want to think of the sort of situation that appears in string theory in the following way. You have this. Way. You have this right boundary, the green line here with the t tilde, where the local degrees of freedom live. So think of this as the singularity, the local degrees of freedom of the singularity. They are attached to some topological field theory that we call the symmetry theory. This is a topological quantum field theory. So you have dynamical B and C fields and whatnot. Then you have a gapped interface. We call it rho. The choice of gapped interface. The choice of gapped interface here is the choice of global structure for this theory. And once you have fixed the global structure, once you have fixed the one-form symmetries, then you have the notion of an anomaly. So the first sort of picture I was drawing in which you have your field theory attached to an anomaly theory, that would be the picture you obtain if you collide this pink interface with the green interface, squishing the symmetry theory to nothing. Then you have a well-defined theory. Theory to nothing. Then you have a well-defined theory with well-defined global symmetries, and that's attached to an anomaly theory. String theory instead is seeing something different. String theory is sort of sending broad to infinity to the left. You're not quite seeing the anomaly theory on the nodes. What you're seeing is this symmetry theory that encodes information about all the potential symmetries that you can have, and their anomalies at the same time. So, how do you compute this thing? Well, when we wrote this paper, we used a bit of sleight of hand. I mean, we did mention it, but you know, we didn't make a big deal out of it because we didn't understand it very well. But now we understand it better. So the way we competed this, we started with the M-theory on this ALE space, and we turned it into this sort of CR geometry. And we argued that because you're doing some topological computation, it doesn't quite matter. Now, once you have this. Now, once you have this sort of cigar picture, remember that we want to go from a picture that looks like this to a picture in which you have a semi-infinite interval on which the symmetry theory lives. And then on the boundary, you have your CFT. So the CFT is at the similarity, and this is kind of a semi-infinite interval, except that you have an S3 mod gamma on top of it. So the kind of thing that you can do is do a reduction of S3 mod gamma, a reduction of what you have. So, a reduction of whatever theory you have, M-theory in this case, on a stream of gamma, and this gives you a topological field theory, this symmetry theory. Okay, so you can obtain the non-commutative bits out of this in a fairly straightforward way. Let me not emphasize that. Let me briefly comment on how you get anomalies. So, this is the paper with Fabio, Federico, Chagar, and Serb Cura. So, in the 70 theory, Um, so in the 7D theory, you have the one-form or four-form symmetries, and then you also have the continuous instant of symmetry. In this case, it's a two-functions, and there's a mixed anomaly. So, you can try to compute this one in the way that I suggested. And you can obtain this by taking the chance coupling synonym theory and reducing extreme of damage, keeping track of the torsional sector. So, there's also a recent paper by Miriam and Marcus, Lin, and Chen. And Chen, where they do something related. So, you want to take your channel-semus coupling in M-theory and integrate it in this extreme mode gamma. I wrote it in modularity here. The problem is that this thing I wrote is not well defined whenever we have torsion. And the things that we're interested at torsion. And even worse, the things that we want to integrate are actually flat. So, g4 is equal to zero. So, it seems like you always get zero. But this is because we are not using the right mathematical formulation. So, we can use differential common. Formulation. So we can use differential cohomology, do the integral, and then we obtain what we wanted, and then some much more subtle results in fact. Okay, so let me just say a word about the swamp plan, then I could, I think I should say what about the swamp plan at least. So you can use these things for understanding dynamics of field theory. You can develop tools to extract symmetry theory from the geometry of strain theory, and in that case, you can try to understand the I. That case you can try to understand the IR of theories with no known Lagrangian. And you can say something about the classification superconformality theories in higher dimensions. Let me skip that. Let me focus on what does this say about the swamp band. So hopefully I convince you that symmetries are in some sense a topological theory in one dimension higher. So the statement that there are no global symmetries in quantum gravity means that our quantum gravity, the model that we are trying to understand, does not live on the boundary of any topological field. And if you turn this to a partial condensed matter, the You turn this to a partial and condensed matter, probably the first thought would be: well, then your theory can be gapped. And indeed, there are some recent examples where this kind of philosophy has been taken to success. And saying that you have the gapped phase of gravity is saying that you have a domain wall between your ordinary gravity and then a gap phase where there's nothing, there's a domain wall in the middle. So you can end your gravitational theory on some domain wall always. And this is also something that follows from the COVID. From the cover this in conjecture that you can expand your theories of gravity and drive to mention many things related to this. And just to mention it, this is a domain wall, but of course, if you break supersymmetry, what the theory will want to do is nucleate bubbles of this domain wall with nothing inside, and it will tend to decay by nucleating these things. So you start expecting that if all these things that no global symmetries plus lack of supersymmetry might imply that non-supersymmetry stream vacuum are unstable. So this is something that we try to. You are unstable. So, this is something that we try to push in this paper. And at least in some cases, it was to, of course, there's many other papers that do related things. Okay, let me finish. So, in recent years, developments in this matter have started other things, have started converging on the new understanding of symmetry. So, symmetries, in some sense, are one high-dimensional topographic theory. And in a string theory, we can determine this higher-dimensional theory geometrically. So, it's a lot of fun. And we don't really need to know. And we don't really need to know anything about the Lagrangian. We can understand the symmetries of a theory just from geometry, which is interesting. So, we'd like to develop this more, and in this way, we can probe a string theory. The big question I would like to raise is something we don't yet know how to do, is how to properly include gravity in this framework. So, we have a framework that works fairly well for field theory. Gravity is a bit of a question. How do you incorporate the funny things that gravity does, like some solar topologies? What it does, like some solar topologies. Um, there's an interesting paper of Banardia Amur I want to highlight that starts addressing this question, but there's much more to do in this one. All right, thank you. Okay, thanks, Anyaki. Uh, let's thank you Nyaki for the talk. Okay, uh, questions? So, I already see one hand up. Uh, so Marcus? Yes, hi, Injake. Thanks for the nice talk. Hi, Marcus. Uh, so, one question. So, one question. This works beautifully for a single singularity in M-theory, for example, on this C2 mod gamma. But so, I tried a little bit to understand what happens if you take two singularities and then you sort of try to couple them together and glue the geometry into some complete picture. And it turns out to be surprisingly complicated compared to a single stack. Can you maybe argue if there is a way to? Argue if there is a way to make that happen in a more generic way, or if you understand it better in terms of the symmetry theory? No, I don't think symmetry theories will help you. It's a good question. I spent also quite a bit of time thinking about that. It seems to be maybe you have seen this too. At least in some cases, I looked. It seems like sort of like knowing mandatory conditions are the things you want to use for gluing, and I'm not entirely sure why. But yeah, you're entirely right. This is a much more complicated. Yeah, you're entirely right. This is a much more complicated question. And then, if I may, a very short other question. So, on your introduction slide, you said that this invertible topological field theory construction excludes or you wrote no gravity. And I don't fully understand why, because I would say that at least for let's stay in the realm of zero form symmetries, I would say that the construction using Bordism and the anomalous. Construction using Bordism and the anomaly field theory also includes mixed gravitational anomalies and the gravitational part, in a sense. Yeah, yeah, you're right. The thing I had in mind is that when you do that calculation, you are sort of taking gravity as a classical theory, right? You take your importation and you fix it and you put the connection or whatever, and then you get the structure. But the thing I don't know how to do is in a TSA guard more concretely. Sega, more concretely, how you're supposed to sum over top of values. What is the right prescription for this? I see. Okay. Yeah, it's the sum that bothers me, not quite each manifold individually. You're right. Right, can be okay. Great. Thanks a lot. More questions? Maybe everyone's tired. Well, maybe I'll ask a question. Well, maybe I'll ask a question. So, in the bulk theory, I think you assumed it was gapped, but we also have many examples from holography where we have things like flavor brains, where we have a TQFT sector coupled to a gapless sector. So, as an example, say take a large number of M5 brains probing the E89 brain wall. So, how does the story work there? Yeah, I should have mentioned that it still works. Yeah, we have in our paper with Sakura and Federico and Fabio Sagar, we have papers in which you have brains beyond infinity, for example. Brain is going to infinity, for example, and what happens is that when you do this reduction, I was sketching. Um, the what's the meaning of term on the brain, you reduce it, and then you use the churn Simon for random value on the on the one-dimensional height. So the same picture seems to be true in those cases. In the one example we have checked. I see, but in that case, from the string theory perspective, I wouldn't call it a straight TQFT. So I understand how you got the TQFT sector coming out to this, but at the same time, I would have said, well, it still looks like a completely light degree of freedom propagating in the pulp. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's something that needs to be. That needs to be, we definitely need to understand better. Um, the thing I just told you is a computation can reproduce these coefficients here in 5D, for example, from a rank construction. So I'm fairly sure that we are doing the right thing. But as you say, the trigger is arguing that all the dynamical massless fields that you have to start with, the couple. And that's a problem we really have also in the M-theory picture with C2MA gamma, right? And in C2 has the gravity number. Mod gamma, right? And it serializes the gravity and everything. I'm saying that we are reducing extreme mod gamma, but that's a bit of an exotic thing to do. And I'm just forgetting about everything that's not the change, anything that's going to be the right prescription, but in general, but something like it would be true. Something we didn't answer. Let's see. Any other questions? I kind of want to ask one more, but I'm not sure I'm allowed to. So I think in the majority of your talk, you assumed that kind of the space-time that was being used to define the quantum field theory was orientable. Is that correct? Or? Yeah, I was assuming that. I don't think it's just from a sense. Yeah. So, what happens if you have you looked into what happens if you relax this condition? In particular, This condition, in particular for the string theory constructions. I haven't, but it's definitely on the list of things I want to do. So, this sort of this mysterious comment here that the computations are very sensitive to details. What I had in mind there is that, you know, it's not entirely clear which is the right generalis combo theory for M-theory, say, there's some proposals by Sati and collaborators. The way to understand The way to understand which is the right proposal for a differential commodity theory would be to do what you are saying: put a string theory in a button which is perhaps non-interval, perhaps with torsion, as complicated as you can, topologically, and try to test out both from the geometry and from the field theory the expected anomalies say. And if you do that, you should have a good proof of what the common U theory is. So it's a fantastic question. I really want to have an approach. Okay, thanks. Okay, quick comment. Yes, yes, please. In our manifolds, we even assume that there was no torching. So we're in the simplest case in this particular. Yeah, of course. Okay. So I guess that's the end of the conference.
