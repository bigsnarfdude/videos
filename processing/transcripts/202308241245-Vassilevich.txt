Excellent, excellent, thank you. It's fine. It's not a full screen anyway, but I think it's better. So, first, let me thank the organizers for this wonderful workshop. I was not able to come there because there was some funny glitch in diplomatic relations between Brazil and Mexico, and so we are now required a visa to come to Mexico. But fortunately, we are not still required a visa to online. So at least I see some of you well on the screen. So, what is the content of this talk? I will actually speak not about spectral actions mostly, but about spectral functions in general and some spectral invariants, which are particular cases of the spectral functions. I will start a short introduction, which may be quite unnecessary in this audience. Be quite unnecessary in this audience. And then I will ask, and we will try to answer two questions. One of them is: whether some specific biomedic contributions from spectral invariance can be expressed as spectral invariance related to a different era cooperator, which is kind of a direct operator on the boundary. Well, it can be done in some cases, and an example of this is just the I'd say. Example of this is just the Atiya-Padoisian index theorem, which relates the index of direct operator on a manifold if boundary with the ethane variant of a specific boundary direct operator. So this is not hopeless. And then a more specific question. So if this specific boundary contribution can be related to the contribution of specific boundary states. So this is not just States. So, this is not just an operator which checks on the boundary, but this has to be a restriction of the initial direct operator to the states, to the eigenfunctions, which are well localized near the boundary. So, this is much more sophisticated questions, and there are very few answers to that. Any examples, I have to choose some spectral invariants, which I will some spectral variants which I will discuss. I will mostly speak about the Ether invariant. The ether invariant, which is not exactly related to the spectral action, but it can be found for a specific function. My other relation motivation for doing this work is not only in expect election, but so this scheme is actually what one finds in the holographic principle and in some generalization of initial framework of ADS CFT. And then recently, also, there is a lot of application to the Also, there is a lot of application to the condensed matter physics just because the new materials which were discovered during this century, like graphene, topological insulator, viral serum metals, they are all Dirac materials. So the operator which governs the dynamics of quasi-particles there is exactly the Dirac operator. So whatever you do in spectral geometry and local geometry, maybe somehow related. Somehow related to the condensed matter physics of these new advanced materials. And moreover, these materials, of course, have boundaries. So people are quite interested in what happened, especially in quantum biological materials. Well, and so since Speculation describes so nicely gravitational physics and also describes so nicely standard model particle physics, why not? Standard model of particle physics, why not move to something which is closer to other applications, particularly and condensed matter? So let me remind briefly what in fact actually needs, what is not, of course, not needed here. I will consider a Dirac type operator, actually Dirac operator, defined on some spin bundle of the smooth manifold, the smooth boundary. Mostly, I will assume this manifold is. Manifold is compact and that this manifold is Euclidean. So the spectral action is defined as a trace of some function of this operator divided by its scale factor, lambda. And if lambda goes to infinity, this Pertile action admits an asymptotic expansion in terms of the heat-kernel coefficients. So these are heat-kernel coefficients for d squared. And if this function f is Function f is not an even function. So if it's not invariant under reflection d to minus d, there are also coefficients of this type. So the coefficients are defined out. So this is trace. It's q, which appears here. It could be one or this flash, times the usual heat exponent. So for good boundary conditions, these coefficients are local and well, the bulk boundary. And well, the bulk part, at least the bulk part, repeats a lot of interesting things. Let me now come to the ether function. So the ether function for a GIRA cooperator is defined as a difference of two infinite sums. One sum is calculated for the positive part of the spectrum. So this is lambda elevated to minus s, where s is some complex parameter. Exparameter and minus similar sound for negative part of the spectrum. It's again minus s. So as we know from the wire formula for the asymptotic eigenvalues, this sum is convergent if a real part of the complex variety is sufficiently large. And as theory tells us, it then can be continued as a meromorphic function. Be considered as a meromorphic function to the whole complex. Similarly to the zeta function and the zeta invariant, which is more common in the context of complex. So why is it so important? First of all, it just measures the spectral asymmetry. So if you formally take here s equals to zero, so you will have a sum of plus one for all positive eigenvalues, minus one for all negative eigenvalues, and therefore you Eigenvalues, and therefore, you just well count so the difference between the number of positive and negative eigenvalues. Of course, for infinite dimensional operators like Jira operator, this sum doesn't make sense, but as a continuation from the part of the disconversion, it does. From the physical point of view, so it's possible to evaluate some kind of. It's possible to evaluate some kind of a smooth part of this eta invariant, although it's not smooth and dot local. And this just gives you the Chernobyl-Simons action, which is quite an important action. And so this action will discover some interesting physics and a very important physics for condensed matter since this is exactly the whole conductivity. It's an interesting part of the modern physics. So the equations now is: so I'm going to use the heat invariant. Use the it invariant, uh, this it of zero of t, but I would like to make some connection to the spectral action in the cashier as well. And this invariant can be found as some kind of asymptotic of the spectral action, and the answer is positive. But the function which we have to take is Kenneth's continuity at d equal to zero. So, for example, like this, and then the formal limit lambda to infinity produces just eta function of. Well, one has to be very careful this limit because if you take it just naively, it will be divergent. Now let's come to the boundaries. So we will assume that the boundary conditions are local, which is mostly true for physics, but not mostly true for mathematics, because just the idea but what is in your index theorem. Tear pathology zinger index theorem was demonstrated for non-local boundary conditions. But anyway, so it's enough for our purposes today. And so for these boundary conditions, under some additional assumptions, which I will explain a little bit later, the heat kernel coefficients of Dirac operator are represented as a sum of bulk and boundary parts. Of bulk and boundary parts. So these coefficients are local. And they can be written like that. So this integral over the manifold M with some bulk invariance. So this bulk invariance, so this is Riemannian curvature. This is the field strength of the curvature of the gauge connection. If you have Higgs field, its potential of the Higgs field, and so on and so on. So this is basically what you would like to see in the standard model or in the Einstein gravity. Einstein gravity. But also, it has some integral of the boundary. So it's again local in the trace of bulk and boundary local invariance, which again contain the Riemann-Curvichi, the field strength, and the Higgs field, but the partly it also contains some specific boundary invariance like the extrinsic power gel boundary. PLG of the boundary like normal derivatives of your Higgs fields, like normal components, and so on and so on. So what they see, so the heat-kernel coefficients are already factorized in two parts. One is the quality, another the boundary. So this is not a problem, but the problem is to find a good interpretation of the boundary part. Of the boundary path. So, and related to, let's say, heat-Kaml coefficients or the spectral invariance of some specific Dirac operator defined just on the boundary. So, this is the hard part of this problem. And, well, frankly speaking, I don't know how to solve it. In general, just because the number of bulk invariants is limited, but Is limited, but the number of boundary invariants is very large. Well, you can imagine if you add new structures to what you already have and the boundary, well, this just becomes very complicated. And sites, so this boundary invariance also depends not only on the boundary itself, so not only on the intrinsic geometry of the boundary. only on the intrinsic geometry of the boundary but also on the way uh how you put uh this uh this boundary into the box or how this is embedded uh so there is little hope to relate uh in general uh the boundary contribution to the heat kunnel coefficients to anomalies of the function uh through some characteristic of the paraco operator so we have to Operate. So we have to make certain distinctions. And well, to begin with, let's just take the Delaco operator in the simplest form. So this is I gamma mu d mu, where d mu is a covariant derivative which contains a gauge and remaining one. That means to begin with, you don't have any Higgs field. To begin with, we don't have any Higgs field, we don't have any axial vector fields, and we don't have any torchions. So, this is just to reduce the number of invariants to some well, to some reasonable choice. And practically, that means that this covariant derivative here is compatible with the Clifford structures. So, the covariant derivative can use you can. Covariant derivative can use you, so this is the most important technical advantage of this. Also, to remove all the invariance related to the way how the boundary is embedded into the manifold, we assume that there is a kind of a product structure near the boundary. So, near the boundary, there is some all our neighborhood where. Some call our neighborhood where the manifold itself is a product structure of an interval boundary, and also other fields like edge connection, they also respect the structure. That's normal. So the idea about what is in your index theory, what's also demonstrated under this assumption. Moreover, instead of considering the ether function itself, I will actually. Itself, I will actually always consider the what is called exponentiated either invariant. Although I will not always say this explicitly. So if it look at the either function, you see there is a sum of positive eigenvalues, some of negative eigenvalues, and then an eigenvalue crosses the origin. So it has been positive and become negative. First of all, the ether function of zero jumps by one. function of zero jumps by one when it becomes zero and then it jumps back another one and it becomes negative so all in all eta of zero jumps wise so to compensate one of these jumps the add the dimension of the kernel of direct operators so the all discontinuity now is true and then the multiply by i pi And take an exponential of this, we will obtain a smooth function. So, the only problem with theta is that jumps and eigenvalues cross the origin. So, this function, exponentially function, is first of all, it's smooth. And second, it has local variation, which can be expressed for the heat count. So, this is big simplification. What can we do now? So, that was. So, that was the result which I obtained with Sasha Ivanov from Stiklov Institute a year ago. This is the following. So, first of all, suppose that the dimension of a manifold is even, consider now a boundary which has some number of connected components which are numbered. Which are numbered by this number alpha, and then they derive the boundary projector, which defines the boundary conditions by this formula. So gamma star is a correlative matrix, which is used in many, many aspects also in fact electron. Gamma n is the normal gamma matrix which corresponds to the inverse point in the direction, and epsilon alpha is just some sine factor which. Is just some sine factor which has to be constant on each connected component on the bound. These boundary conditions are called the equilibrium back boundary conditions. They were introduced many years ago in the context of hadron physics in the 70s. Then they were basically rediscovered in the 80s in pure math. For these boundary conditions, first of all, the Dirac operator is symmetric and actually symmetric formation. Actually, see the information. And second, these boundary conditions are what is called strongly elliptic. Strongly elliptic means all the nice properties of generic operator or with the boundary, which also operator in the bulk has. So this strong liquidity condition is becoming more and more important nowadays since people are considering more and more sophisticated boundary conditions and sometimes. Boundary conditions, and sometimes it's very easy to get into trouble since, okay, you import some local boundary conditions, but the problem that for these boundary conditions, the generic operator may even not have a spectrum. So, strong ellipticity means the following. So, ellipticity itself is the property of the leading symbol of the operator. And the strong ellipticity is something very similar. So, here I wrote. So here I wrote the Giraffe operator near the boundary. And to check the strong ellipticity, one has to go to the leading symbol of this part, which is a restriction of the recognition of the boundary, but still keep the normal derivative and then solve the corresponding one-dimensional boundary value problem on R plus and make sure that That the eigenvalues of this problem do not appear at the wrong places of the complex plane. So, that the eigenvalues of this main part of the spectral problem are somewhere near the real axis. So, this is the problem of linear algebra. Nothing else to this. So, this is simple, but it's important to solve it. Well, okay, so in some ways, we're So, in some bases, we write the operators like this, and let's now compare with the boundary conditions. We will see that this scribe D is actually the operator which acts on the boundary values. So, depending on the sign of epsilon alpha, the boundary condition is that either the upper components of The upper components of spinners are zero on the boundary, all lower components of the spinners are zero. So, this d alpha is exactly the operator which is restricted on the set of the boundary data. Then, if we analyze the structure of the heat count coefficients and the variations, which is quite technical stuff, we can find that the ether function of operator D Function of operator D has to be a sum of all the alpha numbers and boundary components of some functionals defined on its operator DI. So the idea is to show that the data which may appear, the spectral data which may appear are exactly the data of the operator dr and f this capital F is some universal function. So I mean of course as I as I said so it's not the identity I said, so it's not an identity for ether functions, it's identity for smooth variation of ether functions. I cannot control the zero eigenmodes here. Well, you see, this is a great simplification. This means that we have to define this function for all possible boundaries, but we don't care in the bulk. In the bulk. So we can just take a boundary which we're interested in, embedding some nice manifold, construct some nice operator where they can solve this particular problem, and compute the ether function. And automatically, we will get the results. So we don't need to compute this for many fold with 99 boundaries. It's enough to compute this stuff for just manifold if one boundary. Manifold with one boundary, or actually, it's much simpler to do this to manifolds with two boundaries. And it goes back to examples by Gilkins Meath in 1993, which they used, well, exactly for this purpose, to derive certain identities on data function and on the index. So we take the manifold as a product of some. A product of some n which is which is actually boundary times the interval zero pi. Then it's actually simple to find the spectrum of the previous operator, of operator here. And what we'll see that most of the spectrum is actually symmetric with respect to wavelet. So for each positive eigenvalue, there is a negative eigenvalue. So there is no So there is no contribution to the heater function. And there is just a very small part of the spectrum which corresponds to a constant spinner. So then this normal derivative is actually zero, which is not similar. Eigenvalues on this part of the spectrum are defined from the spectrum this operator D, which is exactly the operator which acts on the boundary data. So the So, the non-symmetric part of the spectrum of the full operator in this particular case is fully defined by the spectral asymmetry of the operator z. When you take together all the information, so all the coefficients and so on, you will immediately find that this universal function is actually one half of the eta function of zero for the operator dr. zero for the operator DR. So you see, so in quite a general case, and you just have a product structure near the boundary, which is important, restriction, we are able to find, to compute the smooth part of the ether invariant in the bulk manifold, which error, through a spectral function, which is again ether function of just boundary operates, which is a great simplification. And please notice. Great simplification, and please know this coefficient one-half, which is quite important in the applications of good. So that was for even number of dimensions. What happens with odd number of dimensions? With odd number of dimensions, we encounter difficulty immediately since in odd number of dimensions, there is no reality values. So to get So, to get strongly elliptic local Hermitian boundary conditions, we have to double the number of ephemerals. Instead of the usual number of ephemerals, we will have twice that. So even multiplied by sigma 2. So if gamma mu, if capital gamma mu are gamma matrices of well, of the minimal dimension, then gamma mu are also satisfied equivalent. Also, also satisfy the cliff conditions. Then they can solve the condition of strong ellipticity and hermeticity, and they file the most general Hermitian strong elliptic local boundary conditions, which are also rotation invariant. So they do not contain tangential gamma matrices, and they are given by this projector. And in this projector, there is an arbitrary number which is not defined, which is handled theta alpha, which again. Which again should be constant at each component on the boundary, and otherwise, we will be in trouble. For these boundary conditions, again, we can argue that the heat invariant, the rational heat invariant, just contain boundary paths which depend on the boundary operators to alpha. And the boundary operators d alpha, they are defined. Derived for they are defined in a similar way. Then we can again use the technique of some universal examples. So again, we take a manifold which is a product of boundary times and interval. The spectral problem again can be solved explicitly, and we see that most of the spectrum is symmetric. It doesn't Is symmetric, it doesn't contribute to either. But there is some part which is non-symmetric. And this part is actually defined in this number of dimensions, not by the ether invariant of this operator, but it's a different structure. So it's defined by the index of the operator d alpha with respect to gamma n. So index of the alpha with respect to gamma n means. Of the art with respect to gamma n means it's the number of zero eigenvalues of gamma alpha, which are also eigenvalues plus one of gamma n minus the number of mines. So again, we succeeded this, and here I wrote the exact expression which actually contains not a variation, but just the whole extent it invariant. So it works like that, and let me now go to Like that, and let me now go to the last question: What happens? What is the relation of the boundaries? So, this is this is quite a recent paper by Redevia Fresneta, well, Lucas de Solos and myself. What is interesting about this team? So, that Lucas de Sola, he's still a bachelor's student at our university, although he has a paper public. The most difficult part here is to find a right setup. Right setup. So, what are the boundary states? The boundary states are the eigenfunction of the Dirac. I will speak about the Dirac Hamiltonian since it's closer to Releon physics here, which decay exponentially faster the boundary. So it's hard to define them if your manifold is compact. There is no large distance from the boundary, the distance also finite. It's the first thing. It's the first thing. And the second, I would like to compare boundary invariance with contribution of the boundary. But it's not always easy to clearly separate bulk and boundary invariance since you can just add you can add a total derivative. Wherefore, we will consider some relations between e to invariance. Between ether invariant in the non-compact manifold and ether invariance on the manifold at the boundary which so uh the Hamiltonian which we study, so I instead of gamma matrices I use alpha matrix and either matrix for the kerality matrix since it's annotations of a Hamiltonian analysis, but it's it's just the Clifford matrices are uh alpha j, and this is a gamma star on the previous slides. Previous slides. This A is an electromagnetic field strength, and it describes a magnetic flux which just goes through the plane. Let us suppose that this magnetic flux is very well localized. So this magnetic field is non-zero somewhere near the origin, but then it decays exponentially faster. So the field AJ still remains non-zero. Still remains non-zero and it does not decay exponentially fast. It decays like one or the R. But it becomes pure gauge. But hopefully, it becomes pure gauge. It still contains the collagen, since it cannot be removed smoothly on the whole. Well, for this function e double 0 of h on just R2 without boundaries, there is a famous result by Niemi and Semyonov that this. And similarly, that this either function can be expressed up to a coefficient depending on sine of the m as a total magnetic flux of R2. When the story about this is that so this intervention can be related to the fermion number of a vacuum state, and what appeared that the fermion number of a vacuum state doesn't need to be integer. So that was Well, that was fermionic fractionization result obtained in it. Well, now let's do the following. So let's cut a disk out of this R2. So I will suppose later on that the radio is are small, it's going to be large. So there is this one as a boundary. And let us define this ether R of 0 H. e to r of zero h as just this expression well we restrict the integration to the t instead of r2 so this is not an either function of any operator this is just uh well the either function or r2 we have restricted integration then uh we can analyze uh the boundary states in this problem which is not very hard for And its problem, which is not very hard for reasonable boundary conditions. We can also analyze the ether function on the t with suitable boundary conditions. And then we take a limit when r goes to infinity or when r gets sufficiently large. You write the following result. That the ether function of the Hamiltonian, of the generic Hamiltonian, which is defined Which is defined on the disk, so subject to certain boundary conditions, actually splits in two parts. One part is the regularized, restricted integration on the R2. So this is what we would like to call the bulk part, which corresponds to the infinite plane. And plus the contribution, which is exactly either function of a restriction of a direct operator to the boundary state. To the boundary states. So, this is what we may expect on some mathematical intuition and physical grounds. But the point is not, it's not always true. So, it's true if you can see the, let's say, back boundary conditions from the previous slide. All this. So, if there are boundary states, then the Then the contribution of boundaries is just the difference between the left-hand side and right-hand side. If there are no, that means that both coincide because HB simply does not exist. But there are boundary conditions, and these are called chiral boundary conditions, when the boundary states do typically exist, but they are not very well localized. Very well localized means that's for a whole Localized means that for a whole set of boundary states, you have some bound on the decay rate. So the decay rate is always finite. But for some boundary conditions, this decay rate actually comes to zero. It becomes very close to zero. And then this is violated. Which is also clear. If you have the boundary states which are not really localized near the boundaries, you know. Localize near the boundaries, the near boundaries. So, what's the reason for calling the boundaries? More or less like that. Well, interesting part of this result for, let's say, condensed matter applications is that this tells you that we have to be very careful with respect to some results and regarding the whole conductivity for various semi-metals. But never mind about that. Metals, but never mind about that. Uh, at the uh at the level of spectral invariance, so what is good? So, the technique you used was actually more universal than what was used on the previous slides regarding well the mass this case. So, we will, and I actually believe that this can be generalized. be generalized for some other more for some other spectral functions for zeta function for and maybe even for the Hitgaum coefficients in general and maybe therefore for the limit of spectral action when the lambda goes to infinity just because the technique was more universal and less dependent on the spectral operator and therefore And therefore, I'm asking the question where it could be something like a holographic spectral triple. So imagine that you have spectral triple defined on a manifold boundary and that it can that the spectral action contains a specific part which corresponds to some other spectral triple which is defined on the boundary. I think that will be an extremely nice picture, and so that's what. Picture, and so that's all what I wanted to say. And I think I'm still okay with the time. Thank you very much. Yeah, you are excellent with time. Okay, so that's questions. Let us see if there is somebody. There is a question from people in Zoom. There is a question from people in Zoom. I don't see anything here. Yeah, Andrei, please, please, please, go ahead, please. Hi, Dmitry. Just, you know, a question which is sort of general about spectral to represent eta-invariance. I mean, eta-invariant, I mean, is not really an invariant, I mean, in this sense, but it still is an invariant. But it still is an invariant, but you can say it of differential structure. So, have you thought? I mean, have you any ideas, or is it somehow known whether it's an invariant of a spectral triple? Which is like a... And then in what sense? Yeah, it's a very good question. So then. Well, it's in the variant in the sense that it's defined on the spectrum. So, if you make a neutral transformation of Eugiraco, it of course stays the same, but it's trivial. No, I don't know. It's a good question. This is something I've been thinking, and I don't think there's an obvious answer yet. Yeah, you're right. So, at least I don't know. It's not obvious to me. Works to me. Maybe. Yes, thanks. I will think I'm not sure they'll come up with something. Okay. That's okay. Good. Okay, I do not see anyone else wanted to say something. So let us thank the speaker again and move to the next, the last talk of this morning.
