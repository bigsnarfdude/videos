Yesterday, I started to realize these might be the same thing as upper and lower. We'll see. So before I continue, for anything I'm going to say to make sense, I need to briefly tell you categories and co-fibrations and walhousing categories and tell you how you need to vary the SDOT construction for these two things. Alright? So vary. So definition, a category with co-fibrations. Co-fibrations is a category together with a special collection of morphisms called the co-fibrations. These are denoted with a tail, so you have even more morphism pictures like this, and a zero object, which I'll just be denoting zero, such that the unique morphism from zero to any object is a co-vibration. is a covibration. You take a cofibration and compose it with a cofibration. So you get a co-fibration. All the isomorphisms are co-fibrations. And lastly, a condition that looks different than the rest, if you have a co-fibration from A to B, Vibration from A to B, and a morphism from A to C, then you can always form the push-out. And the push-out of the co-fibration will be another co-fibration. Categories with co-fibrations are the original thing that the S-dot instruction was defined for. Now, a wallet housing category is a category with covibrations and another collection of morphisms called weak equivalences such that a weak equivalence composed with a weak equivalent Weak equivalence composed with a weak equivalence is a weak equivalence. All the isomorphisms are weak equivalences. And lastly, if you have a diagram like the following, so one of these pre-pushouts where one of the morphisms is. Pre-push-outs where one of the morphisms is a co-fibration. And the middle of these pre-pushouts, where one of the morphisms is a cofibration. And you have vertical maps, which are weak equivalences, which I'll denote with a twiddle. Then the induced map that goes from the push-out, I'll call this AV. I mean, I'll call this AB and see what it means. The induced map from the push-out up here to the push-out down here is a weak equivalence. So weak equivalences respect this part of the structure of a category with code vibrations. Right? Now, an example which I'll make heavy use of is the category of finite. The category of finite based CW complexes and based cellular maps. I'll tell you the other G cell maps too. So example, there's CW finite stars. This is the notation I'm going to use for finite-based CW comparisons. W comparisons with base cellular maps. This category also appears in Waldhausen's original work, which we denote in the R sub F star. So here, take co-fibrations are cellular inclusions. And weak equivalences, weak equivalences are weak homotopy equivalences based on equivalences. Okay, now I'll just tell you, you can apply the SDOC construction to a category with co-fibrations. I'll tell you the little modification you have to make from exact categories to do that. So if C is a category with co vibrations, S dot C is like Like S dot E, where E is an exact category, which Victoria told us about earlier today. Except exact sequences have been replaced have been replaced with co-fibration sequences. Sequences. And what's the cofibration sequence? Well, it's just a co-fibration followed by its co-curdel. In the case of a Lawdhausen category, Waldhausen category for the Waldhausen category C, if we denote the weak equivalences by W for the subcategory of weak equivalences by WC, that S dot C Is walled housed with I think equivalent says component-wise. And so the uh subcategory of S dot C consisting of the equivalences we would denote W S dot C. Words denote WS.c. Right. Now, last two facts. A category with A category with co-vibrations can always be made into a wallhausen category by taking the isomorphisms to be the weak equivalences. And in that case, I would write I C. If the weak equivalences are isoms, then I write I C. And S dot C would be Waldhausen with the weak equivalency as component Y is isomorphisms. To this component y is isomorphisms. I would write IS dot C. Alright, so now we're ready to say what a big goal has been of mine for a while. So big goal, let vertical bars denote geometric realizations. This is a functor that goes from the category of categories to top. Is realization WS.c, which goes from delta op to top at level n is the realization of WSAC. Is this two Siegel or which two Siegel maps are weak equivalences? That's been a big goal of mine. Are there questions so far on the background part? All right. And so the way I've approached this was looking at, I would call this a variant of the S-DOC instruction. I've looked at other variants of the S-DOC instruction and addressed this question first and tried to work my way up to more and more complicated ones to get towards this one. ones to get towards this one. So the first one that I'm going to spend a lot of my time talking about is just S.C, the simplicial category. And I think some of you, from comments I've heard, might know this story already. But I'm going to tell you about which two single maps for S.C, where C is a category with co-vibrations, are we going to follow once C. So So which two Siegel maps for S dot C, where C is the category with the vibrations, are weak equivalences. And for me, two Siegel maps are going to be in correspondence with any polygonal decomposition. Any plaguable decomposition, not just the triangulations, but when I say two signomatically correspond to any flagal decomposition. Alright, so that's the question. And the answer is that some always are and You can have all of the rest not be at the same time. More precisely, the polygonal decompositions for which the associated two psego maps are mean equivalences are those where every polygon in the subdivision. Are those where every polygon in the subdivision has the vertex zero? So we have every polygon in your decomposition of Pn. This is the notation from earlier on in the week, Polygon with n plus one vertices. One vertices, if every polygon in your decomposition of Pn has the vertex zero, then the associated two sequel map is only equal to the colour. And I'd like to go ahead and kind of sketch why that's true. So It suffices, this is a proof sketch, suffices to check the polygonal decompositions of the following form. We have vertex 0, 1, 2, and we have just a single subdividing edge that goes from vertex 0 to vertex j. Check the two single maps associated to these. Two single maps associated to these, that would be enough to conclude that all these are weak approaches. So, using Walker's notation, this is the map that goes from SNC, this is associated to the map that goes from SNC to holiday fullback categories, S sub 01j C over S 0 J 0 J C with S J J plus 1 delta 0 and C. And for somewhat model category reasons, I'll omit them, the canonical map from the ordinary pullback to this homotopy pullback will be an equivalence. And so really, we just have to look at this to the ordinary pullback. To the ordinary equivalent. Right. And to show that this is an equivalence, it suffices to find quasi-inputs. So I'm going to start with the data of an object on the right-hand side and produce an object on the left-hand side. And let me schematically write down what an object of the right-hand side looks like. Side looks like. So instead of having your whole triangle-shaped diagram of an object in SNC, you have a triangle like this. You have the whole entire top row. And you have one morphism that goes down to here, and then you have the whole triangle shape down here. This is a sketch of what the diagram looks like. Of what the diagram looks like, because I don't want to write down the whole diagram. So, how can you complete this to an object of S and C? Well, everything in here is supposed to be a pushout of a composite of things in the top row, and so you just start taking push-outs to fill the empty bits. And then the rest of the maps are induced by the universal reactor push-out. So, because you can take push-outs. Take pushouts along cofibs, covibrations, you win in this case. And the cases where you're going to be able to have an entirely complete top row are exactly the corresponding to polygonal decompositions where every polygon has a zero. Oh, right. Now, I also claimed that no other two siegel maps were necessarily weak equivalences, and I said there was an example where you could have all of the rest of the two siege maps not be weak equivalences at the same time. So let me give that example. So, if this example was going to be a little bit contrived, the example was created for this purpose. Consider the following diagram and my category of base finite CW complexes. So I'm going to put S1, the circle, with one zero cell and one, one cell. I'll have the torus, which I give one zero cell still. This is kind of the standard way of making the Taurus where you combine the top two, identify. Combine the top to identify this, this, and this, and this. I'm giving it three one cells. So one cell here, one cell here, but also a one cell here. And I'm attaching two cells here and here. So there's a cellular inclusion here. It takes this edge to this edge. And the quotient of that subcomplex, pictorially, looks like this. Pictorially looks like this. And I can include a subcomplex into here. And the quotient of that is just S2, where there's just one zero cell and one two cell. Now call Call the smallest subcategory with cofibrations of finite ACW complexes containing This diagram. I call this D. Then my claim is for S dot D, none of the other two siegel maps, none of the two siegel maps that don't look like coming from a polygonal decomposition screen, a polygon as zero, none of those will be weak equivalences. So, claim is Is that for S dot D no polygonal decomposition where some polygon doesn't contain the vertex zero. Has its associated two-seagle map a weak equivalence. So how would you verify this? Well first of all let's look at the map from what about the map from S The map from S3D to S013, and I'll draw the picture because I want this. S 013C. I'll let it pull back over. Oh, remember we don't have to worry about that. S one, three, C, S one, two. Sorry, this should be D's. So this is the two-seagle map that corresponds to the decomposition where we just have a diagonal going from vertex 1 to 3. First of all, this two-seagle map is not an equivalence for this category D. If it were, then for this particular diagram, we'd be able to complete it to an object of S3D. We'd be able to put something here such that this co-vibration also has. That this covibration, so I put a question mark. I'm going to be able to put something here so that this covibration factors through this mystery object and such that the quotient of this mystery object by S1 inside of it would have a CW structure that looks like this. Now, if you explicitly determine what the objects of D look like, you'll see that there are two that have the right number of cells to fit here, but for neither of these can you find a cellular inclusion, for neither of these in this background. This back. So that's the claim for that one. Now you can look at slightly in a put more empty spots in this diagram in the top row, and you can find that two single maps where you have n vertices and just this leftmost diagonal. None of those will be weak equivalences, and then you can do it. Weak equivalences, and then you can do an inductive argument based on the structure of the triangulations to get that the rest of them aren't. That's a sketch of this back of all these old moons too signals. Right? So maybe when is S dot C two single? Well, I'll give a sufficient condition. So S das C is two siegel if one can take the diagram any diagram of the form that we have. Here we have A, the cofibration to X, the co-kernel to Y, and then this is a commutative squared, and you have, let's say, you have some object B value, such that 0 to Y factors through B. So if you have a commutative diagram like this, if you can always complete to To a diagram where we have A, now we're factoring this top cofibration through C as a sequence of cofibrations, such that the co-pertal of this first cofibration, that's the co-curtal object B. So if you could take this diagram, you get this diagram, where the right square. The right square is bicartesian, so that's a heavy requirement, and the left square is push-out, then you win. And the reason behind this is if you're trying to fill in a diagram where you're missing part of the top row, you can use this condition to fill out the top row step by step. And once the top row is filled out, you can take push outs and fill out the rest. And for the last bit of my time, I'll mention some results about variance of S-dosity. If you consider realization S.C. S dot C, which goes from delta to top, this is always 2 signal. And this is just because S and C has an initial or terminal object, the diagram of all zeros, and so these are all contractible. If you look at the realization IS.C, so here we're viewing C as Walthausen with the isomorphisms to be covered, this behaves Pretty much the same as capital S dot C. You have to use a different argument to replace homotopy pullback with, or homotopy limits, with ordinary, well actually replaced them with something called, I'll call protected two limits, but anyway. But anyway, it behaves very similarly. Then there's iso s.c. This is a functor from delta op set. It takes n to the set of isomorphism classes of s and c. This also behaves like s dot c and similarly w s dot c behaves like Behaves like, or WZ, we're seeing a lot as a category. This also behaves the same as S.C. So the only one left is realization WS.c, and I only have a partial result for that one, and that was the whole reason for doing this. So for realization, ws.c, I think I'll just say it. So if C is a saturation, So if C is a saturated, for the people that know, if C is a saturated wall and has a category that satisfied the mapping cylinder axiom, then the two signal map of WS.c is a weak equivalence, if and only if the two signal maps of a different simplicial topological space are equivalences, and that other simplicial topological space would be a realization of acyclic Covibrations and M.C, where M.C is a simplicial category where MNC is shape objects of MNC. are chains of n minus 1 cofibrations and leak equivalences, morphisms or morphisms of such chains, leak equivalences are component-wise and the cofibrations are Cofibrations are component-wise cofibrations, but also if you look at a morphism between two objects, you have a sequence of squares, and each square needs to have the push-outs of the top right corner. It needs to be a covibration into the bottom right corner. All right, so I managed to get through everything I wanted to say. I just probably had to left things? In the definition of a stock for this category of coffee the top face map. So when you say top face map, does that mean D well, how about I just tell you what all the symposium maps are at the same time? So let's see. If you have You would have alpha that goes from square brackets m to square brackets n in delta. Then you get a map from SMC to SMC, and it's given by on objects you'll have a diagram zero to A01. 0 to A01 to A02N. I'll just do the first two rows. 02. I could also answer by saying it's the same as in the case of exact categories. Instead of writing out the whole picture, I'll just say it's the same as in Zec categories. You have diagrams with the same shape, and you either delete rows or columns in the same way as for exactly. I should say that an example of a category with this property is the category of finite. With its properties, the category of finite basic complexes. Super quick question. Is this on the archive if you wanted to? It's not her on the archive. Just a quick follow-up. So you said that for base CW complexes that you have this condition. Do you know if that's true if you replace like a point with a space X? So now you're looking at retractive spaces. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what to map. Okay, I'll I'll I'll finish this version of the answer. So suppose you have the map alpha from square brackets M to square brackets N. This induces the map from SNC to SMC, and I'm going to say what it looks like. So suppose we have this object of SNC. I'm just putting the first two rows. Then what does this object get sent to? gets sent to, well it gets sent to 0 to A sub alpha of 0 alpha alpha of 1 or vibration to A sub alpha 0 alpha of 2 and so on until A sub alpha of 0 alpha of N to A sub A sub of 0. This is the last point. Alpha of 1, alpha 2, and so on. And so you just kind of forget anything that doesn't have subscripts of the form alpha, i, alpha, j. This will go. Oh, sorry, this should be m. Sorry. So, one to a select alpha of one alpha of them. A complex number, you called it D. You seem to have in mind some description of CW complexes, say, occurring inside of D. Is there a good description of what you get? Not very quick. It's complicated to index them, but they look like attaching a bunch of weird different services to each other. I think we were yasked. Thank you. Oh! I need to say, I just really needed to say. Sorry. Though. So you just say it in words. Yeah, so you have all the ingredients. Yeah, so I've been saying something is left to signal if all the two signal maps corresponding to polygonal decompositions, where there's a single diagonal from zero to 80 vertex, and that's it. Those are two single or unique equivalences. And I've been saying something is right to two siegel. If polygonal decompositions where there's a single diagonal going from the last vertex to some other vertex, if the two signal maps associated to those are weak equivalences, I would have written. To those are the equivalents of seven by decision mark. And that definitely implies upper and lower, respectively. And I suspect from talking to Philip Hackney, Julie after Philip's talk, that that's probably the same thing, but I'm not sure yet. Okay. It's the same. It's the same thing. What's next speaker again? Okay, we have a short break until 1.45, so do whatever you do in short breaks.
