quantum information processing with um mostly multi-qubit systems. Uh but this talk is more about sort of other ways to to develop quantum computing and more generally even quantum just technologies in other platforms. You may familiar be familiar with continuous variable systems or colloquially called harmonic oscillators where the degrees of freedom, position, momentum are continuous as opposed to Z2 valued, like they are in the qubit. Like they are in the qubit world. And this comes with its own features and bugs, and it's basically something we kind of have to use because we use optical fibers and free space communication to communicate information. So this talk is more about kind of stepping back, not necessarily focused on quantum computing, but just thinking about other types of platforms and looking at what stages of development they're in. And you may be surprised, as I was. Be surprised, as I was, when I started looking into this, that different platforms are really, some of them are extremely well developed, like the qubit one and the harmonic oscillator one as well. And others actually are completely in their infancy. And that's what makes this kind of exciting, because to me, with molecules, we're kind of in the 1920s, like we were with the harmonic oscillator when people were formulating these states in Fourier transforms and things like that. So, and there's also nice many-body examples of this in physics, where basically any quantum platform that you use for any technology has some notion of duality between something and something. Usually it's position and momentum, right? Any sort of application or algorithm uses this notion under sort of many layers deep, but it's still there. You start with, I'll show you the next slide. And sort of going back to the point I made about. Going back to the point I made about some spaces being in their infancy, this position of momentum, the duality, has not yet really been developed in molecular state spaces. And that's what we're going to do. It's been basically developed halfway. There's been lots of development for momentum states. The momentum state picture of molecules has been very well established for over 70 years, but the position states, you know, the actual position rotational states that I'm depicting now, have not really been developed. Have not really been developed for many, many different molecules. Yeah, I'm just confused about the setup. Because, like, position and momentum, like if we have like a scattering scenario, you would call the momentum state like a scattering state or something. I'm just confused about the what is the generalized you said it's very well established. Oh, um angular momentum. Oh, angular momentum. Yeah. So let's assume the c the center of mass is fixed. So let's assume the center of mass is fixed, so we don't deal with translational degrees of freedom. And then I'll show you the other assumptions. The Hamiltonian is, so why has the why? Maybe I'll explain why this is the case. Why there's such a deep asymmetry. So because the intrinsic, so any of these systems has some intrinsic Hamiltonian, right? This is x squared plus p squared. Well, it turns out this is just p squared, where p is angular, so L squared. So eigenstates of the canonical, you know, rigid body Hamiltonian. Canonical rigid body Hamiltonian are momentum states. And when you're studying Hamiltonians, as you do in chemistry and molecular physics, you don't think about changing that. You want to figure out what the Hamiltonian is. And to do that, you work in the momentum basis because that's the basis in which it's basically diagonal. And so there's been, you know, so there's no reason to quit that basis. But quantum information processing and quantum mechanics is more than that. There's this whole other Is more than that. There's this whole other way of interpreting things. And there's like an aphouria transform that goes in between all of these, right? So that's what the point of this talk is. So besides maybe from the mathematical or fundamental, in my opinion, point of view, there are actually more practical reasons to study position states of molecules. Namely, you can already make them, and you have been able to make them for about 20 years. If you shine a really strong electric field, If you shine a really strong electric field, that'll orient the molecules in the direction of the field if they have a dipole. So there you go, you made a position state. Local, right. And even more recently, there's been lots of progress in cooling and trapping of molecules, diatomic and polyatomic. And so it's not difficult to imagine the rotational degrees of freedom starting to be relevant there. And especially if we approach this problem with the point of view of not that there's this. Problem with the point of view of not that there's this intrinsic Baked in Hamiltonian, but from the quantum information and quantum control point of view, where, well, whatever it is, we're going to control and do new things and make it behave in a different way than it intrinsically was supposed to. So, from that point of view, we want to look at the entire phase space, and that's what we do. So, just to kind of reiterate this a little bit more technically, I view sort of quantum technology as being built from the ground up. Technology is being built from the ground up. And at the bottom, absolute bottom, is the state space. You have to show what the Hilbert space is. And there's two kinds of states in phase space. Realizing this duality, that's this all important thing that I was saying. Then after you define your phase space, which is kind of these two, the domains of these two types of states, you have operations on them, and the operations then will become ingredients in protocols for. Come ingredients in protocols for, you name it, information processing, sensing, metrology, what have you. And there's basically been three kind of canonical quantum state spaces here that I'm listing, two that you're very familiar with, and one maybe not as much. The difference here is that this is now a particle in a ring, so these are position states whose label is an angle. And this is starting to also be. And this is starting to also become realizable. It's a little late to the party because for some reason, practically, it's harder to realize this third system. But from the point of view of the theory, it's not too different from these other three, and we've been developing some of them, like, for example, looking more in depth into the Clifford group of the rotor. Yeah. Sorry, what's the Hilbert space for the planar rotor? L2 of U1. Thanks. I should have just said that for this audience, but yeah. You can think of it as a you can think of like the Clifford group as a subgroup of these transformations that maintain periodicity of functions in Hawaii. That's how you can get the root of Clifford group. Okay, now let's turn our attention to molecules. And in this, for these state spaces, there's many, many of them, and I'll show you. But the ones that have been understood from both the momentum and the position. From both the momentum and the position perspective, are these two. So, one here is the position states of a pen, of a heteronuclear diatomic, more technically, but it's that thing. These are labeled by points on a sphere, which, as you can probably see. And if you do the Fourier, this is L2 of S2. If you do the Fourier transform, you get a total angular momentum and how this works. And its z-axis projection. And more generally, you have an asymmetric. So, this thing has a symmetry. It has a symmetry of rotations around its principal axis. But if you have an asymmetric rigid body, no rotation that you apply to the body will leave the body alone. Every rotation will take it to a distinct orientation. And therefore, you need all rotations to label all distinct orientations of the body. This is L2 of SO3. And it has two indices here: projection onto the so both the body and your lab defined coordinate systems, and the orientation of the molecule is in one-to-one correspondence with the proper rotation that you apply to the lab frame to go into the molecule frame. So it's the relative orientation of the molecule frame with respect to the lab frame. Molecule frame with respect to the lab frame. And these indices are projections of the total angular momentum of the molecule into the lab and the body frame. You can also get this by thinking about Peter Weil for SO3, if you want to be a mathematician. But there's deep physical meaning to all of these mathematical terms here as well. So these two spaces have been, up to here, kind of studied. Is studied, and there's only kind of beginnings of a Pauli group and no notion of a Clifford group at this point for these spaces. So we are going to go down this route, we're going to go over. We're going to consider molecules with symmetries. But is there any reason to believe there should be a Clifford for this? No. Because in the rotor it's smaller than the Gaussian one. And it might get smaller and smaller. That's my guess as well. I just we before we have a Pauli group it's hard to think of a flipper group. A Pali group, it's hard to think of a quiver. That's all. Why should we? I mean, one reason to care about the Clipper group is that it's like an n-qubit quantum set of quantum transformations that are efficiently classic consumable. Whereas in your setting, the Cooker group would be like a much smaller thing. Well, we figure it out for one and then we scale it. I guess that's what I'm asking. So is there like if we have one molecule and the one molecule, is there an n-molecule group? I don't know. That's the point. First, figure out the... No, that's the point. First, figure out the Pauli group on one molecule, then do that for N, and then do the Clifford group for one, then do the one for N. This is all ahead of its time. Is it an open question whether or not it makes sense to do that? Or do you know that it would work? You just have a more type of detail. It makes sense to do what specifically? To define an N molecule Clifford group. It would be nice if it existed, sure. And if we can define a one-molecule Clifford group, I'm sure we can define an N-molecule Clifford group. But before defining a Pali group, I can't say anything about it. For defining a poly group, I can't say anything about what the clipper would be. Yeah. Yeah, what is a polygroup? So, yeah, no, that's a good question. Because in here, there's a way to do it, and it's not even a group. But it's, to me, it's the operators that shift you locally in the position space. That's your logical X operator. And there's operators that shift you in momentum space, so change the J index. And these operators, in the way I did. And these operators, in the way I did it in an earlier paper, they're non-unitary. However, my student Eric Kubishta was thinking about how to do this in a different way that's unitary. So there's kind of potentially more than one way to go. Right, so but we're going to go this way. These are all interesting questions. I'm also interested in this, but this is, again, like I said, in its infancy. Let's first cover the first two lines, okay? And let's go to molecules with symmetries. So as I told you, an asymmetric rigid body requires all of SO3 to span. To be to span its configuration space, all of its orientations. But if you have a symmetry, then some SO3 rotations don't map it to anything other than back to itself, and you don't need those to label that. And when you do that, when you figure out what labels you need to label this guy, you have to quotient the symmetry group, SO3, by the symmetry group. And when you do that, for the case of the diatomic, you have SO3 mod U1, which is the true story. The truth chair. Right? More generally, molecules like this fullerene can have other symmetry groups or point groups of discrete groups. And to figure out their state space, you have to quotient the SO3 group by the symmetry group of the molecule. And the other quotients have not really been studied in depth too much. The even more interesting thing, what we cover, is when you add. Interesting thing what we cover is when you add identical nuclei with spin to the molecule. So in that case, there's a non-trivial interplay of spin and spin statistics, or sorry, of symmetry and spin statistics. When you apply a symmetry transformation to the molecule that moves it, but gets back to the same molecule as before, you have a permutation of spins occurring on the nuclear spin factor. And when you do that, you have to take into account that there has to be some particular phase, plus or minus one bosonic or fermion. Phase, plus or minus one bosonic or fermionic phase coming up after you do this symmetry rotation. So symmetries gain access and gain an action onto the permutation, the factors of the spin space in a permutation representation. And this upgrades this kind of basic classical rigid body analysis to a kind of a quantum one. And the main result of this paper was finishing basically both of these columns. And okay, so here you have, you know, what have you, your molecular applications. It's a bit early to talk about using the full state space for these applications, but if there's any guideline from the oscillator space, there are indeed potentially many different ways you can use the entire space for information processing or what have you. Recognize something. Um for example in these things, I mean can I also have like an efficient readout of these things? I mean it's not discrete, right? I mean like if I want to measure the position, this is like a thing I can do. In the oscillator you can, it's called Homodyne detection. You can actually measure position or momentum or any rotation of between the two. Yeah, yeah. So and and dealing with continuous numbers is, you know, I mean, you're not going to be measuring it to infinite precision. There's discretized versions of them. Precision, there's discretized versions of them, and mathematically it's well formalized, and practically it also exists. For these cases, it's much more of an open problem. So we classify molecules into basically kind of the three cases you saw there, but we do so first by making an assumption. So molecules have many, many degrees of freedom. They have electron orbital degrees of freedom, electron spin degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom, electron spin degrees of freedom, vibrational degrees of freedom, translational, rotational, and nuclear spin degrees of freedom. So, everything except the rotational, the nuclear spin, we put over here, and we say we assume it transforms trivially under rotations. So, there's a plus one anytime you apply a rotation. And the reason we don't just study rotational is because of the reason I mentioned you have a non-trivial interplay of rotations and nuclear spin because of the spin statistics. Because of the spin statistics requirement after symmetry transformations. So you have to include nuclear spin into this rotational thing. Otherwise, I would be giving this talk about a year earlier because it would have been a lot less difficult. And we classify molecules into three cases. So one is this asymmetric case that was in the second column in the previous slide. It's basically a classical rigid body that's asymmetrical. And engineers study this quite a bit, especially if you're flying. It matters whether. You're flying, it matters whether which orientation you're in when you fly. And the same perspective goes for molecules that are asymmetric in this way. If you add symmetry but don't have any nuclear spin statistics to care about, then you're in this sector where you have a rotationally symmetric molecule. And these also have classical analogs to them. The classical analog, of course, will have the same symmetry as the molecule itself. So this. So this heteronuclear will be a pen, homonuclear, there's no spin on the sulfurs, will be a dumbbell, and a fuller ring will be a soccer ball. And this is again classical kind of rigid body physics. Not much interesting things happening there, but worth writing down. The crazy stuff happens when you actually have little rigid bodies but with little spins attached to them that also have symmetry. So for example, here, hydrogen, the one we're going to study in this talk. Here, hydrogen, the one we're going to study in this talk, has a symmetry and also has symmetry operations permuting identical spinful nuclei. And there's many more molecules like this. If you, for example, dope or you construct a fullerene out of isotopes of carbon-13, which does have spin, you get this completely different beast than this one, with many, many different features that this one doesn't have. So, we're going to do the 2D version of this for the talk. And in the 2D, because there's a lot of richness already in the 2D case, that'll demonstrate one of the effects, will demonstrate the classification and one of the effects that we observe. The three classes for molecules that have C2 symmetry, so let's assume they're in the plane and you can just move them around like this. And there's basically no symmetry, there's a C2 or Z2 symmetry. I'm going to use chemistry names. Symmetry. I'm going to use chemics three names, C2. And there's two types where you have a rotationally symmetric molecule, so there's no spin, and then a molecule where the symmetry rotations also permute spinful nuclei, namely the old word from 100 years ago is called parotational symmetry, permutation rotation. And let's figure out what their state space is. In the case of the heteronuclear diatomic, it's the same as Diatomic, it's the same as the particle on a ring that I showed you before. Position states are labeled by an angle, so the thing is on a circle. And momentum states are just any kind of integer whose sign is just depicting which direction you're locating, clockwise or counterclockwise. And now we're going to do the other two. If we want to figure out what this state space is, we just have to remember that this thing has a symmetry, and the symmetry is a pi rotation. Symmetry is a pi rotation around the z-axis, and this pi rotation around the z-axis has to leave the molecule invariant. And if we do that, we can then determine our state space by just applying this constraint to the states of this underlying state space of the asymmetric case. The symmetric case will be a subspace of the asymmetric case, and because of the way this rotation is written, you can easily show that the states that are invariant are only those of even n. That are invariant are only those of even any element of j. Now, and if you look at this in the position picture, it turns out that if you do the Fourier transform, the resulting position states of this molecule are none other than the position states of the asymmetric molecule superposed with their symmetric counterparts. And phi now will go from 0 to pi because either way you think about it, you know, this thing, the configuration space only goes from 0 to pi. Okay, what about the third case when you have nuclei? Well, when you have nuclei going into the picture, as I mentioned, rotations become permutation rotations or pair rotations, where now they're also acting on the nuclear spin factor, namely swapping the two nuclear spins. So not only positions are swapped, but also the spins. And because this molecule is fermionic, so the nuclei are fermions, the required spin statistics phase is a minus one. Spin statistics phase is a minus one. Had they been bosons in the case of deuterium, the required spin statistics phase would be plus one. It doesn't really matter if it's plus or minus one. What matters is that there's an extra action on the group, and so you have to include the nuclear spin factors into the analysis. So there's two ways to figure out, to determine, to, sorry, there's two ways to define the subspace of states that satisfy this condition. One is called ortho. This condition. One is called orthohydrogen, the other is called parahydrogen. Who's heard of this? And I'll go through it. So basically, you have to have a sign that comes out when you act with this thing, and the sign can either come from the rotations or from the nuclei. One of them gives you para, one of them gives you ortho. In the para case, the momentum states are just the same even momentum states that you had for the dumbbell. So these give you a plus sign when you act with this thing. Give you a plus sign when you act with this thing. So the minus sign has to come from the nuclear part. And the nuclear part is an anti-symmetric or singlet state such that when you apply this swap, it spits out a minus. So the para species of hydrogen is just none other than a dumbbell with a little anti-symmetric spin attached to it. However, in the other case, the minus sign will come from the angular momentum. So this requires the momentum to be odd. The momentum to be odd. This is not something you can obtain in any classical rigid body. The spin statistics and symmetry combination imposes or allows you to have different types of states here that you would not have in the classical situation. And since the nuclei now has to have a plus sign, it can be in any one of the three triplet states of the two nuclei. So even this trivial example contains something that's fairly exotic if you're coming from the rigid body perspective. If you're coming from the rigid body perspective, as I mentioned, position states for the para species are superposed symmetry-related states of the original non-symmetric case. And you can do the same type of Fourier transform on this space, and you get another superposition, which is just the minus superposition between the two of those spaces. If you write this out in terms of positions, you'll see this happen. Okay, so just to recap. Okay, so just to recap, the non-symmetric case is just a particle in a circle, normal planar rotor, no big deal. The dumbbell is now labeled from 0 to pi and consists of this. However, the 0 to pi space is just the circle mod C2, which is again still a circle. And so you can still think of this as a circle with a different labeling. Circle with a different labeling and a different set of position and a different set of momentum states, right? Even versus all or these superpositions versus these. And then the third case, when you look at orthohydrogen, again, you're still a circle, but again, it's a different space. The position superpositions that you use to define the position states of this circle are the minus superpositions of these states. Okay? So that's kind of the classification for the 2D case. That's kind of the classification for the 2D case. Now, what do we see that's interesting about this? Well, even though the configuration spaces are all the same, the state spaces are different and they transform differently under a different type of rotation. This is where the connection to fault tolerance comes in. So, let's look at how a different type of rotation acts on the state space. So, we previously had We previously had to look at, to define the state space, we had to look at pair rotations, namely things that acted in a composite way on the rotational and the nuclear state space. Now, let's just cook up a different type of rotation that just acts only on the rotational factor. This is actually a physical rotation. What it is, is kind of like a passive rotation from the point of view of the molecule. And it's more. More precisely, remember we started with two frames: the lab frame and the molecule frame. This rotation changes the lab frame, while the previous rotation that you used to define the molecule happens to the molecule frame. Okay, so there's two frames, two types of rotations. So physically, this is actually a meaningful operator, but mathematically, let's take a look at what happens when you apply this operator. There's no longer a swap action, and when you apply this to the even states, you get a plus, and when you apply this to the odd states, you get a plus plus plus plus plus. And when you apply this to the odd states, you get a minus. The two species transform in a species-dependent way. Why is that? Well, you can look at it from the momentum, or you can look at it from the position picture. In the position picture, such a shift just shifts phi to phi plus phi, thereby exchanging these two states, and spitting out a minus here, and spinning plus here, and spitting out a minus here when exchanging discharge in these two states. And this is because of the different nature of these different state spaces. These different state spaces. More precisely, this is a symmetry operation on the molecule. It leaves the molecule invariant. And it's represented here after it does so as a plus. And here it's represented as a minus. And so you can identify the effect of this symmetry operation on the molecule with how it's represented, with one of the representations of the symmetry group that differs depending on. That differs depending on which species you look at. If you look at the pair of species, the symmetry group, which is just C2 or C2, is represented trivially. The identity operation obviously doesn't do anything, and the only non-trivial operation gives you a plus. However, if you look at the ortho species, the identity operation is again trivially represented, but the generator is represented as a minus. And so graphically, you still have... So, if you look at how you basically can think of the effect of this operation as a path in the position state space, so namely going around the circle. And when you look at that, you can see what happens when you get back. In the case of no rigid body symmetry, there's no symmetry to begin with, and so you don't have anything. You just go around 2π, and you come back to the same thing, nothing there. If you do this to a dumbbell, because we had positive superpositions. Because we had positive superpositions, we have a symmetry that we can apply, namely going from 0 to pi, we get nothing again. But in the parotational case, when we apply, in the ortho case, when we apply a symmetry rotation to go from 0 to pi, we get a minus 1. This is a topological baryophase. You can also think of it as a monogramy because it's coming from redefining. Well, yeah, I can explain that, but you can think of this as. You can think of this as a topological baryphase whose value depends only on the topology of the space, namely that you went around the hole, and not on the fine details of the path that you used to get there. Mathematically, these three different types of circles form different induced representations. You can think of these as induced representations, namely of a particle in a circle, namely the particle at each point on the circle. At each point on the circle carries with it a little internal degree of freedom that defines how the particle transforms under closed non-contractible paths in its configuration space. Here, the configuration space is a circle. The closed non-contractible paths are just going around the circle. And the little induced represent, the little, you can call it a fiber or a pseudo-spin will tell you, will govern how, will transform somehow under closed non-contracting. Somehow, under closed non-contractible paths, in a way that's determined by some irreducible representation of the symmetry group. So, induced representations are labeled by the full group of rotations that you have, the symmetry group that the molecule has, and the inducing irreducible representation, or era. When you have just a classical rigid body, the inducing representation is always trivial. If I pretend this is a I pretend this is a dumbbell. If I flip it like this, I don't have a minus one flying out. It's trivial. There's no baryphate. However, because of the combinations in statistics and symmetry, you have the presence of these non-trivial induced representations where you do have a topological baryophase. For example, here, the inducing EREP is the sine ERAP of Z2, and you have a different induced representation here. So you can keep going with this for the 2D case. And you can do this for all the different symmetry groups of 2D molecules, which just happen to be subgroups of SO2, because that's the full loop that you can play with. And the only subgroups of SO2 are just Zn or Cn. We already showed the case of C2, but more generally, irreducible representations are just roots of unity, so whatever. So, whatever inducing UREP that you pick, you're going to get some root of unity here. Now, there's already something interesting here because even for the case of boron trifluoride, you get a phase that's not a minus one or a plus one. So you get something that's kind of the same as a topological phase arising from braiding anions, quasi-particles that are not bosons and fermions. Now, we're not, you know, we don't have the same level of topological protection in the sense. Protection in the sense of the anions, but this phase is the same type of topological phase or monogramy that you get when you study how anions are graded. And already in 2D with C3 symmetric molecules, you get something that's not a bosonic or a fermion of phase. So that's the 2D case. And things start to go pretty wild in the 3D case, which is the main result. The 3D case, which is the main result. Turns out the same kind of stuff happens. The same rules that I mentioned apply. You have some symmetry requirements, you have different types of species, each species corresponds to an induced representation. And the induced representations now are of a non-abelian group, namely the group of rotations in three dimensions. So going from two dimensions to three dimensions, the same recipe holds, but you're going to see different features happen because these spaces are much more. Happen because these spaces are much more exotic. So let's look at the differences here from the 2D to 3D case. In 2D, I mentioned the only subgroups are just the CN, ZN subgroups. But in 3D, because this group is non-abelian, there are interesting, there's dihedral non-abelian subgroups, and then there's the exceptional cases, tetrahedral, octahedral, and costahedral. And there's also the continuous ones, SO2 and O2. Continuous ones, SO2 and O2. Because the group is not abelian, you not only have scalar or one-dimensional irreps, you also have vector irreps, namely, you know, d-dimensional irreps. And this makes things quite interesting because the position state now, I told you it always had a little pseudo-spin at each point in position space. Now, this pseudo-spin gains. Now, this pseudo-spin gains a dimension degree of freedom. It's not just a one-dimensional thing. And so each position state of this seemingly classical rigid body-like object has inside it a delocalized fiber degree of freedom that will transform under symmetry rotations according to the inducing irreducible representation, which I call here gamma rod. Okay, so, right. Right. The momentum states, you can also work out. You can work out a Fourier transform. And the momentum states here just one of these J's, but modulo n symmetry. And then here you gain some more indices that I can get into if you want. But anyway, this part has been known in chemistry literature for over 70 years. And when we formulate this, we match on the momentum side exactly what they've been doing before. Could I ask what is the sort of challenge in identifying what would be a poly group? Like, because the Pali X groups are just the rotations, the lab-based rotations. It comes naturally from Peter Weil, roughly. The Pali Zs question. But yeah. The complication comes from there's two indices labeling positions, a continuous. Indices labeling positions, a continuous one, and at each continuous point, there's this weird pseudo-spin degree of freedom. So, how z-type, what functions you define on that space and how they transform is something that's actually still, I haven't quite figured out. Okay, so now that you have spaces with fibers that have a dimension to them, you can transform under symmetry rotations in a way that now doesn't just give you a phase. This is the connection to fault-tolerant gates. To fault-tolerant gates. So there was a paper by Lucy and Daniel studying fault-tolerant gates from the point of view of this monogramy approach. Thinking of fault-tolerant gates by embedding them into some continuum of parameter space and showing that when you apply a fault-tolerant gate, you're doing the same as inducing a monogramy that occurs after a closed non-contractable path. The same thing can happen, of course, in the annual literature, and that's much more developed. Literature that's much been much more developed in that literature as well. And we see it in molecules. So if you take a molecule with a non-abelian symmetry group, tetrahedral here in the case of methane, you apply a lab-based rotation on, say, this position state, this is some baseline position state, with the fiber being in some state mu. You go into this state, this g mu, with the rotation being g. And now, if you assume g is a symmetry rotation. Assume g is a symmetry rotation, you know that this state must be somehow in the same position state as the original state because it was a symmetry rotation. You can think of this e as being 0 and g being as 2 pi. Go around the circle. You have to now take the 2 pi state and re-identify it with the 0 state because you're already using 0 for your label and not 2 pi. And when you do that here, in the non-abelian case, you have a compensating matrix operation on the internal fiber degree. On the internal fiber degree of freedom, when you express G in terms of E. And this matrix operation depends only on the coarse-grained topological features of the path and not on any fine-grained geometric details as you go along the path. So in this sense, you could think of it as like a topological or fault-tolerant operation. Okay, so I discussed with you the classification of molecular states that we did. Molecular states that we did based on symmetry and Smith statistics. When we did this, we identified the interesting feature of how these states transform under symmetry or lab-based rotations. Namely, they give you this interesting kind of operations that can be thought of as topological phases or topological bearing matrices. And then there's a third thing. There's one more effect that we found when we constructed these state spaces that I'm going to show you now. That I'm going to show you now. And this deals with going back to the nuclear factor a little bit. So, before, remember, I told you there's ortho and terohydrogen, and the nuclear factor has to be in some compensating state such that the full composite state space transforms in some way under symmetry rotations, under molecule-based rotations, the ones that have the swap. And all of these cases that I was mentioning also have that feature. We've only discussed the rotational side of it mostly, right? Side of it mostly, right? But there is also a nuclear state space also has to be in some particular ERAP, such that when the ERAPs are taken together, they can project down to the spin statistics ERAP that I call gamma-mole. So more formally, this condition that I mentioned all the way in the beginning for hydrogen is here in the more general way. So this is just a plus or minus one factor from the spin statistic. The spin statistics, so the spins of the nuclei, and this is a molecule-based pair rotation that also applies a permutation action on the spins. This is how you define your state space. And just to phrase the case of hydrogen back there, and a dumbbell, the dumbbell, the inducing URAP on the rotational side is trivial, and to get us, this should also be hydrogen, sorry. These both are hydrogen, just different species. Hydrogen, just different species. The inducing ERAP on the rotational side is trivial, so to get a sine ERAP, because the spins are fermionic, you have to have a singlet state in the ERAP, and vice versa. You have a triplet state here. Right. So when the ERAPs are abelian, this is a scalar, this is a scalar, and these two just form a product, and they equal the resulting spin statistics ERAP form. Spin statistics EREP. When you fuse abelian representations, they just multiply. However, remember, we're dealing with non-abelian ERAPs because we deal with SO3 subgroups, and these can be vectored or multi-dimensional ERAPs. In that case, this resulting representation is a tensor product of these two ERAPs, is a matrix. But this thing is just a scalar. So what you do, what the chemists do, is you take this. is you take this representation and you project it down to the ERAP that is this gamma mole. So this presents a requirement or a condition on triples of EREPs. So basically identifying all the species of a given molecule corresponds to picking for a given gamma mole that the molecule transforms under, this corresponds to picking pairs of EREPs of the symmetry group such that Ereps of the symmetry group, such that when you fuse the pairs, you can project down to the gamma mole species, or gamma mole V rep. And so my student painstakingly identified all the different triples, a table, and right, so now we have them all at our disposal and this is what happens. So the case when the dimension, so we see two things and we don't know why. One is that the dimension, whenever this is true, that condition, Whenever this is true, that condition, the dimension of the gamma rod, the rotational one, and the nuclear one are the same. They don't have to be the same URAP, but they're the same dimension. And the dimension here, this letter D, is in this column. And you notice that there are cases where the two EREPs are non-abelian, so they're matrix-valued, where the dimension will now be the dimension of the EREP. The other thing we notice is that when you take this representation, you project it down to any copies of gamma mole, there always is one copy whenever this is true. There's either zero or one copy. And we don't know why that's the case, but it seems that that's how molecules are, I guess. So, because there's only one copy, this makes things a little bit easier to explain. Yeah, did somebody have a question? Okay. So this projection business, when you have multi-dimensional earps, gives you the second effect that we noticed that we thought was interesting, is namely intrinsic entanglement. How do you get this intrinsic entanglement? You get it from the projection. You get it from sure orthogonality. So let's review the full basis for a molecular species. It consists of the rotational factor transforming under lab-based rotations. Transforming under lab-based rotations in this interesting way, and it's labeled by these indices that I can get into if you want, but anyway, they're there. You've seen them before in earlier slides. Then, the nuclear factor is compensating whatever this EREP inducing EREP is. And there could be a multiplicity of the nuclear EREP, and that's labeled by this chi-index. And in chemistry, this is called the statistical weight. And you can think of this chi as, for the example, of the. Think of this chi as for the example of the case of the triplet. When hydrogen is in the triplet state, chi goes from one to three, indexing the three different triplet states. And then if you have vector irreps, gamma rot, gamma nuc, on the two sides, you have to take, there's extra space here that you have to restrict to only be in the gamma mole transforming subspace. And you can do that by doing basically Klutch-Gordon type. Basically, Klutch-Gordon type analysis or Shure orthogonality. And when you do that, you project this representation down to, like I said, only one copy of the gamma-mole URAP. And this one copy I can represent by this state. One state, the transformer has this gamma mole. And because this comes from the rotational factor, this comes from the nuclear factor, this state, and because of Klepschordon stuff, you can show that this state is maximally entangled with respect to the tensor. Entangled with respect to the tensor product consisting of the two rotational nuclear spin factors. And its Schmidt rank is equal to, namely its Schmidt rank is equal to the dimension of one of the factors. You know what Schmidt rank is. So what's interesting is that because we do this from the symmetry standpoint, we don't care about Hamiltonians. We step back and look at only the symmetry requirements and spin statistics requirements. Spin statistics requirements. This state cannot be removed by anything other than things that break the model. For example, consider superposing different states with different J, M, Kappa, and Chi. What happens? Well, this state is a third factor. It just tags along for the right. It's dressing each basis state, and you can't remove it. So any state in this species, in this molecular species defined by this pair of groups, a pair of irreps, has intrinsic entanglement whose Schmidt rank is low. Intrinsic entanglement, whose Schmidt rank is lower bounded by d. You can increase the entanglement, but you can't decrease it. And as I was saying, no Hamiltonians were harmed in the making of this. We don't care about the Hamiltonian because the analysis is, in some sense, taking one step before the Hamiltonian comes in. It's looking at the underlying state space, and then of course you can put your favorite Hamiltonian on there, but it won't change this story. The state space, no matter what basis you pick, will be intrinsically entangled. You pick will be intrinsically entangled in this set. So that's how many more. How much would you say that this is like an artifact of the model or the restrictions that you put in the beginning of this talk on how the states look like and what about the or where you put the other degrees of freedom of the molecule? Or is it like a um nature it's like this, or is it just like maybe two cores of a model to account for this? Two cores of a model to account for this. This same state space has been in chemistry textbooks since the 50s. So I'm inclined to say it's not something that's not relevant. I can tell you when it breaks. It breaks when you have other degrees of freedom transforming non-trivially under rotations. So for example, if you have a vibrational mode that distorts the molecule in a way that breaks the symmetry, this is no longer valid. If you have a vibrational mode that does... If you have a vibrational mode that doesn't distort the molecule, like a breathing mode, this is still fine. Another way it can break is if you have an excited state electronically. If your electron is going to a different orbital state that transforms now in some way under rotations, this isn't valid. And one of the open questions we leave is how to generalize this. In fact, I think when you open up these other degrees of freedom, you're going to have extra factors coming in from the EREPs that govern how those degrees of freedom transform, and things actually will become more exotic, not less. It's actually quite exciting. Less. It's actually quite exciting to try to work out if anybody's interested. Okay, anything else? Cool. So maybe one more thing. We see this entanglement, but then we were like, well, how rampant is this? Does this happen very, very rarely? How often do you see these cases when you have triples where the first two guys are these vector ERAMs? So we ran some kind of analysis that looks at this. The books of this. You can do this by taking all, so each molecule, okay, so each molecule has different species, right? Some of these species will come from scalar irreps, they're called separable, some of them will come from vector irreps, they're called entangled. What you can do is just count all of the different basis states of each species and divide by the number of all basis states of the molecule. And that gives you the relative fraction of intrinsically entangled states, namely the fraction of states of the molecule, or the fraction of the dimension of the space of the molecule. Dimension of the space of the molecule that consists of intrinsically entangled states. And using the Fourier transform, you can get this exactly in the J equals infinity case, or you can truncate it at fixed maximum angular momenta, and you can look at this relative fraction. And for example, if you look at these dihedral chains, you see that it can go up past 50%, maybe go even 84%. Another exotic one I can tell you is that Tell you is that carbon-13 fullerene C60, 13C60, because the icosahedral group is so special, it has one separable species and four entangled ones. And the separable one occupies only 2% of the state space, and the entangled ones occupy like 98%. So it's not generic in the sense that there's still a 2% chance they're separable, but almost all states of carbon-13 full arena are. It's a carbon-13 full arena intrinsically entangled. I want to acknowledge for this project, before I state the conclusions, Eric, who painstakingly understood the chemistry literature and before translating it to me, so we can kind of rephrase it and re-understand it in terms of quantum information literature. And Lee has an experimentalist who's, I have a slide backup slide. If you want, I can tell you how to. Backup slide, if you want, I can tell you how to kind of see some of these effects experimentally. And Misha for helping us understand this history of all this chemistry, molecular physics literature. So, to summarize, we classify and develop a position, momentum, duality for rotational state spaces of closed-shell molecules. I shouldn't say closed-shell, any molecules satisfying the conditions that I outlined before and mentioned to you in your answer. I think this is sort of could mark the. This is sort of could mark the beginning of the use of the entire molecular state space for any applications. Now, this is still a very difficult task because it involves manipulating or getting rid of or somehow mitigating the intrinsic Hamiltonian that's there. Molecular Hamiltonians are L squared and you have to deal with them in some way, shape, or form. And the hope is that you can use all the creative tools that we've developed in quantum info to try to do the same thing for molecules. The idea of the position states I mentioned, they're not normalizable by the way. States I mentioned, they're not normalizable by the way, but they're like direct delta orthonormal, just like position states of an oscillator. But you can define well-regulated approximate versions that have the same kind of intuition behind them. There's other interesting patterns we noticed that have been noticed in the chemistry literature, namely that certain species, so depending on which species you pick, different J states feature. And some species have no J equals zero. Some species have no j equals zero state. In fact, the trivial species is the only one that has the j equals zero state. The species of the trivial Ereps. And the other species don't. So if you force a molecule to be inside one of these, like ortho-opera species, it can't stop spinning. And I can't quite tell whether the relevance of this has been really kind of appreciated and identified and fully studied in chemistry or not, because I'm not as familiar with that side of the literature. But there have been other physicists actually trying to look at this and. Physicists actually trying to look at this and analyze it from a physics perspective. So I mentioned to you that each position state has this intrinsic fiber pseudo-spin, and this pseudo-spin transforms under, in a topological way or a fault-tolerant way, under lab-frame rotations. So this fiber, you may be inclined to think, well, is this a qubit? So does this give you a natural qubit embedded in the single position state? Previously, in the molecular code paper, there was. Previously, in the molecular code paper that I was working on, we had to devise codes that consist of superpositions of multiple position states for an asymmetric molecule. But it looks like when you add symmetry, you have something that happens at one position state. This is something that we are leaving for the next paper. But I'm pretty confident that because there's fault-tolerant gates you can do on this thing, I'm pretty confident that an error correction analysis will also show that there will be some intrinsic protection. That there will be some intrinsic protection against local noise as well. But this is something we haven't shown. In part, because I have problems trying to figure out what even the Z-type Pally operators are. And we mentioned this intrinsic entanglement. Again, this is not entanglement that comes from diagonalizing a Hamiltonian. Entanglement is ubiquitous. We all know this, and especially in chemistry, where many degrees of freedom entangle themselves in molecular eigenstates. This is a Hamiltonian-independent feature and is only induced by simulation. Independent feature and is only induced by symmetry and spin statistics. It's a different type of intrinsic entanglement that what you all are probably used to. And I think, and yeah, we're looking into how to detect it. And we're not really sure how to detect it short of exploding the molecule and looking at signatures of it. So, with that, I want to thank you for your attention. Some other questions? Some other questions from the audience? Thanks, it was really cool. One thing I didn't quite get is more of like toy speeding thing when you compare the two ways of rotating or walking. Are you saying we watched you on slide five? No, I follow the rest. Okay. Where? I wasn't entirely sure I got them right. So, like, you have two symmetries. Like, say on this line, right? This is the one with the swap. That's along this line, right? This is the one with the swap, and then you have the one without the swap. Yeah, you mentioned this, like, one is passive, and the one passive, something like that. Like, what does this symmetric action represent physically? So, the orientation of a rigid body is parametrized by the rotation you apply to the lab frame to get the molecule frame. The molecule frame is bolted to the molecule and rotates with the molecule, so you might as well think of this as the molecule. This thing is fixed, let's pretend, and the molecule are. Pretend. And the molecular orientation is just what you apply to this to get that. Okay? Now, you have two frames, so therefore you have two different ways. You can rotate this frame, you can rotate this frame. In 2D, for molecules that have no nuclei, the two things are the same, because you have the two frames, the group is abelian and the two frames are the same. However, even in 2D, when you have a molecule with nuclear spin, the analysis is such that the one that the Such that the spin statistics has to happen when you rotate the molecule frame. Because that's the active rotation when you actually exchange the nuclei. But I don't think that is if you rotate the lab frame, you could also be switching that model. Subtle. You're mapping the position of the nuclei to the position of the other nucleus. But you're not actively exchanging. Think of it like as looking upside down on the wall. In 2D, it's very, yeah, they're very similar. But in 3D, they're actually distinct operations even without nuclei. And in that case, mathematically, they're literally distinct operations. But the swap only goes to the active one. I struggled for months to understand why. My best answer is: if you attach a swap to both, then you have like no state space left. If you attach a swap to the one that's only actively If you attach a swap to the one that's only actively permuting and leave the one that's passively permuting alone, then you have the same state space that's been developed. This is how the formulas are built. Does this have to do with the fact that somehow these state spaces are in some sense fictitious because these fermions, they don't, you know, we want to think of them as different state tensor products and tensor product space, but in fact, they live in the anti-metric space models. Like this is some kind of tissue space thing you need to be part of it to actually have to access physical space anyway. Yes, the method does exactly that. It figures out what the state space is as a subspace of this larger asymmetric state space. Tell me to understand, to identify that subspace correctly, I need to rotate without the swap? No, with the swap. With the swap. Yeah, everything gets, both, the spins and the positions get exchanged. And in the case of the Positions get exchanged. And in the case of the blab frame, the positions are mapped into coordinates that happen to be the positions of the other nuclei. But that's just coincidence, like you could have mapped them to different coordinates. And the spins are not exchanged. So what experiment would give me something that I associate with elaboration? And what experiment would give me something else as you have? I literally talked to experimentalists about this two weeks ago, and we have the same question still. In fact, they actually want to do the experiment to figure out whether they're doing it. Want to do the experiment to figure out whether they're doing a lab or the molecule. This is all very subtle if you see this at first. So I'm sorry I don't have much better way to explain it other than the math works. Just to be clear, in a classical mechanic setup, this distinction between active and passive rotations would not show up. Is that correct? You said that. No, it will show up, just there won't be any nuclear swap stuff. There's still two frames in classical rigid bodies. So imagine you have a piece of a robot. Imagine you have a piece of a robot, and this is where they use this stuff. Like, you can rotate the thing itself, or you can rotate some other thing that's connected to it that'll inadvertently wind up rotating it. Those correspond to the two different frames being rotated. And because the group is non-abelian, mathematically the operators are different, even without nuclei. So it's giving something on like standardized volume rotation. Yes. The extra wrinkle is that one of them gains the swap, a swap action, where which where all this magic comes from. Where all this magic comes from. So I see we still have some questions, but maybe for the interest of time, we can thank Victor again and only time we'll have two consecutive talks. So we had a few Tuesday. Tuesday, this is already so far. This is already so far away. So, yeah, I mean, next talk here, Chris.
