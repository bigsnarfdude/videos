And it's about different notions. So, I will talk about different notions of freedoms for dynamical systems, and then I will relate it to the classification of sister algebra. But I will rather mainly talk about background motivation for this work rather than the main results or the book of it, because it's also a bit technical and also a bit tool system. So, the setting would be that. It would be that we have G counted a discrete, and X would be a compact metric space. And I will all the time assume that G is acting on X by homeomorphisms and the action is minimal. So non-closed invalid sets or every Or every orbit is dense. And now, given such a dynamical system, there are three different notions of freeness that we can consider. So, three notions of freeness. So, the first one is just that the system is free, namely, there are no Namely, there are no fixed points or every stabilizer subgroup is trivial of x and x. We can also consider the notion of essential freeness. So the system is called essentially free if If whenever you take an invariant probability measure for the system or a gaudic invariant measure, then for almost every point in X, the stabilizer is triggered. So namely, the measure of all points for which the stabilizer is triggered Is one for a three environment measure. And the last notion that I would want to consider is topological cleanness, which means that the open stabilizer of every point is trivial, so the open stabilizer It's just a collection of elements in G, so G and G, which fix not just a point X, but an open neighborhood around X, pointwise. So G fixes pointwise an open neighborhood of X. And this should be the trivial A X. Okay, so what is the relation between these notions? So freeness, of course, is the strongest. It implies everything. If the system is free, then it's essentially free and topologically free. But under minimality, you have that freeness implies essential freeness, and one can check that essential freeness implies topological freedom. Excuse me, what happens if there are no invariant measures? Okay, so that's a good point. Okay, so that's a good point. I'm always going to assume that there are unlikely measures. G will not necessarily be admittable, but I'm always going to assume that there is quite valid. So this is the inclusion that we have under ID. And the question is whether we have street includes. Whether we have strict inclusions. So, first of all, it's easy to show that it's easy to find a system which is essentially free and not free. So, an example for such a system is, for example, you take Z semi-direct product with Z naught Z with a natural action here, and let it act on the circle. On a circle where Z is acting by rational rotation and Z mod 2Z is just complex conjugation. So the action here is just conjugation followed by rational notation then. And this system is not free. For example, the points 1 and minus 1 are already fixed by the copy of Z mode 2Z, so it's not free, but it is essentially free because if you fix Free because if you fix a group element here and you look at the fixed points, you see that there are at most two fixed points for every element. And the invariant measures for these systems is uniquely ergodic, and the only invariant measure is the Rebecca measure. So since there are only two fixed points, they have measured regions in one. So this is not free, but essential. Okay. So now the difference between these notions is sometimes related to the structure of the group. For example, if G is abelian, if the group is abelian, then all these three notions coincide. Topological clearness will imply clearness, and then everything is just the same. But if you want to find To find a system that shows this strict inclusion, namely a topologically free system, which is not essential free. This is a bit more zero. And the definition by Matthew Joseph goes as follows. So let so let So the minimal system regime action g on x is called austerity. So the action is called a lostery if it's topologically free but not Essentially. And then a group will be called allosteric when it admits such an action. So for example, abihan groups are never going to be allosteric. Okay, so in order to find allosteric groups and allosteric actions, it's useful to consider the theory of uniform recurrent samples and the invaluable random samples. And I will try to And I will try to just 30 minutes. So consider the space for the subgroups of G equipped with the induced topology coming from the product space, rule 1 to G. So this is then with induced topology it becomes a closed up space, so it's going to be a compact, totally discompact space. And G is acting on it just by quantification. So G is acting on the space of subgroups by quantification. And now that I've so before I go on, let me say a new word. So we will note the map. So we know the map, the stabilizer map, step from X to this space of subgroups that maps every X to its stabilizer group. So this stabilizer map with the topology that we put here is not necessarily continuous, and the continuity points are exactly. And the continuity points are exactly the points where the stabilizer group is equal to the open stabilizer. This can be checked. And the domain of continuity is a density delta set inside of X. Okay. And now with these notions, so with these notations, one can consider invariant animals are both. Environment Arms are books produced by Adel Clar and GR. And URSs mean uniformly recurrence outputs. This is produced by Klaus and Price. Where an invariant group subgroup will be just an invariant probability measure for this system of G acting on the space of subgroups. So IRS, by definition, will be the invariant overhead. For the section of G acting on the space of subgroups. So, examples here, for example, the so-called trivial dials is just the Dirac measure at the trivial subgroup. Take the Dirac measure at the normal subgroup. This is also an IRS. Exact group, this is also an IRS because normal subgroups is going to be in volume computation. And a bit more subtle is if you take a subgroup HG, which is almost normal, namely it has a finite orbit under conjugation, then you can take sorry finite orbit. Then you can take the normalized measure. Measure of the demagos hose are examples of IRSs and motivated by this definition there is the definition of the URLs which is more recent which is A would be a closed minimal invariant subset for in sub so closed minimum or invariant subset for the system. And again, here you have that, for example. You have that, for example, the trivial subgroup is a trivial mass. You can take the senior correlation of the normal subgroup. Or if you have a subgroup with finite orbit under conjugation, you can just take the orbit of this subgroup. So in a way it generalizes the URS generalizes the notion of the normal sample. So in some cases you can describe IRSs of certain groups. Actually there are more results describing IRSs than results describing URSs for code groups. For example, one famous result by Stack and Zima describing Stack and Zima describing IRSs for SL3Z and showing that all embodic IRSs must be of this form. While for URSs, it's not known how they look for SF3s. So, another way to construct an IRS and a URS is yeah, if you start With an action with the PMP action of G on X, with Î¼ being a mu some involvement probability measure, then you can take the push forward of mu via the stabilizer map and get NIRS, get an invariant correct probability measure on this. Measure all these space of samples of change of samples of Gen This one is an IRS this one was this this is an IRS and it's called The stabilizer on the other side of this table, you can also associate a URS for dynamical systems. So if you start with an action of g on x. And then for the alpha, maybe I should also say denoted the IRS. So the IRS is associated with the action alpha and the dashboard. That's the stabilizer IRS. And here the stabilizer URS. The loaded OS alpha is defined to be, so the set of all stabilizers where you only look at points which belong to I normally x0 to the domain of continuity for the stabilizer model. Stabilizer mode. Okay, so X0 is the domain of continuity for the stabilizer map. You look on all the collection of these stabilizer groups and you take the closure inside sub G. And one can show that this is a closed invariant minimal subspace. This was shown by closed analytics as well. Okay, so why did I introduce this why did I introduce these notions and how do how they related to um to the notions of freeness? So it turns out that the system of G acting on X is essentially free and if and only if If and only if the stabilizer IRS IRS alpha mu is trivial for every mu invariant I'm going to measure. So it's a it's actually this is easy to see. Let me just Let me just write it down so that it's clear. So, this is IRS alpha mu being the dirac measure that the trivial subgroup just means that since this is the IRS, then this just means that the measure of the inverse image of the stabilizer at E is one. So, namely for the new So, namely, almost every point will have a trivial stabilizer. And this is exactly how we define essential freeness. A little bit more subtle to see is that the system is topologically free if and only if the stabilizer URS is free. Eastern, So now that we've translated in a way this notion of freeness to this concept of IRSs and neural asses, I'm saying that for a minimal system essentially Essential freedom implies topological freedom can be just written in this new language that then the stabilizer of this stabilizer For actually your body, this is now on the selling essential process. And then it follows that the system is topological free, as we have claimed before, by namely UOS alpha sometimes US state. Now that we Now we want to find atosteric actions, namely we want to ask in a way to what extent can you reverse this error? I mean, does topological fairness imply essential fairness and if not, how does it fail? Okay, so So the proposition also by Matthew Gays that if the standardizer in your base is trivial and yet for every for any fixed new body Then a destabilizer IRS with respect to mu is either trivial or has no atoms. So it's either trivial or atomous. So if it's not there for all So, if it's trivial for R mu, then this is somehow the case where topological files apply the central theorem and otherwise. So, I can warn you from this. It is that again under minimality, if you have a group for which have a group for which the space of subgroups so if you have a group with countably many subgroups each subg is g has countably many subgroups Yeah, then this is a foundation space, and any invariant boil that we measure on it must have an atom, right? Because it's a curved space. So this means that in this situation, G can never be allosteric. All of its All of its topologically free actions will also be essentially automatically. An example of G with countably many subgroups is, for example, every G is finitely generated group with polynomial growth, then one can show that it has only counted the many subgroups, and then And then it can never be almost a okay. So there are other examples of books which can never be allosteric, essentially because they, as here, they lack IRSs, not necessarily because they have countably many subjects. Because they have count with many subs, but just for other reasons. For example, more examples of books in John Devil Love Story. Um so um for example by starting Z1 again as we said before SL3Z all the algorithmic IRSs are atomic and therefore this condition here means that if the URS at the stabilizer URS is trivial then also the Is trivial, then also all stabilizer IRSs must be trivial. And therefore, in this case, SLCZL can never be austeric. So another example where there is a description of the IRSs and also all the algorithmic ones are atomic is by Jesse Pillerson and Vernstone. And also when we consider PS and K, where K is a countable thing. Okay, so these are some examples where you cannot have autostatic actions and excuse me, Shirley. Could you remind me what does X0 mean? Surely, could you remind me what does X0 mean? Yeah, that was just the domain of continuity for the stabilizer network. So, more concretely are just the points where the open stabilizer coincides with the stabilizer. So, now for books that are holosteric, so some examples of the allustrary groups which then admit Then I read many RSs. So three groups, okay. This was shown by a middle. And just another example, a non-reminible surface books. This was shown by So fundamental groups for closed services except for tools and for the climate model or okay and when the so when it was shown that these groups are allosteric, there was a a concrete action, concrete minimal action which was constructed um which was an allosteric action. Which was an autostatic action. And the actions here are that were constructed are also broken finite, so inverse limits of PMP actions on finite sets. And they are uniquely algorithmically. So afterwards, there was a question whether there exists at all There exists at all any whether there exists any anosteric groups which are amenable. So are there amenable anosteric groups? And this was open until quite recently. And the theorem of Mathieu Joseph From 2023 shows that there are indeed allosterical minimum groups. So the actions we construct are minimal or finite and therefore also nuclear chordic. Minimal for finite action. Minual profound interactions. So since these are profinite actions, the actions are on the control set. And the groups are looking like this. These are with products of z to the d with lambda, where lambda is finitely generated. Finally generated a V forward. So finally generated total three foldable. So the sweet product is so the company sends it to be tea. Direct sum over lambda and then semi-direct product is lambda where lambda acts just by translation. And later on, hitchwork and the international mood, I just reconstructed more examples. So I will not be going through. But motivated by its construction, we should start more. So let me now finally say why are we interested in such constructions from Cisternwarg perspective? So the conjecture Is that if you start with G, which is a state amino, when you let X to be again compact metric space, but you also ask that it's finite-dimensional, namely has finite covering dimension. Mentioned then, if the action, if you have an action of gene of X, which is minimal and a topologically rename it, the weakest notion of predance. Then the gross product is target one is a so-called classifiable, but meaning is determined by a set of invariants which consists of a k-theory, so the k-zero group with such an aura. Such aura, so let's say pathium and traces and a third map which connects between these between these. Okay, and the traces that we just mentioned are exactly the invariant bore probability measures for an X or probability measures on X or correspondence, rejected correspondence with the variable probability measures on X exactly when the action is essentially free. So you can think of them as invaluable only functions. So and we would like to understand when these C star drugs can be determined. Can be determined by K-theory traces and the pairing map. And the best. I didn't understand the last thing you were saying. Are you saying that if the action is topologically free but not essentially free, that there are say esoteric traces? Exactly. Yes. Yes. Traces that do not come from perfect trace. I think this can be found in the paper of Okay, so um So we would like to find, so the best would be to find a purely dynamical notion that would allow us to decide whether the sister algebra cross-product is indeed falling into this class of sister algebra that are classified by K3 traces. And the notion, the dynamical notion that is most used these days is by David Kirk. David Kerr on transparentness, gain a dynamical notion that allows us to show that this conjecture is then satisfied. So g acting on x will be called almost finite. I will not give the very precise definition, but just the idea. If so, if you have the, so you have the space. Have the space X, and you can find some open sets V1, V2, to VN inside of S. And you can also find some subsets of the group, finite subsets, S1 plus N. 1 plus ng finite subsets. And when we start translating these open sets by the finite subsets of G, right, so you start translating those, S2 acting only two, and finally Sn acting on Vn. Then you fill in all the space X, namely X. Phase X, namely X, will be the disjoint union of the translates of the PJs by the SJs. I also want to require these SJs, so there are some epsilons here that are missing, but these SJs should be essentially personal sets, they should become more and more invariant under the next action of the constraint. Of course, this is very strict because it means that the V j's are not only open but closed. Are not only open but closed. So, this definition makes sense when X is zero-dimensional, for example, the composite set, but it can be generalized for arbitrary compact spaces. So, the theorem then of the repair says that If G acting on X is minimal and almost finite, so two dynamical conditions, then the class product is so-called a fastifier. And can be determined by the FD vector basis. So, the question is: when can you check this dynamical condition and when is it satisfied? Whether it's actually helping us? Can I ask really quick, though, this is going through two's work to get the UCT? Yes, yes, because with this definition, it forces G to be amenable and then you get UCTAR. Yes, yes, this is about Q's result, yes. So if G is aminable or if the action is aminable on X, then uh dotomatically satisfied G is your point for it, right? Yes, exactly. So the SI should become more and more brown and have more concentration. Okay, so some examples where these almost finiteness could be verified so by Chair Malishtin. So, Karen Marishkin, they showed that if G is elementary amino, this is the smallest class of groups containing abelian groups, finite groups, and closed under natural operations. X now finite dimensional. Dimensional and the action is free, then you always get almost finiteness, so you always get this dynamical condition, and therefore versifiability of cross-product. And then so um let me mention just some of some of it, Donald Hovit and Sean. We are then generalizing. We are then generalizing it to finally generate the groups which some exponential growth. That's another class of examples. Again, under the assumption of freedoms, they can show almost finiteness. And another result is by care. For example, another scheme showing that if G is finitely generated, This polynomial growth, and x is finite-dimensional again, then freeness of reaction also implies being almost finite. So, therefore, qualifying almost finiteness for larger and larger classes of groups can be, but this is a subclass, so they can't be any almost there. Yeah, you're right. Yes, sorry. That's true. Sorry, what you were supposed to be the upgrade of. Right. So okay, and then yes, the upgrade of this was also the satisfying point. So what I'm going to do is, I think that What do I want to say? Now, in all these results, the assumption was that the action is free. But if you look on the definition of almost finiteness, it does not really require freedoms. You do need some kind of thinness because you want to move these shapes, these say open sets V one to Vn shapes in a way that you cover the whole space, but it does not necessarily imply clearness of the action. Imply freeness of the action, it only implies that the action is a essential. Can I ask? Did Kerr originally define it for free actions? Yes, so everything he did was under the assumption of freeness within score because that's true. Yes. So almost finess only implies essential clearness and not necessary and not necessary clearness. Necessary and not necessary for this. So, now finally, let me say what we have done. So, we extend the whole theory from the setting of three actions to the setting of essentially three actions so that we can cover, for example, in the case of groups with polynomial growth, we can show the result not just for, so not just under the assumption of free. Not just under the assumption of freeness, but under the assumption of central freeness. So that the action is almost finite, therefore guaranteeing justificability. And in the case of polynomial growth groups, remember that essential freeness is actually equivalent to topological freeness. So we actually sort of answer in general the conjecture, the sister conjecture. The sister conjecture for works with polynomial mode under the weakest notion of freedom-nary topological things. Now, this was a bit technical, but following essentially the ideas of Gavo and Kerr, very quickly. And the more interesting part was these examples of Joseph that are topologically free and not essentially free. So there are potential. So there are potential candidates for counterexamples for the transfer units of the quantum planets. And this also is posed in this paper. So the question was are geospatial numbers which are never almost finite because they are not essentially free. Section three A counter example is and we actually can show that now, so So we can, we develop ad hoc ad hoc book that takes these examples and shows that they are Z stable and therefore massifiable, but using quite different machinery than this machinery of almost finite peso tons. So at home methods Methods to show that intercepts examples are not counted examples, so R plus R and since it's done very specifically for these examples, it's still an important important An important question: whether this can be generalized and whether we can develop some dynamical condition which not only addresses essential three actions but addresses in general topological reactions that this dynamical condition then would allow us to verify a possibility. So this is still missing and this is what we hope can then be developed thinking about. All right, thank you very much for your attention. All right, thank you very much for your attention. So which regularity property do you show the included mention? So which regularity property do you put for these?
