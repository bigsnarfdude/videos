To talk to you about the symmetry of stable solutions of semilinar elliptic equations, please don't hesitate to interrupt me if you have any question. So, my framework is the following. Consider U a bounded stable solution. So, I will explain in a moment what stable means. So, u a bounded stable solution of this equation, minus Laplace of U equals F of U in a domain omega. In a domain omega with Neumann boundary conditions, which means that we assume that the outer normal derivative of u is zero across the boundary. So we assume basic regularity assumption that the domain is C3 and the non-linearity F is C1. And as a first remark, we notice that if Z is a root of F, then it is a solution of the above equation. But it is somehow. But it is somehow a trivial solution. And we ask the question about what about the existence of a stable non-constant solution, which I may call pattern in the SQL. What is the influence of the geometry of the domain on this question? And what kind of symmetry or classification results can we expect for a stable solution with this equation? So, first of all, let me define rapidly what I mean by. Rapidly, what I mean by stability. So, for u, a bounded solution of the equation, we set lambda naught a quantity which is the infimum of a certain operator, the integral of gradient v squared minus f prime of u v squared for some test function in h1 of l2 norm equal to 1. So I will explain why we set lambda 0, like lambda naught like that, but we define the stability of u. But we define the stability of u through the sign of this lambda naught. We will say that u is stable if and only if lambda naught is non-negative, and that u is stable non-degenerate if and only if lambda naught is strictly positive. This definition may seem a little bit awkward at first sight, but let me briefly justify it. Actually, the operator that is involved in the definition of lambda naught is nothing but the Hessian of energy at U. Of energy at you. So it's a second variation of energy. And taking the infimum like that amounts to say that lambda naught is the least eigenvalue of the HN operator, of this operator. It's a Rayleigh-Ritz formula. And so classically, we have that if lambda naught is strictly positive, it implies that u is a minimum of energy, which itself implies that lambda naught is non-negative. So we see that our definition recovers the That our definition recovers the classical definition of stability, but our definition is somehow more flexible and quantitative. And so let me motivate this problem. Why is it interesting to classify stable solution? If we consider the evolution operator, the evolution problem, and so now u depends also on t and satisfies dtu minus la plus of u equals f of u. If we consider this reaction diffusion equation, and if we know that u Equation and if we know that u converges in long time to some limiting function u infinity, then we know that u is stable. And so, classically, stable solutions are the only observable final states of an evolution process. And more precisely, in our context, the existence of non-constant stable solution means the possibility of a partial invasion. So, if you think of U as a population density. As a population density, for instance, a partial invasion is a situation where the population has invaded a part of the space, but not the whole domain. It has invaded a part of the domain omega, but not the whole domain. This is a partial invasion. And so the question that I considered here is very closely linked with the propagation of traveling wave in heterogeneous geometry. I refer, for instance, to the paper of Belistiki, Amel and Matano, who studied. Of Belistiki Amel and Matano, who studied the influence of an obstacle on the propagation of a traveling wave. And so, this question, yeah, can you clarify the statement? I mean, you are saying that if U converges to U infinity, then the limit is stable. I mean, even unstable equilibrium might have some stable manifold, right? So, I'm not sure I heard you. I'm not sure I heard you well, but stable in the definition, so it's linearly stable according to the definition I just gave before. So the solutions may converge to unstable equilibria. Some solution may converge to unstable equilibria. That's what you said. So here you are saying that if U converges to U infinity, then U infinity is stable. Yes. It's not always true. It's not always true, yeah. I think, I think you're right, of course. It's um, you know, for instance, you could take as initial value u infinity itself, yes, or so it's if it's a so but you mean but you still probably want to say that it's increasing or converges from below or something like that, yes, yes, okay. Sorry, sorry for this. Uh, okay, so it's not it's not exact. Okay, sorry about that. Sorry about that. Uh, thank you uh very much. Thank you very much for this comment. So, I just go on. So, this question of classification of stable solution has some implication in many fields of application. So, for instance, population dynamics, as I already mentioned, also model for phase transition of van der Waals can in Iliar, formation of biological patterns, and many more. And so, our starting point to try to Our starting point to try to classify a stable solution is a famous theorem proved independently by Kasten, Holland, and by Matano 40 years ago, which states that if the domain is convex and bounded, then stable solutions are constant. This is a very important theorem, and I would like to emphasize that there is no assumption on F, except that F is C1. Except that F is C1. So it's a really general fact. I would like also to mention another result by Matano, which is angular symmetry. If the domain has an angular symmetry, so does any stable solutions. And it implies in particular that if the domain is a torus or an analyst, then stable solutions are also constant. So the the same conclusion holds even though the the domain is not convex. The domain is not convex. So, at this stage, we might think that the convexity assumption in the Castanon-Matanot theorem is not really needed. However, it's more complicated. And in particular, Matano proposed a counterexample. He proved that there exists a stable non-constant solution if we choose the non-linearity to be of the b-stable type and if we choose the domain to have the shape of a dumbbell. So, typically, if we if the domain Typically, if the domain consists in two balls connected by a thin corridor. And so the natural question is: can we relax the assumption of the theorem of Casten, Holland, and Matanot? And unfortunately, in general, the answer is no. We cannot relax the assumption of this theorem. First, we cannot relax the stability assumption because cos X is an unstable solution. X is an unstable non-constant solution of this equation on the interval 0Ï€, which obviously is convex. Also, we cannot relax the assumption that the domain is bounded, because the hyperbolic tangent is a stable non-constant solution of minus u double prime equal u minus u to the power 3 in Rn. This is the Alen-Khan equation. So we cannot relax this assumption either. Assumption either. And last but not least, we cannot relax the convexity assumption. This is a little bit more intricate, but this is due to a famous result by Cohn and Stenberg. They prove that we can construct a stable non-constant solution if the nonlinearity is chosen like that. So it's a rescale Allenkan nonlinearity. And if the domain features a minimal surface. Features a minimal surface. So, what I mean by that is the following. So, we suppose that we can divide our domain in two subdomains such that the boundary between the two subdomains is a local minimizer of the perimeter functional. So, this is an illustration. This is okay, so S here separate the left and right part, and this is a local minimizer of the perimeter. A local minimizer of the perimeter functional. But actually, such a set, such a domain, can be made arbitrarily close to a convex domain. So it's shown here on the right picture. And so the result of Cohen and Sternberg implies that there exists stable non-constant solution in convex perturbed domain, which in addition are star-shaped and also of positive mean curvature. And also of positive mean curvature. So it really seems here that we are stuck because we cannot relax any of the assumptions of the theorem of Castenolon and Matano. Let me also mention that even the angular symmetry cannot be relaxed. Still, it's also an implication of Conan-Sternberg result because we can construct a stable non-constant solution in perturbed analysis, such as this one, because this set. This one, because this set features a minimal surface. So we are apparently stuck because none of this assumption can be relaxed in general. However, in all the above examples, if we look at them closely, we see that in each of them, F has to be large or U must be almost unstable. And so one may hope that there exists a trade-off, a relation. Hope that there exists a trade-off relation between the geometry of the domain, the stability of the solution, and the size of the non-linearity. So, our question, I make the question more precise, what kind of criterion can I find on the stability of the solution, the domain, and the nonlinearity to ensure that the solution U is constant? So, in the first part, I will consider the case of bounded domain. In the second part, I will study whether the I will study whether the result extends to the unbounded case. So, part one, bounded domains. What kind of criterion can I find to ensure that u is constant? So, let me just recall that the definition of stability, u is stable if and only if lambda naught is non-negative, lambda naught being defined as follows. Let me set gamma of x, the minimal curvature of the boundary of the domain. Of the domain. So, what I mean by that is in dimension two, gamma is the curvature of the domain, and in higher dimension, gamma is at each point the least principal curvature of the domain. And so, obviously, classically, we have that the domain is convex if and only if gamma is non-negative. This way, we can reformulate the theorem of Casten-Holland and Matanot. Like this, lambda naught non-negative, which stands for stability, and gamma non-negative, which stands for convexity, implies that you is constant. We propose the following results. Let's use a solution and define lambda gamma as follows. So it is defined similarly as lambda naught, but we add here an extra term which involves the curvature. So it's a boundary term, the integral over the boundary of the domain of gamma v squared. Of gamma v squared. So it's a boundary term that involves the curvature of the domain explicitly. And our result is that if lambda gamma is non-negative, then u is constant. And we see directly that actually the theorem of Casten, Holland, and Matano is a particular case of the above theorem, because lambda naught non-negative and gamma non-negative implies that lambda gamma is non-negative. Gamma is non-negative. And so somehow the assumption on the sign on lambda gamma combines the two assumptions of the theorem of Castinolan and Matano. And so this quantity lambda gamma encodes both the information on the stability of the solution and the geometry of the domain. And so it's more flexible and it allows, it has some consequences. The first consequence is that we can show that the theorem of Casten, Holon and Matano. That the theorem of Cassin, Holland, and Matanot is robust under small perturbation. So, this theorem is robust under small perturbation on lambda naught, omega, and f. So, what I mean by small perturbation is for the domains, the C2 modification of the boundary, and while keeping a C1 control on F. One may look for more explicit criterion to ensure that Q is constant. So, I recall the definition. So I recall the definition. So to do that, I recall the definition of gamma, the minimal curvature of the boundary. And I also define mu gamma. So it's an important, it plays a key role in the SQL. So it's the infimum of some functional. Actually, mu gamma, defined this way, is the first eigenvalue of what I call the Robin curvature Laplacian, which is the Laplace operator with Robin boundary condition, which are the outer normal derivative plus gamma, the curvature. Plus gamma, the minimal curvature, equals zero. So the boundary condition involves the curvature of the domain explicitly. And so this quantity is intrinsic to the domain, does not involve the nonlinearity or any solution of the equation, and it somehow quantifies convexity. And we propose the following results: if mu gamma is greater than soup of F prime, then all solutions are constant, even the instable. Are constant, even the instable solutions. And more generally, for any parameter a greater than one, we have the following relationship between the stability of the solution, the geometry of the domain, and the magnitude, the size of the nonlinearity. So, let me, by the way, let me just mention that we can also here recover the theorem of Castellan and Matano as a particular case if we take. Case if we take A to plus infinity, if we let A go to plus infinity. And so this is a criterion to ensure that a solution is constant. This is a quantitative criterion. The last question that I would like to address is if a non-constant solution exists, can I control the gradient? Can I control the gradient of non-constant solutions? And prove that somehow they do not, they are close to be constant. So I recall the definition of gamma and mu gamma. Of gamma and mu gamma. And we have the following results. Let u be a solution, possibly unstable. Then mu gamma times the integral of the gradient squared of the solution is less or equal than the integral of F squared. And this can be seen as an inverse PoincarÃ© inequality or a non-linear catchopoli inequality. Let me emphasize that it is universal. It is universal in the sense that the only constant here, the constant depends only on the geometry of the domain. It does not involve neither the solution or the nonlinearity. And incidentally, we deduce that from this inequality that mu gamma is less, is smaller than Cp is the best constant in PoincarÃ© inequality. So it relates these quantities to a famous geometric quantity of to a famous constant. To famous constant. And actually, the PoincarÃ© inequality plays a crucial role in the construction of pattern, especially in Matanos construction. Especially, this constant is typically very small in the Bell domains. And due to this inequality, so will be our inverse PoincarÃ© inequality. And I think so this echoes Matanos. A cos Matanos contra example. Let me finally remark that, in fact, this equality also holds for non-homogeneous equations when f depends explicitly on x. So it's more general inequality that we can infer here. So let me now consider the case of unbounded domains. So our question is to classify stable solutions in convex unbounded domains. And the literature And the literature considers this question mostly in a particular case, the particular case where the domain is the whole space Rn, and the nonlinearity is the Allen-Kahn nonlinearity, which has this shape here. It is of the B-stable type. Actually, for this particular example, there exists a stable non-constant solution, which is given by the hyperbolic tangent. So, we do not expect in this situation. This situation that any stable solution is constant. There exists such solutions. However, we notice that the solution u is 1D and monotonic, and moreover, that the nonlinearity is balanced. That is, the integral of F between its two stable roots, minus one and plus one, is zero. And so, the literature, there is a large literature devoted to this question. A large literature devoted to this question on this classification of stable solutions in Rn for the Allen-Khan equation. And the literature is organized around the famous conjecture of De Georgi, which states that the bounded solution of the Alenkan equation in Rn, which are monotone in one direction, are one-dimensional, at least in dimension less than eight. This conjecture has been proved to be true in dimension two by Gus Huber. In dimension two by Gousup and Gui, and dimension three by Ambrose and Cabre. It is still open in the intermediate dimension between four and eight, even though it has been proved to be true by Sevin under a slight additional assumption that you admits limits in infinity. On the other hand, Del Pino, Kovalchik, and Wei provide a contra example in dimension greater than nine. So this is the state of the arch of the conjecture, but Of the conjecture, but we don't see the stability assumption appear in this conjecture. However, it is classical that the assumption that the solution is monoton in one direction actually implies that the solution under consideration is stable. So we can reformulate the conjecture of the Georgi. We can formulate a variant of this conjecture by replacing the assumption on monotonicity by the assumption the weaker. The assumption, the weaker assumption of stability. So it goes like this: the bonded stable solution of the Alenkan equation are one-dimensional in dimension n less than seven. So since we so we have to assume a stronger assumption on the dimension here, we will see that it's indeed the case. So this variant of this conjecture has been proved to be true in dimension two by basically Caffaralli and Nirenberg, but it's still completely open for the intermediate data. Still completely open for the intermediate dimension between three and seven. On the other hand, a counterexample has been proposed by Paka and Wei for dimension greater than eight, proving that we really need to restrict the dimension here. And let me finally mention a last important result. In all dimensions, if u is stable, non-degenerate, then u is constant. It's the result of denser, which is important in this context. So all these results hold for when omega is the whole space and f is the Allen can nonlinearity. A natural question is: can we generalize somehow those results to the case where the domain is not Rn, but is a generic unbounded convex domain? So we propose the following results. So let omega be a convex, unbounded domain, and U be a bounded stable solution. Be a bonded stable solution. First, if u is stable non-degenerate, that is, lambda naught is strictly positive, then u is constant. This is true in any dimension for any convex domain. Secondly, if the domain is not a straight cylinder, that is, it cannot be written as R times a subdomain. And if the domain satisfies the following gross condition at infinity, saying that the volume of the domain Volume of the domain does not grow faster than r squared, then u is constant. And finally, if the domain is a straight cylinder, which satisfies the gross assumption H, then U is either constant or is one demonotonic and connects two stable roots of F between which F is balanced. So the first point of the theorem solves the case of stable non-degenerate solution. Stable non-degenerate solution, and the point two and three give a complete classification of stable solutions when the domain satisfies the gross assumption H. So these domains are obviously any domains in R2, domains that satisfies H, any domain in R2, but also domains in Rn, such as a cylinder whose cross-section grows not too rapidly, not too fast. And as an application, And as an application of this theorem, we can show asymptotic symmetry results. For example, if we assume that the domain is asymptotically convex, so think of a cylinder with varying cross-section, which converges somehow to a convex cylinder when x1 goes to plus infinity. In this context, any stable solution converges to a constant. And similarly, if And similarly, if the domain satisfies an asymptotic angular symmetry, so does any stable solution. So, now let me conclude. Let me first do a quick recap. So, in the first part of the talk, we focused on bounded domains. We proved that the theorem of Casten-Olan and Matano was robust under small perturbations. We also give quantitative criterion on the stability of the solution, the geometry of the solution. Of the solution, the geometry of the domain, and the non-linearity to ensure that a given solution is constant. For example, if Î¼ is greater than sup of F prime, then all solutions are constant. We also presented a nonlinear Clatchopol inequality, which said that the inverse Poincare inequality, which says that the L2 norm of the gradient is controlled by the L2 norm of F. In the second part, we consider. In the second part, we consider the case of unbounded domains, stable solutions in convex unbounded domains. So, first of all, non-degenerate stable solutions are always constant in this situation. We are also able to classify all stable solutions under the growth condition of the domain. If the condition does not grow faster than R squared, then we can classify all stable solutions. As an application, we presented some asymptotic symmetry results. Synthetic symmetry results. And let me finish this talk by a couple of open questions and possible extensions. So, first of all, we introduce a key role is played in our result by what I call the Robin curvature Laplacian, which is Laplace operator with Robin boundary condition involving the curvature of the domain. So, up to my knowledge, this operator has not been considered before, even though it contains valuable information on Contains valuable information on the shape of the solution. And I'm confident that a further analysis of this operator could lead to new results. So the second point is none of these results is clear for the fractional Laplacian. We do not know if the result holds or not. And finally, the last question I would like to state here is how can we relax assumption H? So let me recall that we cannot drop it completely because the there exists some counterexample in R eight. Exists some contra example in R8, but still, if, for example, the domain is strictly convex, does it allow to relax the growth condition H? I thank you all for your attention. Thank you. Thank you, Samuel. Okay, we already had one, two questions during the talk. Maybe there will be time for a very, very short question, if any, otherwise. If any, otherwise.
