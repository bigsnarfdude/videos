Uh, like a student in the middle of work, which is related to my long year quest to do something like epsilon expansion for turbulence, like what Wilson did for equilibrium phenomena. And let me remind us that for this, we're actually looking for something which is turbulent and yet close to Gaussian statistics. And the natural candidate is big turbulence, as I maybe come up in the end, and as we found recently with Mikhail Shaw. Found recently with Mikhail Shavit is actually not a good candidate. So the whole statistics of weakly interaction set of waves is not close to Gaussian, even though the statistics of any single wave is close to Gaussian. So what instead we're now doing in parallel is what Michal talked yesterday. And so I'll continue to talk: is this model which goes back to this Arnold idea that an incompressible fluid is. An incompressible fluid is like a rotator. So just to vector rotates transversal to itself and it's generated the whole industry of shell models. And what we'll be considering here is a particular case of shell models, which is more or less like what is shown below, is a set of resonantly interacting waves. So it's a shell model, but which is also Hamiltonian. Also, Hamiltonian dynamically, and then we add random forcing, and then we add dissipation. And we, but this, uh, because it's from the same family like earlier equation for solid body and earlier equation for incompressible fluid, it has this particular property that thermal equilibrium is exactly Gaussian. Moreover, thermal equilibrium with Gaussian is non-interactive mode. So the probability distribution is a direct product of probability distribution of Gaussian for every mode. District of Gaussian for every mode. And so we naturally were looking, as Michael explained yesterday, to the case where turbulence can be close to it. And turbulence, of course, is something which is apparently non-Gaussian because it must have a flux. So it must be a short cumulant, which breaks time reversibility, and it's definitely non-Gaussian. And yet, if we consider this equation and we assume that this coefficient of That this coefficient of interaction v has a scaling alpha, then for alpha equal to one, naively defined scaling of correlation functions and turbulence coincided with that of equilibrium. And we had such situation before there is Bros Pitayevsky in dimensionality to share this property. There are some plasma waves since maybe late 70s, we know. Maybe late 70s, we know that if you have such a consignment, then your spectrum will be very close to thermal equilibrium with a small, usually logarithmic correction, not a power law, but logarithmic, namely very deep correction. And so it is also in this case, which we discovered in our previous work with Shavit and Vladimirava, which was published in Torex last year. So we were very enthusiastic that this is exactly the case where we can start. Exactly, the case where we can start epsilon expansion. So we do have a third moment, and this third moment would be either direct cascade or in reverse, because it's a totally symmetric situation, which where you have two boys can siding. Then you can skew it this way, it will be inverse cascade, skew it this way, it will be direct cascade. Both were absorbed, and this is the parameter of non-linearity. And this is that it really, if you describe It really, if we describe defined it as a skewness, at dumping region is of order unity, but as you go into the inertial interval, it goes to zero. And as you make interval longer and longer, then you see that it's statistics of a given mode. So your per correlation function, your occupation numbers are getting large. If you keep moment, third moment large unity. And which means that this dimensionless units would be. Dimensional skewness would be decreasing non-stop. And we were very enthusiastic. And so we started this exercise. And in particularly, we started first to see how moments, higher moments AN here is just amplitude, wave amplitude as a raised in the power n and relatively to its Gaussian expression. It's not a constant thermal. Constant thermal equipartition is a function of a mod number, but it's really not a big change. You see, it's a change in between from here inertial interval starts on approximately 0.6 to 1.3. So, this is really minor change. But what is more important, all moments scale Gaussian. So, when you look at amplitude of a given mode, its statistics is Gaussian no matter in which I, no matter how deep into the inertial. No matter how deep into the inertial interval you go, which is exactly opposite to what we have usually in turbulence: that as you go into the inertial interval, you see that your statistic is getting more and more non-Gaussian. Here it's a uniformly close to Gaussian for all i, as we expected. And of course, that's precisely why we choose this model. So then it would be natural to do something like to. To do something like to look for the probability distribution, its logarithm, as the main Gaussian term, and then to do small corrections to it, which the first correction would be cubic, because you must generate a third moment, which is a flux, but it must have a small factor in front of it. And then you would have a higher cumulative. What is important for this model, which I did not mention before, that it has a That it has gauge invariant, namely, if you just multiply every amplitude by exponent in the power i times Fibonacci number of this mode, that it would be invariant. So, only it's a little bit reminds other gauge field series and particularly confinement problems. So, you see that you can have strings here where all these february. Where all this Fibonacci sum into the Fibonacci of this k. And so, in principle, you can have such term. And then, we are interested what will be the coefficient in front of it, because we would expect that, because it's close to Gaussian on the level of one mode, that we also expect it to be on the level of many modes. And so, we expect that the higher the m the order of this correlation function, the smaller will be this factor. The smaller will be this factor. So we already found empirically that in front of this qubit moment, this factor is like decreases, like one of the size of the inertial interval. And so we were kind of looking for it. And we are into a big surprise. So let me now describe this surprise. And I think that it actually teaches, at least it teaches me something which I did not think before about turbulence. Think before about turbulence, at least not in that clear form. So, again, to understand the form of the FIDF, we would like to understand what would be the high-order coumo lands. And because we expect it to be perturbative, then we'll now write HOP fluctuation one by one on these coumoons. And again, only coumollons for which this sum of Fibonacci they're actually frequencies. It's kind of a resonant condition. It's kind of a resonant condition. Okay, so you write the equation for the zeros common, which is the second moment, which is occupational number. You get a condition on the third moment, which here it's defined like C to one. It is just third moment. This just gives you flux constants. This is a trivial zero step. Then you write equation time derivative on this third formula. And you, again, here epsilon is the difference from alpha. Epsilon is the difference from alpha one-half. So if you take epsilon equal to zero, then you can give a fourth-order moments. And then you make a natural assumption that they are close to Gaussian. Namely, you decouple them. And you indeed see that this first line, which is kind of has a reducible part, it turns into zero for exactly partition. But we don't have exactly partition. Have exact equipment, we have a logarithmic distortion of the equipment as we have seen. So, we may now assume that it has this form and we find out that this is non-zero but is suppressed more or less by the factor which is one divided by the number of mode minus the dissipation mode. When I is of order of d, it must be of order unit. It must go for the unit, if it's not non-Gaussian, but when your eye is much less than your dissipation for a say deep cascade, this is a big number and it's a denominator. Good, excellent. So we now conclude that it must be compensated by the second line, which is force-order cumulant. So you conclude that the force order cumulant are in comparison with the force order moment of a single mode are suppressed by this single power. That more or less what is we That more or less, what is we expected, and then, of course, as usual in the hope population, you go and differentiate four soda pumolem. And you are for a nasty surprise. There are no consolations there. You can just directly check it. And then you can actually develop a very generic procedure where you can show that at any order, an order will be called M, there is no There is no further cancellation. So, all these formulas are of the same order. It's only related to this conservation. The short moment is definitely special. So, as a result, we obtain this estimate that no matter what is the order M, the respective cumulon is suppressed by the same power, not by anything which would be. Not by anything which would be related to M. You can say, okay, still they are small. Yes, it's true, they are small, but the moment that you start to compute anything like relative entropy, but we have divergence between your probability distribution and the ocean, you need to sum all these formulas, right? And each one of them is small, but they are small only like one of the number of modes. So when you start summing it over modes. Mods. So, when you start summing it over mods, you find out that it all sums out into quantities which are the for the unity. And another angle that you can get into this is that what we was already noticed in our first paper with Mikhail two years ago in Pyrel, is that if you look at the entropy production, in this case, and again, entropy here is not an entropy of a Gaussian distribution. Gaussian distribution of mode. It's not additive entropy of Boltzmann. It's a Gibbs entropy of the whole mode distribution, where rho is a distribution of a multimode distribution like I've shown you. Before, then you find out that it has, of course, Louville's theorem guarantees the dynamical interaction conserves entropy. So you have pumping contribution and you have dissipation. And if you now plot here your near Gaussian PG. Here, your near Gaussian PDF, you get that this is a very small relatively to this. This is because this is actually suppressed like one of the occupation numbers, which is again large. And then again, you see that you actually cannot satisfy this condition if your whole probability distribution is close to version. And then, of course, we went with Vladimirova to check this assumption. To check this assumption, it's really now we want to check a very long multi-mode correlation functions. For this, you need really long intervals. And fortunately, when you invented the trick in which we kind of renormalized our variables in the right way, and so the equation looked like this: so when alpha is one half, the right side is independent on alpha. Because the main problem in shell models is that. Main problem in shell models is that the higher the mode, the shorter is the interaction time, the shorter must be your integration time step. And it's exponentially growing. In these new variables, it's actually uniform. And so we can really afford having very large inertial intros, not like 30, 40 people had before, not like 80 in our first world, but like a few hundred, which is kind of a record. Precision, and then, of course, we find out that it's not really Gaussian. So, when you look at the probability distribution, as I've shown before, of a given mode, it's indistinguishable from Gaussian. But if you already look at a three-mode quantity, which is the probability distribution of a relative phase between three modes, this quantity theta, right, you find out, and this is for different eyes, you see that they more or less the same again. See that they more or less the same again. Direct cascade and inverse cascade had maximum of pi over two or minus pi over two because it must give you. But also, if you look at this probability distribution, it's not close to a constant, not in any way. It's really something which is totally of order unity. And then, of course, what we just it's still unpublished results. We're now writing the paper about it. So, when you look at all these coumoons which are listed here. Which are listed here, and also here at the right, you see this table, and it shows you. And this is a logarithm. So you see, when you look at this component, they aren't decreasing, they're actually growing very fast. That's a logarithm of them, right? And even able to get what is this, three, six, eight, nines. This is nines order cumulan. This is truly heroic computation. Heroic computation and it's large. So, again, because of this HOF computation, let me return back. It's actually predict the dependence on mode number. And so now we try to check this dependence. So, what we did, we took the respective cumulants of order m, divided it by an occupation number in the power m over 2. That makes it dimension. Power m over 2 that makes its dimensionless. And then we say that we expect it to be suppressed by one power of n. So let's multiply by this extra power of n. And let's see if this would be of order unity first. And independent on mode number, you see this is 200 modes. This is an inertial interval. I mean, pretty good. This is a direct cascade in Grovsky scale. This is a direct cascade. This is an Androvsky scale. Okay, so you see here is that the See, here is that. No, this is directly. So, this is the dissipation region. This is the dissipation region here. So, you see that for M at 123, this is for the unity, for M at 124 is of order unity. It's essentially the same. There are two different cumulants for M equal to 4, and you see that they're actually comparable. And we see that the probability is scaling via in the sense that as long as we are in. That, as long as we are inside the inertial interval, the non-Gaussianity, which is usually we see as an anomalous scaling, we see it as an intermittency which increase as you go away from the pumping. Here, it's only in the dumping region, it really rises and here rises. Along the inertial interval, it's practically constant. And for higher order components, it's also practically constant, you see here, which means that it's something which I haven't seen before. I haven't seen before. It's a scale invariant, very non-Gaussian distribution. It's Gaussian as long as you look at one mode, at two modes, at three modes, because then you would kind of, it's marginal distribution, you integrate over other things and it's close to Gaussian. But here you can see it for even higher for M equal to six and for M equal to seven and eight. It's more or less scattered. It's very difficult to get. Scatter it, it's very difficult to get good statistics, as you probably guess, from a for eight order for cumulant, which is a correlation between eight modes related to different wave numbers. But still, you see that it's independent on the mode number, which means that it's kind of scale-invariant. On the other hand, it's they all for the unity. Well, actually, probably because this I still don't understand very. Don't understand very well. There is some factor. This is already non-dimensional. So you're supposed to be every single for the unity, but some higher moments have factors like 5, 10, or 20. They're probably factorial factors which you need to take into account just due to combinatorics. But the conclusion is unmistakably the confirmation of what we expected from Hopfluctuation: that the cumulants do not decay with the number of cumulants. Turbulence is character. Turbulence, turbulence is characterized not only by the third moment, which is a flux-re-mode correlation, but by a correlation of all modes inside the inertial interval of a comparable size. And of course, then we went back to our this work with Michal and we asked, okay, so what we have a weak turbulence where really we have, because this Fibonacci model is like incompressible turbulence, it's only resonant interaction, there are no small parts. Resonant interactions, there are no small parameters of non-linearity. But in this case, again, it's you can compute in a standard way third moment, and then you can compare Gaussian distribution with the true distribution that you would expect dynamically. And it's characterized by relative entropy. And then you compute relative entropy through the cumulans, and then you find out that in equilibrium it is uniformly small. It is uniformly small and in non-equilibrium, it is actually growing within the weak turbulence theory, which means that there is no weak turbulence solution. The solution is really far from the turbulence, and that's again unpublished numerics. Here we have a third model. This is for four capillary waves with turbulence. And here you see that we take two modes here and here and see with which third mode. And see with which third mode it actually has this non-trivial pumulant, which would be a flux, its imaginary part would be a flux. And you find out here the maximum, which is a resonant, as you would expect. And then you raise nonlinearity. The left and right are different levels of nonlinearity. And up and down is short moment and force moment. I don't think anybody ever looked for force moments. And this is pumula. Moments, and this is pumulan. This is something which has no reducible part, right? And surprisingly, you find of the same level, color code is the same, so it's small, but it's noticeable. And the first order cumulant is of the order of the third order cumulant, which is a flux in this case. So, even though I don't have any analytic computations in this case, it's probably doable and we are going to do it, but again, but Again, but what we see for fourth-order components is that they are a resonant point is noticeable. So here is this mode, that mode, and that mode. And we ask with what else they correlate. And here is the series on, but they are mostly correlate with a point which is kind of symmetric to this resonant and to these points which are more or less on the same frequency line. And in high non-linearity, you see that this. Linearity, you see that this resonant is giving more prominence. So the non-resonant kind of more or less blurred away. So at this point, I would like probably to go into, again, you can look at the mean value of the phase difference. Again, this is a Victorbulence with several thousand modes, I guess. And then you see that this is a And then you see that this is indeed the phase difference for which is non-zero. So if I now go into the conclusion is that this shell model, which we call Fibonacci model, because it's a Hamiltonian and has a Fibonacci set of integrals of motion. Indeed, it has a case where equilibrium. Case where equilibrium and turbulence has naively the same scaling. If you're interested in occupation numbers, they are practically indistinguishable. And as you increase the natural interval, they are just like everywhere concise. But the moment you start looking into higher and higher correlation of modes, you see that they do not diminish with an order. So there is something which most likely is related to the fact that all which. Related to the fact that all which I believe that the non-equilibrium probability distribution are essentially singular in phase space. So they are characterized by arbitrarily strong correlations. So it's probable that some kind of perturbation theory is possible, but it's clear that we are dealing with a non-analytic perturbation series. So the passing from Gaussian thermal equilibrium to even what looks like weakly What looks like weakly non-equilibrium because the flux is numerically small relatively to the second moment, it's a non-analytic transition, so you need something which would account for this fact, and it's still not known what it is, but at least the naive idea that I can handle it more or less like Wilson did it. It's a lot of miracles which happens when you do perturbation theory. When you do perturbation theory of a thermal equilibrium, and you do not know it is the same until you start trying to do it out of equilibrium, and then you find out that all the beautiful properties that you were kind of using, they disappear. And that what, of course, Dorfmann and Cohen found for dilute gases, that if you start doing it for virial expansion for equilibrium, it works nicely at every order, you can get equation of state, but for non-equilibrium, you get divergences. For non-equilibrium, you get divergences. And I think that this multi-mode correlation, which we found, they are a reflection of it. For dilute gases, people actually built a renormalized perturbation theory that we were able to take it into account, which is, of course, much simpler problem technically than what we are handling now. And they were only interested in a weakly non-equilibrium situation like computing viscosity. But it may be in this case we'll find it out. In this case, we'll find it out, but it's clear that it will be still long and windy broad. So, let me stop at this point and take the questions. Thank you. Thank you, Grisha. So, we have time for one question, one or two questions. Yes, please. Hi, Grisha. This was too fast for me to follow. I just want to ask about one aspect. I just want to ask about one aspect. Are you saying that the weak turbulence theory is not really accurate? The statement which was actually made before is that weak turbulence is weak as long as you are interested only in a paper relation function. Then wave kinetic equation works pretty well, even for turbulence. But the moment you are interested in multimode probability distribution, it's not close to Gaussian. Excellent. Thank you. Excellent, thank you. And the same true to the Sibonacci model in the case where it seems to be close to equilibrium. It is not. Other remarks or questions? Okay, yep, I was probably scared people away, but I guess the conclusion, at least the last line, is the main take-home lesson. We never considered non-de Oceanity from this viewpoint. And it's actually, I think this way, the essence of programs, not an anomalous kid. Okay. Okay, so maybe we can switch the screen and so I stop sharing. Yes, yes, please. Thanks a lot.
