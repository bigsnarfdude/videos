I wish we could be in person, but things are as they are. I'm looking forward to potentially seeing you all in 2022. And thank you to the organizers for the invitation and for getting such a great workshop together. So, as this first talk of the meeting, I wanted to kind of think about a little bit of an overview. I wanted to kind of think about a little bit of an overview for genomic epidemiology and what it's meant for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. And so I'm not going to really get into real methods or anything here, but just try to kind of set the stage a little bit for what Genomic Epi has really been able to do. So I want to look backwards a little bit in terms of, yeah, exactly what it's been able to do for public health response during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also look forwards for kind of what are. For kind of what are just a handful of directions that I think would be useful to take things for pandemic response. So, first off, if we go back to the very beginning in January, as I think you all probably remember well, there was this period of time in early January, even through the first WHO meeting about a public health emergency of national concern, where there were weirdly open questions about whether there's human to human. About whether there's human-to-human transmission of this novel coronavirus. And that was something that early on the genomic data could really say a lot to. So if we go back, and throughout this first section, I'm dating all of these figures. So I'm trying not to cheat here. And this is like a figure that was generated on January 11th. So it's not borrowing any information from the future. So on January 11th, there were the first five genomes that were produced. First, five genomes that were produced by Chinese CDC, Wuhan University, and Wuhan Institute of Virology, sorry, Fudan University, and that these showed a novel SARS-like coronavirus. We have these bat viruses here, we have SARS-1 here, we have this novel coronavirus here with these five genomes. So, just seeing that it's a SARS-like coronavirus is already concerning. But where things kind of got more concerning was over the course of Was over the course of that week from January 11th to January 19th, by then we now had 12 genomes, Fomuhan in blue here, and Bangkok in red. And at that time, it was an open question of whether these are kind of repeated again and again spillover events from the Huanan seafood market. And this was really pointing at not that not being the case. So the Wuhan genomes. So, the Wuhan genomes, it was unclear what their kind of epilinkage to the market was. That wasn't really recorded well. But we knew for the two genomes from Bangkok, those were travelers in the media reports. They hadn't had any market exposure. And so then what we saw was that these five genomes were all completely identical, all roughly 30,000 base pairs. These have one unique mutation, these have two, this has three. But basically, there's almost no genetic diversity, which the easiest way. Which is the easiest way to get that and the most parsimonious explanation is there was a human point source introduction a couple months previous, a month or two previous, that then there was human human spread. And this was strong evidence of human human spread before the WHO had called there, had admitted, had suggested that it might be the case. So if we go forward four days, we got a report together. We got a report together that just from these first 24 genomes, by then we had had a few more, that we're able to estimate a TMRCA if we kind of borrow some rate of evolution from what we'd expect from coronaviruses. And we get between the beginning of November, mid-December sort of date, which actually has proved to be pretty consistent as we've gotten more and more data. And more data, and we're able to combine that together with the really excellent work by Imperial looking at total caseload from international travelers, where their median estimate was that from international arrivals, they're able to estimate about 3,000 infections, cases at that point. And we get an R0 then between two here and two and a half, depending on when you put the date, which has also been pretty consistent after this point. And so something where the genomic data, again, very early. The genomic data, again, very early on, was able to say things when case-based surveillance was quite spotty. Okay, so moving on, after this kind of initial emergence, we started to see COVID pop up all over the world. And something then that the genome epi was really useful for is to find these introductions to different countries and to indicate an extent of community transmission. Again, when case-based surveillance was really spotty early on. Was really spotty early on. So I'll give an example here. This is from a March 13th report that's up online. That at that point, there were, let's see, 410 publicly available genomes. You can see that majority, a number from China, number from the Netherlands, elsewhere in Europe, and from the United States, again at the beginning of March. And we're already seeing kind of very strong evidence of circulation. Of circulation in different geographies. So, this is kind of zooming into this European clade where you see kind of again and again very similar genomes that group together phylogenetically, as you'd expect from ongoing local transmission. This was helpful in kind of some other situations where at that time it was a little unclear what was actually happening, and at least my understanding, in the UK, where kind of group, whether it's again repeated. Of group whether it's again repeated introductions that picking up as cases or where there is community transmission and seeing this phylogenetic grouping was indicative of local transmission. Interestingly, if we go to the US, there was these two major kind of data sources at that point. One was all of the sequencing that we were doing in Washington State, where we could see that this is a clade of viruses that are all closely related, that are indicative of human-human. That are indicative of human-human transmission and local transmission in that area. Whereas there is also some decent sequencing in California, and you can see that the California samples, even though they're being picked up in both travelers and the community, they're not really forming the same clade structure. And so looking kind of like less sustained local transmission in California. So information here that was useful and was perhaps actionable or at least close to actionable. Actionable, or at least close to actionable. If we go forward to October 27th, this is now the kind of more formal analysis of this idea. And I think this is a really, really fantastic paper. So basically, looking at the amazing data sets from the UK and the COG Consortium, where you can take these different lineages that if you basically do a large phylogenic tree, you can find these monophyletic introductions into the UK. Into the UK, you can date when that introduction occurred by finding the common ancestor, and you can also estimate where it came from. And so there's a whole bunch of these introductions, many hundreds, that are inferred from all of this large data set. And it really recapitulates and helps us understand these, kind of how the epidemic in the UK really got going. So you can see that early on, there are a few introductions. They're mostly from Italy and Spain. Italy and Spain, and then they really start to ramp up, also from France and so forth, and then they start to come down at the end of March when there's basically travel restrictions put into place. And so that really helps us understand how those introductions feeling the epidemic really occurred. So the third thing I wanted to mention was that this is kind of big scale. We want to move to small scale for support for detailed EPI investigation. Just as one example, this is an October 1st report that. October 1st report that was done before, but only became public on October 1st, looking at emergence of community transmission in New Zealand with when things re-emerge there. This is again not my work, but a number of colleagues here. And so if we look at New Zealand early on, we have a bunch of introductions from all over the world. This gets tamped down on by some kind of very strong mitigation and kind of Mitigation and kind of lockdown efforts, reducing basically transmission to zero. And then there is this re-emergence in August 2020 where we get this clade in red here that is kind of all localized. And one thing that was, I think, really, really helpful and really unique about what New Zealand's doing here is they were sequencing basically every case that came from their quarantine facilities. Came from their quarantine facilities. So there's a number of arriving individuals who have COVID. These cases, people go to quarantine, those cases pop up in quarantine, they all get sequenced. And so this was able to kind of directly address the question of whether there was a quarantine failure and whether you see the outbreak connected to a case from quarantine. And it was not. However, this is not a silver bullet here. You can kind of see that these are all connected. It here, you can kind of see that these are all connected. You can see that their closest ancestor, which is one mutation off, you can find genomes in Ecuador, Germany, Poland, Democratic Republic of the Congo, a number of places, but you can't really pin down exactly where it came from, but at least it was really helpful for at least kind of supporting this detailed EPIA investigation, even if it can't supplant the EPIA investigation. And then And then we have fun things like looking at the White House outbreak and trying to see how that's connected in kind of a similar fashion. Anecdotally, there's not a lot that's actually entered the literature here. So in talking with a bunch of public health folks, they're all doing this stuff and looking at these kind of targeted outbreak investigations of things like long-term care facilities, avocado processing plants, et cetera, where there appears to be a number of cases. You want to see if they're linked to see if you actually have an output. Want to see if they're linked to see if you actually have an outbreak. And so it's getting used quite frequently for this, even if it's really not getting published because it's being conducted for targeted public health purposes. And four is tracking the spread of emerging variants. So I think you're all probably familiar with D614G and these two different alleles. This is, it's really difficult to actually really fully ascribe that, yes, this. That, yes, this variant is more transmissible than this other one based upon frequencies alone. So, kind of being a bit clever with the phylodynamics and looking at repeated introductions to see if these things take off is quite useful. And then it tells you that, it tells the virologist that they really should be investigating this gene mutation, both for functional reasons, but also for vaccine reasons. And so, more recently, if we go to October 28th, we've had a lot, we haven't now seen anything really predominant globally anymore because the travel has. Globally, anymore because the travel has been reduced so much, but we're seeing regional variants start to take off. So, we have this A22V mutation spike protein that emerged earlier in the summer in Spain and Europe and has been spreading since then and is now representing the majority of sequenced cases in Europe, which is, of course, worrisome on the face of it. We think it can be explained by this epiconnection to Spain, but that's not fully clear. But that's not fully clear. And it does then say that, regardless of how it arose, we really need to be checking our serum panels to see that A22V does not have an effect on antigenicity relative to the wild type. Okay, so in last few minutes, I want to look forward a little bit more and talk about kind of directions that I think would be useful for the field in general. And so one, and this has really, really been pushed strongly by SARS. Pushed strongly by SARS-CoV-2 is just dealing with large data sets. So, this is a global tree that's made and updated by Rob Landfier. This is super useful to have. And so, there's 160,000 odd genomes here. And this works via kind of maximum likelihood phylogeny, and you can do this. But the data, the methods do not exist to do time trees or do To do time trees or do any of the kind of more skyline plots, etc., the kind of more classic phylodynamic things that we'd want to do with this data for data sets this large. And so figuring out how to do this is going to be quite useful and quite necessary. The main way that I've been dealing with this is a bit of a hack where you basically try to do clever sub-sampling to reduce the data set to these like 5,000 odd sequences that are manageable. Sequences that are manageable and that are focused on the geography that you want to look at, that include a lot of sequences from your focal geography and include some context sequences from elsewhere as well. But it's kind of necessary to figure out. We want to be able to, this is kind of like this EPI investigation idea, but this is something that's been repeatedly frustrating for me: that they're doing all these phone calls throughout public health in the US and the world, and the And the world, and the data is not really getting recorded well for knowing exposure history for whether we think that the person perhaps was exposed in, say, bar, restaurant, gym, school, church, all of these different transmission settings, exposure settings that we might be worried about, but we don't really know how much each of these is contributing to the ongoing epidemic at the moment. And you can imagine tying the genomic EPI together with this richer EPI data to actually address these questions. Three is reducing sampling bias. Is reducing sampling bias. So I suspect everyone's very familiar with this, but it's really frustrating to the degree that the discrete trait model, in particular, which is the kind of fast model that you'd want to use for these large data sets, is influenced by sampling bias. So if you have regions that have more data points than they should, what you end up with is those regions kind of looking much more like sources rather than sinks in the overall. In the overall circulation network. And so, right now, this is just showing of the 160,000 odd genomes from GISAID, how they're distributed over the world. And we can see that the UK is really contributing much more than their fair share of sequences. But we also have places like Australia and the US that are contributing a lot of data points, and then pretty decent collection from elsewhere in the world. And so, this is much. And so, this is much better sampling than we've had before, but it's still representing probably, at least in the US, the calculation is about one case in a thousand, one infection in a thousand is getting sequenced. So it's still quite a small number. And if you were just to take all of this data and say, particularly look at Europe and run discrete trade analysis, you'll make some strange inferences about what's happening in the UK just because the amount of data. We generally deal with this by sub-sampling, but that. Generally, deal with this by subsampling, but that is a bit of a hack. And then, kind of building on this, right now, almost all of these methods are really descriptive. If you think about the phylogeography, it's saying you have these genomes, they're related in this way, you can see that these genomes from this area outgroup from these genomes from this area, therefore we think that we went from A to B. But there's really no kind of conception in these models of data that's outside of the sampling frame. And so, I think the way. Sampling frame. And so I think the way to actually start thinking about this, and I don't have a really something that's, this is pretty vague, but if we could connect this with the kind of infectious disease modeling approaches, so this is GleamViz, Gleam, where there's kind of a full agent, a full simulation of the world, people moving around, different patches, mobility, et cetera. You could actually be able to have the phylogenetic data, the genomic data feed into these models. Feed into these modeling approaches to inform your modeled view of the world in a kind of richer fashion than you have if you just have cases through time and time series data. But so far, that connection is really quite tenuous, and it's something that I think could really be pushed and contribute. Okay, so I'm out of time. I'll stop there. Really thank data producers from all over the world. This has been an amazing effort of hard work and real-time data sharing. Of hard work and real-time data sharing, and it's been remarkable. Giga SAID for all their curation that they've done, the Nexttrain team and the lab for all the work here as well. And I think I guess there's time for a question or two before moving on. Absolutely. Thanks very much, Trevor. This was a great talk. So do we have any questions? So for the questions, for this session, at least, I'm going to allow people to either unmute themselves and speak or type it in the chat window. So whichever you prefer. Chat window, so whichever you prefer is okay. Does anybody have any questions at the moment? Okay, so there's a question from Celia Greenwood that is asking, are you getting data from tracking apps? Yeah, I was super excited about these apps earlier on, and like it's been really challenging. Challenging. I think where things stand, if people aren't familiar here, there's this idea of these exposure notification apps that you're running on your phone. Phones are talking to each other via Bluetooth, and you basically, each phone records a log of these unique numbers that it's encountered. If you get diagnosed with COVID, when you're called by public health, they ask you if you're running one of these apps. If you are, they give you a key that you then upload. Are they give you a key that you then upload that your IDs that your phone has seen to at this point? They actually do have a national diagnosis server, which is pretty, pretty good. That would be really interesting to have this data connection, and it could tell us a whole lot. The way that the tracking apps have been set up is they're really strongly privacy-preserving, which I think is the smart way to do this to get buy-in. So, how it's set up. So, how it's set up, you'd have to somehow, like all the information is basically on, you could maybe do it. Yeah, I don't think anything's being connected. So, when someone uploads their keys, those would have to be attached to some PII from the person, and then you'd connect an individual. I think the UK might be doing something that's less privacy-preserving, but I actually don't know where that stands at the moment. So, yeah, it would be interesting data. It would be interesting data. I don't think any of it exists at this point, though. Excellent. Any other questions? So, we have a question from Matthew Hall, who asks, do you have a vision in your head for how to deal with sampling bias in a more methodological way? Yeah, it's a really good question. So, how I'd imagine this is, again, with that last slide, that if you could simulate via Could simulate via forward simulations via kind of the infectious disease modeling framework, and you simulate, you know, kind of, and there's an emergence in Wuhan, you kind of know about air travel and you know about R0 and these things, or at least you can kind of have those parameter ranges that are being explored. Then that you simulate out trajectories of the pandemic, you simulate sampling from those trajectories, and then you're not so kind of strongly. Kind of strongly tilted towards just the data, the data in your sampling frame. And kind of the overall simulation should point at things that are kind of more consistent with reality than just relying on the samples that you have. So that's super vague, but you could imagine some ABC framework or something else like this to be able to connect out your simulations that you do to your genomic data. Genomic data. Fantastic. Thanks very much, Trevor. I'm going to stop the question and answer session here, just because we've got a time to stick to. But there are some other questions in the chat. And I would encourage you to go to breakout room number one at the end of the session and talk to Trevor more about it.
