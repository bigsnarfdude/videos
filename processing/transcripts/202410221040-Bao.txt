Okay, so this joint work with a few colleagues: Wei Jiang from Wuhan, Yifei Li, just grad last year, now is a Hongba Fellow at the Tu Bingen Tijian Qian at Hong Kong UST, David Slowitz at Hong Kong Yu, Yan Wang at Central China Normal in Wuhan, and Chen Zhao finished his Hong Ba Fellow last. Finished his Hong Ba Fellow last year and joined USTC last summer. Okay, brief outline. I begin with some what is called solid writing problem. I understand most audience here do interface in fluid. We are doing something, so that kind of interface problem in solids. And we throw this called a slow variation. So somehow a function of a curve or Function of a curve or surface to be closed to open. From that one, we derive the variation, equilibrium, and also dynamics. You will see, like you had talked about a lot, like Professor Nielsen, here, you can do the variation to derive PDE and also derive boundary condition. So that the problem is energy dissipation, some stress preservant. So I will begin with. Preserve it. So I will begin with a sharp interest model, like you know, isotropic. We can isolate topic, and then topic is kind of parametric elements for solving this kind of geometric flow, like Russian Hai Jang. They also evolve that do some structuring for this kind of basically moving the curve or surface and some results in 2D dimensions, three dimension. Well, with time, I told how to extend to strong or harsh. To strong or possible surface energy, proper substrate, and also three dimensions. Okay, so here is a typical cartoon to show source deviting of thin film. So we know most thin film, they are metastable. As so called the white from party, see, you have a like a device, protect, electric device, from protect, you have a thin film. Normally, it's by gold. Normally, it's by gold, a gold film, something that very nano-size thick. So, due to subdiffusion, at the beginning, a uniform film will divide to many particle or quantum dots. So, this process, of course, it happened at high temperature, but this temperature is well, well below the melted temperature of the solids. So, you can see this is just a slide. You can see this is just a slice of this. Like, this is you can see the particle size different, but the shape of the profile looks similar. So, this is due to this with the famous Young's equation 200 years ago. Suppose just a slice, this is a substrate, this is a film, and the film, and this vapor. So, this point called is a triple junction and three films. Three the substrate and the film and the vapor meet together. So there's of course this is a film and substrate. The film and the vapor here is the substrate and the vapor. So this meet together. There are three different sort of surface energy, gamma F V s, gamma F V and gamma F s so at the horizon direction there is the famous Young's equation gamma V s this one equals gamma F s this one equal gamma Fs this one times gamma F V this one times the cosine theta the angle so yes if given film given vapor given substrate the theta is uniquely determined okay so this is some recent so this is a typical experimental relative this is a silicon substrate and with AU AU gold film so you can see the typical size is 20 nano micrometer Nano, a micrometer, but the height very since you can see at the beginning, this film like this one, like this one. But after some time, the film divides to very completely geometric structure. Okay, so somehow this kind of self-dividing is driven by capillarity effect and occurs through the self-diffusion controlled mass transport. So my understanding may be somehow slightly different. So you can say the So, you can say the interface motion of the kind of dividing solids and the floats are quite different. So, in floats, the total energy change depends on the float energy plus interface. But the majority part is from float part. However, in solids, the thin, thin film. So, the material, the elastic energy change very little. So, here the Very little. So, here the main part, the energy change, is due to surface, due to the interface energy. So, it belongs to so-called Capella controlled interface surface involution problem. It can be regarded as a surface diffusion last contact line magnition. So, you can see the equilibrium from fluid interface problem and from solid problems that are similar of equilibrium. Of equilibrium energy minimization. But however, the dynamics is quite different. So flows due to the pressure or surface tension here due to self-diffusion. There are a lot of applications plays an important role in electronic processing or a common method for producing nanoparticles. Especially recently, people use this phenomenon to do this extreme ultra- Extreme ultraviolet, so little graph, like somehow to produce waiting for some kind of compression shifts. And also recent experiments, you will see some kind of geometric complexity and the capital-driven instability of phasing teen as well as pinch of observed experiments. We try to understand this phenomenon. I want to mention here this whiting, the whiting influes. The Waiting includes a lot of study, including Chie Chen Chen, Xiaoping Wang, Ping Shen O, Wien Omecardiga, We Ching Ren, Wien there are a lot of work there because they for flow problems. Here we have to solve this white and diwai chi. Okay, so this is some results so that you can see from this two, you can see a square, this is a diamond, but of course if it flutes, this is gonna drop it a square or diamond. This is going to drop it a square or diamond. The fluids are isotropic, but they white and white are similar. But, however, for solids, due to different crystal orientation, you can say that they were different. And this is a small square, a bigger square, you can see initial uniform become very complicated. And also, this typical shows some kind of initial uniform, it's got a film. So, the dark device is because it's got a complex pattern formation, like a edge effect. Like a edge effect, you can see after some boundary, so the surface, the interface like a piece-wise kind of linear. Curvature is zero from that. And also, some kind of corner instability is a whole. And also, we also observe really lack instability in solids. We know really instability in fluids is well understanded, but in solids, they also observe this kind of phenomenon. But in salt, it's also observed this kind of phenomena. Okay, so to understand this kind of problem, we spawn always one sort from simple beginning case. We want to ask, of course, in experiment always have a substrate. First, we forget substrate. So we consider how, what, see, consider a droplet or another particle. So we see a droplet, like a water or an oil drop. You can see the You can see the water droplet, like it's really the size small or oil size small. You can say they're always sphere. Why? Because you can see that diamond is always like this type. This due to why the surface energy, one is isotropic, the other is anisotropic. So here is whether this one is kind of considered as equilibrium. Of consider as an equilibrium or a minimization problem. So, like in two dimensions, like a three dissimilar. So, I want to find a curve gamma. The shape, the surface is unknown. So, I want to find a gamma, but define a total energy W depends on so-called integral gamma of gamma theta d gamma. So, you can see this curve gamma at any point is n is normal vector and y x is the angle theta. y x is the angle theta so not usually so we define a gamma theta is the surface energy at the point this point of course if gamma equal one isotropic like a fluids oil droplet but if in like a crystal solids gamma normally anisotropic so the to find this equipment of a droplet become the following problem i find the curve gamma in two dimensions such that i minimize this Such that a minimize this target function of a given this gamma theta. So that minimum antifunctional, so any functional, and say that, well, the area of the region increased by gamma is when omega is constant. Okay? So you can say if my gamma equal one, isotropic, this becomes a minimum lens or minimum surface problem. Length of minimum surface problem. Like this in two dimensions, I want to find out. I want to find a curve gamma. The length of the parameter is, okay, sorry, we find the area is fixed. The parameter is minimum. We know a circle in two dimensions. If it's three dimensions, I want to find a surface. The volume of the surface enclosed is. The surface enclosed is fixed. The area of the surface minimum, we know it's a sphere. So that's why the water drop is always a sphere. However, if you insult it, it's gamma is a function and it's anotropic. So this, you know, how to find this problem? So this minus problem. This is like a one for a curve gamma. Well, in material science, like almost Material science like almost 100 and 20 years ago, almost, yeah, this wolf proposal construction. Although we don't say like a geometric construction, say a given this gamma, from a given gamma theta, I say, as in two dimensional for any vector angle with angle theta, I draw an arrow like this one. The length of this one is gamma theta, but I'm typically this one. Take this one. Then let the set of change. I get this wolf envelope. Then on the envelope, at any position, I do a tangent line. I have all this tangent line. Then the envelope of this tangent line becomes a solid curve. Then you can see the solid curve, of course, it's not one-to-one. So I cut the air, cut all these four air. This blue region is basically this part. So, specifically, this part is my minimizer of this one. And this geometric construction was just fed by using the geometrical measure theory by Gene Taylor, Edric Foncika and Stephen Mueller. David gave us formulas this one. Of this one, of course, is when gamma squared when see for example if gamma equals one, this is a sphere. Of course, if weekly, this is unique defined. Uniquely, this is uniquely defined. If strongly in a cut air somehow, then next question is equitable for this can be to three dimensions. Next question is how to find a particle on a substrate. Small one. So the problem began to follow. So this is my substrate. Suppose my substrate is a flat. I want to find the open gamma here and with two people point, XCR and XCL. XCR and XCL. So these two are on the substrate. So the problem becomes defined for this configuration, I define omega curve plus these two points, depending on the configuration omega. So I define total energy, W of omega. This part is the curve energy, and this part called the war energy. Okay? The problem becomes, I want to find the omega, is this curve plus two points? Plus two point this package shift and subject to okay minimization of this double double omega say that this the region of this omega this curve and subject this region the area is fixed this is called okay for this one there's a okay almost a 50 years ago this is winter bottom the construction for this example for given this one gamma theta what you do is you first ignore first Ignore the substrate. Okay, like you do. First, you just use a winter bottle construction. Like you from this one, this one, this one here. Then what they do is just use a horizontal line to cut this one. They get this one and some more. So you have to get many. Among them, some are global minimization. Global minimization, some are much stable, some are unstable. Want to understand which one is the proper one? Okay, so then we try to do the thermal dynamic variation to understand. So, similar for this problem, what we do is, suppose this is my gamma, this is my substrate, I suppose my gamma uses X of parameters by X of S as accuracy of this one. The total energy can be written as this is an interface. Can be written as this is an interface energy. This one, this is the war energy. So, this one compared to this one and this one just up to a constant. Okay. So, then what I do is suppose this is the solid line is my gamma and the dashed line is my gamma epsilon. So, this here is my open curve. So, I need a perturbation both. So, my gamma epsilon equals gamma plus epsilon phi of s times n plus epsilon psi of s times. Plus epsilon set of S times tau. Because if for closed curve, we need only perturbed at the normal direction. But for open curve, you can say we need to perturb at both normal and otherwise you can say this XCR, if you only perturb at the normal, then after perturbation, the XCR is away from the substrate. So this one. Of course, when you request my psi, this one, my psi is arbitrary because the tiny direction. The tiny direction. And my phi is phi, the integration over gamma is zero. So that so this one says that so that the area increased by gamma and the area gamma epsilon is second order in terms of epsilon. Then you basically you write this one as this one. Of course, we need a request so-called this V, if you plug this P and S say in, we phi and s say in what we rewrite as so so in terms of u and v vector then we have v v zero and v l is must be equal to zero then you do so because the camera first variation remember here what variation of gamma so so of course we come to the so the w is the the energy of gamma and the w epsilon is the total energy of gamma epsilon okay of course we know the s is the accuracy of gamma S is the accuracy of gamma, but s is no longer gamma length of acclaims of gamma epsilon. Of s is one of the premises parameter of gamma epsilon. Then you plug each other defines the limit, double epsilon minus double over epsilon epsilon zero into some calculation, you end up this one. So with this one, we can define this gamma plus gamma double prime times kappa curvature as. times kappa curvature as the variation of W over gamma because the mu can potential. And we define this one is the variation of W with respect to XCR, the right triple point. And this one is the left triple point and with the function F. F is defined here. You can see this one. Of course, you can see here, we call this one is called because anisotropic Young's equation. You can see here. Young's equation. You can see here, if my gamma equals constant equal, you know, constant equal one, this one collapse to the famous Young's equation. But this one comes from variation. Okay, of course, you only come to the first variation because then we have to find the equilibrium shape. So it's mu equal constant. Since this is because my this phi, the integral of phi equals zero. equals zero. So as n is mu equals constant and this f equals zero. So first variation is equal to zero. This is equilibrium. So after equilibrium we can continue to calculate the second variation. So d square double df square, you do the calculation, you end up with this one. So with this one, you can see if since my phi and psi arbitrary, the order the see on the path is See, on the path is so called stable. We need gamma plus gamma prime is greater than equal to zero. So, stable equilibrium shape must satisfy at this position, this one. So, gamma Telta, they call surface stiffness is non-negative. Okay, then we come back to our example for our this with this gamma, this one again. You can see the blue curve is the wolf, the wolf. The solid curve is so called the oh sorry the blue is a gamma plot. The black curve is the wolf envelope. Then you can calculate that between this one, we calculate, yes, here there are eight branches. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. And we count each branch. And this branch, this branch, and this branch, this one, gamma, double prime is always non-negative. However, Non-negative. However, along this branch and this branch, this branch and this one, they are negative. So we know these four are unstable. Then from our this one, after the second calculation mathematics, we can know this whole envelope, right? So this four is unstable. We remove them. Then we do so-called use a line to cut. This is the one you get this one here. And this is another one. This is another one, the last one. This is another one, the last one. So with this one, we can get all with this given gamma, we can get all four stable equilibrium. You can see the difference. And this one is a global minimization. Okay, so after, so this, we can, use our this method, we can, we can systematically get all kind of equity, if you have, you can find, we have all kind of, so this diagram of this kind of problem. This kind of problem of gives them gamma. Okay, after they have this kind of equilibrium, so people ask how kind of dynamics there are different maps, different methodology. Shopping is model, what we are for aspect case, so material science, you have some, by some intuition, you get a model. Then we by using our summation, we can systematically get a model, which can be for esoteric. Model which can be for isotropic and anisotropic cases. Of course, there are other kinetic model methods, or distributed surface method, or physical model, many other methods. I don't want to bother you too much here. So, you got the dynamics. After you have this variation, type of potential, then the dynamics, what we do is, see, again, he will do here is, see, this is my substrate, this is my curve. Once my gamma is functional time, t is. is functional time t is promoted by x s t or two components as accurate then the model becomes dx dt equals v n times n basically at the normal direction the velocity v n is equal b times d square mu ds square b is motor constant the mu is this one what we have to chem potential this is for pde you can say if you can say if mu if gamma is constant equal one this becomes the equal one this becomes d dx dt equal say if b also equal one you have this mu becomes kappa specifically is a d square kappa ds square okay also we can derive one condition of course we know xcr so y xcr is zero because this point must be uh move can only move along substrate and also there's a zero mass flux ds mu s mu and xr equal to zero so the mass conservation and then we also use our variation we get a dx e dr dx e r dt this one you go minus eta this is the w my energy to with xcr variation you minus eta f well eta is a material constant okay you can see this we call this one is a relaxed particular angle condition before you know people always use it click the You know, people always use it, like the static condition. That's uh, because I'm from because you know, equilibrium, you know, the kind of angle given by Janssen, I know the young equation, but initially, the experiment always like a so-called end of the film. The initial angle always like a pair of two imagic experiments. So, you can see, so this give a dynamically condition. Of course, you can see, so this also can say this somehow condition is very non-standard body condition. And here, when my e-tackle to infinite. My eta goes to infinite, this becomes this and it's static and it's a Yans equation. And when gamma goes to zero, uh, of course, so interesting here, you can see this is a problem, right? You can see my X has two components. So it's a system. On the right, my kappa is second derivative of the X, and V has an oscillator. So this is somehow is a system of. Hamhole is a system of two equations in space. It's a fourth order derivative. In time, is oh, sorry, fourth order. So, but however, on the XCR, we need only three boundary conditions. This comes from the intuitive and from the computational from analysis. Yeah, but what so for this problem, from what I already know, with this problem, PDE plus button addition, what this problem is well posed. Where this problem is well posed, still not very clear. So, if my based on this model, we can see this area conservation and also anti-tissipation approved. Look at how to compute them. You can see, of course, there are different formulations. You can write as dtx equal to dx and mu n, mu equals some alternate equation, and the kappa equals this one. This is a closed formula. Kappa equals this one. This is a closed formulation. This one, you look at it here, I know it can be x, mu, and kappa. Close is the type. Then if we rewrite into n dot dtx equal ds is mu, mu equals something, and kappa n equal minus dx is x. You can say now the first equation looks like a kind of ellipse equation for mu. The third equation looks like a limit equation for x. Look at the equation for X. The standard equation is like an algebraic equation. So then you can say, based on the right formulation and they have bargain, based on this formulation, you can easily do variation. You just test multiple test function, you end up this one. This is like a very aligned with the famous slogan by this late professor Kang Feng said that for one similar problem, the different formulation, right and left. You choose the proper formulation. You choose a proper formulation, you will, all the cannot the same, but after determination, they are completely different performance. Okay, with this one, we can, this is my variation. Here, what first we try to do is we evolve this curve. What we do is we consider this EXER DT as a time-dependent problem for XCR. So, what do we do? We first evolve XCR, the triple point, then evolve the curve. point then evolve the curve we when we do this way we do generation so basically we first evolve this xcl and xcr then when this two point is first evolve then evolve the the the curve we find that this method okay only only first order in uh if for open curve there's some problem and here of course we want to also we want to test accuracy what we need to do is we know for What we need to do is we know for function, there are all kinds of so-called norm to measure the arrow. Here, question is for this uh for two curve, how to measure their difference. So, so what here we do, we borrow the PDP do is see for two curve, we measure this, we use it to get a manifold distance. So, you can see this see this for close to curve, what we do basically, the error is somehow the the the Arrow is somehow the green area. Here's open curve. So this one, we use this one. Okay, for this frequency, for closed curve, we different mesh side time step. So this is somehow for closed curve, we will see close second order in space. If you use a sheet with a linear element, well, for open curve, we only can only observe first order accuracy in space. But we do, this is a linear element. So even this kind of this is roughly. So, given this, kind of this roughly corresponds to a function roughly like an L1 norm. Okay. Then later we find instead of regarding this function, this body condition as a kind of you're given f, you evolve this one, we can rewrite this f into this one. We rewrite this function into dsx equals sigma plus one over eta dxcr l d dt. So this some kind of a robin type pernotation, but here is time derivative. Again, non-standard. But when we write it into this form, then this particular become a natural participation. Then this one can be absorbed into my Can be absorbed into my variation. So, basically, now I evolve the open curve and its two triple pointers together. Okay, with this one, we can do digitization. And what we do here is basically using so-called users semi or linearly implicit. Basically, for you, for this two, we do implicit, but for this LM, we do explicit somehow. This one with this one, this transition, I don't know about the detail, we can easily prove well put. Detail: We can use it to prove well post-ness and also can prove anticipation and kind of stay unstable. Usually, also could say this has got an asymptotic so mesh distribution. And later we find that if we replace the nm to nm plus one half, remember n is a normal vector, but by using this one, then we can prove this one have area conservation, like a structure preservation. And this is workshop is structure preserving structure preserving. Structure preserving and the stretch preserving here. So, for this one, okay. So, with this one, you can see this is the red curve, is the new method, and this one is the order of the open curve. You can say, no, of course, we have a clear second order here. Of course, what we pay is the price is princily. It's a semi-implicit or nearly implicit. You can see principally this transition here. Here, this one. Here, this one. Every time step, I need to only solve a linear system. But now, with this new treatment here, okay. Oh, well, so if with this one, I need to solve everything non-linear system. However, due to this, some we can easily show that for this one, the non-linear system is only quadratic and easy to solve it. Okay. So I want to show some, so let's show some anticipation. So that's the anticipation and due to time, I show some results. So this is my initial substrate initial end curve. The initial context angle is pi over two. The equilibrium is Young's angle is three pi over two. So I choose my beta equals zero, but while my gamma straight is one plus beta cosine for theta, you can see it evolved like this one. I just quickly I just quickly okay good. You can see for this duce asotropic, they evolve to a part of a curve. Okay, now if I extract my beta equal as anisotropic, you can see it evolves like this one. Okay, now it's not no longer a curve, part of curve. And if a lung, of course, this is not a height is one. The the height is one, the len the length is sixty here. So you can see they have a pinch off, and uh you can see the little pinch off. Of course, at the pinch off, we need to artificially separate to two curves evolves. Okay, and of course, we can extend to strongly anisotropic, so strongly means gamma double prime less than zero, then we need to do a supersonic U then Need to do a support that user well more anti-regularization, then you get a six other PDE, and here interesting your variation. We can also have this sum of percondition. What we get is, okay, here, one percent what we find is kappa at XCR equals zero. The PDA similar. So, this kappa equals zero at the XCR, kappa equals zero. It's a segment which clearly explains the facet. Explain the facet of the experiment. Okay, I just can sweep this one and also connect to curved possible subjects to for example experiment. Say, gamma equals epsilon value, cosine plus epsilon sine theta. Now, since this is no longer C1, we need a regular smooth edge, they need to regulation. And of experiment, many cases, it's because the substrate is curved. So this may like this experiment, there's a curved substrate. So then what we do, we have to simulate. So then what we do, we have to simulation, we can match some cognitively map this agreement. And this show like a is uh like a initial is this is my added film, this is my substrate, like a upper triangle. So that you can see when this interesting observation is, you can see here this one, they stay here. If you go back here again, you can see this one, they climb the mountain, they stay here because. They climb the mountain, they stay here because this cover here, the cover is zero. But here, you have to go to the bottom. You can see this has stay here, this one stays here. And similarly, because if there is a substance a sine curve and a small particle, you can see they evolve like this one. You can say there are two states. Initially, this one goes to like a like a like a Like a like a spot of sphere, then they go down here. And when they go down, like a like a solid something that they're like particles, they don't know. You can see they go down. We can find the go-down speed of V of S at any point proportion to the copper prime of S. Kappa prime is the curvature of the substrate. And this one, by using Anzac principle, we can clearly justify this motion. Okay, we can, of course, this kind. Okay, we can, of course, this connection to curved substrate with anisotropic surface energy of the particle. Also, intradimental here is: here we have the substrate is the two parts. One is a convex curve, another is concave curve. So, this is my substrate. Okay. You can see initially I have one here, one here. This one will go here, go here, go here, go here, go down. Go down very understandable. A lot of our understanding. This is this one. You can see this one a little here, they go up, they go up, go up here, go to the top. This somehow is entered into the two. Remember here, the party is small. No greater force. So, of course, you can say here, since here, you can say the curvature is positive. They go to the here. And here, this is concave. The curvature is negative. So, this one. Is negative them so this one the the particle will go to the top just like you do an umbrella if a water drop at the outside they go down if you put a small drop under your umbrella but put it inside they go to the the thing they go to the top not go to the not go down just a pier due to the the main dream force is a is a curvature of the substrate okay similarly our study can be extended to to to i have a few minutes right Two to I have a few minutes right two minutes right whatever it's almost finished it just two minutes oh good great so and all this study can extend to three dimensions like you can see here I have a substrate and then I have a want to find a surface the surface is s so basically I have a substrate I have a surface like this one so here of course my surface is s and any point I have a n as a normal vector and as s2 and the gamma fv Gamma F V with the film and the vapor is gamma L, depends on gamma L. And of course, this surface and the substrate, there's a contact line, is gamma, of course, this one. So now my total infrared energy is W equal to Wi plus Ws. Ws is the integral over S for the surface and gamma N D S plus the other two material constants times A gamma. A gamma is the area of the region. The region on the substrate of gum. Of course, this substrate can be beginning. I just show here in the flat, but it can be a curved substrate. Okay, then we can simulate total energy into variation. Of course, you know, some of the variation, you know, shift derivative and a common Hoffman curse vector in very property in mature science with the model is dtx. This x is this is the end position of the of the surface which have x y z three can put. Have xyz three components. So dtx equals surface Laplacian sub s mu times n. Well, this mu is the campaign potential equal surface divergence of Kc. K is a gradient gamma heter n. Gamma heter p is the homogeneous extent of gamma n. Gamma n is from s2 to r plus a function. And also we can derive this three functions for this one. And we can design the primary final edge mask for the problem. Okay, I just for some. Okay, I just for some comparison from our model and this method with experimental. This initial is like a island film, like a city wall, like a Xi'an, the city wall in Xi'an. Like this island film is in T equals almost T was zero. When time evolved, like this one, you due to has here, you two that the pinch out happens. And this is a form of simulation. You can see when time evolves. Okay. Okay, at least qualitatively, they agree with experiments. Here we only evolve a surface. Again, with the new Qing Chov, we didn't stop, we didn't use a flag, Qing has a messenger to continue. Okay, this is also another experience called dividing pattern film. So initially, like a small one, a large one. And this is some cut slice. I just only compare one case. I just only compare one case. This is my initial adding the film and the very thin, a few, maybe 20 nanometers high, but several micrometer long. You can see when time evolves, you can see very clearly to see through the corner fattening and pinch off at the center. And if we, so this is We so this is the experiment. This slice at the here, and this simulation, of course, we do not if here, yes, here is my y is from zero. Here is a little shift above from zero. Yes, if you come with this one here, this one this one, and this one they are they agree very well. So, I want to last one to see is here what our problem is: given initial substrate, given initial film, given gamma n. film given gamma n how evolve but in applications many cases my gamma n is unknown because this interface right is created by stm or many other mechanisms so but they can evolve example here you can experiment you can evolve say now picture of this one this one and this one they have several snapshots of the surface so then basically question how to find the gamma n is the inverse find the gamma n is a universe problem or evenly so or even somehow or see you know to to get together the final pattern field pattern the pattern the particle how to design a proper substrate so so this is machine learning method to to do gamma n or to learn my substrate so it can solve all so basically future maybe using grammar design machine learning method Motorization machine learning method for QMR PDE or PDE on manifold. Okay, this is some conclusion. Okay, thank you.
