Okay, I'm presenting you talk. So it's you're going to talk about some tools for integral geometry used in different areas of mathematics. You have one hour. Yes, well, actually, I slightly changed the title and still let me say that whenever asked to deliver an introductory overview survey type talk, I A survey-type talk, I recklessly agreed. And indeed, for instance, in the past, I had experience and delivered a series of introductory talks at a conference on inverse problems, introductory talks in geometry, and most people there were experts in PDEs without so much knowledge of geometry, and that went okay, and even with positive results for me, because I entered the area, so maybe it was more useful for me than for them. More useful for me than for them. Here I'm a little bit embarrassed because I see plenty of great experts. So many things I'm going to speak about or to say are going to be silly, but this is a point of no return. So I'm going to speak about a number of results. Now, this lecture is going to be curvature-free, no curvatures at all. And actually, this is one of the issues for me because it's really difficult in problems which are formed. In problems which are formulated in a synthetic way to explode the difference between Riemannian and Finsley manifolds. Why I mentioned these two classes, of course, there are spaces of curvature bounded below, but they essentially from say measure viewpoint are more or less Riemannian up to singularities. In negative curvature, you don't understand really what the measure is unless you make some very strong assumptions before that, because there is no Before that, because there is no local homogeneity or such, and sub-Romanian road is not nearly as well investigated. And when you introduce Finsley Kurvach, we have a number of results, even with Sergei Ivanov, on this topic, saying that there cannot be any good relation between Finsley Kurvich and geometry. So it is a structure which is interesting to understand, but it's not so geometric. Not so geometric. So, for me, these are the two worlds. And of course, there are certain things that you can use and see the difference. Mostly, of course, you use things like the coera formula, co area inequalities, and other things of this type. And I'm going to speak about a couple of those. And since this is an introductory talk, I would wish to start with something quite old. Start with something quite old, almost 30 years old, but probably at that point it was not properly explained. Our goal at that point with Sergei Ivarov was just to produce a rigorous proof which can be checked. And we were both unmature at all. And so we didn't care about exposition being understood. We just wanted it to be checked and nothing else. So maybe the first topic I'm going to begin with. Topic: I'm going to begin with is characterization of ellipsoids of ellipsoids. So, so what is so special about Riemannian matrix versus all-fistinatics? And of course, there are lots of characterization for ellipsoids, and Euclidean space is the only fully homogeneous spaces among all norm spaces, and there are all sorts of inequalities. Sort of inequalities like Santa law inequality, which becomes sharp only for ellipsoids, but they are kind of difficult to use, even though they are very nice. And here is the following grammar. So at this point, I'm speaking on some things which we understood with Sergeyva, and if I will mention a couple of other people as well. But here is a lemma, which can be formulated as follows. Which can be formulated as follows. Let B be in some vector space. I don't need any clean structure on this space. Corve X and centrally symmetric so convex body. So one can think of think of B of B Of B as the unit ball of some norm. And let mu be a measure, probability measure on the boundary. And we assume that the following inequality holds. For any supporting linear functional linear function, L integral of L squared d mu. L, I know that Antoni Petruni hates this notion. I agree, it's mathematically stupid. It's integral with respect to mu, but it became traditional. Is less than or equal to one over n. Then the two things hold. First, this integrals of L squared with respect to mu, okay, all right, still the way I'm used to, is always equal to one over n. And second, the support of mu lies. Not to make it mysterious in any ways, let me explain where this one over n comes from. And that could be a good exercise for Calco students, especially if you want them to think a little bit rather than to do changes of variables and so on. Ask yourself what would be the integral of integral of x squared ds over units circle where s is arc lengths arc lengths on x squared plus y squared equal to one normalized normalized so integral of this is equal to one there's a question i I think H is new. Let's see, there is something in the chat. I didn't look at the chart. Yeah, somebody, what are the restrictions on H? Maybe H is new? Where is H? Yeah, maybe I ask myself. Sorry, I'm mute if it's okay. Maybe I just maybe I didn't understand. Assume that for any linear. Linear functional functional L it's L. Sorry, sorry for my handwriting. It's L. So for any supported linear functional when you're supporting linear functional, so here is supporting. Okay, sorry. Thank you very much. I didn't understand. Okay, sorry. Totally clear. Here is L is equal to one, which is high. No, it's clear. Sorry. Thanks. So it's just a So, it's just a supporting linear functional. These are its level sets. Okay. And for instance, here is X is a very nice supporting linear functional. So, if you look at the unit circle, traditionally from teaching calculus, though I didn't teach it for already more than 20 years, but say we have a unit circle, and this is the level set x is equal to 1, right? And you ask what is this integral, you ask the students, and To ask the students, and what they do, of course, they parameterize the circle, write down the formula, do some change of variables, and find the answer. That's an absolutely correct way of doing things. However, you can ask what is equal to integral of y squared dx dash. And of course, you don't know what it is yet, but you know that it's the same as integral of x squared ds. Of x squared is and if you integrate the sum of them, integral of x squared plus y squared, you get one half, right? Because it's just you integrate one. And so each of them is one half. The same thing in n dimensions, if you take n coordinate functions and integrate the sum of their squares, you get one over the dimension for each of them. Over the dimension for each of them because they're all equal due to symmetry. So there is no mystery. Now, the way of proving that it's not difficult, I'm not going to explain it. Of course, it's more like an exercise. If you think about the space of linear functionals, it's with norm one, it's a convex set, finite dimensional, Carnok or Theodori. So you can find the extremum of certain. Find the extremum of a certain quantity and then do some differentiation. It's an exercise. I don't want to explain the proof, it's not instructive, but the fact itself turns out to be quite useful. And now I'm going to go to an old story. This is a part of this old story. So it's kind of two here. Which is work on the Hopkin conjecture, which we did jointly with Sir. Judge, which we did jointly with Sir Geovanov. But I'm going to, the thing is that it is written down, but it is not readable and not explained. It was written for verification, as I mentioned. So maybe I'll explain the structure behind that. And the starting point for us was the following theorem, that if you have, you look at an n-dimensional torus with a metric D, here it doesn't matter whether D is Riemannian or Finster, it can be any lengths. Can be any length symmetric on Taurus, then there exists a constant C and a norm on well, let me write it in a very stupid way. Well, let's write it Vn, which is the same thing as universal cover of the Storus. So the Dexter's formation acts there, so this is X there, so this is Z to the N space. I don't want to write Rn, so a norm such that for every two points, for any two points, let me raise that for any two points x, y distance between x, y minus norm of x minus y, no matter how far they are. No matter how far they are. Now, what is very easy that this is less than or equal to little O of D for some norm. And of course, this already tells you that this norm is unique. So there exists an unique term and a norm. So there exists a unique norm here, which is bounded by this constant C. This constant C depends only on D. Okay. Now this Now, this is a rather tricky statement. And an important part of the statement is some nice lemma, which is in generalization of the following fact, which was for Kloor known, that if you take a curve in the plane and you take this vector R, then there is another vector somewhere here, which is in a vector language. Which is in a vector language is equal to R over 2. Now, my contribution to this generalization is minimal. I mean, I realize that this statement should be true, and I realize that this lemma should be generalized, but it was generalized by Faze Nazareth, who generalized it and apparently had a proof, which I didn't understand ever, because for most of things, Faith did it, especially at that time. Things Federated, especially at that time, was some using of Fourier analysis, rather complicated. So then Grisha Periman came up with some proof understandable for me. And my basic contribution, other than just suggesting that it should go, was that I changed the proof in a way that it is less than half a page and fully understandable. The original ideas of digitalization. The original ideas of regionalization are due to Fizz and Azarov. And then, with this thing, you can prove this theorem, which is well, at that point, it was rather surprising. Now, I need to confess that the theorem itself in this form, this inequality, it's much better than, of course, it's little O of distance, whatever the distance you take here, x minus y. But this is a weak thing. But at that point, But at that point, it was very exciting. And to tell you the truth, there is not so much applications of this lemma, other than motivating. And in the discussion of HOF, actually, first of all, once you assume that there are no conjugate points, the proof of the statement becomes much easier. And if you go deeply in the proof, you can see that it actually can be avoided. However, this served as a motivation for Sergei and me to look. Motivation for Sergei and me to look deeper into the geometry of what we call periodic metrics, matrix which are lift with respect to an abelian action. In this case, this is co-compact abelian action. In this case, this is Z to the N. And there is another animal in the zoo here, which is also very important for us. Let's say we have this torus. Taurus. I'll look at this universal tangent bundle, unit tangent bundle of this torus, and you can lift it by some measurable map. Measurable and to a compact domain. Lift it lift L to Lift L to its cover Vn. So you get a fundamental domain. So this thing is a fundamental domain of pi one of the torus, which is just z to the n. And so it has a Louisville measure on it. So there is Louisville measure mu. How do I denote it? Well, how do I denote it? I want a different letter for that. I will use muse for something else. Uh, yeah, I don't have any prepared slides, and on purpose, I realize that whenever I try to deliver a lecture with prepared slides, I go too fast. So, writing down slows me down, and that's the reason. So, I leave there, and there is a Measure. I think there is a question by Samyun. Samuel. Where is it? I'm looking at the chat. Yeah, no, it's not in the chat. It's not in the chat. Oh, okay. Okay. Yes. Okay. Sure. I just missed probably this trivial. So in the theorem, you stated x and y. You state that X and Y are point in the Taurus, right? No, of course not. In the Taurus, it's a triviality because you can bound it by the diameter. It's in the universal cover of the Taurus. And you lift the distance to the universal cover. Of course, everything. I'm going to abuse the Taesis. All local objects, they leave on the torus and they lift to this cover, so there is a projection pi going down. Projection pi going down, and then there's this lift L which I which is which works in one domain, but actually you can discontinuously, but local, I mean any neighborhood can be lifted. Okay, I understood. Thank you. Yeah, so and then you can use the following thing. First of all, for every point Xv from the unit tangent bundle. Unit during the bundle of tn tilde, you can look at geodesic gamma of t, which is exponential map just at the point x of tv. It's a geodesic. And then you can define a map, rho, which sends this point. Now, it's the same as, well, maybe I should have used notations again, it's the same as. It's the same as some point. Well, maybe I'll write pi of x dπ of v, and this is in the tension bundle to the torus. What is important for me is that it's independent. I mean, you can do this projection, it doesn't depend on the lift. And so, rho, this is a rotation vector. Rho of xv is just the limit of 1 over t gamma of t minus gamma of 0. This is subtraction in v. It's non-invariant, but doesn't matter. And actually, this thing is irrelevant, of course. Because as I divide by t, t goes to infinity. t goes to infinity. As I divide by t, this subtraction matters nothing, but it's to assist intuition. If I follow a geodesic, this is my gamma of t, I go to gamma of t, then what is written here, this expression, is just this vector from gamma of zero to gamma of t. So I look at this vector, how I displaced, and then I see that See that, of course, this gamma of zero is irrelevant. You can choose any origin and it matters nothing. You'll see lots of phenomena like that. And then what happens is that this limit exists almost everywhere. It follows from the subadditive ergodic theorem. Rogodic theorem. And in the case of Hoff conjecture, let me remind you, since I'm speaking about this, Hoff conjecture stated that, well, now we're conjectured by Hoff, yes, conjectured by Morse, probably, and Herbund, whatever, Hoff's conjecture. This is Eberhard Hoff. There are two famous Hoffs in geometry, which says that D has no conjugate points, which just means that every geodesic in the universal cover is the shortest path on every segment, implies that D is flat. Notice that here is the difficulty comes because if you think about comes because if you think about Finceletori, this is absolutely not true. So even though the formulation doesn't involve any differential machinery for conjugate points, I don't need to look at the Jacobi equation. I can formulate it in a fully synthetic way. This thing cannot work for Finslematics. There are plenty of conterexamples, but by this time it has shown that any Finslematric defined in the neighborhood of a point has some In the neighborhood of a point, has some neighborhood which can be inserted in a finsted pose without quantity points, so they're badly flexible locally. So, there are plenty of such examples because nothing like that happens in a Riemannian case. And in this case, this limit exists everywhere, not only everywhere. But anyways, I can look at the row of my measure M, and this is going to be a measure on B, where B is. Where B is the unit ball of the null. Okay? So now what happened here? So far I don't know where this measure sits. It doesn't have procedure on the boundary. Actually, there are examples where it can be a delta measure at the origin in this ball. But anyway, we get a rather strange correspondence from a torus. From a torus, n-dimensional torus, with a Riemannian metric. Actually, you can play this with a Finsler metric. It also has a sleeville measure, and everything works up to this point. You go to a norm. So norm for me, which is the same as B in a vector space, and a measure probability measure. Yeah, I should have said that. measure. Yeah, I should have said that when I spoke about this measure mu, normalized integral of mu is equal to one. And so a probability measure mu on b as I said, well this is trivial that this measure lands on b because in time t, we can't go further than distance. We can't go further than distance t, and when you divide by t, you go distance no more than one after an error which disappears as you pass through t goes to infinity because you divide by one over t. So any uniformly bounded errors can be forgotten. And so a lot of things are known about this stuff. A lot of things are not known. So this is a field for with plenty of open questions, including issues. Questions, including issues when this norm can be smooth and when it is necessary non-smooth. And many open questions and many attention was devoted to this topic, but this is not what I'm going to speak about at all. Here, note that if D has no concrete points. This means what? If you look at the definition of this map row, it means that this point is exactly distance t from gamma zero. So in our metric, this distance is one. So in our norm space, well, it's t so in our norm space, it's t up to a constant. So when I divide it by one over t, so it is the same thing as a normal space. So, it is the same thing as a norm up to a constant. And when I divide it by 1 over t, what I'm going to see is that it's on the boundary of the thing. So, what I can see then support of my measure mu is equal to the boundary of B. Now, you see, I'm approaching the situation which was at the very beginning when we had some mesh. When we had some measure of the boundary of a convex body. And now there is a little bit of integral geometry, which is actually the key for this argument. So we are going to see, we see here two objects, two very different, two objects which, and I'm going to badly abuse notations. And of course, I'm going to sweep all technicalities on the carpet. So what are these? Why this is checkered board? I'm just trying to illustrate the Z to the N axi. Just trying to illustrate the z to the n x here, and this is the space vector space v n with the norm, and some objects live in this space. And with the finite house-door distance, there is this universal colour of the torus t to the n. And of course, there are tangent bundles of them. And so they are within finite Rom of caused or distance. And so, every computation is where I don't care about universally bounded error. I can't perform in any of the spaces. And you have some basic tools here, which are Boziman functions. You have Booseman functions of a point P, which is Boziman function. Of here P is going to belong to DB with the boundary of the ray TP in Vn, right? And you have, and if you take a gamma, geodesic, which is exponential map at some point x of T V, the way I wrote it before. The way I wrote it before, you have Booze munction of gamma, which is a function from universal curve of the thing to reals. And I don't need to make much distinction between them because the difference, I can't write this because I define it on different spaces. Still, I write that the difference between BP minus B gamma. So, of course, I mean that rho of gamma here is P is. A is bounded by this constant C, or maybe twice C, whatever it is. Now, how I write this difference, of course, they are different, they live on different spaces, but the spaces are within bounded distance, so I can compare objects. And now, if I want to see how this function changes, I would need to get an extra object here. And for convenience, I assume that p is rational, which gives me a lot of structure, which is easy to obtain. Structure which is easy to obtain. That's not a big deal. Again, there is nothing so far which distinguishes Riemannian Fincer. And here, what we see is that if P is rational, then B is smooth at P. And you have, in general, for every P, you can define a vector field VP as a gradient. As a gradient of the Busiman function of gamma, which is norm of Vp is less than or equal to one, in general defined almost everywhere. And we are fine with that. There's no conjugate point of rational direction, it's defined everywhere. It's easy to see that if P is rational and no conjugate point, the P is everywhere. Everywhere, even smooth. So we have this vector field. And what we can do is we can see how B gamma changes. So how B gamma changes, B gamma of T minus B sorry, well This, I'll call this geodesic gamma p. I fixed the geodesic here, gamma p, which is corresponds to this point p. This gamma is any geodesic, minus b, gamma p, gamma zero. This I put it for just as the adorment here. I take this difference and look at this average. And how I do that is, of course, I can just. Do that, and of course, I can just integrate the scalar product of gamma dot VP and by Cauchy Schwartz. I immediately get that one over t well, I will get rid of this term because, and I'm going to go to yeah, B gamma P of P of gamma of t squared is less than or equal to this integral, the same integral, one over t integral gamma dot v p, but now it's square because we use Cashi-Schwarz. And now, again, we have a function which is actually defined on. On unit tangent bundle to our torus, which is vp dot product. So it's a it's a function and applying to it, applying to it theorem you can end. Can end replacing B gamma by BP. So I'm going from this space tangent bundle T2. I go to my vector space Vn. We get what we actually wanted to get. The integral of B P of Q. B P of Q squared d mu. Now remember, me mu is push-up thing over all. Now I can write the boundary because mu lives on the boundary is less than or equal to one over n, y one over n. Since how we apply Bergov's theorem, what Brighow's theorem is doing here since for For every fixed x from the torus. If I do the fiber integral in the fiber, the integral of W scalar product with VP. Now, at this point, Well, no, no, it's not VP. I should use a different letter here. It should be, of course, V. No, VP, that's correct. At this point, X. With the fiber, X is fixed. So it's a fixed vector. So it's linear functional. It's exactly equal to 1 over N. So what happened here? We transported by Bergoric theorem this integral, fiberwise integral, and this is the only. integral and this is the only point here we do use that d is Riemannian we use the fact that d is Riemannian and that's the only point where it comes up in making this equation and this is this type of integral geometry which which I wanted to to illustrate here now once you know that you know already Once you know that, you know already that this B is an ellipsoid because measuring U, it's very easy to show that it's supported on the entire boundary of B. Furthermore, you go back to Cashi-Schwartz and you see that all inequalities must become equalities. So, almost everywhere the function is constant, and so you get coordinates, and you see that in this coordinates, the matrix is flat. So, the rest there is pure technicality. What I want Purtified. What I wanted to illustrate is how integral geometry works here. And it works through a tool which could be called, and it shows up in many different works, integration along the geodesic flow. So there are two places where integral geometry start comes to spread. Where integral geometry comes. First one was at the very beginning where I spoke about characterization of ellipsoids, which is also given by some integration. And then by integration along the geodetic flow, we send local information, which we have an integral form on our unit tangent bundle of the torus, to its what can be called boundary at infinity with its nice structure. With its nice structure, and then there, as I said, you build a bunch of from this point, everything is purely technical. So I tried to explain the kind of the gist of the matter here without technicalities. Let's go to one more thing. I probably am not going to cover nearly everything I planned to because I Everything I plan to because I have six topics and I probably would cover most three of them. And this is a classical Bezikovich inequality, which is also purely Romanian. There is no Finsta analog of this inequality. What it states is the following thing. States is the following thing. Let's say you have a manifold which you think as a Riemannian cube, topologically. Cube with faces AI, BI, they're opposite faces. And you know, like that, I'll write the simplest formula here. The simplest formula here. You can put different numbers, but whatever they are, it's the same statement. And the distance in the Siemensian metric between A and A I B I is less than or equal to 1 for all i. So opposite faces are, no, no, no, no, what I'm writing here, it's complete nonsense, is just opposite inequality. It's at least. Just opposite inequality is at least one for all AIs. So opposite faces are far apart. Then the conclusion is that the volume of this cube, how do I call it C, is at least one. The proof is not at all very difficult by modern standards and with modern technology, which With modern technology, which can introduce coordinates which are distance functions to faces, or say some of distances to faces, which are going to be Lipschitz. So the Jacobian or less than or equal to one. And for topological reasons, from this condition, you see that the image covers unit cube and Euclidean space. So by this kind of tricks, the original proof, which was sort of complicated. Complicated can be converted into a rather easy argument, but the usefulness of that is great. There are many applications with that, and I want to illustrate that on one question, which goes from something we studied with Sergei a lot, and which is their inverse problems, inverse problems, problems. And we tried as much as we could to stay away from PDEs. To stay away from PDs, even though at the end we happen that we work from PDs for interest problems, but inverse problems work more or less like that. You have a manifold, you can think about it as a disk, and you know, so this is M, this is the boundary of M and for every two points X and Y, so there is Riemannian metric here, and you know the boundary. The boundary distance function, d boundary between x and y for all x and y in the boundary of your m. So you are not allowed to enter. You're allowed only to measure what the distances are. And you want to can one recover D. So we have a map. So we have a map d goes to the boundary distance function. Okay, let's recall it dm. Okay. Of course, in general, you cannot because you can trivially have examples like this type of examples in even in two dimensions. This is a kind of triviality. You can have it's a two-dimensional disk, and you know all distances between points, and you have no idea what. And you have no idea what your metric in this region is because no shortest path goes there. So, if you start changing it a little bit, you wouldn't be able to detect it by boundary measurements. And what we try to do is, of course, to assume that what is called D is simple, meaning that boundary DM is convex. The M is convex and every geodesic segment is a minimizer. Well, we need a little bit more than that. I mean, a little stronger assumption. No conjugate points. Meaning that it can be extended a little bit if you attach some color and still it is a minimizer. Still, it is a minimizer. You may see conjugate points on the boundary, and still it might be a minimizer. But away from that. And the question, in this case, it's a reasonable question. And the answer is affirmative in dimension two. It's a beautiful PDE work by Pesto van Ullman. And what we could prove with Sergei is that this is again probably even not going to get to work with this. Sergey Ivanov. Is that if D is C2 close to Euclidean? The answer is yes in all dimensions. But the way the proof goes is not some specific distance measurements. We don't do that. What we do is actually we do some integral geometry and what we try to do is we look at minimal feelings. We look at minimal feelings, meaning that a metric D prime on the same manifold M on M such that, or anything else with the same boundary as M, this actually doesn't matter seriously, such that distance prime on the boundary of M for any XY is at least that. Y is at least that as distance on our original metric. And we have, if so for any if for any d prime, then volume with respect to d prime of m is at least set as volume with respect to d. With respect to d of m and the equality case implies that d prime is isometric to d of course isometric to d doesn't mean that this is the same metric in the same coordinates. We need to expel the group of diffeomorphisms, but still this is a statement. And the proof goes around again, it's all integral geometry here in the proof, which I'm definitely don't don't Which I definitely don't want to discuss here. I wanted to show some concrete application because it's rather long and involves not only technicalities but some lengths of straightforward computations. Well, I'm not good at computations. Sergei usually says, speaking about speaking to me, that you can solve That you can solve quadratic equation with integer roots after three attempts, and only if someone helps you to find your error in your first two attempts. I'm not good at solving quadratic equation. But as my excuse, I heard a story about Vizikovich, who was one of the greatest analysts of his time as he was crossing the American border. And he wrote that he's a professor of mathematics. Apparently, the border officer was, he took calculus classes. Was he took calculus classes as such? He hated mathematicians. And he said, Okay, your professor of mathematics prove that take an integral. And it requires guessing some substitution. And Bussiman failed. And for the first attempt, it was in the 50s. He was refused entry in the United States. So that's considered my excuse for not being good in computations. However, here is a question: Is now this question stays open? Well, Well, so what we prove? Oh, okay. So again with Ivanov, we prove the Riemannian is strict minimal feeling, minimal feeling. Strict refers to this second part. To this second part. Equality implies that it's the same metric. Feeling provided we know D is close to flat metric. Note that it is very important here that we don't assume anything about D prime. D' can be very far away, that's if you assume that D is. That's if you assume that the prime is in a small neighborhood, things become much easier. Now, what you can say here, it's important to mention that absolutely no Fifinsula. To this question, for Finstler, what do you know of For Finster? You can ask yourself. You can ask yourself: this is unknown. For meaning and feelings, this is unknown. They are not strict, without strict. However, there is a result by Ivanov, who continued this work. So, yes, Ivanov. True if dimension is equal to two, m is a disk. Okay, Sergei, well, it's very specific two-dimensional for physiometrics. In five dimensions, it's an open question. But then, why I mentioned Bisekovich inequality? Besides inequality, you can ask whether this map, so this map there is a map D goes to D on the boundary of M can be can it be locally surjective in any reasonable class Of course, if you assume that geometric is simple, so here is a remark here. If D is simple, this implies in this formulation that DM is smooth. And actually, these things are equivalent. You can use the first relation formula to differentiate this function. This function. So, of course, it's once you try to find a non-smooth boundary distance function, then you have no luck. But in this case, you want to see whether it can be surjective in any smooth class. And the answer is no, not surjective at all. And to show that, I'm going to explore Fincelematics. Finsleymatrix, even though it's not a statement about FinSlemetrics, it's everything here. So here I'm speaking about Romanian metrics. Because of in symmetrics, we don't have even any injectivity, so it's kind of a dead story. However, I'm going to However, I'm going to use Fincele metrics. And here is a simple trick. Take a square in R2 with a standard Euclidean metric. And its area of this cube C, of course, is equal to 1. Now take a fin symmetric, how you take. How you take your phenometric? You locally, so you take a point which is tangent space at X to the plane. And here you see in this plane an ellipsoid, which is a circle. Now change it and make it slightly smaller in the diagonal direction. Smoothly, nicely cup of something. And make a translation invariant to do it in any nice. Station variant to do it in any nice smooth way. So you get a Finste metric. Now it's a Finste metric. By the way, I had to mention, especially for so qualified audience here, that in Ivanov's theorem, actually you can use basically any reasonable Finste metric which is sensitive to the shape of the ball. To the shape of the bulb, for instance, what is called Holmes-Thompson volume, or in this case, surface area. So it's a symplectic projection of standard symplectic volume from cotangent unit disks. Or you can use Busiman, Buseman-Hausdorff measure on that. For either of these two, this thing works, so I don't want to specify them. They all coincide in the Euclidean case. So look at this fin symmetric, and since I The metric, and since I uh changed it, well, no, yes. Uh, what did I do here? Yes, uh, no, I changed it the wrong way and no one yells at me. I should change it differently. Sorry. When I increase the unit ball, when I increase the unit ball, distances decrease, so I need. Decrease. So I need to increase it in this direction. So distances decrease. So Finste metric, so pneumometric D-finsler and the area with respect to this D-Finsler of the C is strictly less than one because I just decrease it in an open set. However, distances, look at the distance take. Look at the distance take the boundary distance function receive for this phensty metric for this phensty metric. It changes, of course. It's some new thing. Since it's a constant metric, it's definitely smooth in any sense you want to say that. And it does not satisfy Bezukovich inequality. So there cannot be a Riemannian metric. not be a Riemannian metric which realizes as a boundary distance function. Seemingly obvious application of basic covid inequality. However, it tells us that this never happens. Now I plan to speak about, as I said, a bunch of other applications. Let me just mention just one of them very quickly because I wanted to formulate a problem at the end, which has to do with one of the themes of the conference. The themes of the conference, magnetic geometry, which is not directly related to integral geometry, although in some sense it does. But I very quickly mention one more thing. I don't remember what the number that was. Maybe it is number four. Indeed, it is four. It is four. Okay, thank you so much. I don't see other pages on the screen. Yes. So So, and this is a work with also Sergei Ivanov and Roshanovikov. There are two versions. The first is rather old for time-independent situation, and I kind of know exactly when it was done because we dedicated the paper to To the 80-year anniversary of my dad. So he's turning 86 this year in June. So it was six years old, but later we wrote a much more complicated paper for time-dependent things. And here is the story. You have a vector field V on Rn with three conditions. V is M ellipses. Ellipses. M could be a huge number. Huge. Second condition is that divergence of V is equal to zero, which apparently means that I'm going to think about some sort of a volume-preserving flow. Let's say it's R3 for simplicity, so it doesn't matter. Seriously. And the third condition. Seriously, and the third condition, since I'm thinking about flow, is that it has zero mean average shift asymptotic, which basically means the following thing. If I integrate on a V d volume over Q. The volume over cube cube of size L divided one over L squared. Take the limit L I'm sorry L what is dimension three so it should be L cube the volume of the cube as L goes to infinity it should be equal to zero well it is not so important be zero it can be Be zero, it can be okay, less than one minus some number epsilon. And now I take, I'm looking at a fish, and my fish can move, move with speed less than or equal to one, wherever I want to. Now, autonomous cases V is a map from our. V is a map from R3 to tangent space of R3, a section. In other cases, V is R3 cross R time, the same space, T R3. It turns out that this is true in both cases. What I'm going to say in a moment, it's speed can move. Can move. Can it travel from any given X to given Y. And what does it mean trivial? It means that you prescribe velocity of the fish, V of T for the fish. And you look at solution gamma dot of t is equal to v of t. It's our control for the fish. And of course, the length of v, big v, is less than or equal to one. This is the speed of the fish, plus our vector field, which we can do anything with that, which is v of where you are. V of where you are, gamma of t and time t and the answer is affirmative. Clearly, the zero mean drift is absolutely needed and because otherwise if everything moves to the right with speed two. The right with speed two, and a fish is feeble and can move faster than one, it can do anything. It's sort of like you flush it down the toilet. However, in general, this doesn't happen. I mean, with that assumption, it doesn't happen. Like people drown in tidal streams, say on the beach near Tel Aviv a lot, but of course there is no But of course, there is no immune drift, the water stays there, and it's faster than even very professional swimmers. And professional swimmers drown there even more than other people because they're more self-confident and they try to fight the stream. Of course, fighting the stream when it can have speed 100 and the speed of your fish is basically one, no more than one. It's useless. You need to choose some smart strategy. The proof is non-constructive, but The proof is non-constructive, but the core of the proof is purely geometric. And what I don't have time to show at all is that it's based on a bunch of applications of geometric merge theory. Like you study a reachability set and you prove that its boundary is nice and like local Lipschitz graph, or you can work with BV functions. Functions as solutions of corresponding G equations and such. And then you show that eventually the set intersected with any cube occupies the whole cube. And for that, you use actually several times slicing and coercion inequality. I won't be able to explain this, but even I wrote a couple of formulas that wouldn't help. The paper in Antonio's case in Autonomous case in non-autonomous case, the proof is more than 10 pages. So I wouldn't be able to do that. But at least this is an idea that in a problem where initially it seems to be almost no integral geometry, it comes in. In the remaining minute, I have a challenging idea of formulating a problem which essentially was formulated by myself and Anton Petrun. Well, actually, it's all those. It's obviously a formulational question I asked to Anton, who has, I believe, a smart solution of this problem. I didn't quite understand it, but I'm pretty sure he has that. I think I have a very dull and boring solution, but it's in dimension two. And in higher dimensions, I want to leave it as a problem. So here is the thing: you have a disc, two-dimensional disk, D2, curvature. Curvature is less than or equal to zero, and the curvature geodesic of the boundary is always less than or equal to one. Then the area of the disk is at least pi. It sounds like a very classic statement, but for some reason, For some reason, it's formulated in immediately. Very, very funny thing: a cat zero disk whose curvature bound, it's like some sort of has a parametric inequality, but there is no perimeter, nothing, just curvature with a boundary. Then the area is at least pi. Anton's idea was to use a differential version of the arm lemma, Cachi arm lemma, for card zero spaces. Zero spaces. I didn't check the details of his argument. My proof is so boring that I don't want to explain it, but doesn't matter. The question here is, so this is with Petrone. At least Anton has a proof which he checked. I didn't completely check mine, but it seems to be also working. It's different and less smart. And the question. Less smart. And the question: what? For D3. Here you can assume that the strongest assumption that any principal curvatures of this disk k principle of the boundary of the boundary of the three are less than or equal to one. Than or equal to one, then volume of this disk. For this question, I believe none of us has an answer. Maybe Anton by this time invented some argument. I am at a loss how to do that, and we don't see any conterexamples so far. So it's kind of it's a generalization. So maybe there are conterexamples. I'm not trying to think about mean curriculum. We assume the strongest thing possible. Now I'm already two minutes over my time. Now I'm already two minutes over my time, so thank you very much for listening. Unfortunately, I didn't get to do other things. Thank you. I think it's time to thank you. I'm trying to see if there are any questions from the audience. There are many topics that have been covered by Dina. Let's see in the chat. I'm sorry, I forgot where is the I'm sorry, I forgot where is the raise your hand option, so I just interrupted everyone. Thank you very much for the thought. I have a question about the Nazarov, Perelman, Burago theorem. So what do you assume about the distance function? What theorem? That a periodic metric has a staple norm. Well, the final statement. The final statement is attributed by me, so the distance between, so I assume nothing. So I have n-dimensional torus and this D is intrinsic metric. Intrinsic. Okay. Nothing. I don't even need it to be. Yeah. What is a metric then? There exists a C and a norm within finite grammar. Gromov host or distance to formulate it clearly. Now, what is Nazareth Nazareth, Grisha Piranhman, and myself as a kind of suggesting it and then making it readable in a sense is as. In a sense, is a lemma, and since it's over time, I can tell you what the lemma is. The lemma is quite funny. You have a curve in Rn gamma. Then you can find a bunch of vectors here. Let me, then you can find vectors R1, R2, let's say Rn over 2, roughly speaking. Rn over 2, roughly speaking, maybe Rn over 2 plus 1 or minus 1, doesn't matter. Ri, so let me draw them rather than writing something. Here are the vectors. In R3, one vector is not enough. You may need two vectors such that the sum of R i's. This is my vector R. These are R1, R2, and so on. RIs is equal to R over 2. Is equal to r over two. So this is in fact a topological statement, and this is a lemma for this theorem. Okay, by the way, even in the plane, in the plane, this number, let's call it m 4r2, m is equal to 1. So you can find m is equal to one. So you can find just one vector here. However, what you can say is that this vector r, which is r1, is one over two of the whole vector r, right? You can write this formula r1 is equal to one over n one over k one over lambda times r. And this is true. And this is true for lambda belongs to natural numbers. It's not true for any coefficient. So if you put here one over square root of 10, you can find a control exam. So the idea of pulling that directly by like, you know, naively saying that, okay, this is my vector. Then I start moving this line and see when I see one half, you may not do that. You may not do that unless, well, for one half, you find it, but not by continuity argument, because for such continuity argument, you can put here any coefficient lambda. But nonetheless, it does not work not true otherwise. Okay, so which means that it's a little bit more than just moving this line, but they all are statements. So that's some key lemma in the proof of the theorem. Is that some key lemma in the proof of the theorem? Yeah, that's at least one of the key lemmas. There are two lemmas. Of the key lemmas, there are two lemmas which are important, and this is one of the two lemmas in the proof. Yes, thank you. And you also mentioned that there is a half-page proof somewhere. Could you indicate where one can find it? I do not know, but it's now so short that I can reproduce it now for those who are interested, because official time I think is over, but this is Zoom. So if you want, I can just immediately reproduce it on basically one slide. On basically one slide. Okay, so maybe after the question session is over, I will know where it is written properly. Maybe I wrote it down somewhere. I think I wrote a paper about that, and I think it is written somewhere in its readable short form. Thank you. Grisha's argument used some simplicial complexes and all kinds of technology. Complexes and all kinds of technology. Cesar Nazaros was even worse. It used advanced Fourier analysis, and the proof now it's more elementary. Yes, I think it's written. I can try to find reference. Yeah, I think it's a paper called Periodic Metrics, Tima. You wrote a long time ago. It could be. Yeah, it's written. I read it as one of the other students, I remember that. Any other question? Any other question by the audience? My baby's slide. Maybe we stop the question session and so we can listen to you. And I remember for people who are going to live that we start again tomorrow at 8 time from Oahaka time. Thank you again. Thank you. Goodbye. Do you want the proof? No, if it is written somewhere, even though what I wrote at that time, I hardly can understand now. This grammar, the proof is so simple after all simplifications. It's a direct application of. It's a direct application of Borsa-Coulomb's theorem in a very trivial way. It's just basically the following thing. You think of for the curve, you take any partition of the interval into intervals x1, etc., x, k, where k is an appropriate number depending on n. So k is n plus 1 probably. So the sum of x i is. So the sum of xi's is equal to one. So you can, each x i you put it to be yi squared because they are non-negative numbers. So here are on the sphere in R n plus one. One with and now you form the sum of, let's say, you curve with gamma is a curve. You can take gamma of, so xi is the distances of intervals. It's not a partition. So partition yi, xi is yi plus 1 minus yi, and you take gamma of yi. Take gamma of yi plus one minus gamma of yi. It's a map from the sphere, and there is a missing information here. And you multiply it by sine of yi. Sine of yi. Now I'm doing some kind of a trick here. Now yi is already used, so this is called them the i's. As you want the i, as you want the i, sine of yi, where now I need to map from the sphere. So I assign, so for point y1, y n plus 1 in the sphere, we assign xi to be yi squared. Yi squared, but still I have signs them, so I can multiply by them. And then, of course, I get phi from the sphere to Rn, which is antipodal, and then by Borsuk there exists. There exists a point y in the sphere such that phi of y is equal to zero. And you immediately see that if you regroup positive numbers in negative guys, you get zero, each of them is going to be one half of the total displacement because the sum of them without signs is the total displacement and they are equal because with signs they give zero. Because with signs, they give zero. That's the end of the proof. It's really a very short proof, which is kind of on the surface when you know it. So it requires even in printed version requires less than half a page. I think I overstayed your hospitality. Thanks for explaining it. I'll try to fill in the details. Okay. Okay, thank you everyone. Thank you. Just for sharing that's not done. See you tomorrow. Thank you very much. Bye.
