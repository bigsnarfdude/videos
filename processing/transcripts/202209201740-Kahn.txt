There are synchronicities, and just this afternoon, I got a message saying that the paper is basically accepted. Thank you. So we find it bearing What is it about? Well, it starts with the model weight theorem. Which tells you that if you have A an abelian variety over a normal field K. A number of fields K. Then the group of rational points of A over K is finitely generated a group. And there are two ingredients in the proof. First one is. First one is what is called weak model V, which is that A of K mod N is finite for some integer n greater than one, and the second one is the theorem of hypes. And it works like this. So if you have take a to define the height, you need a very ample line bundle over A. And then this gives you maybe in a centrality space, let's say I, and you get a height function HL, which is the pullback of the canonical height function, let's say H O of one over the projective space. Over the projective space, which is given well, roughly, you take a point and you take the maximum absolute values of its coordinates, right? And then this function is approximately quarantic and And the positive definite. And the point is that let's say the number of points of bounded height, let's say less than some integer n is finite. So well, it's a function of the points on the points of A, which is an embedded group. It takes values in R. Yes, here I'm taking the logarithmic height, which means that I take the log of the absolute values. Okay, so the sequel of the story is that by Nehru and Plate, there exists a unique quadratic form, H L hat, quadratic form on A of K well real valued. real valued, say k to r which is positive definite and which approximates H L, which means that the difference between H L and H L hat is bounded. Okay. Okay. And the point is that the discriminant of H L hat appears in the Birch and Swinet and Dyer conjecture. And that's the origin of the problematic of how. Of the problematic of height pairings, which is to generalize this thing at least conjecturally. So, to do that, I want to first reformulate this story in cycle-theoretic terms. Cycle theoretic. Theoretic reformulation. So, as far as I understand, it works like this. You can define a height function not only for very ample line bundles, but for every line bundle. Oh, to be quadric, I think you need L to be symmetric. Symmetric. But never mind. So if for because you can extend this definition to all line bundles by because it's additive in L. So if you take A cross the dual variety, you have the Poincaré bundle. So, I do not know how to write it. And so it gives a height HP A which goes from A of K cross L hat of K to R. So the Poincaré bundle is. The Poincaré bundle is not very ample at all, but you have this function which gives you actually a pairing of inner groups between this and these two R, which is perfect. So I think it's in Neyron's paper, but I don't know a proper reference for this. And then if you have a line bundle, a very ample line bundle over A, then it gives you a map from A map from an isogeny from A to A hat. And when you do this, you get back the height pairing. Sorry? Yes. That's a bit. No, that's right. It's a quadratic linear. It's quadratic, but it might have a linear part. And finally, it gives you a pairing between this and these two R. So if you use this, for instance, I could take for a smooth predictive variety over K. Or okay, and I can use the duality between the Picard variety and the Albanese variety X0 X and X and then this yields appearing from Chawan. Char one of X, the cycles which are homologically equivalent to zero, cross, let's say that D is the dimension of X cross child D of X, homologically equivalent to zero, which is just zero cycles to R, which is not perfect because there is Perfect because there's the Albanese economy. Never mind. This is the height pairing, the basic height pairing. And I think this is already written in Nehron's paper. Sorry? Here is Ch C H one and here's C H D. Okay, home, it's ho cycles homologically going to zero. Cycles homologically equivalent to zero. So here you get peak zero of x, and here you get just the degree zero. And home is unambiguous because you have the comparison isomorphisms in the characteristic zero. Okay. And then the issue that Block and Daly and Son studied in the Studied in the early 80s was to generalize this to an equimension. So shall i fix homologically from zero cross shaw d plus one. Now d plus one minus i from x to r so you see if I was taking the intersectional product I would have the sum of the two would be d but here it's d plus one and I take subgroups uh cycles homologically equivalent to zero and they they wanted such pairings and they They wanted such pairings and they constructed such pairings so that they can at least get a formulation of a conjecture for special values of L functions at other integers than S equals one, which they did. Okay, so and then they give the they give two different They give two different constructions independently. And moreover, so maybe I'll write it over there. The difference between the proofs of Negro and Tate are that. Tate are that Tate's proof is very simple and very algebraic, and Nehron's proof is richer because it gives a decomposition of this function into local factors. So you have local height pairings. And here it's the same, so independently block and bring it on. Give local height pairings which add up to this global height pairing and moreover Bailinson gives a global construction When k is a function field, because after all, you would like to have this not only model model theorems true over any global field. So C is a curve. So it's with values. So it's with values in QL, where L is a prime different from the characteristic. And that's using methods. So it's intersection cohomology. Okay, so that's the story of the 83, 84 like this. And then, ah, and Bailey Sun asks So question Benison asks what happens if you take a function field in more than one variable. Okay, so then come in Russler and Samuel Lee. So it's 2019. So there was a K-theory workshop at Oberwolfar and Samuel. Workshop at Obervolfar, and Samuel explained what they did. So, they take an algebraically closed field, and B is a smooth variety. So, let's say that its function field is capital K, and then you take a smooth partial. Take a smooth projective variety or capital K of dimension D. And then they construct the following forms. So it goes from forms. So it goes from I. I'm going to put L for homological equivalence relative to eladic cohomology. But x cross char d plus 1 minus i. So I yes and L L is different from the characteristic. Okay. Okay so it takes values in h two of b q l of one and the method is an extension of Benitzon's method. It's using paras sheaves in analytic cohomology. So if If B has dimension one and is projective, you have a trace map which goes to QL and then you get back Beninson's height pairing. So when I listened to his talk, I thought that There's a peak B, let's say char one of B, which goes there. So why couldn't one refine this pairing to a pairing here? And so that's what I'm going to talk to explain here. Okay. So uh Yeah, so uh explain so we are as above but k is any field. But I'm keeping this setup. And then I want to work with the category ab tensor queue. That's the category of abelian groups up to isogeny. So it's the, if you like, it's the cell quotient of category of abelian groups by By the full subcategory, the self-subcategory of ability groups of finite exponents. And it's a very nice category. I like to work with this category a lot because it maps to Q vector spaces, but it's much finer. This functor tends to This functor tensoring with q factors through this. It's a q-linear category, but you see it retains much more information than here. For instance, if you take a group of finite exponents, it goes to zero, of course. But if you take q mod z or q l mod z l, it survives here. So I'm going to formulate something in this category. And so the construction. And so the construction is for any i greater than zero, some subgroup shao i of x upper zero, which is containing sha i of x. And actually, I'm going to tell you more. Tell you more about it. No, maybe I'll see it after that. And then I have pairings like this: chow i with x upper zero cross chow d plus one minus i. plus one minus i of x upper zero to char one of b but this pairing these these are really genuine abelian groups but this pairing lives in this category ab tensor q if you don't like this category you just tensor char one of b with q Okay, and then of course one would like to compare the two pairings. So, what's the connection between this group and this subgroup and this subgroup? Well, this is what I can say about this subgroup so So proposition. Let's see. We have some inclusions. Char i. So here's my subgroup. Char I of X zero. So it's squeezed at least between cycles algebraically equivalent to zero and cycles numerically equivalent to zero. Equivalent to zero. Yes, this is a C. This is an inclusion. And so, therefore, we have equality if I equals one or D, so in this category. This category. Okay. And then also this group shaw i of x mod shaw i of x upper zero is finally generated free. And then I have a conjecture. I have a conjecture, which is that this is always an equality of all i. So that this subgroup is really cycles numerically equivalent to zero, which implies a weaker conjecture, which is that That shall i L of X is contained in shaw I of X sub zero. So which will be true for I equals one and D. So if this conjecture is true, it makes sense to compare these two pairings. And then this is true in some cases. In some cases, okay, so maybe this is conjecture one, and this is conjecture two. So, conjecture two is true well. Well under dictate or the Hodge conjecture but it's very messy so I wanted to write it up in the paper and then it's so messy that I left it. It's not very helpful. It's just for philosophy. And it's also true. And it's also true when X has good reduction relatively to B which I'm going to explain in five minutes. And in this case The two pairings are compatible, which is proven by Roswell and Sandrich. Okay, so that's the general situation. Yeah. Yeah. So, yes, here I should really write B over K bar because they work over an algebraic closed field. So, this pairing is when we can compare them, it's richer than this one because this map has a kernel, right? And I think I won't have time to talk, to say anything about. To talk to say anything about this kernel, but one can say things about it. Okay. No, even over the algebraic closure, you have a peak zero of B. No, no, no, I mean that one of them is equal to the factorization of the other one. Is that what you mean by compatible? Yes, or to form a to format. Yes, to formulate this, you don't even need to pass to the algebraic closure. Yes, because I mean they state the theorem over k bar, so they get something for x k bar, but then it okay so for the remainder of the this talk, I'm going to explain the idea to construct this pairing. Maybe my point was also to avoid any co-homology to get something which is purely cyclo-theoretic. And for some reason, I prefer numerical equivalence to homological equivalence. So that's going to show in the constructions. So, and also the starting point of the idea is very simple. Simple minded. So, situation is like this: we have X over K, and then B is a model of K over the smaller field. And then, suppose that I have a spread X over B. So let me. So let me call, yes, this one is F, this one, if I need it, is going to be F eta, and this will be J, right? So assume that I have a diagram like this, where X is smoother over K and F is probable. Over k and f is proper, a projective. Then I can do the following. I can look at the intersection pairing for curly x, shaw i of x cross shaw d plus one minus i of x, which goes to d plus one. b plus one of x oh sorry of a curly x and then i can push forward to b and then i get into chow one of b so i get a pairing like this and one would like to shrink to go from colleagues to x that's that's the game and the And the starting point of the game is trivial. It's this. Suppose I have a closed subset of B, which is of co-dimension strictly bigger than one, then Then sha one of B is the same as SHA1 of B minus Z. That's why you should certainly not insist that B is projective. And therefore, we can remove F inverse of Z from colleagues. From colleagues. And so whenever I have a closed subset of co-dimension bigger than one, it doesn't count. Can remove it. And I get to points of co-dimension one. And that's when the trouble begins. There has to be some trouble. And there you have to work. And moreover, you have to work so much that you have to end up with a smaller subgroup to have a height variant. Pairing. So, well, now I'm going to explain how this is defined in two steps. So let's say, yes, step one. It's a semi-stable case. So I will say, I will give a definition. F, which is in this diagram, ah, well, let's say let B be a point of B of codimension one. Then F is semi-stable. At B, if well the inverse image of B is a strict normal crossing divisor in the inverse image of O spec O B D right. B, right? Sorry? Yes, yes, reduced. Strict reduced. It's not the same notion of semi-stable as in previous talks, but I'm told that they are closely related. Don't ask me why. So, and actually, this is overkill for what I need. All I need is that. What I need. All I need is that this closed subset in here, all its irreducible components are smooth and have codimension one. But in practice, that's what is going to pop up from the constructions. I think I'm going to keep this. To keep despairing just in case right, so that's okay. So then Ah, and of course, uh, F is semi-stable if it is semi-stable at B for any V of co-dimension one. And you notice that F is generically smooth, so this condition is. So, this condition is automatic except for finitely many points B. So, it's not, it's quite reasonable. So, if, so assumption, hypothesis for the moment in step one, F is semi-stable. Ah, yes, maybe this is going to be the definition. This is going to be definition one and then definition two. So let's say first I'm going to define how is it? B or P in point of co-dimension one I will define shaw i of curly x zero without parenthesis sub B that's the set of R but are removed so I'm going to put back So, I'm going to put back this partition square. Okay, so that's the classes in chow I with X such that J upper star alpha. J upper star alpha is zero. Is it zero? No, no, no. Sorry. J upper star alpha is numerically equivalent to zero. That's for the generic point. And so let me write it. So I'll define kappa lambda in the second, kappa lambda. Second, kappa lambda star of alpha is in sha i numerically equivalent to zero of d alpha d lambda for any lambda where I write f inverse of b as a union of d lambdas that's the D lambda, that's the irreducible components. And kappa lambda is the version of d lambda into x. And this pullback makes sense because the parallel x is smooth. Okay, so that's at one point. That's at one point, then shaw i of x zero is just the intersection of sha i of x zero b and it's a finite intersection. Yes, because whenever it whenever this is smooth, it's automatic. It's automatic. And then shaw i of x. Now, this is, sorry. This is not curly x, this is straight x. So zero is the image of i of curly x sorry zero in Charlie or now. Uh but uh what uh oh no no no, it's not automatic. No no you are yes, you're absolutely right. It's not automatic. So a priori it's in infinite intersection. Yes, but this is the definition. And then From the notation, it's not clear, but this group does not depend on the choice of the semi-stable model, which is actually the proof of this is quite substantial. It doesn't depend and it behaves well with respect to the To the action of correspondences. If I have an X1, an X2, then the action of correspondences will carry this subgroup to X1, to the one for X2. Okay, so the main result for the key point. Is that favour class in child I of X, so it's called X 0 and a class in complementary dimension plus 1 early X, then if this class beta vanishes. Beta vanishes at the jerric point. Then I had my ah, I raised my height, my pairing. Yeah. So I had the Remember this construction by push forward. Some people know how to organize their boards and some people don't. So sorry about that. So if we have this condition, then f lower star of alpha beta is zero. So actually, to explain this, I should really have put child D. Chow D plus one of X and here F lower star chow one of B right and the proof is it's technical but it's not too difficult and the the main ingredient for for the two facts I said that it's independent of the choice and this is Fulton's refined Gizin maps. Fulton's refine geysin maps. The gig file A is zero, and it's comes from something to the fiber, and the alpha is numerically a good one, real on the file. So here's Uh yes, but you have to be careful. Uh
