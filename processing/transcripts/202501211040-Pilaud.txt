Is there a chair that nobody is sitting in? All right, welcome back to our second talk of the morning. Moissant is going to tell us about Is going to tell us about polycoats and lattices. Okay, so thanks a lot for organizing this meeting. The audience is quite impressive for me. I learned lattice theory from the remote models. So I want to tell you a little bit about the ties between polytops and lattices. And I wanted to start with these two sentences by Pro that are really useful, particularly for young people. I put these two sentences in all. African people. I put these two sentences in all my print applications. So he says that the biggest lessons that he learned from Richard Sanre are that combinatorial objects want to be partially ordered and they want to belong to polytopes. And I actually claim that they want to do both simultaneously. So that's what the talk will be about. So we'll start with lattices from polytopes, we'll speak about typographic lattices. Then we'll turn to polytopes. Then I will turn to polytops from lattices. I will speak about remote head performances. And then, okay, we'll do polytops from lattices from polytopes. I will speak about quotient tops beyond the weight order. And then I think the first open question of this talk is actually to understand good question to actually iterate. So I will stop here because I don't have more ideas, but please feel free to iterate. Okay, so let's start with that. Okay, so let's start with lattice from Polytos. I simplified a little bit from what I explained in the notes. I will just speak about the hypergraphic lattice. So I start with a hypergraph on N, so just a bunch of sets, N. And out of this hypergraph, I can construct the hypergraph equality, which is just the Minkowski sum of the faces of the standard syntax corresponding to each set. Into each set. And so this hypergraphic polytope is a deformed permitah, so there's a natural orientation on it. You can orient it in the direction from the identity permutation to the reverse permutation, and you get a poset. This poset, I call it the hypergraphic poset. So here is an example. I just take uh my hypergraph is one, two, three and one, three, four. I do the Minkowski sum of this uh blue and red phase. This blue and red phase, I get this polytope. I orient it in this direction, and I get this. So, some edges might disappear in the Heisenberg, but I get this nice poset, which here is a lattice. So, the first problem of what I want to present is to try to characterize the hypergraphs for which this hypergraphic poset is a lattice. So, maybe let's try to think a little bit about this hypergraphic lattice. A little bit about this hypergraphic analysis. So, the first thing is that when you do Minkowski sums, Minkowski sum behaves nicely with respect to normal fans. So, the normal fan of the Minkowski sum is a common requirement of the normal fans of the summit. And in particular, if you work this out, then you realize that the vertices of the hypergraphic prototype correspond to what we call acidic orientations of H, which are maps. Which are maps from H to L, so that the image of H is in H and there is no cyclone. So you want this to be acyclic. This is a definition of a cyclone. And you can also work out what are the edges that correspond to orientation flips. You might want to read this definition or not. So the important thing is that if you don't like polyhedral geometry, this is pure combinatorics. So you can still join us. I'm not sure whether it's a good advertisement because I did. Sure, whether it's a good advertisement because I do like polyhead of geometry. If you do like polyhead of geometry, it is still polyhead geometry. But anyway, you can still do that. So, some examples of hypergraphic possets. So, if you take the whole element subsets, you take the config graph, like the Multovsky sum of the segments corresponding to the whole edges, then what you get is the permitahedron, the classical definition of the permitahedron. The hypergraphic postet is a recorder, so it's a lattice. If you take as your hypergraph, you take all intervals of one n, what you get is a classical Lotus of the Lanhidron. So the hypergraphic positive is the Damari lattice. In these two cases, it's an ice lattice. Okay, so I want to tell you two particular families in which I can answer these questions. Like I mentioned, and the goal of the Like I mentioned, and the goal of the project is to find all the families, or maybe to answer in general, I don't know, depending on the time we have. So, the first family is a family of graphic at zonotops. So, what we do is our hypergraph is just a graph. The hyper edges have size two. So, I start from a direct graph for some reason. Then I construct the graphical arrangement, which is an arrangement of hyperplane xu equal to xv for uv in the graph. And this is the normal arrangement. Normal arrangement to the graphical zonotope, which is this what I define as a hypergraphical polytope, is the Minkowski sum of all edges over this arts, these edges. And as we said, the vertices of this graphical zonotope, which correspond to the regions of the arrangement, are in projection with acyclic orientations, acyclic reorientations of the graph T. And the positive regions, which we And the post set of regions, which I called before the hypographic post set, is actually the acyclic orientation posset of D. So what is this acidic orientation posset? So here it makes sense to start from a directed graph. Then I look at all possible acyclic orientations of D. So I pick some edges which I reorient and I want the result to be acyclic. And I order by inclusion of these reverse arcs. Okay, so I start from this green. From this green directed graph, and then some of the edges I reorient and I order by inclusion of the red sides. So on bottom, I have the graph I started from. On top, I have the opposite graph. This graph is cell cell dual, you can just reorient everything. The and the cover relations they correspond to flipping a thing about. That's not completely obvious. It's obvious if you if you think of this picture. If you think of this picture, you just pass one hyperplane. And the arcs that you can flip, they correspond to the transitive reduction of the orientation you are at. So for example, in this orientation, I will not be able to reorient this arc because it is already obtained by transitivity from these three arcs. So if I only reorient this one, then I get a cycle. In in both, these are the arcs that I can adopt. Arcs that I cannot lattice. Okay, so examples: if D is a forest and what I get is a Boolean lattice, it's very interesting. If D is a tournament, then what I get is a flucon. Okay, so I answered in 2021, actually it's published, no, I forgot to play that, uh to the question when is this acidic orientation post at the lattice? And actually I I forgot to say it was uh this question was uh asked by uh David uh David Spire on Matt Overflow, I just didn't notice it, so it's not mentioned in my paper. Sorry for that. So the acidic orientation process is a lattice even if and only if the graph is vertebrate. And surprisingly, it's a very simple condition. So you want that if you pick any induced subgraph of D and you compute the transitive reduction, so the Heiseti graph, the opposite of the transitive program, then you want it to be a forest. So here, Okay? Uh so here um I have a lattice if I have for example if I compute the transitive relation of this graph then I get only this path. But here the transitive revolution of this graph is this graph. It's not the forest, so this one is not the lattice. And here you see why. These two elements have no joint. Okay and actually you can compute in this lattice easily and for that you need Easily, and for that you need uh equivalence of the inversion set. Uh and what is inversion set? The inversion set is uh the set of red arcs. Okay, so uh if this uh D is vertebrate, so if I have a lattice and the subsets of arcs which I can reorient to get something acyclic are what I call bi-closed sets. So it's a very simple version of bi-closeness compared to what we call the people try to do. But if you have a characterization of this. But you have a characterization of these red sets. And now, if you want to compute the means of the joints, what you're doing is just computing intersections or unions of unions of red sets or green sets and taking crop transfer. So that we have a characterization of which are the possible red sets and the possible green sets, we can really just compute. Okay, so now you can go further. We know when it's a lattice. We can ask when is it a distributive lattice, when is it a semi-distribution? Is it a distributive lattice? One is it's a semi-distributive lattice, and so on. So, distributive is not too interesting. The distributive acidic orientation process are precisely just a Boolean lattice. We need to have it first. It's not super interesting. If you want semi-distributive, it's much more interesting. So, you want first to have a lattice, so you need this vertebrate condition that I gave before. And you want an additional condition for being semi-distributive, which is the condition of being filled. So, filled means that each time you have an arc and the direct. An arc and a directed path which goes from the source to the sink, then you must have a tournament here which should see all possible edges. So, for example, this one is okay, and this one is bad because I have this arc, I have this path, so I'm missing two edges here for the total. So, you can think of skeletal graphs as you start from a directed tree, or for let me say it's true, you start from a directed tree, and then you choose some. A direct tree, and then you choose some paths, and on this path, you just glue a turnout. That's what the scale-talon graph is. Okay, so that was the first time in it, graphical zoomotot. And now, sort of in the opposite side, it's what I call interval hypergraphs. So, you take a hypergraph whose sets are intervals of one n. Of one end. Okay, so I represent it this way. And in black, I represent the elements that I have chosen in my CD implementation. So they are interesting. So if you claim that you have some interesting families in this family, so if you take all intervals, you get the sisahedron, as we already mentioned. If you take all initial intervals, then you get the Bitmars Nandle polytope, which is combinatively pure. If you take all initial intervals, If you take all initial and final intervals, you get the freehedron, which may be a lattice. And if you take only nested or disjoint intervals, then what you get is a 30-dotops of column. This is sort of a familiar in which you have maybe some interesting polytopes. So, yes, sure. How do you go up? What's the current regulation to this particular one? You can, well, I can, I mean, this is what I showed and said these are the edges. And I told you, we don't want to read it right now, but it's And I told you we don't want to read it right now, but if you have a description of the edges, which is so you just move, you choose an i, you choose a j, and everything which contains i and j, and which has i as a point, you switch it to j. Very simple. Okay, so in this with uh Nantel Bergeron, we also have uh studied which one which ones are lattices, distributive lattices and semi-distributive lattices. So maybe the results are not as appealing, maybe lattice is easy, so Maybe lattice is easy. So, this interval hypergraphic posset is a lattice if and only if I is closed in the intersection. I guess this is swatched. Sorry about that. For distributive lattices, we also have a characterization, which is not too bad, so you want first to have a lattice, so each time you take a non-empty dissection, you want it to be in height, but you also want it to be initial or final. Want it to be initial final in any upper edge containing this intersection. So let's see here, for example, here you have a lattice because it's closed on the intersection. But you have this, so this intersected with this, so this one, three intersected with two, four gives you two, three. So that's okay, it's here, it's a lattice, but it's not initial or fine, I mean one, four, so you fail to be uh distributed. And for semi-distributive, well, there is a condition. Well, there is a condition. It was painful to find it and to prove it, but there is a condition. Just one chance that there is a condition. Okay, so here is a summary of this first problem. For graphical zomotopes and for interval hypergraphs, we have a characterization of which ones are lattices, non-lattices, lattices, semi-distributive lattice, and distributive lattice. And I want to do semi-half classical. And I want to do similar classification for arbitrary hypergraphs, maybe some families. I don't know. So, this is what we have to cover. And I was thinking that since Felix already worked on that, so Felix is a PG student of Nortel and partly myself, and he already started studying that, so I think it will just lead this project. Okay, any questions? Okay, so we'll switch the topic completely, so take a glass. Yeah. Drink. Stretch your legs. Okay, let's just go for commercial. So just more commercial, we have a postdoc position in Barcelona starting soon. It's a two-year position in this Spanish-German Community Politopsy project. So you will work with Arnaud Patrol. So you will work with Arnold Open Roll, Pichu Stupham and Sen and himself, which is good. So if you want some details, go to this web page. You have to apply before January 31st. It's quite easy. Just don't forget to include two sentences of program. Otherwise, I shouldn't get. Okay, so let's go to the second topic. And second topic is polytops from lattices. So I want to speak about removal hedon dogs. So the So the idea of this topic is from Naden reading that lattice congruences on the recorder know a lot about combinatorics and geometry of Cox levels. And it keeps, I mean, this sentence keeps being so important in my life. So I want to speak a little bit about the lattice questions. We already mentioned it in some talks, but we could just go through an example. So here are two lattices, the record on permutations and the timer lattice on And the tamarilattis on binary trees. These are the cover relations. And what is interesting here is that they are related by a congruence relation, a quotient relation. So you can define an equivalence relation here on the recorder so that the quotient will be the tamarind lattice. You have several ways to define it. Let me do the following way. For each binary tree, I will associate a congruence class, which is seriously congruent. So, how does it work? I start from the binary tree. From the binary tree, I label it in order, and I orient it from bottom to top. So it's a positive now. And the corresponding class of permutation will be the set of more linear extensions of this posit. So here I want one smaller than two smaller than three, and four smaller than three, but I don't care whether four is bigger or smaller than one and two. Okay, so I get three permutations, and this is a class of the string. So this turns out to be a lattice congruence, which is an equivalence relation compatible with this. Equivalence relation compatible with the lattice operations. So you can lattice quotient and you get the lattice, the tamilatice. Okay, so the good thing is that, okay, so you can do that at the level of lattices, but you can also do that at the level of geometry. So the first thing is that you can start from, sorry, first level is the level of fan. So fan is a collection of cones which behave properly. So on the left you have here the bread fan, so the fan defined by the bread fan so the fan defined by the bread arrangement hyperpane xu equals xv for only v and on the so it has one chamber for each permutation and on the right you have the CPS definite which has one chamber for each binary tree and the following way so the chamber is given by so you start from the binary tree you do the same as before you think of it as a poset and now each time you see ij in your poset you put an inequality xi smaller than xj. You a bunch of cones which behave properly. And it turns out that it's a quotient fan, it's a sense that you can obtain the Silvester fan by gluing together the chambers of the red fan, which correspond to permutations in the same congruence class. Okay, and now you can do that at the level of polytopes. So here you have the permitahedron and the session hedon that we already mentioned. So the permitahedron, you can think of it. So, the parameter hedon, you can think of it as a convex of all permutations. The athosahedron, you can think of it as a convexor of all load directors. What is more interesting here is the description in terms of inequalities. So, the inequalities of the so first the two polytopes are contained in the plane sum of the coordinates equal constants. So, use here, but it's what's that you see here. It's interesting. Thanks. And then so the inequalities of the parameter hedon are. Inequalities of the parameter headion are, so you have one inequality for each subset, proper non-type subset of 1L, and this inequality tells you: okay, at these places I can put at least the first n numbers, the first j numbers. So I pick the subset J, and I look at the places, where, the places in the positions given by J, and here, the permutation, the minimum thing I can do is put the first J numbers at this position. So, this gives me an inequality. And so for the And the so for the association you have the same I mean you have the same kind of inequalities except you don't have all of them, you have only the ones corresponding to intervals. And that's telling you this, that's telling that you can obtain the association from the perimeter hedon by just deleting some inequalities in the facet description. Okay, so let's do that. So I start from the perimeterhedron and I delete some inequalities to get to the accessahedron. Except instead of deleting it by once, I just move then. Of deleting it by once, I just move them slowly to infinity. Let's do that again. Okay, so that's how, I mean, the 3v, the geometric point of view on this, on this CBS document. Oh, and you can also print it. I mentioned that there's a printer downstairs. I don't know about these print modes. This is probably the main achievement that uh we obtained with uh Nathan Reading when he was visiting with Barcelona. Okay, so the last thing is that between these three, so the lattice point of view, the fan point of view, and the polytope point of view, of course they are related. So from the polytop you can obtain the fan, which is the normal fan of the polytop. And you can obtain the the lattices by just the orientation exactly as we were doing the first problem. We were doing the first problem. Orient the parameter, you can identity to the reverse permutations, and you get the recorder. And if you do the same with the same direction, it goes from the left cone to the right cones, then you get the tarots. Okay, so now we can try to do the same for any lattice congregance of the recorder. So the first thing is that the main reading proves that you can play the same game with the file. Same game with the time. So you can just glue together. So you pick any components, fix the components, then you glue together the chambers of the red arrangement which correspond to permutation in the same class. Then what you get is a fan. And later with Pacosantos, we proved that this fan is polytopa. It's a normal fan of a certain quotient over. So here you see all possible congruences, almost, I mean, all possible essential congruences of the recorder of size four. Of the recorder of size 4. So, for example, here on top you see the trivial congruence. You get only the recorder, so the parameter. Here is the assessahedron that we mentioned, the C-based congruence. Here is the cube that you saw in the video, if you keep going. This one is interesting, it's the diagonal recognition polytope, so it's a Minkowski sum of these two opposites. This was already constructed by Nathan and Charlotte. And so this this is an interesting lattice. So it's a it's a distributive lattice. Lattice, so it's a distributive lattice, and now if you pick any chain in it, then it gives you a way to open this permitahedron. Matrioshka way to open perimeter hedon and this occupy, but whatever chain you choose, you have a different way to open. Okay, so now I want to speak a little bit about parametries and some special commodities. Sure. Can we go back to the other side? So the quotient tote is like each one of these a quotient hope? Yes. One of these, a version top? Yes. Okay. Exactly. So for each congruence, I have a polytope whose normal fan is the quotient fan. You have only one quotient fan, and you can move a little bit, you have many quotient dogs as possible, but it's proven that any quotient fan is the normal fan of a point, which would call quotient fine. Okay, so parametric conferences. So parametrizes are nice trees, even nice Trees given nice lattices. So, what is a parameter? It's a directed and labeled tree. So, it's labeled by one end rejectively, and it's directed from bottom to top. I never draw the directions. So that locally at each vertex you see this. So, what does it mean? It means you have one or two parents and one or two children. And if you have two parents or two children, then the node J separates the left descendants from the right dissonance. Left descendants from the right descendants. So, any label that you see on the left descendant should be smaller than J, and on the right descendants. Yeah, sorry, ancestor should be larger than J, and same on the bottom. Okay. So, this is an example of a permitry. Now, when you have a permitry, you can record the type of each node from 1 to n, and it gives you what I call a signature or a decoration. So, now, let's say decoration begins, and it's what. So, now if you fix the decoration, then you have nice means. Have nice, I mean, the permutries are vigilant with nice objects. So, if your declaration is you always have one parent and one child, then your permitry is just align. So, it's a permutation. If you have one parent and two children, then it's just a standard binary tree. If you have sometimes one parent and two children, or sometimes two parents and one child, then what you have are congregant trees. And if you have two parents and two children, then what you have is a binary sequence. I just have to tell you whether I go down or up at each step. Or up at each step. And now these parametries are defined exactly in the same way as we define the silencer congruence. They define a parametry congruence. So you fix a decoration, delta, and now you look at all parametrizes with this decoration. And so these parametries are labeled, they are oriented, so you can just think of them as possets, and you look at the linear extensions of these posets. So for each parameter, you get a congruence class. And this gives you a congruence, which is called a delta. A convuence which is called a delta parameter congruence. So if you do the quotient, then you get the delta parametry lattice. And in these cases, well, what you get is the recorder, the tamarind lattice, the Common lattice, and the Boolean lattice. And in general, you get some much more interesting than a whole family of lattice. Okay, and these parameters that can also be constructed exactly as we constructed the association. You can obtain a Obtain a polytop realizing this permitual lattice by making the convex half of certain vectors, transmitting pollen, looks really like rode vectors, or by making some intersections of the inequality distribution, I mean the same inequalities as the perimeter hedge, except just a different set. So I don't want to explain what is a set, but for each decoration you have a certain set of inequalities that you have to keep and just screw the other ones. What you get is a boolean. So what you get is a Boolean lattice, it's a Boolean lattice of perimetrihedra. And as before, you can just go from the permitahedron to the cube by just deleting some inequalities. Okay, so if you were attentive enough, you observed that I have two constructions for parametries. So the one that I just let me start again, the one that I just described, I start from the parameter hedging and I delete inequalities, so it means that what I'm constructing is outside the parameter hedon. Constructing is outside the perimetahedron. I think of it as an outsider dihedron. And the one that I had before, I start from the perimeter hedon and I was constructing, I was doing Matferschka insights. It's an insider hedon. The connection between these two constructions I don't understand. But these are quite different. So the first one is based on this removing facets, and the second one is based on the shutter. Okay, so now we sort of introduce what I wanted. Now we sort of introduce what I wanted. So, the what I want to focus on is actually the quotient types which are removahedral. So, I call removahedron a polytopes that I obtain by removing facets from the classical vermutahedron. And the fan is removahedral if it's a normal fan of a removahedron. So, examples, we saw the perimeter is, but you have also some have a characterization of the graphedron and the nestohedron, which have this problem. So, what about quotient tops? With Alberta and Ritter, I proved that the Alberta and Ritter, I proved that the quotient file is removahedron if and only if the components is a parametric component. But they are very special. These parametric components are very special. So let me just mention also that this remover header construction is very naive, so it does not work in general. It only works for the parameter component, but sometimes it's really useful. So when you don't know what to do, you just do that. Try, maybe it works, but it doesn't work. But if it works, then you're happy. So in particular, it worked beyond this story. It went beyond this story of the record and type A that I mentioned. So it was the first construction of the genise as the hedra by Holborn Land, Redland, and Thomas. I should not say the first construction, we can say this is a construction of the Convoyant lattice, Conboyant fan, by Holbeck Langer and Thomas, starting from the W parameter helium and deleting some triceps. We also used it recently to construct the Horseshoe polytope. I mentioned before the free helium, which was metal lattice. The Horseshape polytope is a poly. And the Hausshi polytope is a polytope with the same non-oriented graph, but whose oriented graph is a lattice. It's a Haushi lattice. So I obtain it from the multiple hedon by just deleting facets. Again, I had no idea what to do, so I just deleted facets. Same for Icodio Hydra, which I obtained by some deleting facets. So sometimes it's just a convenient way. Okay, so what is the problem? The problem is to try to do that for other coseter groups. So I start from a coseter group W and I look at the Cosette W and I look at the what I call the W removahedron, which are the positives you can obtain from the W permetahedron by individual facets. So here's the W permitahedron is the orbit of the sum of the positive odes. Okay, very special parameter head. And now the W removahedral fan is just a normal fan of a W remova hedon. And the examples of this, as I already mentioned, are the W parameter helium, but also the generalized association by Robert Klinger and Thomas. By Robert, Younger and Thomas. And the problem is to try to prove or disprove or check, I don't know what we need to do, this equivalence that the quotient fan of a congruence is removed by Hedron if and only if the congruence is homogeneous congruence of B2. So I don't want to define what it is, but that's a very simple definition of this homogeneous congruence of the V2. So let me mention again, sorry, we know that it works for Azessahedra. Let me mention that there are alternative constructions which seem to work for OP. Constructions which seem to work for all congruences. It's not a way to, I mean, it is still a nice construction, but I think it's an interesting characterization of the homogeneous congruences. So I proposed that to my student, Daniel Tavayo, just by almost the end of his thesis, had no time to finish and decided to at academia. So I decided I will keep it for the next student. But then two months ago, Nathan sent me an email saying, This is true. So I think you have to. So, I think you have to lead this group. Maybe, I mean, I think Nathan is in a candy store here. In this conference, there are so many projects that you want to work on. So, maybe he will not be here to work. People are interested about it. I've got the chat. Okay, so any questions upon this uh seminal problem? Still want to go through on third problem. Okay, so stretch your legs. Okay, so you want commercial break. So commercial break. Um I just want to advertise that we'll have two nice uh properly nice uh events in the fall in in uh in Europe. So the first one is an intensive intensive research research program on combinatorial geometries and geometric combinatorics. So it will run from 1st of October to end of November 2025 at CRM in Barcelona. So the CRM is the Spanish or the Catalan version of Than a version of Uber Wolfar or MSRI, except it has no money, so still it's a very nice place. So we'll have in particular a research school with very nice speakers. We'll have five weeks of research projects, seminars, visitors, and closing conference. So as before, we might be good friends. I think it's a place to make connections. So you can already register to. So you you can already register to the full program by february fourteenth. Um there is a limited support for doctor and postdoc students, so there's more information here. So you know what to do. So if you are an advisor, you just send us your students. If you are student, you send us your advisor, and you put us on this event. Uh so the second event is uh just after the week after, so you can can use your trip to do both. Uh on first to find December at uh Siem. December at CM, so this is a French version of CRM. It's more money, but not much more. We'll have a conference or research school called Biden Playbackland and Associa. So Nathan and Marta will give many courses and we have five other invited speakers. So the page is not super, it's not yet done. The CM is a bit slow. I will give an announcement soon. So keep. So keep posting. Okay. So last problem, it's about polytops from lattices from polytopes. So I want to speak about quotient tops beyond the recorder. So here is the first way to go beyond the recorder. So you start from any hyperband arrangement and you pick a distinguished region of this arrangement. And now you look at what's called a positive regions of this arrangement, which is a set of regions of the arrangement folded by inclusion. Regions of the arrangement ordered by inclusion of the inversion sets with respect to B. So the inversion set is a set of hyperplanes which separate B from your region. If you use that for the red arrangement, what you get is a record. So the coset of region is not always a lattice. We don't really know when it's a lattice. We know that it's never a lattice if the base region is is uh not simple and we know that it's always a lattice if the arrangement is impatient. And uh we know when it's a semi distributed lattice. That's a very nice uh characterization as uh Nice characterization as tightness by Nathan. But anyway, let's start from something which is a lattice, let's say, simplish. And pick a lattice congruence of this positive region. Then Nathan proved in the same paper that you can play the same game as before and obtain a fan by just gluing together chambers of your arrangement corresponding to two elements, two regions in the same congruence class. And the question is: is the question And the question is: is the question file pull it over? Okay, so in general, I think this question, I don't know, it seems difficult to ask. So there are cases in which we know what to do. So the first that I already mentioned is the quotient terms for the record on gravitation. So this I explained already. Then you can do that for the costet arrangement of a costetic group. Let's say, of simply this case, then Dana, Hanson, and Thomas have the. They have the so there's a technology for doing this which is called the sharp polytop theory and and uh Banahans and Thomas have the polytopes. They are still proving that these sound good polytopes, but they have the sharp polytops so you can you can already play with your computer. Um so with uh grant Colin and Arnold we are working on affine push-tops so same thing, this is the reason why I put it to plus is here. We have the polytops but at the moment we have no way to put it sharply tops. And I did it for the And I did it for the graphical zonotops that I started from. So, if you start from a graphical zoonotop of a scalat graph, then what you get is a semi-distributed lattice. And then you can do quotient ups out of it. So, here is an example of this scalatal graph, and I do a set and congruence, which I call the C-based congruence, natural congruence. And then I can construct a file. I mean, this was known by reading, and this file is polytoppy. And actually, I just want to mention. And actually, I just want to mention, since we saw it, that if you start from a rooted tree, then the association of the transitive closure of this rooted tree is actually this long-rotation lattice that we saw in one of the conversations. We are still proving it, but there are still some things, but it's true. Okay, so now so one problem would be just pick your favorite class of hyperbolian arrangements and try to prove that they are sharp body dopes and try to prove that they are Causion. Prove that they are cushion. But I think I want to do something more fashionable in this area at the moment, which is to do the same but for polyhedral complexes. For this, let me just tell you what I did on the S recorder with Eva Filip. So we already saw the S recorder in the blue pipe matter. So S is a weak composition, which means that I can also have zeros. Then an S tree is a tree on one end, where, so for me, they are increasing, it's also important. Are increasing, it's also important. So they are increasing trees, and the ice mode has SI plus 1 children. And the S recorder is a certain order on this S trees defined by inclusion of inversion set, except it's not set, it's multi-set. So you don't need to know the exact definition, but it gives a nice lattice. It's a polygonal semi-distributive and concurrent semi formattis. And when I saw that, I was in semi-distributivity. You have to work out the gender discipline, so the canonical genre representation. The canonical general representation, the shards, and so on. So, this is what we did. So, we proved using shard theory and shard polytopes or shard objects, we call them, so they are polyhedral complexes, that any lattice congruence of the S-required can be realized geometrically as a quotient of what I call the form. So, the form is like the fan to what you think of fan, except it's not a it's not a fan, it's not a hyperconner arrangement. It's a polyhedral complex, but it is a what is the analogue of the bread fan. The analog of the breadth fan. And now, if you glue together some chambers, some regions, some polyhedra in this form, then what you get is a quotient form called the congratulations. So here is what is called the CDS electron. And this quotient form can be realized as the dual or the normal form of what I call a quotient complex. So it's a polyhedral complex which realizes the S-picot, so this potion of the S-micro. So in particular, it proves that if you So, in particular, it proves that if you do a triple quotient, then the Hesse diagram of the S-required is indeed the oriented skeleton of a polyhedral subdivision of a graphical zonotope. This was proved by Gonzales-Deleon, Moales-Philippe, Tamayo, and Yip. And the case was where there is no zero in S. And or technique, it's sort of a it's very different, but it proves it for S. But it's very different. So, in particular, it gives us some integer coordinates. Some integer coordinates is this. Okay, so now what I want to do, so here is a feature maybe more appealing. So you see that this is a trivial, so this is a S-recorder for S equal 2, 3, 2, 1. And here is a C-bester quotient, so the Tamari, S-S-Tamari analysis. Okay, so now what I want to do is the same thing for any frame analysis. You seem to be interested in frame analysis. So let me remind you, we start from a graph, an increasing graph on. From a graph, increasing graph on M. Then we can construct the flow polytope of G, which is the intersection of the positive buttons with the plane defined by the conservation law. And the vertices of this, almost done, the vertices of this flow polytope are the kinetic z vectors of roots, which are increasing paths from 1 to n in the graph. So we already saw that with matter. Now you need a little bit more. You need a little bit more analysis, so you take a framing on the graph. So you have your increasing graph, and you have a framing at each vertex. So you remember an order on the incoming edges and an order on the on-doing edges. Out of this framing, you can define the coherent and incoherent routes, which to remind you, so they are incoherent if they are ordered differently at the endpoint, at the longest common subpath, at V. And then F-click. And an F-click is a step of votes, which is paramorized coherent at each vertex. Okay, so this is what Mata told us. And Mata really wrote his theorem that if you have a frame graph, then the simplicity is corresponding to the f peaks from a regular triangulation of the flow polytope. And you can orient the dual graph of this triangulation so that this oriented dual graph is the Hassan dual graph. This oriented dual graph is the Hassan diagram of a congruence uniform lattice. Okay, so this was proved by Matthias and César. Okay, and my question, my problem, is to realize any lattice quotient by a polyhedral complex. So of course if you look at the trivial quotient, let's say you really just look at the framing lattice, then it is realized already geometrically. This is what we started from. We started from something geometrically. It is realized geometrically. It's not completely obvious to really realize it as a political complex. You need to do... Polytrical complex, you need to do kdric and some traces of this of a high function. It is quite technical to actually get it on the computer. It's quite difficult. You don't get integer coordinates. I think Cesar and Jon the former student of Cesar Examination. They are working on trying to get some examples integer coordinates. The point of this approach is that using lattice quotients, you will really need to understand the shard polytons. In particular, you will get integrated. Okay, and I don't know, I put it here, Cesar, as someone who could lead this project, anyone who knows more than me about something like this can lead us. Any questions? Thanks. Are there any questions for Nanslan? What's the status of in coxcurs in the context of cotton cox groups? What's the status of the knowing that lattice coaches all make coaches? Lattice quotients all make quotients. So you listen to A, D, and E there, but. So my understanding from discussion with you is that Dana and Hansen, they have the sharp polytops. So they know what the sharp polytops are. They come from representation theory. When you make a ski-sum over what you need, then you get a quotient tops. Everything seems very well. The only problem is that proving that the sharp polytops is an option. The only problem is that proving that a sharp polytopes is annoying. So, you have so, what is a shard polytope? It's something, so for each shard, we need to find a polytope whose normal fan contains this shard. And I mean, the wall of the normal fan should contain this shard, and the union of the wall of the normal fan should be contained in the union of the shards forced by this shard. And this is an only part. In type A, it was, we were lucky, it was quite easy to do. In other types, it seems difficult. They have proofs in. Yeah, maybe I think you should. They have proved some yeah maybe I should I think you should answer. Yeah so so um the the current status is that Eric and Hanson and I think that we can prove the cases that sit the shards we can prove that we have the right thing for the right shard holograms for shards that exist in any Cambrian, but we can't do it in general and it's I mean general and it's I mean you know like there might be there might be there might be somebody in this room who can can do it but it's we we got kind of stuck on the general problem we figured out a way to solve it it's so in the Cambrian case we can do it using then the tool is using representation theory equippers if you want to do it for in general then you have to use representation theory of pre-rejected algebras and that's harder and we have trouble you know getting Have trouble getting sort of controlling these tardinariums on collagen for the pre-credit microcology. But for quivers or in general, here algebra. So we're fine with the operator. We're fine with maximum static massive relationships, but with this chain break restriction. And I think the same is true for affine. So for affine, we have the polytos. I checked that it works on the computer, but I have no idea how to prove that. I mean, we can prove that there is a shard, I think, or less. That the shard that we s we start from is there, but then the rest Start from easier, but then the rest, checking that the rest is contained in the union of the shards forced by this one is difficult. Here we go if the sticking point has to do with how difficult it is to actually do force and order in type B, there is something coming down, coming down the pipe with arc-based, something, well, something really crazy, but it's like sub-arcs that would let you do forcing. So if that's the thing that's difficult, You do forcing. So, if that's the thing that's difficult, I can talk to Rumu later. I don't know if that's the issue. Like, actually, how hard it is to do shard. I guess you can maybe you can do it one area at a time. I think that's not the issue that we have. So, in affine type, there's a description of the shard by Grant using arcs reading around a circle. So we have a good description of the shard and also of the forcing, I think. But the problem is really that we don't understand the edges of the of the shard below. Question uh yeah, about the first qu uh problem that you posed. So this is uh McCasky sums of synthesis, especially into hypergraph. And um Actually, Intell hypergraph. And yes, the question was about the lattice property. If you had this orientation, there's a similar property to look for, which is this kind of oriented non-leaning face property. Or if you take a chain, this buzzword you can ask if you Emily's face or revisit it later. That's a good question. So I think that would be relevant here because Emily and I. Here, because like Emily and I checked, for example, that if the Minkowski sum of simplicities, or Minkowski sum of polytopes that have this problem, then or if each component has a problem, then so the Minkowski sum. So the question would then be like, what was the minimal ones that have this property? I mean, one thing that that you can do also, instead of trying to understand which ones are lattice, you can try to understand which are which ones are lattice quotations of your code and which are analysis. It should happen to like the I should have mentioned like the uh so with Emili and and uh and Thomas they have a paper on this question for uh graphasahira. The special case and the special graph as a hira are hypergraphic polytons, so it was already difficult for them to find which ones are lattices. So I'm not sure we can answer as a big question. So I graphas sahila, for example, I think is a family which is more complicated than the one I looked at. But okay, even in the case where we can't answer, But but okay, even in the case where we can't answer, we can ask so for example for the the two families that I presented here, it's much easier to decide when when it is the latest question to the code. It's like a simple character decision. But it's I mean it's too simple. Very few of them. The same is true for graphics Zahida, but there are very few graphics that are analytic versions of the recorder. There are probably much more which are analyses. Because the field condition, I think it is the field condition is a condition for the The condition for the lattice questions, but then even in your paper at the end, you have an example of one which is not filled, but is is a lattice. This answers in this big finding question, but I think the problem is to find a good family in which we can say something. This is the first two papers are more like this. But each time I spend two hours trying to find a good family in which I can do something, I always found it. So it's very one thing is that it's very easy to implement in safe. One thing is that it's very easy to implement in Sage. In 10 lines of Sage, you have the Minkowski sum of standard simplicities and the orientation, and as you say, so you can just play that. It's very easy to play it. Yes? So just to have a sense of what is happening, maybe it's so among all the family of generalized human behavior there might be some ones that are in the composable disrespect? Yes. These are Yes. These are bad. Do you know if these are bad? I don't know. So actually, okay, so I did not want to speak about that person. So what I would really like to see is a picture of the type code of the bread arrangement, in which each face is colored green or red, depending on whether you get a lattice or not. So if you take the bread arrangement of dimension 2, you get a three-dimensional picture in which everything is green. In which Lemucine is green, if you do that for the red arrangement in dimension 3, then you get an 11-dimensional colour in which you want to colour faces. It's a bit difficult to draw, but this is what I want to do. So I want to have a... So somehow what I'm asking is a map from the face lattice of the type cone of the braid arrangement to true or false. Is it a lattice or not, or is it semi-distributive or not? Is it distributive or not? So it's not predictable. So it's not preserved under taking some phases of the typecone. I mean, maybe there's something to understand that. This type cone you're talking about, that's the semi-modular functions. Yes, it's just the function. Okay, so I don't know much about this, but I wanted to say, Josephine, you and her students have done some serious computations with the color of all sorts of modular functions. Yes. If you get her interested in this question, she might give you an answer. Yes. Yeah, so you take the corner of the function, you take look at the face lattice of this corner, and then you should have a map saying for each face whether this is green or red.
