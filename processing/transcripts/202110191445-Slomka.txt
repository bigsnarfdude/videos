Okay, the second speaker of this session is Professor Bo Slomka from Open University of Israel. And the title is Undiscrete Brun Mitkovsky Type Inequalities. So please. Thank you very much. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak here. So my talk is based on, so it has two parts. The biggest part of the talk will be based on the joint. Biggest part of the talk will be based on a joint work with Boaz Clautag and with Dana Alikias and Boz Klautag. And this is about discrete versions of Brun-Minkowski inequalities. So the starting point is the classical Brun-Minkowski inequality in various forms. So we have the multiplicative and the classical one basically saying that the log of the volume is concave. And we have the functional version, which is the A functional version, which is the Pocopa-Leiner inequality, that tells us that we have this. Whenever this relation holds, we have this inequality right here between the functions. This is a classic starting point. So when one comes to try to discretize the Bruninkovsky inequality maybe in the first obvious way, it fails. It fails if you think about the cardinality and trying to look at some sets. But when you start varying things, then you can get some versions. And there are many, many works on papers on this subject, starting from 09 of Gardner and Granke, and so on. I will not mention all of them. Not, I will not mention all of them. I will just mention some of them that are related to this talk, okay? But most of them, I hope I haven't forgotten anyone. Most of them are right here in this list. So the first discrete Brominkowski type inequality that I want to mention is due to Clautag and Lehek. And it says the following thing: fix a lambda between 0 and 1 and look at functions from. And look at functions from zn to zero infinity, fghk. So we have four functions, and they assume that they satisfy the following condition: that the product of fx and gy is less than age of, so here we have the flow operation, right? The lowest, the lower and upper integer parts, so the flow on the ceiling. And we want f times gy to be less or equal to age of. less or equal to h of the flow of lambda x plus one minus lambda y times k of now we have the ceiling of one minus lambda x plus lambda y. So you see that the lambda and the one minus lambda, they flipped here, the order is flipped. Whenever we have this, and here flow and ceiling, when we talk about Zn, I just mean coordinate-wise, each coordinate, you take the flow or the ceiling. Then we have the following. Then we have the following inequality, the analog of the Brominkowski. So we have that the sum of fx times the sum of gy is less than the product of the sums of h and k. Okay. And so actually they proved it for dimension one and with lambda equal to one half, but and and the tools, the main point is that the tools were pretty sophisticated using stochastic analysis. But the proof, they were And but the proof, their proof also extends pretty easily to the general case using induction, for example. And so I want to note here that if we take just in Z, if we take just two numbers, X, Y, which are zero or one, then the flow of the average and the ceiling of the average are just the minimum and the maximum of X and Y. And so if we look at functions, So, if we look at functions fghk, four functions that are instead of zn they are just restricted to the cube, the hypercube, the hypercube 0, 1 to the n, the result of Plato and Layak actually coincides with another well-known result, which is referred to as the four functions theorem. This is due to Alswood and Dykin from 78, and it says something rather similar. Something rather similar. So if we have four functions again on 0, 1, n on the hyper cube to 0, infinity, and they satisfy the following inequality. So now we have again fx gy, but now h and k, they are taken at the operation which are the minimum per coordinate and the maximum per coordinate. Then we have the inequality right here, the same type. Okay, so this inequality, the faux function, is very Inequality, the faux function is very much related to correlation inequalities. So it gives you, for example, the celebrated FKG inequality, which is used in statistical physics and all sorts of models of improbability. And so the link between these two, the four functions theorem and Klaper-Glad theorem was actually made by Gosland, Samson, Roberto, and Tetris. Gosland, Samson, Roberto, and Titali. And in their paper, where they connected it, they actually gave another proof, at least from dimension one, which is using transport tools to prove both of them. So they actually prove some more general entropy inequality that gives you both inequalities, but somehow separately. Somehow separately. So you don't get all the inequalities, the pop functions, catablax, certainly not in our end. You don't get it via one general result. And this was the main goal of the work with Diana and Boaz. So this is the starting point of our work, the unit major majors and that one. Okay, so so the question is: if we if we look at so I'm sorry, I'll go back a bit. Also here, the four functional theorem actually, I'm not sure if it was known or not, but if you replace 01 to the n by zn, everything still holds, okay? So the operation changes, it's not now, it's not the same as the average. As the average, as the flow and the ceiling of the averages, but it still holds. And if we want a unified approach, we need to understand the common features of operations like the one we see in the full function theorem and in Claude-Glehe. So what are the common features of all these operations, like the flow of these averages and the mean and the maximum, and so on? So the main observation that we had is that Main observation that we had is that these things satisfy two axioms, okay? Two main axioms, and here are the axioms. So the operations, you think about operations T, Zn, times Zn to Zn, and they should satisfy two properties. So the first one, P1, we'll call it from now on, is translation equivariance, which just means that if you add the same value z, the same vector z, you can just take it outside of t. So tx plus. outside of t so tx plus z y plus z is equal to t x y plus z this is the first one which is very easy to verify for these operations and the second is more involved but essentially it means some kind of monotonicity okay so let me explain it in in more detail so we call it monotonicity in the sense of knotte uh because he also used in another and in the setting uh something Setting something which is very similar. So think of, so what is monoclinic in the sense of canota? It means, first of all, that you have some decomposition of Zn, okay, into a direct sum of some subgroups of Z to the N1 times Z to the N2, and so on, up to Z to the NK, some finite decomposition. And now, when you look at T for which part of the decomposition, For which part of the decomposition, you want the following things to happen. Okay, so the first one is that t is going to be triangular in the sense that each ti depends of xy depends only on the first i coordinates. Okay, so only on zn1 up to zn this should be up to zn. This should be up to Z and I, I think. Yeah, only on the first I coordinates of, yeah, I'm sorry, yeah, for any Xi, Xy, so it does not depend on the last one and so on, only up to I, okay, so triangular. And the second one is that for each I, okay, you have some total additive ordering. So I will explain exactly what it is in a second, but just think about the lexicographic order. Just think about the lexicographic ordering on Zn. And for each coordinate, you have some kind of this ordering such that if you fix the first I minus one coordinates, then the map TIAB, which means that I look at XY belonging to ZI. Belonging to zi, okay, z and i. If I look at the just the ith coordinate when ab is fixed, so I look at tiab at the point xy is just ti at the vector ax comma by okay. So this is the definition of tiab when you fix only the i minus one. Since it depends only on the i, the first i, then this is well defined. And now we want this to be. Well defined. And now we want this to be non-decreasing monotone in each of its entries with respect to the ordering, meaning that if x1 is less or equal to yi and x2 is less or equal to y2, to y1, I'm sorry, and then x2 less or equal than y2, then we have that the images also have this relation. Okay, are there any questions about just the setting and the properties of Just the setting and the properties of this p1 and p2 axioms. No, okay, so just to recall what is a total additive ordering. So, first of all, total ordering just means that you have some partial ordering, meaning binary relation, reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive. And also that each two vectors are comparable, meaning either x is less than y or y is less than x. And additive just means that. And additive just means that the ordering is also compatible to the additive structure of Zn, meaning that if you, again, if you add the same value Z to X and Y, then the relation remains. If X is less than Y, then also X plus Z is less than Y plus Z. Okay, and actually the only example I have is the lexicographic ordering, and you can also add linear images of the ordering as well. Of the ordering as well. I'm not sure actually if there exists any other. Okay, so let's see examples of operations that satisfy these two properties. Okay, so of course, the operations that we have discussed at the beginning with relation to the Claude-Glairic inequality in the full functions theorem. So you take the minimum and maximum with respect to each coordinate and And this is easy to verify if you look at just the decomposition into just one-dimensional products. And you take just the standard ordering on Z. So this is very easily verified that two of them are satisfied. Another one is you can just take the minimum on Zn with respect to some, yeah, the lexicographic ordering. And now And now the decomposition is just one right, there is no decomposition, the trivial decomposition, Zn just stays Zn. And another more involved example that I will go back to in the sequel is the following. So now, again, we have T is T1 up to Tn, and I look again at the decomposition into one-dimensional. One-dimensional groups with the usual ordering. And now for each i, I will define ti as follows. Okay, so whenever xi and yi are, sorry, whenever, yeah, whenever xi and yi are the same, then it will just give you the same the same value. So it will be xi oyi, which is the same. Whenever they are different, it's going to alternate. So the first time they are different, it's going to Different is going to give back xi, the second time yi, then this and then the third is going to be x, and then y again, and then x, and so on. And more formally, it just means that you look at the number of indices less than y, such that xj and yj are not the same. If this is even, then I'm going to set the value to be xi, otherwise it's going to be yi. Otherwise, it's going to be yi. But essentially, it just means that whenever they're different, it alternates between xi and yi. Okay? And of course, this condition, okay, this should be i minus one here. It can be replaced by any condition. Instead of even, you can put any condition essentially that you want on the first i minus one coordinates as long as you retrieve if the image is one of them, for example. But you can also make other more crazy events. Make other more crazy examples that satisfy these two properties, P1 and P2, monotonicity, and transition equivariance. Okay. And one other observation, which is important before we state that the main result, the first main result is that these operations t always come in pairs, meaning that if we have one of them, T, then if you look at, so if you look at the sum minus T. The sum minus t xy, the sum of x and y, minus t of x and y, it also gives you back another operation which satisfies both p1 and p2. So to see p1, this is pretty easy. To see p2 is also easy, but you need to write it down and you need to actually use both properties to get that it actually holds. Okay, but it does it does hold and this means that since they're counting pairs, we usually denote them by always by t minus and t plus. always by T minus and T plus in the sense that T minus plus T plus is always X plus Y. Okay. So now what is the result? The result is the following theorem. And it says that if we have any complementing operations T plus minus on Zn times Zn to Zn that satisfy both properties, meaning translation equivalence and monotonicity in the sense of Knotte, then The sense of Knotte, then if we have four functions that satisfy this inequality right here, so here we have t minus x1, and here we have t plus, then we have some kind of inequality with respect to the sums, the product of the sums. And of course, this implies both the four function theorem by just plugging in the minimum each coordinate for t minus, and it also implies Clauter and Lehr when you take Claude and Leg when you take the averages, the flow of the averages, or the sine, or any mix, by the way, and so on. Okay, now the point is that the heart of the proof, of course, it's just the monotone case. So you take Zn for some n and just assume that it is monotone without any decomposition with respect to some total ordering. And the proof is actually a very short and elementary proof. So this was the main goal, not just to unify. Was the main goal not just to unify, but also to find something which is not use heavy tools from stochastic analysis, but just elementary. And this is what we have done. And the general case just follows by induction on the number of terms, components in the composition. So you just use induction for this. Okay? So stop me. So, stop me if any questions. Okay, so just one word about the proof is that actually when we prove this, so the monotone, if we refer to the monotone case here, then we actually showed not only that the let's go back for a second, not only that this happens, but it happens on each level set in the sense. Let me go. The sense let me go back here: each level set of the sum of x and y. So, meaning that it's enough to see that for any finite set, of course, it's enough to prove the inequality, but also any finite set and any z in zn such that the sum, so I look at all the products, sum them up, and the products sum up to the entries of the product sum up to z. So, j and z minus j. Minus j, if z is fixed and a is fixed, then we have this inequality right here. And all I have to do now is just sum over z right here and right here. And then a can be anything, of course, and I get the desired result, okay? But it happens on any level set, every level set. And again, the general case is just by induction. So let me skip this part, but it's here if you want to see it. It's here if you want to see it, or later on, when I will upload the notes. Okay, so another remark is that for the induction, we didn't just prove it using directly the monotonicity property, but we replace it with something more relaxed, more general. More relaxed, more general, which we call an exclusion property. Okay, and this property that I will show in a second, it requires no ordering at all. And this is an advantage because if you think about it, if you want a total ordering on some group G, then which is finitely generated, then it essentially means that it's Zn, okay? Because otherwise you will just won't have any Have any total ordering on the group. And now, if we relax it, then actually the result extends by replacing Zn by any finitely generated Abelian group. Okay, so the exclusiveness property means the following. It just means that if you look at a finite set, finite set A with these two elements, then you can always. Then you can always find two distinct elements in the set such that if you look at the set, okay, so once you take A, you remove X, once you take A, you remove Y, and once you take A, and you remove both X and Y, then you have some exclusiveness property in the sense that if you look at the set T of Ai, Z minus AI, all the combinations, that it lacks, I mean, it misses either. lacks i mean it misses either tx z minus y or t y z minus x okay one of them does not belong into the set this is for i equal one and two if we remove only one of them if we remove both if we look at a3 and look at t a3 z minus a3 where x and y both are missing that act then actually both of these images miss uh do not belong to this uh set of images okay it's an empty set intersection and And what one can show, it's not too hard, is that monotonicity in the sense of quantity imply or monotonicity simply with respect to some ordering implies that we have an exclusiveness property. And then you can just replace the monotonicity by the exclusiveness. And this is what the proof relies on. So the proving that each level set satisfies the inequality uses exactly. That satisfies inequality uses exactly this definition of exclusiveness. Okay, so this is the main result and the main kind of ideas in the result, in the proof. And now I want to discuss a bit about the relations to other results, which are known. So, first of all, of course, is the continuous version, continuous versions of Morninkovsky. Morinkowski. So if you look at the Klata-Gleheck setting, right, if you take just the average of X and Y with some factor lambda and you take the, say, the flow, then for lambda equals one half, you can use just a standard limiting argument and you can just get a per copper line level for lambda equal one half. This is pretty immediate, but if you look at lambda not different than one half, Than one half, you will not get the Percopal, the classical Percopal angle. Because if you recall, the complement operation is not the ceiling of lambda x plus one minus lambda y, it's the ceiling of one minus lambda x plus lambda y. And this recovers actually another known continuous variant of the Percoplander, which is due to Coder and Mouret. And it says the following: if you have, again, four measurable functions. four measurable functions and they satisfy this inequality right here which is the the immediate limit of of the of the one we had for zn then you have an integral inequality with respect to these functions okay and also they proved it using this essentially the same techniques the same technique as as clautag and lex proof using the stochastic approach and again we get it by just a limit argument Get it by just a limit argument, and what we can do also now is use take limits to other operations that we have. For example, if you take the minimum with respect to the lexicographic ordering, you get another continuous inequality for the continuous set, right? Just take the minimum with respect to some total ordering on Rn. But to say that I mean, applications, I don't exactly I mean, applications I don't exactly have for this example, but it is a new inequality, at least from what I know. So, this is the continuous relation to the continuous setting. And moving on to another other discrete Boninkovsky type inequalities. So, the first one I wanted to mention, did I okay? I'm just hitting the scale. I just didn't skip any. Okay, so the next one is the skit version for the hypercube by Olivier and Villani. So essentially what they do is the following. They look at sets A and B on the hypercube and they look at the set of midpoints. So what is a midpoint? So the definition is written here explicitly, but essentially what it means is that if you look at two points A and B, then if you look at the bit. A and B, then if you look at the bits at the coordinates, then half of them essentially up to plus minus one, half of them coincide with those of one vector and half of them coincide with the other. Okay, and you look at the set of all midpoints and you have the following inequality, which is the square root of the product of mid of the number of points in the set A times the number of points in the set B cobinality is less or P coordinate is less or equal than the coordinality of the midpoints, the set of midpoints. Okay, now what they actually did, this is just a particular case of what they did, what they also proved is another Brunkowski type inequality, which is a strengthening of this using another curvature term. So understanding what is the curvature of the hypercube. But this one without the curvature is also something that we got. The curvature is also something that we got. And I want to relate our result to this one. So, to do that, let me recall one of the operations that I gave you as an example, which is just take the t, which is t1 up to tn, and each coordinate depends only on the last, only on the on the path, right? On the first item. The past, right on the first i coordinates, and as we as I said before, it alternates. So, whatever they're equal, it gives you the same bit, and when they are the same, it alternates between xi and yi, meaning that you keep this condition of half and half up to plus minus one. So, what I mean is that this operation, which is which satisfied our axioms, transition equivariant. Axioms transition equivariance and monotonicity in the sense of Kanote is also a midpoint, a very specific one specific midpoint. You can choose many others. But now choosing one specific midpoint and not looking at the entire set of midpoints, we can apply our Buninkowski inequality and we can get that the square root of the carbonality, which is the same object quantity that we have here in the We have here in the Olivier and Villani result is now less or equal not just than M, but then the product of the number of points in M1 minus and M1 plus, which is just defined here. Yes, you look at all the pairs A and B, and you look at for each pair, you take one specific midpoint, which is T plus and T minus, respectively. Okay, and you immediately get this inequality, which is, of course, less than the union of M1 minus. Than the union of M1 minus and M1 plus. And this is, of course, less than, much less actually, than the set of all midpoints. Okay, so it's a very big improvement, at least when no curvature is desired here, considered. And what else is that it's more flexible in the sense that it also holds for Zn, not just 0, 1n. So you can just extend the hypercube to Zn and the same thing. Q2 to Zn, and the same thing holds using the set of midpoints. Okay, so this is another Borniakovsky discrete inequality. And here is another one which is more recent due to Glesius Jepes, Nikolas, and Zvavich. And so what they do is, first of all, we define the lattice point enumerator. So you take a set, a subset of Rn, A, and then you just look how many points in A. Just look how many points in A are in Zn. So you take the intersection of Zn and take coordinality. And what they showed is: so, as I told you, I mean, it doesn't, Buninkowski doesn't hold immediately, so you need to fix somehow the inequality. And what they did is they showed that if you add, so if you take the average of the set, then you add minus one, one to the n, you add in the open cube minus one, one to the n, then you get a Brunikovsky in it. You get a Brunikovsky inequality for the lattice point enumerator. Okay, and this is also, by the way, it's a type there inequality. And if we apply our result for the indicator functions of appropriate sets, so K, L, and then you take the average up to 0, 1 to the N or minus 0, 1 to the N, and you look at the operation, which is again the flow of the average. Which is again the flow of the average, you can obtain a multiplicative version of their inequality. So we do not get the general additive version here with the nth power, but we do get the multiplicative version, which is not the same as opposed to the homogeneous case of Rn. Okay, so this is another related inequality. Any questions? Okay so so the now now we move on to the to the second half of of uh not half the second part of the talk which is a transport approach. So as I told you Goslin, Samson, Roberto and Titali they they proved something more general using transport tools. So they proved the disk displacement convexity of entropy type result which implies the clatabelier inequality and the four The Claude-Blake inequality and the four functions for dimension one. And to state it, we need to just recall two definitions. One of them is the relative entropy. So all we need here is the relative entropy with respect to the counting measure mn on zn. Okay, so mn is the counting measure. Then the relative entropy, which is just a minus of the Shannon entropy, is just the sum of, for any probability mu on zn, it's just the sum of mu x log mu x. Sum of mu x log mu x. So this is one quantity that we need to recall. The second one is a coupling. Okay, so a coupling is just of two probability measures on a measure space is just a measure on the product space, such that the first marginal of this measure pi gives you one measure mu and the second marginal gives you the other one, which is mu in this case. Okay, so this is just a coupling or a plan, if you will. This is just a coupling or a plan, if you will. And the theorem of the result of Gauslan, Samson, Oberto, and Titali is the following. So again, look at a specific operation on Zn Z. I'm sorry, N is equal to one here, Z times Z to Z. And this operation is the flow of the average with lambda equal to. Okay, so the X plus Y over 2, flow and ceiling. Over two flow and ceiling, take two probability measures on Z and take the monotone coupling between u and nu. I will define it in a minute. And then look at the push forwards of pi, this monotone coupling with respect to t plus and t minus. Then you have the following like inequality, a displacement convexity inequality, which tells you that the relative entropies, the sum of the relative. The sum of the relative entropies of mu and nu is always above the sum of the relative entropies of the push forwards of mu and nu of pi with respect to t minus and t plus. So this is the inequality. Okay. And this inequality, if you use the duality between the relative entropy and the logo plus transform, which is written here, then you can get the plot of Lake inequality, for example. The Plato-Lake inequality, for example, all the four functions 014 equals one pretty much immediately using this duality relation, which means that you have some more general inequality. So what I did is, which is pretty natural, is extend the result for these specific operations on Z to the setting of any operation T. An operation T that satisfies the properties, the axioms that we discussed, the P1 and P2. So the theorem is as follows. So for any T plus minus from Zn times Zn to Zn, which are complementing operations satisfying P1, P2, translation, equivariance, and monotone in the sense of counter, the following holds. If you have Following holds: if you have probability measures on Zn, then you can find some coupling between mu and nu, and it's not some, it's not existence, it's a specific coupling that I will say in a second, such that if you look again at the push forwards, you have the same type of displacement convexity. So the sum of relative entropies now with respect to the countermeasure on Zn is above the sum of relative entropies of the push-forwards. Okay, and again, using the same duality. And again, using the same duality relation, you recover the Bun Yankovsky type inequality for this operation. And actually, you can get something slightly stronger, meaning that you can add some powers. And I will say it at the end if I will have time, but it's not too strong, but you can add some powers under certain conditions, which gives you a bit more. Okay, so remarking about the proof. So the heart of the proof is again the case of where T itself is monotone. And in this case, pi is, as in the case of, as in the proof of Gozlane, Roberto-Samson and Titali, is the monotone coupling, but now we have some ordering on Zn, so it's a monotone coupling with respect to this. So it's a motion coupling with respect to this given ordering. And the general case is also, in a sense, inductive. What you do is you take a Knotte coupling. So the coupling becomes the Knote coupling, which disintegrates the monotone couplings on each component with respect to... So if you have this decomposition, you can just take the monotone couplings in each one of them and take the canota coupling between all of them. And yeah, so this already said that it implies the Bruninkovsky inequality. How much time do I have? Four minutes? What? Someone? Yes, four minutes. Yes. Okay. Okay. That's fine. So, okay. So just saying monotone coupling, I will just recall. Recall a monotone coupling essentially, you take the generalized inverse of the CDF, the community distribution function of mu with respect to the ordering, and you take a uniform measure on 0, 1, and you just take, so the coupling would just be this, the law of this random vector, which is the inverse of u with respect to mu here, and the inverse with respect to mu of u again, the same uniform random. Same uniform random vector. And the main point is that the monotone coupling has this monotonicity property now with respect to the partial ordering, not the total ordering, but the partial ordering on the ordering times the ordering, which means that the following. It means that if you have two elements in the support of this captain pi, x, y, and u, v, then either both x is less than u and y is less than v, or Than u and y is less than v, or the other way around. So essentially, the support is some kind of a chain, okay, which is with respect to the partial ordering on the product of the orderings. And this is the main thing that you use and what you use it for is to understand the entire structure of the support with respect to T minus and T plus. So here, let me skip the Knotted coupling because I. A coupling because I'm not sure it would be helpful with this short amount of time. But and also skip some more details, but let me go here. So essentially, what you do is you analyze the properties of the structure. For example, yes, if you have two different pairs, x1, y1, x2, y2, that satisfy that you have x. Satisfied that you have x1 less than x2, y1 less than y2, but they are different, but the images coincide, then it immediately means that, first of all, that the image of the t plus is not the same, and you have strictly less here, and also that either x1 is equal to x2 or y1 is equal to y2. Okay, and this means if I go, if I skip again. I go if I skip again, I'm sorry about this for to the collaries here. It means that the structure is very organized. So, for example, if you have, say, s minus, you have a chain of pairs, then either all of the first coordinates are the same, x0, x1, and so on up to xk, are all the same, equal to x0, all the same for y. And also, what it means for the image for the s, I'm sorry, I didn't say what s minus and s plus is. I'm sorry, I didn't say what S minus and S plus is, right? I should have said that before. Yeah, yeah. So S plus and S minus is just all the pairs in the support of the coupling such that T plus and T minus of X Y is A. Okay, so S plus of A is all the pairs that give you A when you apply T plus. When you apply t plus, and the same for t minus, okay, so essentially, if you have a chain here, then each time you have two adjacent one as pairs in S minus, then they will be separated in S plus. So, for example, in this case, if you have three, then X1, Y1 will be just the one single element in S plus. Okay, and Okay, and X0 Y0, if you look at S plus of T plus of X0 Y0, it will have only smaller pairs below him. It cannot have anything above him. So there is a very nice structure that takes the entire support and separates it into like nice sets between the Between the s minus and s plus, and using this, you can prove the inequality that you want. Okay, so as I said, I'm sorry, I'm out of time. I just leave it here without saying anything. This is the slightly stronger version with some powers. Okay, sorry for the extra time and thank you. Okay, thank you very much for the nice talk. So, any questions, remarks, or comments? So what about those alpha, beta, gamma? Data, is it arbitrary numbers? No, so as I said, it's not maybe as ideal. I would have liked to see something stronger, but what you can show is that if you take four numbers, Four numbers, positive numbers such that the maximum of the first two is less than the minimum of the second pair. Yes, so the maximum of alpha, beta is less than the minimum of gamma and delta, then you can show the following inequality. If you look at powers f to the alpha, g to the beta, and you know that the condition, the following condition is satisfied, that this is less than h to the gamma and then k to the delta, then you can conclude using the duality argument and. And the entropy inequality, you can show that the product of the powers of the sum satisfy this inequality. And but you know, I wish I could show something like alpha beta and then again alpha beta, but this is not the case. At least I'm not sure. Okay, I see. This is what you can squeeze out of it at least for now. I see. Thank you. Okay, so more questions? Or remarks? Okay, if no, then that's thanked speaker again. Okay, thank you.
