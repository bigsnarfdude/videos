And thank you to the organizers. Thank you to the organisers for inviting me here and also for giving me the opportunity to speak. Okay, so I want to talk about some joint work with various people. So this talk will be based on work from a paper with Lydia Angeleri-Hugel, Jam Sobicek, and Georges Vittoria, in which we introduce the concept of mutation. The concept of mutation for sort of large silting and co-silting. And we also explore how it relates to the idea of mutating torsion pairs, say, in a module category of a Artinian ring. And also a paper that's still in preparation that's joint with Lydia Angeleri-Hugo and Francesco Sentieri, where we look at really in a bit more detail. Really, in a bit more detail, the special case of finite dimensional algebras, or really, I think it's Arten algebras, and then we can say even more. Okay, but really, my focus is going to be about simple tilts. So let me start with an introduction, section one, introduction, in which I kind of explain what I want to discuss today and I want to discuss today and where it's going to go. So, throughout the talk, I want to fix A, and this I think only needs to be an Artinian ring. But if you like finite dimensional algebras or Arten algebras, then it can be those as well, of course. I'm going to denote by mod A with a lowercase m the category of finitely presented A modules. Finitely presented A modules. And I'm going to be working also in two triangulated categories: the bounded derived category of small mod A, which I'm going to denote by dBA, and the unbounded derived category of all modules, which I'm just going to denote by DA. Okay. Okay, so that's just fixing some notation, but it also gives you an idea of where I'm going to be working today. The kind of main object of interest is going to be the same thing that Emily was talking about in her talk that I want to kind of understand something about the lattice of all torsion classes. Of all torsion classes, TF say, and I'll usually use a Greek letter for the torsion pair itself. So torsion pairs, in fact, sorry, in little mod A. And I'm going to consider this set as a poset. So I'm going to put an Um, I'm going to put an ordering on it, which is the same ordering as Emily, which is I'm going to say that tau is greater than or equal to another torsion pair, mu, if and only if u is contained in t. So it's just the ordering of the torsion classes. Okay, um, I'm gonna be talking about this lattice, that's the kind of thing I want to understand, but I will. But I will also be talking about other lattices of torsion classes, or other they will turn out, okay, other posets of torsion classes. So similarly, for any small abelian category, I will also use the notation TORS H for the collection of all TORS and pairs. For the collection of all torsion pairs in H ordered in the same way. And this post set, so this gives you a post set structure. This post set will always have a top element, which I'll denote by one. So if it's the top element, it needs to be above everybody else. And this is just the torsion pair that has the category itself as the torsion. The category itself as the torsion class, and then the set containing just the zero object as the torsion-free class. And it has a bottom element given by the other trivial torsion pair. So the torsion class is just zero and the torsion pre-class is H. Okay, so this is what I'd like to understand. And let me tell you the perspective I'd like to take on this post-set. Like to take on this post set, which is that, okay, this is something that's really taking place in the category of finitely presented modules. But I would really want to use some tools that come from the triangulated categories. So the perspective that I want to take, so today's perspective, is that for every Is that for every, so on cause A, I want to use the fact that every torsion pair actually defines a T structure. So I want to use the notion of tilting. So this is sometimes called HRS tilting. Today I'm going to just use tilting to save writing HRS every time. Okay, so I think I. Okay, so I think I was hoping actually that this would have been defined already in the conference, but I think it hasn't been. So I'm going to give the definition of what is the HRS tilt of a torsion pair. So what we're going to kind of note is that little mod A is the heart of the standard T structure. So I'm going to denote the standard T structure. I'm going to denote the standard T structure like this. So, like David, my T structures are going to be torsion pairs in the triangulated category. So, this is all complexes in DB small mod that are concentrated in negative degrees. And this is all complexes in small mod that are concentrated in non-negative degrees. And this is a Negative degrees, and this is a T structure in the sense of David. So if you intersect these two things, you get zero. So if you want the heart, you have to shift one of the two classes and then intersect. Okay, so using this, we can take any, we can construct the HRS tilt, which I will define for any t-structure. So this is a definition, but in fact, it's also a theorem. In fact, it's also a theorem. It will contain some information that you need to prove, and this is due to Happel Wrightin and Smallow from 96. So they prove that if we have a T structure with heart and And now I'm going to reveal which way I shift to give the heart. So the heart will be given by shifting the aisle by minus one and intersecting it with the co-isle. So if something looks like it's out by a shift, it might be because this is what I've done. So we're going to assume we have a T structure with heart like this in some triangulated category. This doesn't matter. Then we take some torsion pair, so let me call it how, like before, that lives in the heart. Then what Happel, Wright, and Smaller show is that there exists another T structure, which I'm going to denote by. Which I'm going to denote by x subtau y sub tau given by the following subcategories of D. So x tau is given. So I'm going to use the same notation as David, which is this star product, which means taking extensions of two classes. So x tau is x star product with the two. Star product with the torsion class. So, this is all objects in D that can be obtained by an extension of something in X with something in T or in a triangle of this shape. And Y tau is similar. So we're going to take the torsion free class and take the star product with the minus one shift of y. Okay, so the kind of interesting thing about this particular So, the kind of interesting thing about this particular T structure is that its heart has a canonical torsion pair that's very closely related to our tau. So, this is going to be the kind of flip in perspective that I want to make in this talk, because we're really studying torsion pairs in the module category, but we're going to study them via these hearts of these T structures and the torsion pairs in those hearts. So, this torsion pair has a heart. Has a heart, which I'll always denote by h tau. And this is, of course, the minus one shift of x with y has a Causion pair, which I'm going to denote by tau bar, which is Tau bar, which is given by the torsion-free part of tau, which lives in this heart because the torsion-free part of the torsion pair lives in the aisle, which is here, and the minus one shift of the torsion part. And you can see that that might live in the heart because of the way I've described it. Okay, so this is going to be the flip, the kind of The flip, the kind of flip of perspective that I want to make, which is that I want to consider two torsion pairs, mu and tau in tors A, but then use this HRS construction to tilt away. Tilt away from mod A in these two directions. So we tilt at mu and we get h mu and we tilt at tau and we get h tau. And what we'll see very early in the talk is that these two things are actually related by a tilt themselves. Related by a tilt themselves. And what I would like to look at, as I mentioned in the title, is the case where this is a simple tilt. So we want to consider the case where we have some simple object in H mu, and we want to tilt at the torsion pair generated by this simple. Okay, so I guess it's, I want to tilt at a pair like this, okay? So we take the torsion-free class, if it is a torsion-free class generated by that's the orthogonal of S, homorthogonal of S in H mu. And then I really want to be considering the case where this is a torsion free class and the torsion class is given by field S. So of course, if we're in a length category, this is always a torsion pair. Length category, this is always a torsion pair because we know that torsion classes are exactly those subcategories that are closed under quotients and extensions, and torsion-free classes are the subcategories closed under sub-objects and extensions. But since we're considering arbitrary torsion pairs, we don't know that this is even a torsion pair. So today I want to be considering for arbitrary torsion pairs when we can tilt at such things and how we can interpret this. Does what how we can interpret this? So let me finish the introduction by just this will be relevant, but it's not my assumption right now. I'm just assuming they're related, and that will give us the fact they're related by a tilt. And then I want to consider what happens. So what happens when this tilt is a simple tilt? Okay, if we can do this. And then, of course. If we can do this. And then, of course, one could have said we also want to consider torsion pairs that are cogenerated by simples and ask the same kind of questions. And one can do this, and all of the results that I'll say today have a kind of dual version that corresponds to asking the same questions about this torsion pair. But about this torsion pair. But I'm not going to do that in the talk because there's not enough time to do that. Okay, so let me just say a further word about motivation and then give a kind of hint of what the kind of answers I can give about this situation are in the general case. So, I guess the motivation for this is probably relatively clear for many people in the audience, which is that when we consider the case where h mu is a length category, we saw in David's talk that this corresponds to somehow. Somehow, this happens exactly when μ is functorially finite. So, the torsion class and the torsion free class are functorially finite subcategories of the module category. And this really means that everything is being controlled by some two-term stilting complex in the perfect derived category. And in this case, this operation that we have here, so tilting at a simple That we have here, so tilting at a simple. This corresponds by the Koenig-Yang bijections to mutation of the silting. And this corresponds to other interesting things, I guess, in this wall and chamber diagram. We have. Diagram, we have that this at least gives us some wall crossings. So, so this in this special case where we're assuming that h mu is a length category, the simple tilts really mean something interesting. And the question today is: what if it's not length? So Okay, and what I want to explain is that some kind of answers, so some answers, there's not obviously all answers, to this very vague question, is that simple tilts will, as Carve has mentioned, correspond to cover relations in the lab. In the lattice. And this, I don't claim this as any of my work. This is really just a rephrasing of the brick labeling. So we'll see that we'll come, we'll recover the brick labelling that Emily mentioned in her talk. And we'll also see that it corresponds to a mutation of a different kind. And this is the mutation of large co-silting objects. Objects that I mentioned, we define in our paper with Lydia, Jan, and Josh. Okay, so this is roughly the plan for the rest of the talk. So section two will be somehow looking at how we can get to cover relations very naturally from simple tilts. And then section three, I'll explain what are these large co-silting sets. So and how mutation looks for them and give some idea of why it relates to simple tilting. Okay, is it right that because it's simple tilt in the mutation, you're fixing more than one individual something that's not off and big microray? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, in fact, I could have said sets of simples, but I want to talk about cover relations. So I starting with just one. The mutation will turn out to be. The mutation will turn out to be more related to torsion pairs generated by sets of simples, and then it would be mutation at any number of sum and yeah. I hope that answers your question. Okay, okay, okay, right. So let's move on to section two. So, as I already mentioned, the first non-trivial question is when this pair that I've written down is a torsion pair. So, first question: When is filt s per? In this tilted heart. Okay, so as I mentioned, if we have the length heart, then this is always a torsion pair for any simple because the torsion class, I mean, maybe it's easier to see with the torsion-free class, but. Easier to see with the torsion-free class, but this subcategory is closed under quotients, sub-objects, and extensions, and so therefore it's a torsion-free class. And you can say the same thing for filtrations by a simple. So, to be able to make this statement for an arbitrary tilted heart, we need to restrict which simples we choose. Okay, and what we want to use is that inside this Is that inside this heart? So, where's it written here? We have a pair of subcategories that, okay, this is not a length category, but this part of it lives inside a length category. Okay, so F is really somehow living inside both this heart and also mod A, because it's just the torsion-free class we started with. So, the first lever. That's not too difficult to prove. Is if we start with our mu and we consider some subcategory of the torsion-free class, but we're really going to think of this as a subcategory of Hμ, then. Then one can show that this L is a torsion class if and only if it's closed under the relevant things. So, just to emphasize, this is really not a given in an arbitrary abelian category, but we can use something about sub-objects living inside this subcategory and conclude that we have a maximal sub-object in this torsion class for any object in H mu. And this is enough to show that we have this characterization of torsion classes. And so, in particular, this pair. This pair, so if S lives in V is simple in H mu, then this pair is a torsion pair, okay, in H mu. Okay, and then you can say the same thing for a subcategory of u shifted by minus one. It's a torsion-free class if and only if it's closed under sub-objects and extensions. This is, yeah, this is somehow a very useful observation. Okay, so if we are careful about which simple we choose, we can say at least that this is a torsion pair. Okay. Okay, so now So now we want to be able to okay, let me draw a picture to say what we want to do now. So what do we have so far? So on the one side, we have towards A, and I said this is a post set. In fact, it's a complete lattice. It has a top. It has a top and a bottom, and let's say within this diamond is the rest of the post set. And we're fixing some mu. And then given this fixed mu, this yields another post set with a top and a bottom that lives inside this diamond. And we're canonically given another torsion pair that's mu bar, okay? That's mu bar, okay, and now I'm saying, okay, if I choose some simple that lives inside the torsion class of mu bar, then I have a torsion pair. So what I'm saying is that given S in V, maybe I use a different colour, right at the bottom of this post set, we have a torsion. We have a torsion pair that lives down here. And now I want to somehow ask the question: if I tilt at this torsion pair, do I get another tilt of the module category? Okay, and in order to show that the answer is yes, I'm going to prove, I'm going to state the next theorem that says that all of the torsion pairs that live below Pairs that live below mu bar, this interval, so this subposet is order isomorphic to everything above mu. Okay, and everything, if you tilt anything in here, you get the relevant thing over here, the related thing over here. So let me write it down formally, and then it's maybe easier to digest. So So perhaps this is sort of known to experts, but it's sort of a helpful insight that we proved explicitly in this paper with Lydia, Jan and Shuz. So we actually can prove it in more generality. So let me state it. So say we have the heart of a T structure. And we have our mu in towards H, then there exists an order isomorphism from the interval one mu to one, so everything above mu and below. So everything above mu and below one to everything below mu bar. And we can write this down explicitly. So if I take how to be the torsion pair TF, and we're assuming this is above mu. Assuming this is above mu, so u is contained in t. Then we want to find something that is below mu bar, so that means we want the torsion class to be contained in v so we do this by intersecting v with the torsion class of tau. So this is a torsion class in H mu, and then we need to extend the torsion-free class here, and we extend. Here and we extend by F. Okay, so this is a torsion pair in H mu, and this gives us an order isomorphism. And moreover, so let me write it in this box, we have that H tau is a tilt or the tilt at At the tilt, sorry, of H mu at its image under this isomorphism. Okay, so now we have something that is in this interval, it's below here, and we know that it comes from a tordium pair above mu and in Compare above mu, and indeed that the resulting HRS tilt is an HRS tilt at field S. So we can now kind of give the first answer to our question, like what does this mean? By asking which torsion pairs give us, which torsion pairs in this interval correspond to these simple torsion pairs in this interval. Okay, I hope that makes sense for the question. I hope that makes sense for the question. So this is the this is kind of a theorem, but I wouldn't say it's like my theorem because really it's just the brick labeling, but turned on its head. So if we take tau and mu. And in our module category, then the following are equivalent. First of all, there exists a simple in V. Sorry, this is F. Such that H tau is the tilt of H mu at this simple torsion pair. Now, we know that this means, first of all, by this previous result, that tau is greater than mu. Is greater than mu. And now let's look at this picture again. So we know we have a torsion class here that can't contain any other torsion classes. Okay, this filt S is somehow minimal non-trivial torsion pair in below mu bar in this post set. And one can argue, and I've written some proceedings of the ICRA that I will submit, and I write this argument down. This argument down that, in fact, all non-trivial, the minimal non-trivial torsion pairs below mu bar are exactly those of this form. And in order to argue that, I employ the arguments of the brick labeling, which are due to Barnard Caranajou and Demoné Yama, Reading-Wrighten and Thomas. You'll see the arguments are the same. They argue kind of directly in the module category, and using the same arguments, but in the heart, you can show that. Arguments, but in the heart, you can show that the minimal non-trivial torsion pairs below mu bar are these guys. So, what does that tell us about tau and mu in the module category? Well, it says that these torsion pairs that we're tilting at are right at the bottom here, which means that they're just above mu. So, what we have here is everything that covers mu. Okay, so this tower is above mu, and for anything. So, anything between the two, so any tau prime that is above mu and below tau, we have that tau prime actually coincides with one of them. And this is just saying that tau covers mu, and as I've already said. And as I've already said, this is really just the brick labeling of Barnard, Carol, and Ju and Demon, Iyama, Reading, Wright, and Thomas. Because if you, the way that this order isomorphism works tells us that this torsion class field S is the The ordinary class field S is the intersection of V and T, and S is the label. Okay, so somehow this gives you all the up labels of mu. This dual story I was saying about the torsion pair co-generated by S gives you all the down labels of mu. Okay. Yes. Is that okay? Yeah. Okay. So yeah, this took longer than I had hoped, but now I want to say how all of this can also be interpreted as mutation of something. And I need to tell you what that something is. So this is section three of the talk. So, this is section three of the talk. Okay. Okay, so I'm just going to dive straight in and tell you what we're going to be mutating without really giving much intuition about what these things are and why they're relevant. If you're interested, you can ask me afterwards, but there's just not enough time to. Me afterwards, but there's just not enough time to explain absolutely everything. So, we're gonna now we want to be working in this unbounded derived category. Of course, everything I've been saying so far lives inside the unbounded derived category. And really, in the back of my mind, I'm interested in the bounded derived category, even though I'm going to be talking about big things. Okay. So. So, rather than looking at the whole derived category, I want to follow David and just look at two-term complexes. So, I'm going to fix some notation, which is quite similar to David's. I'm going to write K01 inch A for the full subcategory of two-term complexes of injectives. So, these are complexes where we have injectives in degrees 0 and 1, and everything else is 0. And I want to emphasize this is a capital I, so these are not necessarily finite dimensional injectives, they're just injectives. Okay, so the definition that I want to give, this is the thing we're going to mutate. We're going to mutate, and it will look quite familiar, but we have to include big things, okay? So I'm going to say that a set M contained in this subcategory of indecomposable okay, and now I'm going to be really sneaky and just write a technical term that I'm not going to really define, but ask me if you're interested. And ask me if you're interested. Pure injective objects is called rigid if we have no homomorphisms from any object in M to any shift of any object in M. Yeah, that's it. It okay, so it's the normal notion of rigid, it's pairwise rigid sets. These sets can be infinite now, okay? If they're contained in small mod A, they're just normal rigid subsets of K01 little inch. Okay, and then we're gonna say that if M is maximal rigid, so by this I mean Rigid. So by this, I mean it's maximal among all rigid subsets of K01 of pure injective objects. That's important. Then we say it's a co-silting set. Okay, and then I'm gonna fix the notation. Fix the notation co-silt A for the set of co-silting sets in K01 inch. Okay, so this is the thing that I want to mutate. And before connecting it to the previous section, let me just tell you what I mean by mutating a co-silting set. So, first of all, is the definition clear? It's just rigid subsets of objects of this form, and then I want ones that are maximal among all rigid subsets of objects of this form. That I haven't told you what it is, but I can. Okay. Basically, you can think of Basically, you can think of where I write pure injective. You can think that this says like it behaves like an injective object in a Gross and D category, or it behaves like an injective object in a module category, big module category. Okay, so let's take. So like in David's talk, I could tell you what it means to mutate a co-silting set, but I want to ensure that the result that I get is another co-silting set of two-term complexes. Silting set of two-term complexes. So I'm going to just tell you what it means for two co-silting sets to be related by mutation. Okay, so we say that P is a right mutation of M If we have the following two conditions. So, first of all, let me write down. Oh, yeah. If there exists subsets of the two co-stilting sets and a bijection row from M prime. From M prime to T, such that, first of all, okay, the first condition says that you can build M by removing T prime from T and adding M prime. And you can build T from M by T. From M by removing M prime and adding T prime. Okay. So we can do this. This kind of says that their intersection is this. Is that right? Okay, well, we want this first condition. Can never think when I'm writing on a board. And for everything. For everything in the subset M prime, there exists a triangle from rho of m to something to m where this L map is a is a minimal rod. M minus m prime approximation, minimal left is a minimal left prod m minus m prime approximation, and r is a minimal right prod t minus t prime approximation. Okay, yes. Okay, yes. Sorry, to T prime. Yes. Thank you. Yeah. Okay, so it says that they differ by these sets, M prime, T prime, and these are obtained from each other by approximation. So it looks exactly like mutation that probably people are used to. Okay, and yeah. Of course, these sets, M prime. These sets m prime, since m and t can be infinite, these sets m prime and t m prime and t prime can be infinite. But if they just contain one element, we want to say that's an irreducible mutation. Yes, thank you. So if the cardinality of m prime, and of course this always equals the cardinality of t prime, is one. You have T prime is one, then we say it's irreducible. Mutation. Okay. Okay, so this is very nice. I've told you a definition. I've told you how to mutate it, but it doesn't seem very relevant to what we've seen before. So let me make that connection. And this is a theorem that comes from the paper, the first paper I wrote on the board. The first paper I wrote on the board, so joint with Lydia Angeleri, Hugo. Um, ah, sorry, no, this will be from the paper with Lydia and Francesco, because it's special to this setting of Artinian rings. This is that if we take M in co-silt A, then we can consider the following. We can consider the following pair of subcategories of the unbounded derived category. Okay, let me write the notation that explains it. So I hope, I mean, is this notation clear, first of all, or should I explain it? It's okay. It's, yeah, orthogonal to all positive shifts of M. Yeah, okay. So we consider this pair of subcategories. This is a T structure. Structure in the unbounded derived category. Okay, and in fact, this is a co-silting T structure. So if you've seen any talks about big co-silting before, this T structure is an example of what you will have seen. But the novelty is that since A is an Artinian ring, what we can show with Lydia and Francesco is that these. Is that these co-silting subcategories that I've defined, these maximal rigid subcategories, these completely determine the co-silting subcategories. Okay, and if you've got two different co-silting subcategories, they give you different T structures. So you don't need any notion of equivalence even. Okay. And I'm going to denote the heart of these things by A M with heart. With heart AM. Okay. And then the connection that we can make with the first part is that there is a bijection from post-silt A, so from our maximal rigid subsets of these pure injective objects into the lattice. It's an order-preserving bijection if you. If you either want, you can either order these things by the inclusions of the aisles, or you can order them by orthogonal, like M is, oh, okay, let's just say inclusions of aisles. I can write down a different ordering as well. That's just like in the silting case. So let's call this bijection gamma. And moreover, if we have some mu that is That is the image of some co-silting subset under this gamma. Ah, sorry, I can tell you what it is. We take a co-silting subset and we know we have this t structure. And we know that the small module category embeds into the derived category by just putting the modules in degree zero. And if we just intersect this T structure with the small This T structure with the small module category, we get a torsion pair. And all torsion pairs arise like this. Okay, so it's easy bijection, easy to write down bijection. And if mu is the image of some Co-silting subset, then you might have guessed what I'm about to say. The HRS tilt of the standard T structure is just this T structure here. But of course, this is a T structure in the small. This is a T structure in the small in db small mod, so we need to restrict this. Okay, and one more thing that we can say, I mean, we can say many things, but one more thing I'm going to say is that the heart of this T structure is related to this, the heart of this T structure in a nice way, which is that the finitely presented object of this heart. Objects of this heart are exactly the HRS tilt at mu. And it's a locally coherent Gross and Deep category, but I'm not going to write that. Okay, so now in the last two minutes, let me state a theorem that, yeah. I'll state the theorem, but I won't write down the I'll state the theorem, but I won't write down the irreducible version of it because I don't think I have time. So the theorem is, and really this is contained in the paper with Lydia, Jan and Georges that's on the archive. But yeah, you can also sort of reprove it from the perspective that I've been talking about here in some sense. Okay. So, we're going to take two co-silting subsets, and we want them, we also want notation for the corresponding torsion pairs. So we have mu and tau like before, then the following statements are equivalent. So, first of all, t T is a right mutation of mu, a thrive M. It turns out that mutation in general, so I said there's this general version of mutation, comes down to HRS tilting at special torsion pairs in the heart AM. Let me tell you what that means in this particular Tell you what that means in this particular case. So it means that there is a SER subcategory S, say, that's contained in V of, so it's a SERS subcategory of H mu. So this is the finitely presented object of A M such that A T is an Is an HRS tilt, a tilt, sorry, I wasn't writing HRS, a tilt of AM at the torsion pair generated by this SERS subcategory. Okay, so it turns out that SER subcategories of the finitely presented objects due to some work of Henning and in parallel, Evo Hurt. And in parallel, Ibo-Herzog, they parameterize the hereditary torsion pairs of finite type in AM, and tilting at these is exactly what gives us mutation. So it tells us that the SER subcategories of H mu are controlling the mutation theory in this sense over here. Okay, and how do we relate it to simple tilts? Well, one can prove that One can prove that all subcategories that live inside V, since V is somehow a subcategory of a module category of a length category, the same, it inherits the property that this subcategory has to be filled of a set of symbols. Okay, this is something that's true in length categories. So a set, there exists a set, I'll call it omega, that again lives inside v of. Inside V of simples in H mu, such that this S is filt of this, but we can also say that this is equivalent to H tau is a tilt or is the tilt of H mu at the torsion. μ at the torsion pair filt omega and the orthogonal of omega. And I'm already over time, so the thing I won't write down is that, of course, irreducible mutations correspond to sets of one simple. Okay, thank you very much. Sorry for going over. Thank you for. Thank you for that counsel. I learned that the colours are found in the city of the United States. So, I was wondering about the second part of your theorem. Yes. In this bijection, I believe that the pre-image of those which are mapped to functorially finite torsion classes are the co-silting which are kind of finitely generated or something like that. Yeah, exactly. So, if so, if this set M M is contained in their finite dimensional injectives, then it actually follows that if you have a, if it's a co-silting set, then it has to be finite. And so, of course, maximal rigid subsets of two-term complexes of finite dimensional or finite length injectives are co-silting, the usual co-silting, and these are exactly the functor already finite. Silting, and these are exactly the functori finite ones under this bijection. Because the covering in the lattice of torsion classes is given by the bricks, which would amount to the simple objects that you have. Yeah. But when you are given a brick or equivalent, even you are given a simple, can you see whether or not from this new perspective, can you see whether or not this brick belongs to a one parameter family or it's just like a brick living happily for itself? Living happily for itself without sharing the dimension with the others? I don't know. I mean, it's, I guess, is something that I would like to know, and I haven't really got any concrete ideas of how to determine that, but I would probably need different techniques to determine that. Perfect. Thank you. Any other question? So you define right of mutation here, and could you explain me the existence and the uniqueness of a mutation if you choose a T prime and M prime? Yeah, so if we just choose, say, an M prime in M, then if it is, if there exists left approximations of all Of all of M, so if it's covariantly, contravariantly finite, whichever one is appropriate in M, then there exists a mutation that is co-silting in a more generalized way. I'm not sure how to determine whether it's two-term, but it's the existence of these approximations somehow. Two-term property is. Yeah. That's why I wrote it like this because I wanted to. Why I wrote it like this because I wanted to say they're both two terms to start with. Um, but yeah, it's the existence of the approximations, yeah, and it's not always possible to mutate. Is it possible to mutate if you consider arbitrarily causal complex? It depends on the subset that you choose. Like sometimes it's just not possible to mutate. So, for example, over the chronicer. For example, over the chronicer, there's a co-silting set given by the proofers and the generic, and you can't mutate it. Like if you took the generic as the thing that you want to change, then you can't do it. Yeah. Is there any reasonable way to understand the subset of M such that one can mutate? Okay, so there is actually some nice setting where Where there is a really nice way of doing it, but it's either all finite dimensional algebras or just ones that have some nice property called the isolation condition. But it turns out that these m's and t's are closed subsets of a topological space, and the places that you can mutate, do the irreducible mutation at least, are the isolated points of the space. Points of the subset. So there is in some setting, conjecturally, all set all finite dimensional algebras where you can say something nice. Thank you very much. Yeah, so there don't seem to be questions from the Zoom audience. Sorry. Sorry. Well, can we leave it for after? Because we have to resume at 11.30. Ah, well, yeah. Yeah. We can talk. We can talk. Yeah, so let's think roughly.
