Relationship between low concavity and heat flow. Please, Paolo. Okay, thank you, Andrea. Thanks for inviting me to the organizers. I am afraid my talk is a little bit outside of the framework of this workshop, but I hope that you can be interested. In any case, that you can enjoy it. So, what I am going to speak at is It is connected to some joint works with Kazuiro Ishige from the University of Tokyo and with Ishige and also Azuka Takatsu from Tokyo Metropolitan University. Okay, what sorry, so it is not okay. Sorry, we tried it before. Okay, now it's going. Okay, so. Okay, so we studied. We have a project about studying concavity properties of solutions to elliptic and parabolic equations. And so let me recall in this framework two famous classical results. So I don't understand why. Sorry, but I don't understand why the is not. Let me try in this way. Okay, maybe in this way is better. Maybe in this way is better. Okay, so the first one regards the torsion function. I mean, in a convex domain. So I mean, if you consider the solution of Laplacian of u equal minus one in a domain omega and u equals zero on the boundary of omega, if omega is convex, then it is known that the square root of u is concave. Using a terminology that I will introduce later, we can say that the u is one half concave. So this results Concave. So, this result is due to Makhar Limanov in the plane and Kennington extended, and other one, for instance, Kabul and other one extended it in 1985. And another famous result, which is more connected to the things I'm going to speak, regards the first positive eigenfunction of the Richley Laplacian. And so, if you consider the first positive eigenfunction of a convex domain. eigenfunction of a convex domain omega with a zero boundary condition. If omega is convex, then the logarithm of u is concave, which the terminology of power concavities, we can say that u is log concave. This result was first proved by Braskampelippe in 1976 in a famous paper where they prove several interesting results and in particular this And in particular, this result about the low concavity of the eigenfunction is a corollary of a result about the heat flow, which is strongly connected to this torque. So if you consider the heat equation in a domain omega, convex domain, so omega will be always a convex domain in this torque, and times zero infinity. And you consider u is zero on the boundary of omega. u is zero on the boundary of omega for every time. And if you have an initial initial data on phi of x which is log concave, then the logarithm of u will remain forever concave with respect to the space to the x with respect to the spatial variable for every time. So in other words, the log concavity of the initial datum is preserved, sorry, is preserved by the I don't have to press the black the keyboard. So, in other words, the low concavity of the initial datum is preserved by the Rich Leid flow in a convex domain. So, the proof by Braskambelieb of this result is very elegant and it is based on the Precopalander inequality. The Precopalander inequality tells the following. If you have three Have three measurable non-negative functions in Rn. Lambda is a fixed parameter strictly greater than between zero and one. So I write here strictly greater than zero, but between zero and one. And if this assumption that you see here is satisfied by this three functions, then so that then H calculated in the convex combination of two point X and Y. of two point x and y is greater or equal than f of x raised to the power one minus lambda lambda times g of y raised to power lambda and this happens for every x and y in Rn then you have that the L1 norm of H is greater or equal than the geometric mean of the L one norm of F and the L one norm of G. The L1 norm of G. Geometric mean, I mean the integral of f raised to power one minus lambda times the integral, so L1 norm of g raised to power lambda. So this, let me recall, let me give you some few remarks about the precopoland line inequality. Okay, so the assumption, the assumption here, which is of course very important. Of course, very important as every assumption. So, can be rewritten in this way. If you consider the logarithm of H in the convex combination of X and Y, then this is greater equal than the convex combination of the logarithm of F of X and the logarithm of G of Y. So, you understand that logarithm of concavity is somehow involved. And And so, if for instance, if f, g, and y are the same function, this precisely means that if sorry, h, f, and g are the same function, then this exactly means that this function must be log concave. So we can rewrite the inequality also in this way. So, this is the inequality, which is true for every edge such that this is satisfied. Then you can rewrite this in just in one line by saying that the integral By saying that the integral of the supremum of f of x times to raised to power one minus lambda times g of y raised to power lambda when one minus lambda x plus lambda y is equal to zeta and you integrate with respect to zeta. So this is a supremal convolution of this geometric mean of f and y. Then this is greater or equal than the geometric mean of the L1 norm. mean of the L1 norms of F and G. So this is the, I mean, this is supremo, the one that you see here defined is the smallest possible function function H satisfying the assumption. So moreover, if you give a look to this inequality and you think to the you remind the holder inequality, then you can see that precautionary. Inequality, then you can see that pre-copolander inequality can be seen as a sort of inverse older inequality. Older inequality, in fact, says that the integral of f raised to one minus lambda times g raised to lambda is less or equal than the geometric is less or equal than the geometric mean of the L1 norms of f and g. But here f and g are calculated in the same point x. So the assumption of Brakopolande is very strong. Assumption of the Copolande is very strong. So it's not just here, you have to take any two-point H and Y, and then H is greater or equal to this function here for every H and Y. So it is not in contradiction, of course, with the Elder inequality. And moreover, the Coppolander inequality can be considered, is not can be considered, but is in fact a functional form of the so-called brute Functional form of the so-called Brumi-Kovsk inequality. The Brumi-Kovsk inequality can be stated in several ways. One is this multiplicative way, and it says that if you consider two measurable sets, K0 and K1, and you consider the Minkowski combination, one means lambda K0 plus Lambda Ky, then the measure, the volume of these Minkowski combinations is greater or equal than the volume of K. Is greater or equal than the volume of k0, volume I mean, the measure raised to one minus lambda times the measure of k1 raised to power lambda. As soon as this set here, one minus lambda k0 plus lambda k1 is measurable. In any case, it works for outer measure. So you can get this from, so they are equivalent. Perkopolandre inequality and the Brumikovsky inequality are equivalent. Koskin inequality are equivalent, but it's easy to see how to get Brummi-Kovsk inequality from Pricopalander inequality. Just take the function key of K0, K of K1, the characteristic function of the evolved sets, and you can see that you immediately, you apply the Copelandian inequality, and you immediately get Brumninkovsky. Okay, so let me, since it is, I think it is. Since it is, I think it is very beautiful, so let me remind you the proof of the preservation of low concavity made by Braskampelibde using the pre-Copolander inequality. Here I just consider the case when omega is equal to Rn. Then consider the solution of the it equation, U t equal Laplacian u in Rn times zero plus infinity with the initial datum phi of X and assume that the And assume that the logarithm of phi is concave. So, phi is not concave. Then, of course, we can write down explicitly the solution. uxt is given by this. It is the convolution of the kernel with the initial datum. And then you can write in this way or in this way. And it has to be noticed that the kernel, in fact, is log concave since log of e raised to minus x square half. minus x square half is minus x square half which is of course concave then what we want to prove is that u is log concave with respect to the variable x which means you can we can rewrite in this way just that if you take the logarithm you get immediately what that u is log concave so it is equivalent to say that u calculated in the point one minus lambdas zero plus lambdas y with fixed time t That's y with fixed time t is greater or equal to of u x 0 raised to power minus 1 minus lambda time times u in x1 raised to power lambda. And then you remind what is u x0, ux1, ux lambda. I call x lambda this point here, okay, just using the expression with the convolution of the kernel with phi. And then And then set f y equal to this, to the integrand of ux0, g of y the integrand when you have to calculate ux1, h of y the integrand when you have to calculate u in x lambda. And so our aim concites with proving that the integraph of h. Proving that the integral of h is greater or equal than the mean, that the geometric mean of the integral of f and the integral of g. Then you can understand that pre-copolam is involved. And indeed, we have that h, f and g, the three functions that are the integrand here, in fact, they satisfy the assumption of recoplandry just because the kernel and file. The kernel and phi are log concave. Just consider a log concavity of e raised to minus x square and phi. Then you have that this is greater or equal than this product and this is greater or equal than this product. And then you get that at the end you have that h and here you have f you have h in one minus lambda y zero plus lambda y one and this is just And this is just u in y zero here is sorry f in y zero and this is g in y one so x zero x one and x lambda are considered as parameter what we are interested in are y zero y one and y lambda so and so we have these three functions they satisfy the precopalander the assumption of the precoplander inequality then we can apply the precopal inequality Inequality. Sorry, I write BL, PL, and we have done. Okay, so of course, different proofs are possible. This, in my opinion, is of course fantastic, but we can give different proof, especially based on PD's technique. And the one proof can go like can go can go like I'm now explaining. It is based on making the concave envelope of the logarithm of U. And essentially it is based on an idea of Alvarez-Lasdier-Leon. Okay, then consider the logarithm of U. U is the solution of course of the heat flow and then we consider the concave envelope of V just respect of the X Just respect of the x variable. So for every fixed set t, you consider a view v of xt, and you make the convex symbol with respect to x. So something like this, this you have a v at time t, this is the shape, and then you consider v star is just the concave envelope. So at the end, the aim is to show that when you make the concave envelope, nothing happens. So v is in fact coincides with. V is in fact coincides with V star. So, how can we prove this? Of course, V star is greater or equal than V by construction. It's easy to see this. And also, V star at time zero is the concave envelope of V at time zero, the logarithm of phi, but the logarithm of phi is already concave, then nothing happens at time zero, and V star is. happens at time zero and V star is coincided with V at time zero. And then the harder part of the proof is the following. Then if one can prove that V star is a viscosity subsolution of the equation, then using the comparison principle, one can get that V star is in fact must be in fact less or equal than V. You can compare them. And since you know that it must be less or equal than V, then at the end they coincide as desired. As desired. So, and this is possible. This is something that works. So, this is another proof. And, of course, it is possible to have other proofs based on PD's technique. Of course, it is possible to use what is called the concavity maximum principle. This was done by Coribar in 1983. What does it mean? It means that if you consider this is a function. This is a function c lambda of x, y, and t t is just a parameter, so t is fixed, which is given by v v is the logarithm of u okay calculated in one minus lambda x plus lambda y minus one minus lambda v of x minus lambda v of y. Then to prove that v is concave, it is equivalent to prove that c is greater or equal than zero. Greater equal than zero, then you can prove that this function c does not have a negative minimum in omega times omega for any time. And okay, this is another technique. And you can also have technique based on the cost and rank theorems, which is a very powerful technique which was produced by Cafareli Friedman. And for instance, in the audience, we have an expert which is Audience: We have an expert which is Pencroguana of this technique, and of course, it can be applied also to this situation. Okay, so I showed you the proof for Rn, but of course it can be done also for a genetic complex domain once you prove that the kernel is log concave. And the question is: does it work only for log concavity? So, what I mean is, are there other concavity properties of the initial Other concavity properties of the initial datum which are preserved by the heat flow. And when I say preserved, so I mean that if the heat flow is something concave, then can we say that the solution has always the same concavity? Which are, so let me show you some examples of concavity properties. So for instance, power concavity is a way to generate Concavity is a way to generalize the usual concavity, which is defined in this. So, defined, it can be defined in a more precise way, analytical way, but roughly speaking, we can say that U is alpha concave for some alpha, for some real alpha. If the support set of U is convex and U raised to the power alpha is concave in omega, this. Concave in omega, this for alpha strictly greater than zero. When alpha is equal to zero, this corresponds to low concavity. It is zero concave or log concave if log of u is concave in omega. When alpha is negative, pay attention so that if alpha is negative, then we say that u is alpha concave if u to power alpha is convex. And then there is the weakest possible properties, which is when alpha is equal to minus infinity, we say. equal to minus infinity we say that u is quasi-concave which means that all the levels all the super level set of u are convex for instance if you consider the function one over one plus x square then this is minus one half a concave for instance okay so uh so quasi-concavity as i was saying uh corresponds to say that every superliver set of u is A set of u is convex, and clearly, if u is alpha-concave for any alpha, then u is quasi-concave. And more in general, there is a hierarchy among power concavities. If a function is alpha-concave and alpha is greater than beta, then u is also beta-concave. Then the power concavity are stronger when alpha. Stronger when alpha is greater, when the power is greater. And of course, quasi-concavity is the weakest one. Let me remind that in the one-dimensional case, quasi-concavity corresponds to what is called also unimodality. So a quasi-concave function is a function such that it is monotone, increasing or decreasing, doesn't change. Or if it is not monotone, then it If it is not monotone, then it first increases and then decreases. And then, when you get the intersection with any constant line, then you have an interval. So, which means a convey set in the one dimension. Okay, now I can ask a more precise question. Since I have many concavity properties and there is a hierarchy, I can compare one with another one. One. Then, a quite natural question is to ask which is the strongest power concavity preserved by the Drich Leat flow. And as I told you, preserved means that if the initial Datum Pfizer is alpha concave in omega, then I say that alpha concavity is preserved if then U is the solution of the heat flow is alpha concave with respect to X for every T. For every t strictly greater than zero. And of course, it is also interesting if there is a weakest one which is preserved. One can hope that quasi-concavity is always preserved. I mean, one can guess if you have a quasi-concave initial datum, then you can hope that the solution is always quasi-concave. Okay, the answer. Okay, the answer about the question: which is the strongest power concavity, also the weakest for n greater or equal than two among power concavity. So the answer is that only low concavity is preserved among power concavities. Furthermore, if the initial data is alpha concave for any alpha less than zero, so low concavity is the strongest and it's also the weakest, but not only, one can wonder, okay. But not only one can wonder: okay, maybe another alpha concavity is not preserved, but maybe the solution, if you have that, you start with an initial datum, which is say minus one half concave, at least the solution will be quasi-concave. This is not even true. And if phi is less than log concave, then even quasi-concavity may be. Then, even quasi-concavity may be immediately lost. And this was proved first in a paper by me and Shiga in 2008. We proved that there exists some alpha less than zero such that the alpha concavity of the initial datum can be lost. I mean, we can show an example of initial datum, which is alpha concave for some alpha less than zero, such that. Alpha less than zero, such that the solution is not quasi-concave. And then with again with Yushige and Takatsu in 2020, we proved that this is possible for every alpha less than zero. Then for every alpha less than zero and for every t greater than zero, there exists at least one example of initial daton such that the initial daton is alpha concave, but the solution is not quasi-concave for some t between zero and big t. So the So even the quasi-concavity is immediately lost. So let me say that this is true for n greater or equal than two, while for n equal one, also quasi-concavity is preserved, because this is due to a result by Angenente, I think this is the pronunciation, of 1988. And thanks to this result, one can see that the number of One can see that the number of critical points is not increasing in t. Then, if you start without a critical point, so a monotone function, or with just one critical point, a function which is first increasing, then decreasing, then nothing can happen to destroy quasi-concavity. And another interesting result in this regard is the one by Lee Baskets, which tells the final destiny of the heat flow in Rn when you start with any When you start with any compactly supported initial data, the final destiny is to become log concave. So if you have that phi is compact support and is non-negative, so the positive non-negative function phi with compact support, then the solution of the heat flow becomes lock-concave in finite time, and then it remains forever. So there is a large time such that after this, of course, the large time depends on the initial data. The large time depends on the initial Daphne, but for every compactly supported initial Daphne, then this will happen. So, if one thinks about this, then one see that it seems that there is a very strong relationship between heat flow and low concavity. And this is, of course, true. So, there is a sort of magic relationship. And one may think that that's all. So, nothing different from this can happen. Nothing different from this can happen. So if you have low concavity and the heat flow is a sort of marriage which cannot be broken. But in fact, if we enlarge our interest and we consider more general more general generalization, sorry, for this bad way to say, more general generalization of concavity, then something different. Concavity, then something different may happen. So let us consider then what is called F-concavity or concavifiability. Sorry, this is a very bad word, but it is used sometimes in especially in economy. So, okay, then you consider a function f from an interval, real interval 0a. So we are speaking about concavity properties of non-excavity. Concavity properties of non-negative functions, then we just consider functions which are defined in an interval, in positive interval. From then, f big f goes from 0A to R, possibly taking minus infinity value, which is and we take F strictly increasing. Now A can be also plus infinity, then can be just the half-line Z plus infinity. And F we consider F which And f we consider f which is continuous from in the interval 0a. Okay, maybe it may lose continuity in 0, it may go to minus infinity when s tends to 0, but it is continuous in 0a. Then a non-negative function u is said f concave if f o u is concave. As I said, it is also u. As I said, it is also used this expression u is said concave concavifiable if there exists such an f such that f of u is concave. Okay, then also in this general setting, in this most general setting, we can consider, we can have a hierarchy, then F1 concavity is said stronger than F2 concavity. It's stronger than F2 concavity is if every F1 concave function is also F2 concave. And the quasi-concavity does not correspond to any F, but we can consider also this an F concavity, and it is still the weakest concavity properties. I mean, if you have any, if a function u is F concave for any admissible f, then it must be also quasi-concave. Be also quasi-concave. Okay, so the ordering between F-concavities is easily expressed by these properties. So if you have F and G admissible on the same interval, then F concavity is stronger than G concavity if and only if the composition between G and the inverse function of F is concave. In, of course, in F in the image of zero A with through F. Okay, for. Okay, for instance, you can consider this function fms equal to square root of m minus s. This is admissible in the interval 0m. And in this case, fm concavity is stronger than one concavity. I mean the usual concavity. Indeed, if a function u, of course, which takes value between 0 and m, then if fm of u is concave, then u must be concave. So notice that. So, notice that the torsion function in a ball is exactly fm concave, where m is its maximum. And these properties characterize ellipsoids. So, this is something that we proved together with Han Ru, Carlo Nietzsche, which is here in the audience, and Christina from Betty. So, this is a sort of over-determined problem where the over-determination is the concavity of the involved function. Okay, so if we broaden our attention to have concavity, then the situation about also the situation about the heat flow changes. And we can define this, we can consider this function, L alpha going from 0, 1 to R minus infinity, which is defined as minus the minus log raised to the power alpha. And we say that the function u is alpha log concave if Is alpha log concave if L if L function u which takes value between zero and one if L alpha of U is concave, then what happens is that log concavity corresponds to alpha equal one clearly. Okay, if you take alpha equal one, you get back to log of s. And if alpha is less or equal than beta and positive, then u and u is alpha concave, then u is beta concave in omega. Then the hierarchy now is opposite. The hierarchy now is opposite. I mean, so it is just that, so using this notation, then alpha concavity implies alpha log concavity. Sorry, I say I wrote alpha concave, alpha log concave. I was meaning here, sorry. This alpha log concave implies that u is beta log concave nomina. Again, this is alpha log concave. Sorry, if u is alpha log concave, okay, this tree is not important. What is important is. three is not important. What is important is that the Gauss kernel is exactly one half log concave. And it is precisely one half log concave because if you consider L one half of the exponential of minus A x square, then it is minus C x. Then we are just precisely concave and nothing more. So thanks to this property too is easily seen. This property too is easily seen that alpha concavity is stronger than low concavity if alpha is less than one, it's stronger. And what we proved with Shige and Takats in 2020 is that one alpha low concavity and every alpha low concavity between one alpha and one, and the best is one alpha, is preserved by the heat flow. Then it is not true that the That the low concavity is the strongest low concavity preserved, but the strongest low concavity preserved is one alpha low concavity. Moreover, if you consider any, so is the strongest because it is also true that if you consider any F concavity stronger than one alpha log concavity, then it is not preserved. And then, as I said, then one alpha log concavity is really the strongest concavity preserved by the Richie. Concavity preserver by the Rich Lid flow. Moreover, the final destiny of any of the heat flow when you start with a compactly supported initial datum is exactly not exactly one alpha law concatenating. We were not able to arrive to this, but for every alpha between one alpha and one, there exists a time t alpha such that the solution becomes alpha log concave after. alpha log concave after this time T alpha. Unluckily in our proof when alpha tends to one alpha T alpha tends to plus infinity then we cannot get one alpha loconca but we are convinced that this this works and we are also convinced that the let me give you a conjecture that the that the first eigenfunction of the of the Dirichlet Laplacian The Dirichlet Laplacian is one alpha log concave in a convex domain, something which is stronger than what is known curved. And then I finish by going back to Law Concave. In fact, they say this relationship, this intimate, a magic relationship between low concavity and heat flow, in fact, still remains. It is not broken by. Is not broken by this result because if you consider functions f which are admissible in zero plus infinity, then if you don't want to restrict to initial data which are bounded between zero and one, then low concavity remain the strongest and they only have concavity preserved by the Richelieu flow. This is in fact a working process, so just let me say that we think we have proved this, but I just This, but I just give an announcement. I hope I'm not wrong in that the proof is true. Then, if you consider F, which is going from zero to plus infinity in R and possibly minus infinity, strictly increasing, continuous in zero infinity, and such that f of zero is equal to minus infinity. Then, if f concavity is preserved, then f must be the logarithm. Logarithm. And okay, then I can. This is the end of my talk. Thank you very much. Thanks, Paolo, for your talk. Are there any questions or remarks, comments? The audio is very, very good, but or something. Very bad ladding, and there is an echo as well. Echo as well. I don't know. Well, I don't know why. Okay, no, no, just to note what happens if you replace the Laplacian by a non-linear operation. If you replace the Laplacian by a non-linear operator by looking at the barbutts, I understand that with the question. Okay, so consider the UI or the same thing. I don't know. Okay, okay, maybe I still hear echo button. It may be a problem. Still hear echo, but it may be a problem. Okay, now I don't hear echo. Okay, now it's okay. I think now it's okay. Now it's okay. Yes, thanks. Now it's okay. Yeah. Okay. So yes, if you consider, for instance, the police medium equation, then there is a precise exponent which is related to the exponent of the equation, which is preserved, such that the power concavity is preserved. And I don't mean the porous medium because the porous medium you can rephrase as. Because the porous medium you can rephrase as a Laplacian of a power view. Yes, yes. So the porous medium, or if you consider a ut equal P Laplacian of sorry. So if you also consider the equation U T equal the P Laplacian of U, then also in this case, there is a power. If you consider a power which A power which concavity which is preserved, but we don't have this optimal result in this. At least we didn't try to prove this optimal result in this case, but I guess that one can probably obtain similar optimal result also in these cases, I hope. And in general, I guess that if you have a general equation, say ut equals a general f of u some General F of you, some elliptic equation, then I guess there should be some optimal concavity which is related to the operator F, which is preserved by this equation. But this is just remember somehow these old papers by Gaffer-Elien Friedman, and they are more general than what is needed just for the Laplacian. I mean, is yeah, yes, no, you are perfect. Yeah, yes, no, no, you are perfectly right. So, so you can prove the preservation of concavity of some concavity properties for many different operators. There are many results. So, here the question is, which is the... It would be interesting to understand if it's a parallel just with the power or if it also involves something more complex as the intrinsic geometry by looking at these barn-blood solutions and so forth. Yes, yes. So forth, maybe. Yes, yes, certainly interesting. Yes, I think it is not just the power. So, as you could see, also in this case, also in the case, in the simple case of it equation, you can find something which is log alpha. So, some strange F concavity. And okay, so in general, you can expect. So, I mean, so there are many results about concavity properties of. The concavity properties of ellipsoid of solution of elliptic equation, preservation of concavities for some parabolic equation. But when you look to sharp properties, and in general, you have some power, some simple concavity which is preserved. When you look to sharp properties, then sometimes some strange concavity properties is involved. And you can look to sharpness in different ways. In different ways. For instance, here we are looking to the strongest or the weakest concavity properties, which is preserved. But for instance, in the paper with Carlo and Christina and Antoine, we were looking to the optimal concavity for solution of torsion of the torsion function. And there are some strange square root of m minus u. Square root of m minus u, some strange, so it is not always so simple. So I think you are right. Something is involved with and for porous medium equations or something related to something that involves also the shapes of the sets that you are considering. Yes, the shape of the sets and the shape and the shape of fundamental fundamental solution and of the kernel in this case you can see that the kernel when you can write the When you can write the solution with a kernel, then if you look to the kernel, so for instance, we tried hardly to prove the same result using a stronger refined version of Palandra inequality based on the fact that the kernel of heat equation is more than log concave. But we didn't succeed. But it will be very interesting to find the proof based on the fact that the On the fact that the kernel is. Of course, our proof is also somehow based on the fact that the kernel is one-half log concave, but not directly. So we use some PD's proof, but of course, this is involved in the result. Any other question? Yeah, I have a question. Yes, yes. Do we have a it's it's very close let's see can you hear me? No, yes, yes, okay. Um, so perhaps you answered the question actually at the end, but let me ask again. So, Bras can bleep prove that if you have the marginal of an alpha concave function, then this is beta concave. Then this is beta concave, where beta is somehow related to alpha. Is something true that, like, if you have this log alpha concavity, that the marginal is log beta concave for some? We tried to prove. We were not able to prove it. So there is something. So we were not able. So we hoped to prove something like this, but we were not able. But you don't have counterexamples either. Don't have counterexamples either. No, we don't have counterexamples. But somehow it is involved with the, you know, when you prove the Borel-Bras-Camp Lib inequality, then somehow the homogeneity is involved, makes things easier. And in this case, you have no homogeneity. You would have no homogeneity of the involved, say, integral and integral. So this makes Integrance. So, this makes things very, very hard. At least we were not able, but maybe one can try with the mass transportation. I don't know. One, so it will be very nice. I think it will be very interesting. So, I think something, some inequality, some stronger inequality or refined equality should be true, but I don't. Okay. But do your result give that the eigenfunction is log alpha concave for every alpha graph? Alpha concave for every alpha greater than one half? No, we are not able to prove because there is some parameter, you know, that to get, so one possibility to get low concavity of the first eigenfunction is to let time stand to infinity and then you make you normalize the solution of the iteration using time. Time and then this tends to the if you make the right normalization, this tends to the eigenfunction that you get low concavity. When you make the same with the alpha low concavity, this normalization does not work in the same way and we were not able to get the same result. We guess it is true, but we were not able to make a precise. We thought at the beginning we thought we have a proof, but then Have a proof, but then there is some parameter which is going to zero, which does not permit to this limit, this limit, at least what we did. But maybe we guess. The conjecture is that this is true. Right. Very interesting. Very interesting. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. So I can probably interrupt. I would thank Paul again. Thank Paolo again and stop the recording and
