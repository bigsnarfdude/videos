Yeah, so today I'm going to talk about some recent studies on yield stress fluid in Porosmedia. Just before getting started, I want to thank my PIs in the course of these studies, Luca Brandon, Utita Misolo at KTH in Stockholm, and also Ian Frigard in UBC, and a couple. UBC and a couple of my colleagues, Dimitrios at MIT and Dalton at Alto University, and of course the fundings, Linear Frost Center and ERC, and also Swedish Research Council. Yeah, so Porosvadia flows are pretty well documented if the flow is Newtonian. And so we can easily scale up from porous scale to macro scale using the Darcy. Microscale using the Dulcie's equation since the fluid constitutive equation is linear. But the story is a little bit different in yield stress fluids. Well, first of all, the constitutive equation is not linear anymore. And also, the flow could be heterogeneous depending on the topology. Now, I will talk about this heterogeneity in the next slides. Slides. Just a minimal example could be the flow over these kind of cavities or fractures. So you see that the flow are the same, despite the shapes are different of the cavities. And that's because the yield stress fluid basically can't sense the exact shape of the cavity because of the yield stress. Yeah, so there are some nice studies on. So, there are some nice studies on yield stress fluid in Perse Media. I can't definitely review all of that, but just to highlight some main points. Well, first of all, we know that we need basically finite pressure gradient to start the flow because of yield stress. And also, the flow is heterogeneous, as I mentioned. So, you see here, for example, if the if the Here, for example, if the pressure gradient is just above the critical pressure gradient, then the flow is highly localized at this channel. And when you keep increasing the pressure gradient, then next and next channels will open up. So these are the results based on stochastically constructed PressMedia. But the story is the same if you use net. The story is the same if you use network models where you represent the post media with some throats and nodes. So you see again you can get the first open channel and then as you increase the pressure gradient, the next channels. And another point, if you are interested in the flow rate, is that the flow rate as a function of pressure gradient has basically three main regimes. Basically, three main regimes. So, at the two limits, which is high pressure gradient or low pressure gradient, it's almost linear. And in the middle range, it's sort of quadratic and increases more rapidly. Yeah, so we want to move on and also fill some gaps in these background studies. So, first Studies. So, first of all, yeah, basically, the connection of network models to Poruscale. So here I'm making my Porusmedia with some randomized obstacles, okay, some mono-disperse, non-overlapping obstacles. And then based on that, we will construct our network using maximum algorithm. Using maximal algorithm. And so, in what follows, I will show the one minus prosity, which is well known in the terminology of Porismedia with phi. So this phi is basically the solid volume fraction. And so we do full fluid flow simulations just at the L limit. Okay, so when the pressure gradient is When the pressure gradient is just exceeding the critical pressure gradient. So you see that we can get the first channels. These are the results using the augmented Lagrangian and adoptive mesh to get reliable results. And then we compare it with the network model predictions and for different volume fractions. And you see that basically the channel. See that basically the channels are the same, okay? So we can predict the channels, right? And also, I mean, not only the channels, but also the critical pressure gradient, which are the same in both. So this method is pretty slow because of augmented Lagrangian, but this network model is pretty fast, especially at this limit, a yield limit when. Limit a yield limit when the equation is all linear. Yeah, so we can get the critical pressure gradient as a function of volume fraction for different ratios of the radius of these obstacles to the domain size. So we can get the master curve, of course, if we are using the right scaling. Using the right scaling, and that scaling is the non-dimensional pressure gradient or the inverse of yield number, which is well known in this context, as a function of the solid volume fraction. So we can find the functionality as well by feeding the data. So it's more or less like these terms, okay? So it's quadratic, and if you quadratic and if you if you look at what it really means is that um yeah so it's it's the void volume um fraction over the solid volume fraction okay so so the critical yield number is sort of like void volume over the solid volume squared yeah so so what I presented so far was for simple ulycerous fluids that we know as a viscoplast. We know as viscoplastic fluids, but we know that there is elasticity for these kinds of fluids as well. I will talk about it later, but there are some nice experimental studies that reported that these kind of materials that yield the stress fluids can slide over the solid boundaries as well. And it's a little bit different from Navier sleep. Navier sleep, in a sense that now we have a tau s, which is a sliding yield stress. Okay, so I would talk about it. Yeah, so it can have different root causes, this apparent sleep. One is the depletion of particles from the solid boundaries if you are dealing with particle suspension. With particle suspensions, or it can be the elastic deformation of the soft particles in past and gels when they are in the vicinity of the solid boundaries. Yeah, so if we assume that we are dealing with simple unidirectional flow of these materials when we have a sleep. So you can see in these schematic. So, you can see in this schematic, so if the wall shear stress is less than the sliding yield stress, then there is no flow because the sleep velocity is zero and the wall shear stress is less than the yield stress of the material as well. So, no deformation, nothing moving. But when the wall shear stress exceeds the sliding yield stress, then Sliding yield the stress, then it's still less than the material yield stress. So everything is moving as a solid, sorry, as an unyielded plug. So everything is moving with a constant velocity, which is the slip velocity. And when you increase the wall shear stress even more than the yield stress, then we will get the deformation. So now we have sheared regions and one plug. And one plug in the core, and the material is still sliding over the solid boundary. So, we want to see the effect of sleep in prosmedia flows. So, here we are looking at these periodic boxes, okay, and we have arranged obstacles. So, this is the model for Smedia. So, here we are using. So, here we are using different scaling, which is Binkam number, it shows the yield stress over the viscose stress. So, in these simulations, basically, the flow rate is fixed. And so, based on Binkam number, we will get the pressure gradient. Okay, so the yield limit now goes to the Bincam equal to B incam infinity. Okay, so this is the yield limit, and the left side is the Newtonian limit where Bincamp number goes to zero. Where Binkham number goes to zero. So we can look at pressure gradient as a function of Binkham number, and so for null sleep, the continuous lines. So you see that in all cases for all values of alpha and beta. So alpha is the ratio of sliding yieldless risk to the material yield stress, and beta here as a pre-factor for the sleep law. So you see that all scale. So you see that all scales with BINCAM number, okay? So at the yield limit, all scales with the BINCAM number, but there is an offset here for sliding flows, which means that the flow can be yielded more easily when we have sleep, which is sort of intuitive. So if you look at these two flows, okay, so the left, left are no sleep flows, and the rights are. No slip flows and the rights are sliding flows. So you can see that the larger part of the solid boundaries are in contact with the flow because the flow can slide over these solid boundaries compared to the non-slip condition. Yeah, so we can look at randomized cases as well. So at this very high bin cam number, which is 10 to 4, say that we are. 10 to 4, say that we are pretty close to the yellow limit. So we have more or less just one main channel here for different volume fractions. These are the no-slip conditions. But when you go to sliding flow, again at the same income number, see that we are far from yielding. It means that we can easily yield the flow. Yield the flow when we have sliding conditions. And you see that it's more pronounced when the solid volume fraction is high. And the reason is that, well, we have more solid boundaries, basically. So the flow can slide over more solid boundaries. So you see that these two are pretty much different. But when you go to low volume fraction, low solid volume fraction, you can see. Solid volume fraction, you can see that these are not that different. And also in the contours of logo of gamma dot, again, we see the same story. These two are pretty much different, but for small volume fraction, it's not that different. So we can look at pressure gradient as a function of Pingham number again for different volume fractions, solid volume fractions. Fractions, solid volume fractions. So we are showing with the red line that the predictions for model prosmedia and the blue lines is showing for the randomized case. So you see that these are almost the same for randomized and modeled prismed, both for non-sleep condition. But for this continuous line, I don't have any randomized case because for Randomized case because for this high solid volume fraction, it's really hard to get any randomized any randomized configuration. So we can compare with the sliding flows and here are the symbols for the sliding flow. So stars are associated with the continuous line and the circles with the dashed lines, asterisks with lines asterisk with the dotted uh dotted dash lines and and positive sign with the dotted line so if you if you uh if you look at the stars for example you see that they are pretty much um below the the the continuous line uh and so it means that when we have sliding flow uh we end up with smaller um smaller pressure gradient and it's uh and it's amazing And it's amazing that these stars are pretty close to the 0.5 solid volume fraction with no sleep condition. So it means that when we have sleep, indeed we are dealing with an effective volume fraction, which is less than the real volume fraction. So we can define the effect of sleep with effective volume fraction. And if you look at the low, low. The low solid volume fraction point one, you see that these positive signs are really close to the no sleep condition. And this is what I said in the contours as well. So when we have a smaller volume fraction, solid volume fraction, then the effect of slip is negligible. Yeah, so we want to see the effect of elasticity of the flow. Of elasticity of the fluid as well, as there are some nice experimental studies that validate that reported the elasticity, like recoil in the rheometers, and also negative wake at the rare of the settling particle. So, we are using Pierce-Armito's model, the Alastoviscoplastic model, which is an extension of Pinkham model with this extra term. So, it's basically Kelvin. So it's basically Kelvin white solid before yielding. And after that, it's like Bingham Floyd with an extra elastic history, which is coming from this red term, which is the upper convector derivative. So it's somewhere here in Pierre's map. Sorry, Pierre, for using it without copyright. So we can look at the effect of elasticity. Okay, so here are the on the top are viscoplastic flow, the Bingham model. The bottom, these are elasto-viscoplastic flows. So you see that, so from left to right, I'm increasing the Bingham number or let's say yield distress. So you can see that the effect of, you can see the effect of elast CCT for Last CCT for when Bingham number is small, they are pretty much the same. But when you go to larger Bingham numbers, there are quite a difference between, I mean, viscoplastic one and lasso-viscoplastic one. We have asymmetry here because of elasticity, as you see. And the story is more or less the same for staggered cases when we have different arrangements. Of different arrangements of the obstacles. So, again, we can look at the pressure gradient as a function of Ping M number. So the blue lines are the elasto-viscoplastic one, and the red lines are viscoplastic one. So you see that at low BI income numbers, the elasticity will increase. The elasticity will increase the pressure gradient, but some point draw the same around Binkham 10. But if I keep increasing the Bingham number, then we will see some oscillations in the flow field and of course the pressure gradient as well, some oscillations in the pressure gradient. So we can integrate it over time and find the pressure gradient. So we kept the Weisenberg number fixed here at a very small number. Here at a very small number, because usually for a lasso-viscoplastic flow, the elasticity is not that high. So you see that they are different from the viscoplastic one when we have large Pinkam numbers, and it's going to a smaller pressure gradient. So it means that elasticity will facilitate the yielding at the critical pressure gradient. So we have smaller pressure. So, we have smaller pressure gradient. Yeah, so I don't know if I have still a couple of minutes. Yeah, so yeah, so as I told you, we have some oscillations in the flow field where the Bingham number is high. So, basically, I was thinking about a method that can handle these kinds of flows when these terms became dominant. Dominant. Okay, so when this term is dominant, then we are approaching the, let's say, the viscoplastic flow. So these term will basically we are approaching the discontinuity limit. And so if you are using augmented Lagrangian, which is pretty well documented for viscoplastic fluids, so we can deal with these problems if they are numerical. If they are numerical, like numerical instabilities. So, my idea was to split the elastic strain rate and the viscoplastic one, and then handle the viscoplastic one with the augmenta Lagrangian that most of you are familiar with, and then basically calculate the elastic strain rate. elastic strain rate and then correct at each step, okay, the whole strain rate and the relaxed visco plastic one. So if you are interested in the details, you can check this paper down here. So it can be, I mean, combined with mesh adaptivity as well to get more accurate and high resolution results. So I use Results. So I use this to look at wavy channel flows for Elastovisco Plastic one. So here you see I kept the Weisenberg number the same, increased the Binkham number, and you see more asymmetry in the flow. So we integrate the velocity over these two lines, which are basically symmetric around the geometrically symmetric. Symmetric. And so we can quantify the asymmetry in the flow for different Weisenberg, different Bingham numbers. And so here is the contour. So the contour is showing the asymmetry in the flow for different Weisenberg and Bingham numbers. So you see that it's so when Weisenberg times Bingham is constant, we almost have the same quantity for. The same quantity for asymmetry. So it means that if we keep Weisenberg number the same and increase Bingham number, so we are moving like this in this contour. So when we have larger Bingham numbers, we are dealing with more asymmetry. So it means that basically if Weisenberg number is the same and we are increasing the income number, we are increasing the elastic effects. And that's why in here we sell this behavior. So it means that we have more elastic effects here when the BINCAM number is high. So it's pretty different from the viscoplastic flow. Yeah, so I think I should wrap up. Yeah, so we validated the network models. The network models for yield the source flow is in ProseMedia and also find that the critical yield number with a large number of simulations with network models. So we got the statistically converged results. So this is the critical yield number, which is quadratic with the void volume over the solid volume fraction. Volume fraction. We analyze the effect of sleep and also the elasticity of the fluid on the flow. So both are facilitating the yielding. And so the critical pressure gradient is smaller than we have sliding flows or elastoiscoplastic flows. And also we showed that the That basically the plastic and elastic effects, how it works when we have large income numbers, so we have larger elastic effects as well. Yeah, so yeah, so I will stop here. Thank you so much for your attention and happy to take any question. Thank you, Ahmed. So we have a few questions. Few questions and Mike, do you want to unmute? Sure. Yeah, I was just curious. You mentioned the onset of time dependence. While the Weiselberg number was still quite small, so probably not an elastic instability. Is there inertia in your simulations? Do you have some sort of stick slip? What do you think is going on there? Yeah, as I said, Mike, so I mean, yeah, so basically. Yeah, so basically, yeah, the Weisenberg number is pretty small. And so when we increase the Bingham number, indeed, we are increasing the elastic effects as well. So you can't compare like Visco Elastic flow with Weisenberg 10 to minus 2, with like Elasto, Visco Plastic one with the same Weisenberg number, but a large Winkam number. And that is exactly the same as what I think we saw in the. I think we saw in the second presentation, I think the flow over obstacle and so negative wake on behind. They compared with the old ROI model. So in the old ROID model, there was no such a negative wake. But when they turned on the plasticity, they saw these kind of elastic effects and negative wake on behind the obstacle. So it's the same here. The inertial. Here, the inertia is pretty small in our simulation, so I'm pretty sure that it's not inertial. If you look at the viscoplastic flow, you see it's pretty symmetric because the Weiss number, sorry, the Reynolds number is like 0.1, I think. Yeah, so that's why you see the asymmetry here. It's pretty elastic. And as I said, because the BINCAM number is high, we are sort of increasing the We are sort of increasing the elastic effects. It's great. Thank you very much. There's a few questions and comments in the chat as well, if you want to pick up from there or later on. So I think we'll finish here. And I apologize for the timekeeping, but it was a great talk, great set of talks. And I think it's time to thank all the presenters from around the world. From around the world, so and for a very nice first session. I think, organizers, I think now we have some photo or break time.
