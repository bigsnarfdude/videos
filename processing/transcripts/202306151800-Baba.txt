Can you see me? Oh, what do you think? I need to sort of adjust to the. Actually, if you're planning to write on the board, I think zooming out would be good. Oh, it's just the middle portion of the board, the two middle sections. That's what we see now. Okay. Can you see well, like entire volume, or like do you think? Board, or like not the entire board, just that sort of middle half with the two quarters on the side missing. Oh, okay, but then you can you see the two sections, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that part I only use. Yeah, you know, when I just connect to the calamitator, I need to somehow, but the screen quality is good enough to read. That's all great. Yeah, let me just introduce you. This is. Let me just introduce you. This is Chinpei Baba, also a former student of Misha Kapovich. If you're all here, you all know him. Who will be speaking on there is simultaneous uniformization on complex structures. Sorry, I wrote a little bit in a different way than the title. Okay. Thank you, Jenny, for an organizers. And organizers for setting up this wonderful Visual Stay. And yeah, so I was a student of Michelle till 2009 at Davis. And I think when I just become his student, can you hear me okay? Just checking. Okay. So when I just become his student, he kind of told me that we don't He kind of told me that we don't have any regular meetings, which is probably not his goal in US, probably because he was busy with, he had a couple of other students at the same time. But it turned out that his office door is always open, almost always open. So I just need to go to his office to ask questions when I need it. So actually, I like it. I like that way better than like somehow. Like somehow. And so I was really happy that I was his student. As everybody knows, he has very wide knowledge and he has very great geometric intuitions and draw many good pictures, as he suggested today as well. And also, also, like later, I see. So like later, I see him acknowledged in many, many papers of others. He's very, very fair, personal and then talks to everybody. And yeah, I was really impressed by his attitude towards mathematics. So happy birthday, Michelle. And today, okay, I could virtually met other students of Michelle. And I really hope that Michelle will be active in coming years. Coming years. I'm pretty sure, because he's active today, even online. So, and hope that maybe his students, including myself, will be grown up more completely so that we can have another mission day at some point in the future. More face-to-face one. Okay. Anyhow, I will give a talk on. Um so give a give a vote talk so uh because I think Misha prefers uh vote and I think I also prefer it so and I start with my classical selen of Bear's Bear's Simonization Theorem, which is a fundamental theorem for hyperbolic free manifold and somehow try to connect with PP1 structures, complex productive structures. There's complex product structures on Riemann circuit, which is which Misha also has some influential work on it. So let us record the audience is somewhat broad, I suppose. Let us recall BL71. So it is closed, oriented. Perfect of genus and we should and so the uniformization theorem of Bears tells that for this CM space which we recall in a second is isomorphic bipolomorphic to product of five meter spaces on this surface. To be precise, one factor with opposite orientation. So, this is by homophobic. So, scan space is a space of co-distant representations representation. representation up to conjugation um so it's a typical discrete facial representations such as the limit set is uh a jordan curve okay so it's another representation in this setting um and this is in this is an important space for study of hyperbolic micros um and this is in the And this sits in the face for all representations of this type without any restrictions of discreetness or faithfulness. So it is called character variety. And the dimension is a complex dimension because. Uh, complex dimension of those uh spaces, by the way, this what is transparent is the open subset of um the character of the idea. This dimension is uh uh three, excuse me, fixed minus fixed. And then thank you that's face it as most of the people. Space, it as most of the people here know the mass office structures on S up to isotopy to be precise, and I'm sorry, it's also Riemann tackle structures, but yes, with opposite orientation and then. And then because the cost, given that quadratic representation, we have a limit set, Jordan Kaf, on the Liemann sphere. By co-shanting out the hyperbolic space by the image, we have a hyperbolic structure on the side. On the surface cross interval, or interval with ideal boundary, and the ideal boundary has complex structures, leaving surface structures on the surface F with opposite orientation. And this pair is the corresponding pair on the right-hand side. So, when you have a colleague, uh, Inside the college space. So it's the intersection of two variables like this, two slices coming from this product structure. So one slice is here. So I said no corresponds to okay, everyone's a structure. So one. Surface structures. So one slice is X drop tightly placed star. And then the other slice. Can you tell the colors? Oranges? I think you cannot. Do I have to? Okay, let me speak. Okay. Okay, maybe I didn't have too many colors, but hopefully people can tell the colors. This is pi-data space plus y. I need to click the bracket. So we are selling gives like a product construction on that. Structure on the quadxian space, and those slice is a code bear slice. And you can actually analytically extend those slightly in the conductor validity. So, this extension is called both slices expands. Excuse me, let QGX denote the phase of holomorphic quadratic differentials. On the Liemann surface X, so this is the vector space, and then its dimension is 3G minus 3. And this vector space of differential on the surface maps to the character of L ID by the holonomy map. No, complex connection structures, T-Mark structures of sort. And then this mapping proves this mapping is injective, and then Misha proves that this map is super far mapping. And briefly explain what this mapping is. So Nothing is. So when you have a Liemann surface and then holomorphic quadratic differential in the Liemann surface, X, and this corresponds to the complex projective structure, and then if you look And then, if you look at the holonomy of the CT1 structure, we have a differentation of surface groups in PTSL2C of conjugation. And this only map gives this mapping. So, by this mapping, this vector space is mapped onto a nice slice in the character variety, which has so this is a half-dimensional slice of the character variety. And today, I want to Misha once told me the question that. Tommy, the question that how the intersection of what how the intersection of those slices look like no no for example in this picture so we have already slices we have slices inside this quad discussion phase and you can extend those slices analytically and we have two slices in the case Have two slides in the kinetic and which has half dimensions of the ambient space. And I guess understand, of course. So Shell, I want to talk today. Okay, I still have Canadians. Good. Is that given Periods are faced with any orientation you like. So, this is we took the discharge union. So, this is the space of Freeman surfaces on. On surfaces on the topological surface S with arbitrary orientation those extensions Is no empty discrete subset discrete set. Any questions about the statement? Before discussing things related to this, like maybe I want to also mention another element with Nisha with Madam. Madam regarding the characterization of holonomy representation of CP1 structures, complex relative structures. So I don't write precisely, but what they can tell us is that for almost all Representation of suffix group into SL2C representation. Um of complexity structures on the software side. So by writing SL2C, I'm saying that the representation we talked, representation into PSL2C, but Into PSL2C, but it needs to be the phonology of CPR structure, it needs to have a lifting property to SL2C. And then once it has a lifting property, like almost all representations, even non-discrete ones, honor me representation of some CP1 structures. And they actually get more precise algebraic conditions, but I just want to briefly make I just want to briefly mention this talent because I'm really influenced by this talent regarding my work and also it's one of his well cited papers. Thank you. Can you see me? Okay, I'll feel your card. So I need someone. Let me just. this let me just i don't want to i cannot get into what is i can i ask a question sure sure sure sure in in your theorem this intersection of these two two slices like yeah do they do they also have intersection outside the quasi function to say how outside of uh uh I don't know. Are we do I kind of I mean yeah it's not I don't know if whether intersection happening but on the other hand if you take any like a law outside the qualification space you you can always find many CP1 structures with this monomial presentation so that many many slice is So that many slice is intersecting at this point. Okay, and when I say like no empty here, I don't know. At least in my case, I only saw that no emptiness is only one, what, two points. So if it's like this case, if of all of its orientations, I can show that at least two intersection points. And like, so there's more things to. So there's more things to be. It's kind of hard to detect where exactly they are. Do you know? So what about finiteness of number of points? Is there any quarter to this? Can it be finite? Can it be? I haven't checked carefully, but I thought it's infinite. Like the natural guess. That would be the natural guess. That's always interesting. Yeah, but I haven't checked carefully, but like Brian Collier asked me that question, in particular, the case at X and X were and I thought it's yeah. I thought it's infinite, but I haven't checked carefully yet. Yeah. Okay. What I really don't know is like the transversality of those devices. It's discrete, but it's not for transversality reasons. It's not for transversality reasons, somehow. So, discrete. Yeah, so the proof. Okay. So, the proof. Okay. So, Nisha. So, here, like, the intersection, so let me just finish my talk by saying some idea of this proof. So, here, like, both nice is a complex analytic sub-variety. So, to show the discreteness, like, we should. Each show that every connected component component is bounded And then to show the compactment for the kind of need to substruct, look at the outside larger compact subset in the character variety and then. And then for every representation in this intersection minus logic compact, I associate some functional from surface group. Excuse me, because this is a special bit simple code card. Simple closed curve on the surface. Okay, maybe two different closed curves on S to integers. Okay, so you know by gamma law. So and so that this is continuous. So it must be because it's integer variant and this is a discrete set. I'm regarding this special simple closed curve, but a discrete set. So this must be a constant function on every connected component. And therefore, for raw, in this, because it's intersectional variety, XM two slices, we have associated CP1 structure on X and Y, but this only raw. And then if you look at the Bartschaft reaction coming from the holomorphic quadratic differential, Just approximation that if you look at the difference of those particle creation is a good approximation of this. Approximation of this discrete function on the set of boots. And this function, this difference must diverges to infinity at flow, diverges to infinity of the character variety in the intersection. Whereas this function by continuity. This function by continuity and the discretion of this function is contained on every connected component. That implies that every connected component is bound in subset of the character. So sorry, I went over the time, which probably doesn't like. So I stop here. And well, okay, let me just say one word. Although I went over the time, that from this discreetness, like one can reduce. Like one can reduce alternative proof of bare simultaneous conversation seller. Okay. Okay. Happy business, Mitcher. Okay, thank you, Shimfei. Any questions? If I remember correctly, for some time you tried to prove that these such intersections can be high-dimensional. That's what I remember. We discussed several times. My damn mission. Yeah, right. But I think it was the yeah, that I think it didn't work. We didn't have a complete event. And, like, just have like a misunderstanding before I never collect. Yeah, that's that's like, yeah, only after I graduated. Yeah, that's really impressive. But yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, this paper is just accepted by general. Okay. Very nice. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. And then I think I will try to share my screen. Let's see whether. To share my screen, let's see whether or not this works.
