And he will be speaking about multiplexing and its upper bound in biological sensory receptors. Thank you so much. And really appreciate the organizer for the opportunity to come here. And it is really beautiful here. And I did a crazy hike yesterday. And I feel all the purpose of, well, half of the purpose of the workshop is accomplished. I shouldn't reveal my true thoughts. No. But today, actually, I'm really happy to share kind of a Happy to share kind of one topic that is within a big dream that my group's long-term research goal is. And before I start, I want to just show those people who did the hard work. And those are people from my research group. And also, I recently have active collaborations with Professor Hong Tian, a cloud mathematician from Seattle, and also Professor Abby Knight, a polymer scientist in chemistry. Scientist in chemistry at UNC, and we appreciate the money from the NESF and also the startup found. And since this is a workshop, and I know there are so much opportunities for us to later talk about many crazy things, there might be something if you're interested in here. I would love to explain that later offline. Something is actually quite interestingly fitting into the big dream of the research group. In particular, how can we ask catalysts or enzymes to harvest enzymes? Catalysts or enzymes to harvest energy from a time-changing environment, we have designed, basically, derived the optimal design rule for its energy landscape to efficiently harvest energy. And another is how can a single molecule even perform temporal pattern recognition jobs? There are things fit into this big dream. The big dream is what are the thermodynamic principles, or maybe non-equilibrium thermodynamic principles, as design rules to guide us. As design rules to guide us to design life-like nanorobots. When we say life-like nanorobots, it is not just a smart material per se, by today's definition. It is something that shows lifelike response to complicated environment. For example, the first task would be not just respond to the average condition of the environment, but respond, recognize the temporal patterns of the external environmental change. For example, the light change, the force change, The light change, the force change, the temperature change, the pH change, not just the average, but the temporal pattern. Then carry out desired functions like separation, sorting, enriching molecules, drug delivery, motion generation. And another thing is, when you design a nanorobot, you probably don't want to hook it with a battery. As it's floating in a brownie in motion, a battery needs to be connected with the robot. So if the nanorobot is operating in a realistic environment, not a Realistic environment, not an ideal thermal bath, if the environment itself is changing in time, that means it is out of equilibrium. In that case, can we actually harness the non-equilibrium energy that is otherwise dissipated by the environment to power the function of the nanorobot? And of course, there are challenges. That's why I say this is a dream. First, it's complex, like living systems, not artificial materials. Usually, things are extremely complicated. Extremely complicated with pretty complex chemical reaction networks and interactions, and also they're far from equilibrium. And more sadly, not just far from equilibrium. Even today, people have pretty good understanding of non-equilibrium steady states. If you require a little nanorobot to respond to changing environment, that means you're also saying goodbye to non-equilibrium steady state. Because the environment is changing all the time, and the system is trying to catch up. The system is trying to catch up. So it's also far from steady state. And of course, when you design nano-robots, you also suffer from thermal nodes. So those are pretty disappointing, but we are making small baby step progress. One, as I mentioned, we can actually design enzymes that can harness energy from a temperature oscillating environment. And the second one, that's this one. And also, we can show that even a single molecule with specially designed energy landscape. Specially designed energy landscape has the potential to recognize temporal patterns, works like a James Bond, only responding to a secret code. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the current robots, they respond to climate-time requirements, right? Self-driving cars and they're not nano, so is there a lot of people who are not. Right, so is there anything specific about nano robots that make it more challenging? That make it more challenging? Yes, yes. Because nowadays, when you consider a robot, usually you have a computer chip insect. But what we're talking about, nanorobots, is really like living cells. Basically, a bunch of chemicals mysteriously mixed together, enclosed by maybe some lipid membrane. So you want a chemical system. Right, right, yes, yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah. And please interrupt me at any time. I wish this talk is more interactive. I feel that's really the beauty of workshops rather than. That's really the beauty of workshops rather than conferences. So, yeah, and another thing is what we are going to talk about today. That is how can a single sensor actually accomplish more than what we usually consider. For example, can a single sensor sense all the parameters of the universe? That's a little bit overselled. But let's get to the sensor. So this is what the title promised. What the title promised. But first, let's look at all the success in biological sensors. People have found those great scientists that they have worked for decades and they have identified so many different types of biological sensors. Each can be as simple as a protein that is sitting on a membrane or being somewhere, and a little molecule can sense the mechanical force. Or there are some sensors that are able to sense the temperature of the Able to sense the temperature of the environment. And of course, this very classical ligand receptor that is able to sense concentration. So one thing in common for all of them that we should really be amazed about is that those are single molecules. And the molecule itself is suffering from pretty complicated and fluctuating environments. But it is still able to extract the information. Extract the information that they want. For example, force, temperature, or concentration. So you can consider that, well, maybe the sensors can perform statistical averaging so that it can remove the unwanted noise and only extract the useful information. Is things so simple? Well, yes, for now, let's look at the classical example of a ligand receptor. Let's consider the ligand receptor. Well, disclaimer. Well, disclaimer: I'm more of a physicist, so I think about things oversimplified. To me, the little receptor has two states: state one being bound with the ligand, and state zero unbound with the ligand. And in reality, this receptor sitting on the membrane of the cell is basically switching between zero and ones in a pretty stochastic way. And the task, of course, is to infer what is the concentration of the ligand. Concentration of the ligand. So, a naive thought, but actually it's a very legit thought, is to say that, well, how can I extract the concentration information from the noisy dynamics? Well, perform a time average. If we average over a long period of time and ask what is the fraction of time that the molecule is in state one, then that fraction is proportional to the concentration, which is fine so far. Which is fine so far. But I want to give you a little bit of challenge here. There are too many environmental factors that could impact the transition, the dynamic transition between 0 and 1 for the sensor. Not just concentration. Concentration can definitely impact that. Temperature can impact the dynamics as well. If the media has a flow speed, or if the media is flowing with some speed V, Flowing with some speed V, that could impact your dynamics of binding and binding as well. Or maybe if the ligand has a diffusion constant that is impacted by maybe the salt solution or whatever changing in the environment, all of those factors would come in to impact your ability to sense the concentration. And put it mathematically, you can say that, well, yes, I can calculate the average binding fraction, S bar, but S bar is actually a pretty But S-bar is actually a pretty complicated function of temperature, concentration, flow speed, diffusion constant, maybe gravitational constant, or Hubbard's constant, or speed of light. Just kidding. But how can we solve this? A naive thought, well sorry, not a naive thought, a very reasonable thought is to say that since we only care about concentration, or at least we assume that the ligand receptor only care about concentration, can we remove Concentration. Can we remove the dependence of temperature, velocity, and diffusion constant? That is a very reasonable thought. In fact, people have found in different kind of biological processes this, well, I call this variable compensation mechanism, but one example is the temperature compensation mechanism for circuitian clocks. We want a circuitum clock to have the same period regardless of the temperature of the environment. Of the environment. As we all know, temperature would impact the reaction rate, and the circulating clock is realized by a pretty complicated reaction network. Then biological systems actually has to evolve into a pretty nice mechanism to compensate for the temperature change. So that regardless of what temperature the living system is at, its circuiting clock period is still always the same. So we can argue that, well, So we can argue that, well, that sounds like a remedy. Just make sure that you design a pretty complicated sensory network so that this S-bar is only a function of concentration, but not a function of temperature, velocity, diffusion constant. But if that's the end of the story, it's pretty boring. So I want to actually ask you what kind of solution, what kind of alternative solution would you like to give? Yeah. Yeah. I had a question earlier. I don't see why you would expect the concentration to be proportional to the fraction of time handling. Ah. Except at very low concentrations. Right, right. Yeah, that's only true for low concentration, and that is when you consider ideal gas situation. So in reality, it's actually more complicated. Yes? Well, it's not complicated, it's just that at high concentration. It's not saturated. Right, right. It's just a monotonically increasing function. So Monotonically increasing function. Sure, sure, yeah. Actually, the reality is non-linearly dependent. Yes, you're right. Sure, but it's a known nonlinear, so you can back it out. And as far as the temperature dependence of the two-state binding process, if it affects the forward average rates equally, then it would automatically cancel out. You don't need any fancy. But don't you get it for free? I mean, if you're just looking at your two-state finding an example. Ah, well, in fact, when you change the temperature, you can also consider. When you change the temperature, you can also consider it could change the free energy. Because free energy has its temperature dependence. The free energy for the bound state and unbound state could also change. And that change is non-trivial. In that case, you have to really design the free energy dependence on temperature so that you can still remove this. Do you want to accomplish all that with one molecule? Is what you said? Sort of, if you have a very smart downstream reaction network that is still being constructed. The last part was actually my question all the time. Do you assume you have only just one single receptor in the cell? I mean, in normal cells, you would have hundreds of reasons or so, and then you have averaging for free semr. That's an extremely great question. In fact, in this work, we're building on the theory based on our ability to observe a single molecule, but the moment But the moment when you have many independent sensors, then unfortunately you're just doing the averaging. In that case, you might want to introduce some correlation between them so that you can actually recover more information than just the IIED averages. So that hopefully will show up later. So any alternative solution to this? I think time-wise, we're good. We're very good because I only have 19 page. We can be more ambitious. Rather than removing T V D, whatever, can we even dream a mechanism or dream the possibility that somehow we can have the single sensor to simultaneously sense temperature concentration, flow speed, all of those things. But of course, then you cannot rely on the single dimension measurable quantity. Measurable quantity. So, to show that I'm not totally crazy, there are examples already by people studying this kind of receptors, and they have shown that by a single type of receptor, people can measure different concentrations of different types of ligands. So their work already showing that from a single sensor, you can measure more than one degree of freedom. More than one degree of freedom of environmental information. Like if you have ligand type A, ligand type B, they can all bind with your sensor. And by looking at the sensor for long enough or with a smart downstream reaction, you can actually simultaneously infer what is the concentration of A and what is the concentration of B. So this has already been shown. But we want to focus on something a little bit more crazier, not just sensing concentration. Can a single sensor actually sense Can a single sensor actually sense all the environmental information? Temperature, flow speed, all the things like that. And here I'm showing you a little Langevin dynamic simulation of a receptor sitting in the center of a tube. And the tube has a media that is basically a fluid with a large middle fluid with many ligands. And this tube has a periodic boundary condition, and we can control the flow speed. The flow speed of the medium and also the concentration of the ligand, of course, and we fix the receptor. And by performing a simulation, we're able to measure the receptor's state trajectory, meaning at different time, what is the receptor state? Is that the bound state or unbound state? Represented in these ones and zeros. And what I'm showing you here is that actually at the same concentration of the ligand, but at different flow speed. But at different flow speed. From our naked eye, you can already see that. Well, I can tell that those two trajectories are generated from probably a different environment. The question is, now by looking at those, oops. Static charge, sorry. The question is, by looking at the trajectory of the single sensor, can we all simultaneously measure just velocity? Measure just velocity, concentration, and temperature, and all of those. One of the questions like this. Rather than looking at just the average S, we look at the trajectory S and ask, by looking at the trajectory, can we simultaneously look for it all? So why does the time spent bound to the receptor change? Ah, yeah, there are two kind of impacts. There are two kinds of impacts. One is that when there is a flow, for the time of the bound state, it will change because the flow will give a drag to the little ligand that is bound. So it's kind of helping the little ligand to leave. And there is also an impact on the unbound time. For example, well, this is actually a very good question. I would love to give people more physical intuition here. Physical intuition here. Imagine that your system is basically stationary with no flow. Then, if a molecule has been bound here and left, immediately after that you know there is a ligand nearby. Imagine if the concentration is really low, then your chance of being rebound is pretty high when you're immediately after an unbinding event happened. This is true for the For the stationary case, but as you start to supply a flow, then this correlation will die out very, very quickly. So, somehow, you already get to the intuition that this velocity will somehow give you the correlation, autocorrelation of the trajectory. And the average binding, of course, is related to the concentration. That later, you'll see it becomes pretty obvious. So, this is really the question. This is really the question and of course the answer is yes, otherwise I wouldn't be talking about this here. And here we have shown through numerical simulation of all kind of different environmental conditions. Here the mu represents the log of the concentration of the ligand. Beta is the inverse temperature of the simulation. And from any point in this space, we are performing a numerical simulation long enough to generate a very Long enough to generate a very long trajectory. And then from the very long trajectory, we calculated two things. That's the two-color plot. Sorry for this small file. This is the S-bar. This is from a long trajectory, we calculate what is the average fraction of binding. And this one is the autocorrelation of the trajectory with the time lag of 1. Here, 1 is really just the arbitrary unit, so please bear with me. Now, Now, let me give you the reason why we say the answer is yes. Now, imagine if I look at a sensor state for long enough, of course I can calculate those two quantities, the S bar and C1. And the moment when I calculate this value, maybe I'm getting S bar equals to, let's say, 0.4, then maybe it's on this line. From this value, of course, I cannot infer simultaneously the concentration and the temperature. And the temperature. But at the same time, I'm able to measure C1. Let's say C1 value is 0.8, assuming that it's here. Sorry, maybe here. Then, from C1, I know that the combination of the concentration or lock concentration and the immersive temperature must be lying on this line. And those two information simultaneously will help me pin down one point in this space. Performing this contour line crossing, we'll pin down one point. That will basically tell us: yes, the log concentration is 4 point something, and the inverse temperature is 0.8 or something. 0.9 maybe. What velocity do you exist? This one is for zero velocity. But we tried, there is a reason why we only do two here. But basically, the typical message is from measuring. From measuring two kinds of different statistical properties of the trajectory, you can already infer two environmental information. And the key for the success is because the contour lines are not parallel to each other. If they're parallel to each other, then we're doomed. But if they're not parallel, it is good. So we actually show that what if we fix the concentration and change different temperature or inverse temperature and the flow speed, and you see the control line are most. And you see the contour line are mostly non-parallel except for this part. Meaning, this is a bad parameter range that you cannot simultaneously measure to, but for most part of it, you can. Yeah. Just a quick question. Are we assuming that different trajectories are simulations with different values of concentration and temperature, and then you are kind of grabbing from that the autocorrelation and the other by measuring long temperature? Measuring longer. My question is: if, for example, during an experiment and using a trajectory, if these two are kind of changing simultaneously in some non-linear way, would you still be able to do that? Or like in this experimental setup, have you been using some resumption of slowly changing variables? That's right. Oh, I see. Sorry, let me clarify this a little bit. When we perform a simulation, we are at a fixed environmental condition. Yes. Yes. So in one simulation, we never change the temperature or concentration. Yeah, so that's what I understood. And my question is that: so, when we go to a more real scenario where concentration and temperature can simultaneously maybe vary or they may not vary slowly. So in that case... If they're varying in time, right? Right. Yeah, right now we are not able to actually resolve that. But I think given the... Well, it's all about. It's all about dimension analys study. So, in the end, you can actually construct a theory for that using similar things. But right now, we're dealing with stationary environments. And also, we show that you can also simultaneously sense concentration at low speed as the control lines are now parallel to each other here. So, we want to derive. So, we want to derive some general theory about the upper bound for multiplexing. When we say multiplexing, it is really a single molecule able to sense different dimension of environmental information. So let's say that your environment is described by multiple variables, theta 1, theta 2, and theta 3, or maybe even more thetas, then your environment is described by a point in this environmental parameter. In this environmental parameter space. Now, from this stationary environment, if you observe the molecule's trajectory, you will see that you can have an ensemble of trajectories. Because every time you restart the experiment, you're going to see a stochastically different trajectory. Now, if you map the trajectory into the helper space as a single point, then from this fixed environment, you generate a bunch of You generate a bunch of trajectories, and each trajectory is a point in the helper space. In the end, you get to a cloud of points. Now, the question is, if you have a different environmental condition, now you can generate different looking trajectories. And in the helper space, it might look like a cloud here. And in the end, you can do that for all kinds of environmental conditions. Environmental conditions, and you have different clouds. The point is that if those clouds are not overlapping, then there's a chance that we can, by just looking at what trajectory you observe, does it fall in here? Then you know it's from this environmental condition. If it falls here, you know, it's this environmental condition. So basically, it is plausible. Sorry, every time when there is a static charge. But here's the problem. When I say we measure the trajectory of the sensor, we are saying that we are making a continuous time measure of very accurate measurement. In reality, like pointed out by Jordan Porowis and Henrik Sandberg, for a biological system or any system, if you want to measure continuously in time, Continuously in time accurately a trajectory that is associated with infinite entropy cost. So living systems shouldn't have the ability to do that. So we make the assumption that maybe the excuse me maybe let us take a step back. Rather than continuous time measurement, let's consider that maybe the downstream reaction network is only able to get discretized. To get a discretized time trajectory, and also let's say the sensor state is also discretized. So, the number of states of the sensor is Ns, and the number of time points is NT. And now the question is, can we have a general theory predicting then, given ability for the downstream reaction to only keep track of NS and NT type of trajectories, what is the maximum number of variables that you can infer? That you can infer. And here is the little theory. Let me just quickly rush through this. Here, again, this is the parameter space for the environment. It could be n-dimensional. And the moment when you generate trajectories, let's say for a binary state sensor, and if you do nt time trajectories, then the number of possible trajectories you will generate is basically. Ns or 2 raised to the power of NT. So basically, when you look at the statistics of the trajectories, you can construct the probability density of the trajectory. Then they are lying in this simplex of dimensionality ns raised to the power nt minus 1. I notice the minus 1 in here is really due to the normalization condition because all the probability has to add up to 1. Probably has to add up to one. So now, when you have the ability to look at the statistics of the trajectories of this time length NT and state NS, you can basically map any point from your high-dimensional environmental condition space to a probability in this probability simplex. And if the dimension of the simplex is already known, then this is really the upper bound of how many environments. Map of how many environmental information you can measure. Because if you want to construct a bijective continuous map, there is no way for you to map maybe 10 dimension into two dimension here. If this is two dimension, then you can only simultaneously invert two environmental information at the same time. So that is the theory. We also derived a more general bound. Derived a more general bound, so we call this the loose bound. It is really just due to a very naive dimensional analysis. But notice that the trajectories will also have some hidden symmetries. For example, if you have this binary space sensor, the probability for you to observe a trajectory of 0, 1 will be equal to the probability to observe the trajectory of 1, 0. So that further reduces the dimensionality of the millable probability space. So if you take So, if you take that into consideration, you can obtain a sharper bound. But unfortunately, it is very hard to get an analytical solution here. And here, maybe using the last minute, I'll just quickly show you that we also built a very simple model of a Markov model of a two-state sensor coupled to a three-state environment. We consider that the environment can have states E1, E2, and E3. States E1, E2, and E3. And coupled to the environment is the sensor that sometimes is at s equal to 0 or S equal to 1. So when you consider the two together, the composite system will have six states illustrated by this. We basically make a Markov state model of this to capture the simplest physics of this sensor. And in the end, we are able to show that for NTU. To show that for nt equal to 2 and s equal to 2 with one symmetry, you get this bound, and this one you get another bound. And it turns out all the bounds, sorry, I'll skip this. It turns out all of the bounds that we obtained for arbitrarily designed Markov model parameters will basically be saturated. And I can talk a little bit more offline later. But in the end, here's the take-home message. Uh but in the end, here's the take-home message and uh hopefully this is enjoyable. It's really simple and naive, but hopefully fun.
