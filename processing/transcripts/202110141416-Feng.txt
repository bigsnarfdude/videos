The second thing to understand is that this space is meant to be a kÏ€1, where pi is therefore the et al fundamental group, and that the et al. fundamental group is in some natural way a quotient of the Galois group, absolute Galois group of Q, which could be thought of as the fundamental et al. fundamental group of Q. So these facts will let us kind of interpret this H2 right here. of interpret this H2 right here. First of all, because it's a open three manifold, H2 is dual to some kind of H1. Maybe I should put C for compactly supported. So there's some condition at the boundary, but the size of H2 will be the same as the size of certain H1. And then secondly, because of this second bullet point, this H1 is some kind of H1 for a group. So it could be interpreted as an extension group. So it's the space. Group. So it's the space of extensions of this fundamental group pi1c1 over p with some condition at p that's corresponding to this compact support between, well, as it shakes out, like these two Galois modules. Another cyclotomic twist like we saw up here, and some sort of just torsion p-torsion group with. P-torsion group with trivial action. So, the upshot of all this was to say that kind of the way we think about this group, at least from the perspective of this right-hand relationship, is that it's some kind of space of Galois representations of a specific form, and they are reducible. So they're not, they're kind of different from maybe the focus of what Smet was discussing in Taylor Wilde's story and so on. We're looking for reducible Gau representations, but we're looking. For reducible Gau representations, but we're looking for ones that are not split, so interesting extensions. So that's kind of what this arrow is about. It's about like every time p divides a zeta value, you have to go out and find yourself some kind of non-trivial Galois extension. And one can ask, like, where are we going to get these interesting Galois representations? And the answer, and this is where we tie into the theme of the conference, is you look at the cohomology of Look at the cohomology of arithmetic subgroups. In this case, arithmetic subgroups of SL2Z. So if you look at the H1 there, it's going to have actually a natural Galois action. And at the same time as we discussed, it has HEC operators. So there will be commuting HEC operators, commuting with each other and with the Galois action. And if this is not something familiar, I'm going to review the mechanism for this thing shortly. But the point is now, this is, of course. Is now this is of course this H1 is some big space if gamma is pretty small, but using heck operators you can cut it down to sort of smallish pieces and then you can look at how Gawa acts on those pieces and in particular you look to see if you can find the types of reducible representations that you want to prove this theorem so this is where we segue into kind of more general context of the Langmunds philosophy and part of that I think Um, and part of that, I think, is that the cohomology of arithmetic groups should account for all Galois representations of a certain shape. So, I declined to say exactly what I mean, but if one puts appropriate adjectives, one can expect some kind of true statement. And so we can think of this as a kind of duality where on one side, you're looking at cohomological arithmetic groups with the action of Hec operators, and that's a kind of automorphic data. That's a kind of automorphic data, so we'll call this the automorphic side, and the other side is some kind of space of Galois data. And the key case, I think the core case where in all situations where we can prove interesting such relationships, interesting such reciprocity relationships, the core case is the case of the symplectic group, or at least like that exhibits the core phenomenon from which this principle is built. From which this principle is built. So to explain that, the key point is that the classifying space of this integral symplectic group actually has a lot more structure than one would initially imagine. So we can present it as the quotient of the Ziegl upper half space, Hg by this sp2g action. So this thing, this Ziegl upper half space is Upper half space is what I guess Matt was calling Gmod K in the previous talk. And in this case, what it is, is it's the space of G by G complex matrices, which are symmetric and their imaginary parts are positive definite. And so here's the picture, at least for g equals one. It's something probably pretty familiar. It's the usual. Pretty familiar, it's the usual like or half plane, and it has an action of sp2gz by linear fractional transformations. This thing itself, zooper half space, is contractible. And so if one takes this quotient in a free way, like an orbifold quotient, then it will be a model for this classifying space. And so this topological space will compute the group homology of gamma. Okay, and the thing which makes this presentation really special is that it has some kind of moduli theoretic interpretation. Namely, this quotient can be interpreted as the moduli space of abelian varieties of dimension G over the complex numbers. So if this phrase abelian varieties isn't familiar, that's okay. It won't, like the technical properties of it won't play much of a role in this talk. But I think at least one example is probably pretty familiar. Is probably pretty familiar, which is that if you give a point in this complex upper half space, then you can form an elliptic curve. You can form this complex numbers quotient by z plus z tau, this lattice spanned by one and tau. And that will look like this as a topological space. It's a torus and it has a complex structure, and it can be promoted to an elliptic curve, which is a ambulane variety of dimension one. Dimension one. But for our purposes, what's important about this is that this is a purely algebraic notion. It doesn't require anything about the complex numbers, even though over the complex numbers, maybe there's some kind of connection to topology. One can make sense of it purely within algebraic geometry and kind of in any kind of algebraic geometric family. Geometric family. And the upshot of that is that there's some thing, some stack AG, which is the moduli space of abelian Faraday as the dimension G over any base in the language of algebraic geometry. And this is some more fundamental, more primordial object, such that if I take its complex points, then I recover this discussion we had above. And in particular, I recover this nice model for the classifying space. Nice model for the classifying space of SP2GZ. And a consequence of all this is that this appearance of this space as coming from something kind of more primordial reveals extra symmetries on it. For example, it's a consequence of some general compatibility and comparison theorems that because of this, the cohomology of this classifying space with p-adic coefficients. With p-adic coefficients is canonically identified with the atalc homology of AG times over spec C with spec C. So whatever this right-hand side means, one thing is evident about it, which is that it has symmetries by automorphisms of C, just because they act on this space right here. And therefore, the left-hand side also acquires such symmetries. Although one can show that they're going to factor through the action of the Galois group. The action of the Galois group, and actually, they will factor furthermore through the Fendmandel group of C1 over P. But in this way, through this algebra geometric interpretation, we see some kind of extra symmetry on this thing. Okay, so that's one mechanism by which this Language philosophy is realized: that you can start with arithmetic groups and extract Galois representations out of it. Galois representations out of it. However, so far, so in principle, all the co-multi-arithmetic groups should be related to Galois representations, but the irreducible Galo representations, in some sense, like the ones of the most fundamental ones, are, as Matt was saying, mostly tied up with the middle of cohomology, depending on what how middle you, if it's if it's really. If it's really sp2gz, it's exactly in the middle, and sort of if it's glmz, it could be a little bit thicker, but very, very close to the middle. And so, the work of Wiles and Taylor and other people in this tradition aims to establish a theorem which has the following kind of shape. So here's a sort of prototype for what this theorem looks like. And it says if I take the middle cohomology of appropriate arithmetic group and I sort of concentrate it on. Of concentrated on some particular Hegel eigen system, then I'd like to show that it's the universal Galois representation of a certain type, like with some adjectives like irreducible, and I could put some condition on his restriction to the fundamental group of the p-adic numbers, and so on. And this is the kind of thing which one can hope to prove about things contributing to this little sliver here. But as I say, in principle, we're interested in other kinds of Interested in other kinds of other parts of chromology as well. One thing which makes them difficult to analyze is kind of, you know, forgetting the Gal action. We don't even really know what they look like as groups. But there's one part which is kind of accessible, which is the stable range. In this stable range, some kind of new structure crystallizes, which allows us to say pretty non-trivial things about it. So, by definition, by stable range, I mean like the homology of this arithmetic group has already stabilized to kind of what its value is at infinity. And a new structure appears at infinity, which is kind of underlying why it's possible to say interesting things about it, which is that you have some kind of concatenation structure, given an infinite symplectic matrix, another infinite symplectic matrix. Another infinite symplectic matrix, they're mostly identity, but you can just stick these two things next to each other and get a new infinite symplectic matrix. And that's a kind of structure which one doesn't have when considering matrices of like a fixed size. And let me just emphasize here that we're actually walking a bit of a dangerous line. Like it's close to make considering the stable range, it's close to making the Gao action not interesting. If we were to consider Interesting. If we were to consider like rational coefficients, it would not be so interesting. So it's crucial that going forward, we're really going to be thinking about integral theory, Z key coefficients. And that's what allows it to still be interesting. Okay, so this sort of term, like formalizing what this property means and why it's useful and so on is the domain of algebra K-theory. So let me just quickly review. Theory. So let me just quickly review kind of the classical perspective on this. And it's that if I take like the union, disjoint union of all these classifying spaces, then so that's the classifying space for all finite projective Z modules. Then that thing, that's a space which has a monoid structure under the direct sum. You can take a direct sum of two projective modules, or kind of concretely, it's like some sort of concatenation procedure. And then I can take this. And then I can take this monoid and feed it into machines. So I can feed into a group completion. It'll output some kind of group-like space. I could feed it into infinite loop space machines and end up with a thing called an algebraic K-theory spectrum. And then I would define the higher algebraic K-groups to be pi i of this spectrum. And somehow I haven't really explained it, but it's related to stable homology by this work of Quillen. That being said, going forward, I'm going to drop this point of view of stable homology and think of the K-theory as being the correct thing to consider. Okay, so this was a story for the general linear group, but we're interested in the symplectic group, and we can feed it into a similar process and get. Can feed it into a similar process and get these symplectic K-theory groups defined in a very similar way. And we can then define higher symplectic K-theory. And then specifically, because we're working with the integers, they'll carry some additional structure within the previous case of the K-theory. They'll carry the action, a natural action of a Gala group. By the same mechanism which explains the Galois action on the homology of a material system. And so our work is about describing what is the Galois action. So it turns out to be interesting degrees which are too modifiable specifically. And so what does that look like? Well, it turns out that as I grew up, the sympathetic key theory. As I prove this a punctured behavior, in those degrees, is an extension of the Z by the neutral operator behavior. And if one analyses a situation more closely, we'll see that in this extension structure, which is preserved by the Galois action, this thing has a trivial action, and this thing has to act communicated by this 2i minus tunnel here. But I just want to emphasize that this, even though underlying stated by roots. Even the underlying statement here, which looks like some computation, is actually the output of some deeper properties of K-theory. It's actually the output of a periodicity theorem, saying that the difference between these two spectra is something periodic. So it's already to describe this at the level of groups is using some kind of phenomenology of K-theory, which one doesn't see for cohomology. But okay, let me continue on to just describe what the answer is. Continue on to just describe what the answer is. So it turns out this is the universal representation for this kind of Galois group, which is of the form this twist by some group with has a trivial action. Same kind of extensions that were actually discussed at the beginning of the talk, and which is furthermore split after restriction to the fundamental group of the p-adic numbers. So, this kind of condition was also mentioned. Uh, condition was also mentioned before, like typically in this Taylor Wiles type stuff, uh, you also have to impose a constriction on the restriction, impose a condition on the restriction numbers. So, okay, I think I'm out of time, so uh, thanks for your attention. Let's thank our speaker. Are there questions? Yes. So uh the the data values were fractions, so is it how it like the dimensions of dimensions of the space or how much the formula to go how many about the denominator? Can we just scroll up first? Okay, are you talking about this thing here? Like it's a fraction, and it's the fraction. And that fraction is like integer mod integer, and an integer is the size of the root. I mean, thinking below that it says that, like, just the part that's got from the buttons we read and get that. So, okay, yeah, sorry. So, I'm gonna start answering what I think your question was. Start answering what I think the question was, and someone corrected, I didn't exactly hear. So, we're, yeah, we're gonna prove what I'm saying here is we're proving this statement like prime by prime. So, like for a prime which divides this, we kind of want to show that it divides this and vice versa. So, like, tensoring this DP extracts a part of this finite group, which is, you know, which is like a p part of it. And the size of that group is the same as the size of this group, the size. Is the same as the size of this group, the size of this group is the same as the P-Morm of this number. Was that the question? I think I think it works. Are there other questions? Does the same argument work for trading real fields? We haven't tried to write it down, but I think it does. Yeah. So, I mean, I guess there's a question of what the statement should be. I think we thought about it just enough to think that it's a similar statement, but where one has like the Hodge, this thing comes kind of the Hodge bundle in some sense, and in the total real case, the Hodge bundle will decompose into maybe a direct several things. And then there should be a universal. And then there should be like a universal extension of that several things, and that's what it should be. Right, because the representation you sort of see is not the right one, but it's tensor product. Right. And this is sort of only indirectly related questions, but I wanted to tie it together to the question I asked at the end. Tie it together to the question I asked at the end of that talk. So when you take the cohomology in these low degrees, you get these very simple stable cohomology truths. Can you say anything precise about how the heck operators act? Like one question, I mean, if the group you get is Z, If the group you get is Z, there's not much way the hack operator can act. Things act by their degree. But when there's distortion, there's a possibility that they might act non-semisimply. And so this non-semi-simple action is sort of exactly maybe related to this extension here. And so one question is. I mean, Excuse me, I'm still in the point for some reason we're writing down like a fake argument that on the stable part, the heck action actually does have to be trivial. But I forget if we really try to pin down whether it's true on the notes. But what is your theorem for with Matt's statement? I mean, don't you? Oh, no, but it's sort of, it just says that it's sort of That this operator is nilpotent. That the thing you think might be zero is nilpotent. Okay. And of course, it might be zero. I mean, if you have a nil-potent operator acting on Z, it kind of has to be zero. But a nil-potent operator on Z plus a finite group does not have to be zero. And you might expect it to actually be nilpotent of order two, and that nilpotence to be related to exactly the exception you're writing down. I mean, we say you might expect, if you come back and tell me, Expect if you come back and tell me actually can prove it's literally zero, I wouldn't fall out of my chair. But yes, I'm not sure who hadn't, or certainly I hadn't thought about this. There's no reason why you would know the answer, but it's more suggested that I'd be interested in the answer. I would say that so when P is When p is large enough with respect to i, but i is still in the stable range, so we still talk about homology, these things arise to some kind of quotient of stable homology by like sort of massive products and things like that from lower degrees. And so perhaps, yeah, perhaps we don't like, I feel like on this theme, it's not something on the quotient, it's going to. On this quotient, it's going to be fairly simple, but perhaps four quotienting, if not. Sorry, yeah, it wasn't very editing. Yeah, it's an interesting question, actually. Maybe maybe someone in the audience knows. I mean, is there any is there any argument that even integrally uh unstable hom like a stable part of homology hypocrisy trivial? Hip hoppers featured you. Well, that's good. That was a question. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, so to say even sounds like the simplest question, but I think that sounds still a hot question. I think this is interesting because I was always asking I've been asking Tony and Amer in which sense the the eigenvalues are trivial on the stable Values are trivial on the stable part, and they always said, Yeah, that's something that Telagari and Emerton have done in our sort of. And so, so, like, so it's not really known. And like, another question would be like on the counterpart in the top dimension, like, it's also like, I mean, the free part apparently, there it's there, it's trivial, that's what Tony said, but could you somebody elaborate on? Elaborate on what's known, what's actually known? Maybe we should talk about it at T. Thank Tony and Anne and attempt to start Benjamin's talk on time, but people can feel free to keep talking. What's on time? On time at three. It's in 20 minutes, so we can apply for more discussion. Time for more discussion. I will stop the recording now, but we should continue talking. And there's also a question in the chat off the class. But sorry, Peter had a question. So let's. So just so I think Peter's question was maybe can someone say something about
