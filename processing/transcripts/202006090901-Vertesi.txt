Okay, sorry. Hello. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, yeah, I really did talk about border contact being variant. I'm also really sad that we are not in VAMP at the moment. So everyone else is, I guess. And so what I'm talking about is a joint work with Akram, Vicky, Kristen, John, and then. John and that's it and mostly I will just tell you what the information which goes into it and then and then a little bit about how the invariant itself is defined. So the motivation is pretty simple. There are contact invariants in many places, so why not have one here too? So the idea of the contact invariant in The contact invariant in Hager homology is the following: that you so first you have a stream manifold, and then for any stream manifold, you can define a Heger decomposition, which is just a decomposition of it into two handlebodies. And using this Heger decomposition with certain choices, you can give its Hegat for a homology, which is just going to be a double-graded vector space over Z2 for me, I guess. Me, I guess. And then you can understand what are these choices you made and show that your definition is independent under these choices. So in this case, you have the Hegea decompositions, every Hegada composition of Cree manifold, every two Hegel decomposition of C manifold have a common. Composition of C manifold have a common stabilization, and then and then and then this describes three manifolds with up-to-deep amorphisms. So any three manifold up to the phoomorphism is an equivalence class of Hegel decompositions up to stabilization. And then if you have a contact structure, contact structures have open books, and then every open book gives you a contact Hagar decomposition. Contact Hagar decomposition is exactly. Contact Hegeger composition is exactly the open Hegel decomposition you get from doubling the page of the open book. And then, once again, we have this equivalence relation, which is again called stabilization. I'm distinguishing it at this moment only. Let's call it open book stabilization. So, contact structures up to contact amorphisms are described by these equivalence classes of open book decompositions with open up to open stabilization. Up to open stabilization. So, one open book with some additional choices gives you a HICA decomposition, and on this HIGA decomposition, you get a generator which is living. Some of the idea of that generator is that it's the element which leaves on, it's the only element which leaves on one of the pages. And then this element is. Is living in this Higgard homology, and that's what's called the contact element once you check that it's independent of all the choices you have made. And this construction was done by Ozrat and Sabo, and then later the way I'm using it is the construction of conduct causes and message. So that's what you have for. So that's what you have for Hagar for homology. And then this is a pretty useful invariant. It doesn't vanish for strength-fillable ones, but vanishes for over-the-state ones. It detects G-Rotors, so it's zero when you have a G-retursion. And then if you think of this, these are all just like local reasons of why this invariant vanishes. The G-retursion is a contact structure in the neighborhood of. Neighborhood of a torus, it's torus percent of embedded into your stream, into your contact structure, and then over-twisted is also the neighborhood of a disk. And then what we would aim for is to get some non-local reason for the vanishing of the contact invariant. And that's really just a motivation, we are not there yet. But I heard this conjecture of follow in at MSRI. At MSRI, long time ago. So, I don't think he wants me to attribute it to him. So, if a manifold contains half a gear torsion along a non-separating torus, then its invariant should be zero. That really would be a global reason because the contact structure of separating or non-separating? Separating, sorry. Separating, sorry, separating. So, yeah, exactly, because so T3 with the contact structure which just twists exactly once has a non-vanishing contact invariant, but it also has a half-G-retorsion in any geo retortion which is smaller than one. And yeah, so that's the goal. I didn't solve it yet, but that's where we are going. But that's where we are going, and for that, we are going to define an invariant which is somehow behaves better for gluing, and then maybe try to use that to prove this theorem. So, because all of what I have said so far is somehow follows from a definition of generalization of open books, quite partial open books. Generalization of open MOOCs, quite partial open MOOCs, each of these local results can be proved using those partial open MOOCs as well. So the invariant I'm going to talk about is going to live in border homology. There is a question in the chat. Really? I don't see the chat. So can someone monitor that for me? I don't even know how I would see it. Is one half your retortion an example of plain. An example of a planar torsion domain as defined by Wendell. No idea. Leb may have been asking that for the audience. Leb may have been asking that for the audience. Yeah, so if it's asked from the audience, and maybe someone can answer. So I don't know. I mean, half-gree return is really just this, turning pi in. Pi in why you go forward in the transverse direction to the T2. And I don't know if you can express it with the planar torsion. Okay, then if no one has an answer, then I just continue. Okay. So the idea of bordered Higgins for homology is that if you have a Is that if you have a Hegel decomposition of your three manifold, then you can just cut it into half using a separating surface, which is nice with respect to this Hap decomposition. And then if you are just looking at half of these manifolds, like only maybe this part of the whole Of the whole manifold, like this part, then this is a bordered Hager Hager, this is a bordered stream manifold. And then the Hager decomposition gives a parametrization of the surface. And so that one together is a boarded Hager decomposition for your 3-man equal. And you can define the invariants, which are A infinity. Which are A infinity modulus over an A infinity algebra, which where the A infinity algebra is associated to the cutting surface sigma and the experiment position. And then the interesting part of border-free homology is that it glues nicely. So if you take these two, so this CFA and CFD, then the derived transfer product gives you back the the chain complex for The chain complex for the Hagar homology of the surface. And then you can basically do the same thing for open books. You can take a surface, which is nice with respect to the open book, and tap your three-manicoid to get the three-manicoid defoliated boundary. And these are the objects we're going to work with. So, once again, we are trying to concentrate on only half of it and describe what this is. That's going to be. Describe what this is. That's going to be the first part of the lecture of this talk. So, if you have a contact structure and I'm going to fix the characteristic foliation on the surface, then you can associate with it whatever is left from the open book, which I'm going to call a foliated open book. And what we are working on, or we have basically done, is that you can associate elements using these foliated open books. Using these full-time open books in this CFA and CFD, which tensor the right way. So it gives you the contact invariant if you tensor them. I wanted to just to set up the notation. I quickly go through what open books are, what context structures and then what open books are. But I sort of assume that most people know them. People know them. So, if you have a three-manifold, and then a contact structure is a non-integrable plane field in this three-manifold, and the non-integrability condition can be equivalently described by this alpha vehicle greater than zero, where alpha is given as the kernel of, where C is given as the kernel of alpha. So, locally, every contact structure looks like, like in this picture, alpha. looks like like in this picture, alpha equals dz minus y ds. That's the serum of Dorbo. And we can all also understand it in the neighborhood of surfaces. So if you have an embedded surface in your contact structure, then the contact structure induces a foliation on your surface. You can just think of You can just think of the intersection of the surface of the tangent space of the surface with your contact structure. That's typically a line, and in some cases, it's not. Those are quite singular points. And you're going to concentrate on only characteristic foliations which have isolated similarities. That's not always true. But you can actually recognize characteristic foliations in the In the so characteristic foliations which are coming from contact structures by this nice criteria that the divergence of this foliation cannot be zero at the singular points. And for isolated singularities, this translates to very nice singularities. It can only be elliptic or hyperbolic. For example, you're not allowed to have centers. To have centers, these small circles. So, and then it's also an important thing that this characteristic fallation determines the contact structure in the neighborhood of the surface, meaning that if you have two surfaces with the same characteristic fallation, then they have a neighborhood which are contactomorphic to each other. And then open Open book decompositions for a contact structure are for a three-manifold are just given as a pair BP, where B is the binding of the contact structure, it's an embedded one-manifold, and P is a vibration of the complement of the binding. So, the idea, which is why it is called the open book, is because the is it called open book is because the binding near the binding we have a we require to have a a special um special uh way it looks namely that the pages which are the pre-images of of of a given time have to arrive in the theta direction like in the in in in the d2 it has to project to the to the theta direction uh another way of thinking of Another way of thinking of open books is to work with the mapping cylinders. So if you cut this open book at the time zero, zero time, then this vibration is a vibration of the interval, so it's just S cross interval, and you have a gluing map which is called the monodromy. And then, so if someone gives you a surface with a monodromy which fixes the boundary, then you can, then you can. Then you can build a stream manifold out of it just by taking the mapping cylinder and then factoring out the elements which are on the binding. So you take any point which is on the boundary and then you collapse them to one. We say that an open book supports a contact structure if alpha is positive on the binding, meaning that it's positively transverse not, and d alpha is positive on the pages, meaning that it gives an area from the pages. Notice that the pages are oriented in this case, so it actually makes sense. Makes sense. And then this being the moral of the alpha being a volume form just somehow is that C, the context structure is nearby, the tangent space of the pages. Okay, it just rotates a little bit, but not too much with respect to that. And then what I was the key the key idea of open MOOCs is that. Idea of open books is that they are really nice to describe contact structures. If you have a contact structure, then you can always construct an open book for it. And after stabilization, any isotopic class of contact structure is described in one way. And then the next thing, I want to give you an example for a foliated open box. So imagine that you have a solid torus embedded in R3, just as it's drawn on the picture, this yellow solid torus here. Oops. So here. And then I'm looking at its intersection with the half planes with the given angle. Okay, so when you are looking at the angle zero, zero then the intersection is just it's just this telephone like it's a rectangle but it is strong funny and then as as the as the angle increases then um then uh then you're going you're going to have a point when uh when this uh open book when this page is uh is tangent to the to the surface. To the surface, and then after that, for example, in pi equals in pi over two, you're going to have only two disks, two half disks as an intersection. And then as you go further, you're going to change again, and then you're going to going to change back, change back and change again once more, and then you build back. So, S0 and S2π is actually the same thing. Okay? Okay, and then what do we see here? So, first of all, we got a decomposition of our solid torus into something like phages, but the phages change over time. And we got this exact same decomposition on the surface as well. So, and this decomposition is a singular foliation on our surface. Singular foliation on a surface. If you have heard of open book fallations, then this is an open book foliation. And then, so you can actually generalize this idea to any stream and if you want. So the idea is that you take any open book. So, I mean, what happened here is that I was working with the open book of S3 and I And I took out this part of the circle of the ice stream, which was bounded by this torus. And then you can generalize this anywhere. So if you have an open book, you can cut it in half with the surface which is in good position. So by good position, I mean that the binding has to be transverse to the surface. The restriction of this vibration to the surface has to be more. So, maybe you have to think for a second, what does that mean? So the pi restricted to the surface used to be used to be a regular. Pi was a regular function, but when you restrict it to the surface, it could happen that it has Of that it has tangent points, and so that's why it's we can only hope that it's going to be Moores. Okay, so we are hoping that we want it to be Moores, and then with a small isotope you can achieve this. And we have an extra condition which can only be achieved with the big isotopy: is that we want that the level sets of pi restricted to C, to sigma, have no closed components. components. So this is a so this can only be achieved with a big isotope and then drew here how the isotopy looks like. You take a circle component of your foliation, if you have one, and then you put your finger underneath and you push it through the binding. If you do that then then the circles, the circle just broke. Circles, the circle just broke because, like, here was. Oh, I don't know why it's always switching to so. Here was one of the circles, okay? And then it just got in, you just inserted in it an elliptic point, and then and then it continues. So it's not a circle anymore because it has an elliptic point as well. And then the other ones, they broke even more. So that condition is called having an open book for so this one is just called here, this part is just called to have an open book for this is some notion which have which have which have existed for a long time. Existed for a long time. So, originally, open book fallations were defined by Benakin, but then they were extensively used by Berman and Manasco in like several papers. And right now, there are also a sequence of paper of Ito and Kamamuro where they use this notion. So they are not new. But cutting the manifold along them is sort of the new idea. So what we are going to do. What we are going to do is that we try to cut our stream using this surface and we are trying to understand what happens with the open book. We do a slight modification of the whole open book here. So we are cutting, we are first changing the open book so that you remember pi restricted to You remember, pi restricted to sigma used to have, so this one has critical points. This one has critical points, and pi does not have critical points. So what we are doing is that we introduce critical points for pi exactly where pi restricted to sigma had critical points. We introduce a pair of cancelling critical points that can be done like in a small neighborhood of sigma. And then we cut this out after that. Okay, so so we. Okay, so we introduce. So here you have a pair of cancelling critical points, an index one and an index two for every critical point of sigma. So recall that sigma can only have index one critical points because the zero and two critical points are ruled out by the fact that you cannot have circles. Okay, so an index zero and index two critical points would be a minimum and the maximum, and then there. The maximum, and then they would have volations near them like that to each of them, and then that's not allowed. Okay, so you only have so pi intersected to sigma, pi restricted to sigma has only index on critical points. Okay, and then and then so I'm introducing this extra pair of canceling pretty critical points, and then I'm cutting them so you only have like half a pretty. Them so you only have like half a critical part, and then this is what the definition of a foliated open book. I just, but right now, I'm really forgetting what happens on the other part. Okay, so I'm taking out this part and I'm telling you what I see here. So, what I see here is that I have an embedded embedded one manifold, which is properly embedded. So, the boundary can go into the boundary. And then if I And then, if I restrict to the complement of the binding, then I get an S1 valid Morse function. But this S1 valid Morse function has some special properties that the set of critical points for this Morse function is exactly the same as the set of critical points of the Morse function restricted to the boundary. And then the level sets of the Morse function on the boundary have no closed leaves. That was a condition. And this is what quality did open work. The quality open book. The rest so far have been just wise that the definition we are using. Okay? And then, so, yes, as I said, so because of the known circular condition, we have that it doesn't have minimum and maximum. So, the indexes and indices are really just one for the boundary. So, if you restrict everything to the boundary, then the indices are just one. And then, so what does And then, so what does that mean for the index of a critical point of the whole function? It could be, so you know, here's a boundary, and then either you get one extra dimension or you don't. So for for for the for the for the descending manifold. And then so if you don't get the extra dimension, then you are working with the index one critical point in your in the in the hole. In your in the in the whole whole manifold here. So this is the index when it all happens on the surface, or you have an have an extra dimension, then you get an index two critical point, and this is the descending manifold in the whole manifold. Okay? And then one more thing you should just remember that we also get a foliation for the whole whole For the surface, for the surface. So we have already seen the foliation near the critical points. They are these subtle points. So that it looks like this, these gray lines here on the picture. These are the folio near the critical points. And then there is another type of critical point, which is the intersection with the binding. Those critical points look elliptic. Okay, and then there are no other types of critical points. And so, okay, so maybe that's a good moment to stop because that means that the reason we didn't want, for example, this type of critical points for the boundary is exactly because characteristic relations don't have this type of critical point, and we wanted to rule them out. Because the next definition is compatibility. So, we say that the So we say that this fully did open book supports a contact structure if like morally if it's nearby the if the tensions are nearby the contact structure. So what we say that nothing changed alpha is greater than zero in the binding. So the binding is a transverse knot. D alpha is an area form in the pages. And then here is the x. And then here is the extra condition here that the characteristic volation is topologically equivalent to the open book volation. So these are the level sets of pi restricted to sigma. So this is when we want to say, this is just the way to say nearby. But this topologically. But it's topologically equivalent, it's sort of not exactly what you would expect, I think, when you first think of it. You want it to say equal, and that's not possible for the following reason. That if you remember, the characteristic relations have this divergence non-zero conditions in the singular point, and here divergence is zero because it's a because it's. Because it's just dp, and then you take d of dp, that's going to be zero. Okay, so so you can never even hope the same. So what you do, you can not even hope that they are diffromorphic to each other. So the best you can hope for is that they are homomorphic to each other, the forelations on the surface, and then that this homomorphism can be small. And this is what we. Can be small, and this is what we require. And then, what we have proved with John is that if you have a contact structure, so contact structures on a three-manifold with a fixed characteristic foliation on their boundary, up to isotopy relative to the boundary, are in one-to-one correspondence in this foliated open box with a fixed Morse function on their boundary. What notion? Are you using the C0 topology or what notion of small for a homeomorphism? Actually, we use something weaker. We only need, so, okay, secretly, these foliations, yeah, C0 is good enough. Yes. C0 is good enough, but what we actually need is that, so these are secretly both. These are secretly both have dividing curves, and we want that the same dividing curve works for both. Okay, thanks. Yes, so I think this theorem is really what you would expect, except that so somehow when you say fixed characteristic volition, you not every characteristic volition can be described as level set of a Morse function. Set of a Morse function. I mean, you sort of have this co-orientation of the leaves. And I actually have been working on this. This is a very simple combinatorial problem of what kind of you draw these characteristic relations with only isolated singularities. That's a combinatorial object. I mean, these things are just hyperbolic points and elliptic points. Each hyperbolic point is going into an elliptic point. point is going into an elliptic point that's a completely combinatorial thing and the fact the understanding which one is actually an open book for H and which one is coming from from some function as level sets of function is a hard problem I couldn't solve it and and it's not only me couldn't solve it so but I think it's it's very nicely you can actually tell it to your combinatory friend and he can Re-expand friend, and you can think of it because it has a reformulation in graphs, you are with even graphs and looking for pairings in graphs. So what I have described so far is an embedded picture of what open books are. But usually, when you use open books, you use Usually, when you use open books, you use abstract open books because those are the ones which are combinatorial objects, and you can define them for these two. They are called abstracted open books. And then, so the idea is that for so the idea of how you would construct it, you want to discretize the whole thing I have said so far, the whole open book construction. Whole open book construction. So every page, every non-singular page somehow looks like this. It's a surface with boundary, or the boundary is either like a complete binding component or some broken polygonal part. What you have to see that you are because you are not allowed to have circles. You are not allowed to have circles, you can never have a completely non-binding type of boundary. Okay, and then when you are moving with this more small function, you're moving the time, then the page changes. So these are the gray parts here are the parts which are on the boundary. So this is on the boundary. So this is actually like some other foliation. Like some other foliation. And then you can either add the handle or cut along an arc. And this is what can happen with your open book. And then the definition of an abstract-folated open book is exactly that. So you have a sequence of pages, even number, because you want to get back to the same page, and the monodromy, which is just mapping from Is just mapping from S2K to S0, and there is a, and then each page is related to the consecutive one by either adding a handle or cutting along an arc. Okay, and then of course what I said that the surfaces have polygonal boundaries B and then and then the AI so the polygon boundary And then the AI, so the parts which are not on the binding cannot have circles in it. Okay? And then, whenever you have an abstract follicle open book, you can reconstruct your three manifold. You just simply take like this relation between Si minus one and Si gives you cobordism here. You can just build it up like with the folation as well. And then you again collapse the binding. The binding, and you get back a 3-manifold with an open book that composition on it. And then you can actually easily construct foliated open books. Just you take an abstract folated open book and you take a bunch of curves in it, which separate it, and then you do operations on it. You do this type of operations of cutting or gluing, whatever was allowed for the. Or gluing, whatever was allowed for the abstract fullated open books. And then what you're aiming for is that you want that by the time you get to the last picture, you are actually gotten age inverse of the original page you started with, or original part you started with. And you can see that you can very easily achieve daintwise just by first cutting. By first cutting and then gluing. Okay? And then so here is the two simplest ways of you can have a folated open book. And then so one of them is for negative dentist, the other one is for the positive dentist. And this is just, so the first one is just a Darby ball. And the other one is a, I think it's a little bit more than the complement of a neighbor. The complement of an over than the neighborhood of an over-twisted disk. So it's an over-twisted disk, but the boundary folation looks like for a Darbo ball. And then everything we have done is just works, meaning that you can cut them and the cutting works the way you. And the cutting works the way how I said earlier that you take the surf you take the surface sigma you you change the open book in a neighborhood of the surface and you remove that part and then you you get two forated open books which are and then and then the the statement is that if this one was if if this was psi If this was psi, if the contact structure was psi here, then and the restrictions to these parts are psi l, then when you do this construction, you get a full lady token book which is compatible with the restriction of the contact structure. That's not automatically obvious. Automatically obvious, you actually have to do something to prove this. You have to understand how this local modification looks like. And then the gluing theorem says exactly the same. If you have two parts which happen to have matching foliated open books, then you can glue them together. For that, we needed to prove neighborhood theorem that these foliated open books, these open book folations. These open book relations determine the neighborhood, the open books in the neighborhood of the whole thing, and then you can glue them together and you get an open book of the whole stream manifold which restricts the right way to do each part. Both the contact structures and the open book. So you can simultaneously do these things. And I wanted to give you one application for that. For that, how you can use this volated open book to prove the addictivity of the support norm. So the support norm of a contact structure is just given as the minus the LF characteristic minus one taking the minimum over all open books. And then the question is how this behaves at the Is how this behaves under connected SAM. So you can immediately see that it's sub-additive somehow because if you take the connected SAM, then you can always take it in the neighborhood of the binding. And then you see that the open books you're getting are gluing together to the open books you start with are gluing together to give you an open book for the whole three manifold. For the whole three manifold for the connected SAM. So you immediately see that the support norm is additive, it's sub-additive, and then the question was whether it was additive. Burak gave a counterexample for this additivity. So the example is actually pretty simple. So if you have an integer homology sphere and an over-twisted contact structure on it, then On it, then you can compute that if you add to it this contact structure in S3, which has minus half D3 invariant, then you don't change the contact structure. Because you get again an over-twisted contact structure with the exact same D3 invariant, so they have to be homotopic to each other. And then, but the support norm of this guy is not zero, and then it immediately proves that he's. Then it only immediately proves that it's not that active. And what I'm claiming is that if that this trick only works because it's overtwisted. So if the contact structures are tight, then you can actually not do that anymore. So what we have seen actually, so the strategy of the proof is very simple. So here you have your Your contact structure, which is a contact structure on the connected sum, and then you just take the sphere which separates it as a connected sum, and you are looking at the open book formation on that sphere. If that open book formation happens to be the standard one, then we are good because that's exactly how we started. Okay, then. Okay, then why would be done because so here on this uh on this sphere I'm having this uh I'm having having the the standard con the standard foliation and then I can just take S3 with the standard foliation with the standard contact structure and the foliation here with this embedded ball so the complement of this is both of them are dark balls with the even foliation. Dark balls with a given fallation on the boundary, and then you just mix-glue them. So you take this part and glue it to that part of the glue into a dorbo ball, and you take this part and glue a dorbu ball there to close it to a contact, to a closed contact three manifold. And then the the open books are just having bound are just becoming boundary connected cells. Bound reconnected samson. So we would have that the support norm is also super additive and we would be done. The problem is that we cannot always simplify this to this simple one. But what we can do is that if you have any foliation which is coming from this diapontal structure, then you can realize this foliation in the Can realize this foliation in the standard open book of Rs of R3 just by doing some finger moves with your ball. And then you can do the exact same mixed gluing argument and get that the open book is in this case not going to be a boundary connected. It's going to be a To be gluing together the open books of the manifolds along a bunch of intervals. Okay, and then what's still true is that the Euler characteristic of the pages add up and then you once again get super additivity, which is what you needed for the proof. And then uh yeah i just wanted to finish then uh with uh how the that that you can what what's going to to what's we're going to have from the contact invariant so um so we had this contact invariant for closed manifolds we also had the contact invariant for contact manifolds with convex boundary remember what we have constructed even though it has a characteristic fortition is also secretly convex Secretly convex, but it has the extra information of the characteristic fallation, and this characteristic volation gives us a parametrization of the surface of the manifold. And then we can define an invariant, like two invariants in CFA and CFD with these parametrizations, and then these loop together the right way. And then they also connect. And then they also connect to the sutured invariant in the right way. So you remember there was a map from CFA to the sutured for homologies and CFD to the sutured for homologies just by gluing these so-called caps. It's going into sutured border, going through suture border fluor homology of Rumenzara. And then what we proved is that the invariants map into the two. The sutured invariance of Honda Casses and Matic. And then this actually gives you a new way to compute the sutured invariant of the gluing map in sutured homology, which was given. And that's really all I wanted to say. Now maybe this one. Okay. Now, maybe this one. Okay. So I just wanted to sum up what we can do maybe later. So first of all, Rumen Zarev had this idea of defining the contact invariant only using suture for homology. And I think this better understanding of this gluing map would give us a way to. map would give us a way to actually understand the A infinity maps not only on the homology level but on the on the on the level of of the chain chain level that was a conjecture of of Rumemzarev he he he described it only on the homology level and then and then I think maybe not everyone agrees with me I think this one would actually give you Agrees with it. I think this one would actually give you a very good guess of how you would define border DCH. And just by this, I think these foliated open books are somehow like if you look at the Hegarfer equals ECH paper of Colin and Honda and Eugenie, then I think this can be generalized to this setting. And I don't say you can prove anything, but you can guess what has to be the definition of social ECH. And what we are actually working on, I'm not going to do ACH, is that you can, I want to be able to distinguish different blowings using this technique. I mean, that's something which I think should. Which I think the suture gloomer shouldn't be able to do. And I want to say that ORS is capable of doing that. And yeah, that's really all I wanted to say. All right, so let's unmute and applaud. All right. So are there any questions for Vera? Yeah, I have a question. What do you mean? I have a question. What do you mean in the end by different gruing? Well, I mean, I mean, there is a diffomorphism of the surface, which of course has to preserve the dividing set, but nothing else. The rest can be changed. And I want to understand how you could do that. Want to understand how you could do that. I mean, the way I, of course, I would do it is that I want to define, I want to insert a piece on a sigma cross integral which realizes this gluing, this gluing. But if you preserve the manifold and the dividing set, can you actually give it the obtain different contact manifolds? I think so, why not? I think so, why not? I don't know. It sounds weird. I don't see why not. Well, because essentially the dividing set is everything around some. I don't know. I mean, it might be wrong, but it goes... The contact structure. I mean, but you could change already the manifold, no? Okay, but then if the manifold is different, I don't need a contact invariant to distinguish. Invariant to distinguish you might want to know how properties of the context structure change, like type or over twisted and things like that. Sorry, I didn't hear. I just said that, you know, yeah, you might know that it's a different context manifold, but you might be interested in the question of how the contact structure changes. For example, you know, maybe for one gluing it's tight, another glue title. Maybe for one gluing it's tight, another gluing it's over twisted or something like that. I mean, are you thinking of inserting some contact structure on the surface cross eye with like the same dividing set on two? Yes, I was going to insert the paper structure. So if you if you insert like different uh contact structure on that piece in principle, you'll you'll certainly get different contact structure, right? No, I was going to insert the trivial contact structure. I was going to insert the trivial construct structures, but I would take care of how the gluing can still be different. What do you mean? I'm not sure. I understand. Well, I mean, so if there is a non-trivial map from R plus to R minus of the manifold. Of the manifold, of this part R plus and R minus. Then I wanted to change the foliation from one of two. Yeah, maybe, okay, maybe this is not cooked out enough. Maybe I should. I mean, you have to have the whatever diffeomorphism. I mean, if you're going to change the diffeomorphism, you'll change the manifold, right? Unless somehow. Yes, I guess. Yes, I mean it would have been the idea of changing the gluing map. But okay, so what I was trying to say is that I think the sutured gluing map is, so I have some information in the sutured bluing map, I have some information about the EH invariant here and here. And independently of what is the bluing here, I won't be able to get any more, like whatever information I can deduct from the Whatever information I can deduct from this EAG invariant for the contact invariant from one side, I have to be, I can only get maximum as much for the other type of LUIMA. And in our case, we should be able to get different results. So Lev has a question in the comments. He asks: Can this bordered contact invariant be used? Can this bordered contact invariant be used to prove a naturality statement for the loss invariant under Legendrean cabling, or more generally, Legendrean satellites? I can only say maybe. I'd never really recognity statement, so I don't know what's hard there. So I think you mean something like, you know, if you know that the contact invariant of some Legendre knot is non-zero, and maybe you know something about, you know, a Legendre inversion of a pattern, can you then conclude that the contact invariant, you know, like the transverse invariant of the satellite is non-zero, stuff like that? I mean, I understand what naturally means. I just don't. Yes, obviously, you have a pattern. In his chat, he says functoriality, not naturality. He changed it. Functorality, I would more agree with that. I mean, you can definitely define maps using this. Whether those maps are independent of how you define them, I have no idea. I have a question. I don't know how interesting this would be, but. This would be, but Liam and Jonathan and Jake have this immersed curves understanding of bordered flow homology when you have torus boundary. Have you thought at all about how one might interpret your contact invariant for manifolds with torus boundary in terms of the immersed curves formulation? No, no, no. No, I actually was hoping to listen to that talk. No. So I had another question as well. So have you actually done computations of these invariants for any examples? I mean, so far what computations we can do is basically like even if we don't use the map, this map of the Of this cat map, they could have been done with that. Because there is a lot of computation done for the E-aging variant somehow. So we can compute that it vanishes for over-twisted or G-w torsion, but that's somehow not interesting. Yeah. Are there other questions? Other questions? All right, well, great. So let's again, let's thank Vera again.
