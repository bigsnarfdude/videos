Tudor de Mafte on non-semi-simple and derived QFTs for quantum groups at root of unity. Thanks. Yeah, thanks very much. I sort of realized later that a snap to your title might have just been unsimplifying Turn Simons. So this is based on work with Work with Nick Garner, who was my graduate student, but is now a postdoc at the University of Washington, and Nathan Gere and Thomas Kreisik. They're sort of two basic goals behind what we did and What we did, and maybe what should be done in the future. So, we were initially motivated by a question that came up in an FRG collaboration with Nathan and Kolya and Christian, a few other people. Namely, what sorts of Sort of 3D quantum field theory might be computing CGP style invariance. All these sort of non-semi-simple TQFTs or TQFTs based on categories that have vanishing quantum dimensions and need some regularization. Also, in the same Also, in the same class of things, there are invariants not just of three manifolds, but of three manifolds together with flat connections, or invariants of knots with flat connections in their complement. So, these were described in older work of Kashaiv and Rashitikin that then has been Has been sort of reformulated within a CGP style framework most recently by Blanche Gear, Patrick Omiran, and Reshitikin. I think that that's still ongoing work. The simplest case we ended up focusing on Focusing on was looking at just a quantum group at a root immunity. And I say simplist, but I guess this audience knows that that is very, very, very far from being a simple case. So in the meantime, Sergei Gukov and DuPay and Gukoff and DuPay and collaborators explored similar ideas coming from the perspective of 3D, 3D correspondence and the Z hats that Sergei told us about. And so they had a paper approaching similar questions. A year and a bit ago, that should be the constructions there should be related to things I'll talk about today by 3G mirror symmetry. And also, there's work in progress that Sergei and Boris Fagin and Kolya Reshitikin all mentioned, also approaching aspects. Also, approaching aspects of this question. Sort of a larger goal for me is to figure out more generally what sorts of TQFTs may arise from twists of 3DN equals for theories and gauge theories in particular. One can sort of think of these. One can sort of think of these as gauged generalizations of Rosansky written or as 3D versions of Donaldson theory. There's quite a lot to still make sense of there, and this project has been a fun playground for trying to figure out some of what should work. We've made some progress on both fronts. Part of what I want to talk about today is a main proposal for answering the first question. What 3D quantum field theories underlie the TQFTs built from the big non-semi-simple categories of reps. Simple categories of reps of a quantum group at a root of unity. And so we've found one answer for that. So we construct a family of topological quantum field theories that should be thought of in a very direct way as generalizations of Trinz-Simon's theory. We focus on type A. So these are labeled by an integer n for SLN and a level K. There ought to be, they're very obvious generalizations to other groups, but some very subtle global phenomena arise that we have not tried to deal with yet. And And the basic conjecture, and supported by physical derivations, is that the category of line operators in these theories is the big category of representations of the Katz-Dekoncini quantum group at an even root of unity. So, the correspondence between levels and even roots of unity is the same as the one in classic Chern-Simon's theory, where you would semi-simplify this category. And sitting inside there is reps of the small or baby or reduced quantum group. The quantum field theory, the 3D quantum field theory by construction, Theory by construction can be coupled to or deformed by classical background flat PGLN connections. And so if it is possible to compute partition functions on three manifolds at all, and I say that with some hesitation because there are serious regularization issues that need to be dealt with. Issues that need to be dealt with, just as there are in the sort of CGP work. But to the extent that one can compute partition functions, one will get invariants of pairs, of three manifolds, which will need spin structure, and a classical flat PGLM connection. And so And so these would conjectually be the same invariants of three manifolds that are coming out of recent TQFT constructions. And also through physical derivation, these quantum field theories admit not just one, but two holomorphic boundary conditions. So in So, in Trinsimon's theory, there's Wes Amino-Witten on the boundary. But if one describes Trin-Simon's theory as a twist of a supersymmetric theory, there's actually a second boundary condition around as well. And that has the level rank dual of SLN Wes, Amina-Witten. And so, what we're getting here are again, Getting here are again two boundary conditions, one of which is supporting a Fagin-Tipunin algebra, and the other one is supporting what appears to be the natural level rank dual of the Fagan-Tiputen algebra. So, one of the conjectures which Thomas has mostly proven in the case n equals two is that these two Is that these two VOAs sit as mutual commutants inside some number of copies of free fermions and have equivalent representation categories up to a reversal of breaking. So that's yeah. That's the sort of framework I want to shoot for. Want to shoot for. And I will get back to it in sort of the last part of the talk. I'd actually like to spend some time before saying more about this, saying a little about 3DN equals 4 theories and the actual structure of the TQFTs or cutative TQFTs that arise. One thing I One thing I sort of wrote but didn't say on the previous slide was that in identifying the category of line operators with some quantum group category, one actually lands on a derived category of quantum group modules. And that's a general feature of general feature of the class of TQF, well, the class of 3D theories that we play with. So let me say a bit about the world of 3D unequals four theories, sort of continuing on from the introduction that Jorg gave in the discussion yesterday. So there's several notable families of 3D. Of 3dn equals four theories. There are so-called sigma models, which are labeled by a hyperkaler target X. And for purposes of twists, it's often sufficient to think of that as a complex symplectic manifold. There have been recent decades. In recent, in the recent decade, there have been a lot of advances mathematically in describing various algebraic parts of twists of these unequal square theories. And that the approach that has been most successful involves derived geometry. And there one needs to One needs to, well, at least in what's done, one needs to make everything as algebraic as possible. And so, in that context, one always sees X as an algebraic symplectic variety. Also, that's what's relevant for Rosensky-Bitten theory that I'll get to in a sec. So, there are also gauge theories. So, there are also gauge theories that, so 3DN equals 4 gauge theories have been studied physically since the mid-90s fairly heavily. The simplest family is labeled by physically by a compact group and a representation. And in the mathy world, that's usually turned into a productive group, an algebraic representation. And it's And it's this data of a group and representation sort of corresponds in this derived algebraic framework to thinking of a signal model whose target is a derived stack. The sort of algebraic symplectic quotient of t star b. And then there's a special class that doesn't come up very much that was introduced by Goyoto and Witten. By Guyoto and Witten. So it was thought nearly impossible to introduce transients levels in these 3DN equals 4 theories. And there turn out to be exceptions to that. So in some special cases, including the theory that we work on in this project, it is possible to introduce turn-Simons levels in these gauge theories. In these gauge theories as well. These have not been studied so much. Should also mention in relation to 40 theories of class S and things like that, that there are non-Lagrangian examples of 3DN equals 4 theories as well that one can try to do something with. 3DN equals 4 super. 3dn equals 4 supersymmetry in principle gives you a way to extract two topological field theories out of the physical theory by taking what can be called A and B twists. These are analogous to A and B twists of two-dimensional two, two theories. Two-dimensional two, two theories that leads to or led to the mirror symmetry program. The A twist of the gauge theory is a dimensional reduction of Witten's Donaldson twist. The B twist is new in three dimensions. It was described in gauge theories by Blondon Thompson and And defined and used to fantastic effect in sigma models by Rosansky and Witten. And then Kapustin, Rosansky, and Salvina worked out a bit of the extended TQFT, of the extended TQFT structure in B-twists of sigma models thereafter. So one expects these physically defined topological twists of 3DN equals 4 theories to give rise to extended cohomological TQFTs. The part that is clear is that they should be extended down to a point and have some underlying two category from which everything else can be. From which everything else can be derived. As one goes higher than a point, dualizability issues start to creep in. And so by now, there are lots of nice algebraic and mathematically rigorous computations of things like spaces of local operators and state spaces on surfaces in gauge theories. Surfaces in gauge theories. These are almost never finite-dimensional. And so, going up to three manifolds, there will be issues in general that need some way to be regularized or dealt with. I should say in the paper of Kuka. Paper of Gukoff and Payan collaborators from last year. They described a way to deal with some of these issues essentially by turning on the sorts of flat connections I'll talk about later and doing some equivariant regularization. Okay. Also, I missed Deuce's talk right before this, but I think what he's doing. I think what he's doing also deals with infinities in an equivariant way. Okay, and I'll mention, so when one talks about 3DN equals four theories, the words coulomb branches and X branches come up. They've been a huge part of developments in representation theory in the last few years have involved takes in colon branches. years have involved takes in colon branches. So the in TQFT terms, the colon branch of a gauge theory is the spec of the algebra associated to the two-sphere. Physically, it's local operators in the A-twist. And the Higgs branch is associated to the B-twist of the gauge theory. So it's local operators, sorry, it's spec of local. Local operators, sorry, it's spec of local operators, or spec of the space associated to the two-sphere and the B-twist to connect with all of that and to say in another way what I mean by A and B. So, right. These Higgs and Coleman branches have been a big deal in physics. Have been a big deal in physics for a long time and mathematics more recently. In gauge theories, they are typically like symplectic cones or hypertailer cones. They're non-compact. Functions on the Higgs and Coulomb branches are infinite dimensional algebras. That means z of s2 is. Z of S2 is some infinite dimensional space, and the non-triviality of that space, the fact that Z of S2 is not just C is really what forces, among other things, the category of line operators to not be semi-simple. So one will automatically get some non-semi-simple category of lines. Simple category of lines. More so in this context of a topologically twisted supersymmetric theory, every object in sight is cohomological or living in the world of DG algebras, vector spaces, categories, etc. And so the categories of lines that appear here. The categories of lines that appear here are naturally DG categories. So, if they're going to be related to some abelian non-semi-simple thing, it had better be the derived category of the abelian non-semi-simple thing. Another common feature of these supersymmetric theories is that they often have global symmetry coming from symmetries of X or of x or symmetries of the symplectic stack t star v mod g and these global symmetries lead to deformations of the topological twists by classical connections so that that's eventually how flat connections are are going to come in um and the third really cool fact about these um that's relevant today um is that Is that at least in the gauge theory world, these 3dn equals 4 theories quite surprisingly admit boundary vertex algebras. So they're holomorphic boundary conditions, just like in Trin Simons, that support vertex algebras of local operators. So this was initially a construction by Initially, a construction by Costello and Gaiato for the GV sorts of theories described here. I should say it's a little weird that there are holomorphic boundary conditions around. In this extended 3D TQFT world, you would expect topological boundary conditions that have like Have like E2 algebras or commutative algebras of local operators, much smaller things. Not vertex algebras, but it turns out this is possible. Okay, so to go into a little more depth into some of the The features of these sorts of twisted 3D n equals 4 theories, at least features I understand. I want to introduce a toy model. Probably the simplest example of a twist of the 3D theories, and it ends up happening, it ends up having many, many of the properties that we want. The properties that we want in the more general examples. So, a physicist would call this toy model the B-twist of a free hypermultiplet, t hyperb. You could call it Mrzansky-Witten theory, whose target is T star C. Or you could call it gauge theory that has trivial gauge group and representation C. If you write down this theory in a twisted formalism, when you write down the twisted action, it is immediate from the Lagrangian that it's the same thing as a turn-Simons theory based on the super algebra PSL11. A version of that was studied by Rosansky and Seller. Studied by Rosansky and Seller. It was revisited more recently by Nikhailov. And so, in this case, one can argue that not invariance should compute Alexander polynomials and three-manifold invariance should compute torsion. The case where that argument makes sense is after deformation. So to To get there, let me say the next thing about this toy model. There's a group of complex symplectic isometries of T star C, namely SL2C, whose presence leads to a deformation of the B-twist by flat SL2C connections. 2C connections. I'll just abstractly call this group gamma because I eventually want to make some more general statements. That the presence of these deformations predicts that one should be able to compute partition functions of pairs, three manifolds, and flat connections. And it's those deformed partition functions that compute torsion. That computes torsion. The boundary vertex algebra in this case is an extremely simple and also extremely complicated logarithmic VOA, namely symplectic fermions. And in saying that the boundary VOA is symplectic fermions, I'm assuming there is no. Assuming there is no background gamma connection turned on, if one does turn on a connection near the boundary, symplectic fermions get deformed by that connection, namely the OPE gets deformed to get an extra first-order term depending on the connection. Depending on the connection. And for this, I've hidden a lot under the rug. For this to make sense, I'm using a holomorphic gauge and writing the connection as a mirror morphic thing or a holomorphic thing locally on the boundary. And so David described some deformations like this in a paper about five years ago. Paper about five years ago about the connection between 3D unequals 4 theories and geometric languages. Okay. So I'll go through what the line operators and state spaces look like in this simple model and what one expects. And what one expects in general. So dualizability should not be an issue for the category of line operators. Sorry, before I make any strong statements like that, it's important to say what context I'm working in. So for gauge theories, the G V sort of theories, these categories of line. These categories of lines have been defined so far mathematically as categories, not braided tensor categories. There's a bit known about the braiding, and there's no issue with them mathematically in that context. Right, so if we try to define a category of lines, we should look at what We should look at what a neighborhood of what fields are doing in the neighborhood of a line. And we can introduce a flat background connection in the neighborhood of a line, which is going to be a flat connection on S1 that I'm calling curly A. And so if And so, if we are seriously asking the question, what do line operators look like in this theory? We should first specify what flat connection are we going to turn on in the neighborhood of a line. And the category is going to depend on that choice. In one algebraic construction of this category, one finds that That in the presence of a flat connection with holonomy e to the alpha, where alpha is infinitesimal. This is a holonomy defect at the line. The category can be represented as matrix factorizations on T star C with a superpotential. With a superpotential that's equal to the moment map with parameter alpha. It's the moment map for SL2 acting on T star C. That might seem an overly complicated thing. It's a nice general statement because categories and B twists get deformed by moment maps associated to flat connections. In this case, something very simple. In this case, something very simple happens. If the flat connection is zero, the superpotential is zero, and one recovers a Rosansky-Witten answer, or a Kapustin-Rosansky-Salina answer, the category becomes coherent sheets on T-star C. Whereas if the connection is generic, that superpotential becomes quadratic and non-degenerate, and the category collapses to. The category collapses to vector spaces, to a semi-simple thing. That behavior matches what happens in a boundary vertex algebra. So we expect that the category of bulk points will be derived equivalent to the category of boundary via. Of boundary VOA modules, just by letting bulk line operators end on the boundary and asking what is that factor space at the interface of the line and the boundary. To keep track of the flat connection, we can I ask a question. Yeah. In which category of vertex operatorizables? So that's a So, that's a super subtle question that you likely know a lot more about than I do. Here, so in general, the answer seems to be logarithmic modules. That's what Thomas and Costello and Gayoto found in their paper. I think there are choices, both in the field theory, like I say decay. The field theory, like I say, the category of lines. I think they're actually physically meaningful choices to make there, and there are also choices in the VOA that need to match up. For symplectic fermions, the thing that seems to match is logarithmic modules, which I think are just the same as ordinary VLA modules. In the case of symplectic fermions, if I understood that correctly from Thomas. So this category is a tinium category. I don't remember what that means. Simple modules has only finitely many simple modules. Yes. Yeah, maybe I can make a comment. The symplectic fermions is C2 co-finite, so it's. C2 co-finite, so it's it's a nice finite behavior. Okay, so so yes, not much choice for category. That's right. If we played this game with the A twist of a free hyper, we would end up with the beta gamma VOA on the boundary. And then the right thing is to consider the category generated by all spectral flows of the vacuum module. Of the vacuum module. And that lands outside of, I guess, this Artemian world. Thank you. So in this category of symplectic fermion modules, a module is determined by the action of the zero modes of action of the zero modes of the fermions on sort of the top weight space. And in fact, as a category, it's equivalent to modules for an algebra generated by two odd elements. That's beautifully causal dual derived equivalent to modules for two symmetric, for symmetric algebra. For symmetric algebra in two generators, which is another way of saying coherent sheaves on T star C. So the match between coherent sheaves and symplectic fermion modules is, as one expects, a derived equivalence. And that's for trivial background connection and for generic background connection, or here in the neighborhood of a point. Neighborhood of a point on the boundary, a connection that has monodromy with generic holonomy. Symplectic fermions deformed like that become equivalent to free fermions. And then the category reduces to vector spaces. So there's a nice match. Sorry, is there a question? Please interrupt. Yes. Please interrupt. Yes, yes. Just because you mentioned before that you got for the beta-gamma system, when you had that as a boundary condition, you only got the spectral flows of the vacuum. You don't get any of these other relaxed. Oh, no, no, you certainly do. Sorry. And then you get like self-extensions of the vacuum. Okay, yes. Sorry. So you get the vacuum and all its spectral flows and all the extensions that. And all the extensions that they allow. But do you also get? I mean, there's these other blocks, right? There's also these other simple blocks. So that is a question that I'm going to defer to Thomas and to my graduate student, Wenjo, who might be in the audience or will be joining later. And Andrew Bollin is also in the audience. The audience, you should ask them during a break. They have been precisely trying to answer these questions. Thanks. Sorry, so, and yeah, sorry, as far as I understand, like these issues are not fully, I don't think they have fully generally. Fully, I don't think they have fully general answers, even for the gauge theory cases. And there are subtleties and trickiness there. So, and even answering this for beta gamma was hard. There's, yeah. What I'm presenting now is an example that I understand really well and is maybe also oversimplified in some ways. Okay, so this category of lines depending on flat connections should form a coherent sheaf of categories over the space of flat connections. There's some extra structure there that is not super important for the rest of the talk, but it is a useful way to conceptualize things. Where each stock of this category is what one gets for a specific connection on S1. And this feature that happened for symplectic fermions or for the twist of the hyper that the category becomes semi-simple upon Turning on a generic connection is something that one might expect if the fixed point set of the symmetry on the target of the theory is discrete. State spaces behave in similar ways. Similar ways. So, let me say a bit about them. So, one of the central objects in field theory is the ring of local operators and TQFT terms that's TQFT functor applied to S2, which can be factored through the category of lines, since local operators in the bulk are junctions between the trivial line and itself. Trivial line in itself, the fusion identity in itself, and expects endomorphisms of the trivial line to be set of S2. And translating that to the VOA world, since the equivalence between 3D line operators and VOA modules is a derived equivalence, that's end in the derived category of VOA modules, which is soft X of the vacuum. Of the vacuum module in the usual sense. And so that was the prediction by Costello, Koritsuk, and Gayoto that Jurg mentioned yesterday. In this toy model, we can compute this in multiple ways. In coherent sheaves, the fusion identity is the structure sheaf and just as ordinary. And just has ordinary endomorphisms, which are polynomials and two variables. And one can also do that computation in symplectic fermions, and one gets the same answer by looking, in this case, at non-trivial extensions. I'll note that local operators are infinite dimensional, as they must be when the target is non-compact. However, However, it's infinite-dimensional in a controlled way. So the symmetric algebra that I wrote down, whose generators are really the coordinates on T star C, has generators in cohomological degree one. I had swept that under the rug. And that's obvious if one thinks of this as X. If one thinks of this as X of symplectic fermions, where the fermions themselves are in degree zero, this is all coming from non-trivial extensions. And so this space of local operators actually has a slightly nicer structure. It's got a non-negative cohomological grading such that the part in degree zero is just C. It's what you would want. It's what you would want in a better behaved TQFT. In higher genus, so on S2, there was no way to turn on a non-trivial background connection. I think it's gauge equivalent to the trivial connection. In higher genus, we can introduce connections. What one expects is that the different state spaces labeled by different connections. Labeled by different connections on a surface form a sheaf with the structure of a coherent sheaf over the space of flat connections. A nice prediction from the physics, at least, maybe a mathematically obvious statement as well, is that the Euler character of the stocks, in other words, the Euler character of these state spaces is one varies the connection. State spaces as one varies the connection is constant, cannot jump. And so, computing whether characters is a nice way to sort of simplify the story. It also gets rid of a lot of information. And then relating to VOA, what one expects that the state space for a given connection is equivalent to Some version of derived conformal blocks of the VOA deformed by the same connection. And there's an expectation that in nice cases, particular if one has a symmetry whose fixed locus is discrete, then generic stocks will be finite-dimensional and zero relating to the fact that the Relating to the fact that the category becomes semi-simple generically. But at special loci, the stocks can jump and will become infinite dimensional. In particular, at zero connection, this will happen for sure. But there might still be this nice feature. Sorry, and I should say, so the physics behind this is also clear. The physics behind this is also clear. If the 3D theory is conformal, this will happen. The state spaces, even if they're infinite dimensional, will have a non-negative cohomological grading. And then one may hope for finite dimensional graded pieces, which is what seems to happen in examples. Okay. Okay. I should move on and hurry up. So I just wanted to make this more explicit for this symplectic fermion free hypermultiplet example. So the state spaces at zero connection were worked out by Rosensky and Witten way back. In any genus, one gets the underlying vector space of Underlying vector space of an algebra with two commuting generators and 2G anti-commuting. And ironically, their cohomological degrees are. Their cohomological degrees are the opposite of what you might think. The commuting things are in degree one and everything else is in degree zero. So that has in cohomological degree zero something generated by the fermions, which is 2G dimensional, which matches ordinary conformal blocks for symplectic fermions. And then if we deform by a connection, everything sort of collapses. There's a differential that gets turned on. That gets turned on, and two of the bosons cancel with two of the fermions. And one just ends up with a finite dimensional space in degree zero. Which, yeah, which if you've looked at CGP type constructions, is hopefully a familiar feature. Okay, I'll say one more thing about the relation in general between line operators. General between line operators and the Hilbert space in genus one. So, in Trin-Simons, at least when I was learning Trin-Simons, I learned that Taurus-Hilbert space was always K-theory of the category of lines. It's the Grothendieck group, the Grossen D ring. And in these cohomological TQFT cases, that's not true. So, one more generally needs to take Hochschield homology of the category of lines. Of the category of lines to get the state space on the torus. And if we further deform the torus by a flat connection, one needs to take a twisted version of Hochschel tomology of a category that's deformed by that connection. There's a nice physical There's a nice physical explanation for why Haxial tomology is coming up. If the category were semi-simple, we would construct states in the torus Hilbert space just by filling in a solid torus with all the possible line operators circling around the core. When the category is not semi-simple, there are non-trivial junctions that we have to account for, and there's some periodicity. And there's some periodicity there, which roughly tells us to be taking the cosenter of some algebra of junctions. That's zerothoxial tomology. And on top of that, in a cohomological TQFT, there are descendants of local operators, which are higher form operators that one can integrate along segments on this circle in the core. So Witten used these. So, Witten used these in Donaldson theory to get Donaldson environments. And they show up here. So, one needs to start decorating the solitaurus by integrated descendants, and that's the higher oxygen tomology. So it's there whether you want it or not in the physics. Okay. That was sorry. That was my sort of summary of general structures. General structures one expects, and the one example that I understand really well, one can do these Hochschild homology computations for free hyper as well. So let me, ah, I'm sort of out of time. That's okay. I'll summarize quickly the rest of this. So there's a theory like the B-twist of a free hyper, like it in many ways, that That has as its category of line operators conjecturally reps of the quantum group at a root of unity. One builds this theory by taking a 3dn equals 4 theory called T of G that shows up as an S duality interface. It's defined by Goethe and Witten. It has global symmetry G times the Langlands dual. times the Langlands dual, and one can gauge one copy of that symmetry, say G, at a non-trivial transience level. And so we do this when G is SUN, then everything has a Lagrangian formulation very explicitly in terms of fields. The Langlands dual symmetry is still left over, and then one can take the topological a-twist of that whole thing and ends up with a theory with just the right properties to match. With just the right properties to match quantum group representations. The reason this sort of has just the right properties is that it basically looks like Trin Simons, like SUN Transimons at level K minus N or G turn simons at level K minus to Milkster number, coupled to a non-semisimple matter sector that has all of the cohomological complications of these general 3DN equals four theories. General 3dn equals four theories. In that sense, this is really a generalization of Trin Simons. And then just restating conjectures that I made in the beginning a little more precisely. So the category of lines is a sheaf over flat connections on a circle. So is the category of modules for the quantum group at a rooted unity. rooted unity. And the right thing here seems to be requiring the Frobenia center to act semi-simply. Then that thing is a sheaf over spec of the Frobenia center, which looks like a copy of PGLN at an even root of unity. Also, there are these two boundary VOAs, and I'll just say briefly what they are. Briefly, what they are. So, one of them ends up looking like a fake entitled algebra, and one of them looks very different. It's essentially a coset of what's known from work of Davide and Thomas's as the Langlands duality kernel, the kernel VOA. I think it may have also appeared in work of David and Miroslav Rapchuk. Work of David and Miraslav Rapchuk's before that. So, yeah, I think without another hour-long talk, I can't say much more about where these VLAs come from, but there's a direct derivation of both. And the conjecture is that they have equivalent categories of modules and more so in an explicit way, they are commutants and MK copies of free from. Copies of free fermions. And then there are lots of checks that we've done on all of this. There are some easy things to compute in the field theory that involve localization of some sort or other. Checking that the growth and tinkering of the category of lines matches what one expects in the quantum group is remarkable. Is remarkably straightforward. One gets a new computation of that growth indic ring using methods of Necrosaf and Shatashule. Characters of state spaces are also easy to calculate using localization methods. And so when one can check that, see when n equals two on any genus surface, when one gets the dimensions. Well. Um, well, see dimensions. So, so one gets the dimensions of the CGP of a CGP TQFT with generic abelian connection. And abelian is generic enough. So, these precisely match dimensions once you're in a semi-simple sector of that TQFT, otherwise they are regularized characters of some infinite dimensional space. And I'll say. I'll say one last thing, see if I'm super out of time. So, one prediction, not about characters, but about the actual state spaces, is that since this theory is roughly standard turn-simons coupled to a non-semi-simple sector that looks, if we fully decouple them, the non-semi-simple sector looks. The non-semi-simple sector looks like Brzezensky-Witten theory, whose target is t star of a flag manifold. One expects state spaces to approximately factorize into a Trent Simons state space and Rusansky-Witten theory with T-star flag target state space. And that is almost perfectly correct in, say, for the Um, if I say for the um I should have done this for the Taurus-Hilbert space of the Taurus state space on n equals two. Um, so that that's a very doable computation on the quantum group side. Taking Hochschull tomology of that category, one obtains something that's very, very, very close to this factorization prediction that's off by That's off by a factor of c squared. Local operators match as well, and the relation between quantum groups and T-star flag comes from work of Archipov, Besr Kovnikov, and Ginsberg, and Besirkovnikov and Lakovska for representation theory. Anyway, so lots of things are matching. Seems promising. Seems promising. I hope there are lots of future directions to go in, sort of filling in other gaps or filling in many of the other amazing things that happened in classic Trin Simon's theory with these generalizations. Okay, thank you very much for this very interesting and inspiring talk. And we have time for a couple of questions. Yes, Sergei, I think you were first according to my screen. Yeah, I know Eunis Dew's talk, which was actually all about regularizing these derived infinities using G symmetries and equivariant. G-symmetries and equivariant action in the B-model context. So just to make sure, I mean, in particular, this was also the strategy that we used with Hiraku and you and others to get non-semisimple or CGP style invariants. So to get something finite for three manifolds, do you envision using the same technique, same strategy? Because today you Because today you talked a lot about derived structures, which of course give infinite dimensions to those spaces. So yeah, I don't know. So there's a the fact that the CGP-ish methods combined with like all the Bashenko work and all of that, the fact that they work even in the non-semi-simple sector where you haven't deformed by flat connections. By flat connections and can define actual three-manifold invariance gives me some hope that that may be generalized to this setting as well. So that's sort of capturing a homological degree zero part of the story only. The one case where The one case where there's an obvious regularization is for surface times S1, where we're computing these characters of Hilbert spaces. And there, even though they're infinite dimensional, there is again sort of a natural regularization that That honestly, I think it's really there because there's a deformation to the semi-pole setting. There's a differential one can turn on that does correspond to turning on a connection, which tells you how to regularize. Maybe that's the most honest thing to say. And that sounds pretty much the same as what you were describing, right? Yeah, so the thing to do would be to really work with a theory that doesn't have a semi-simple. uh a semi uh a semi-simple deformation and and try to try try to answer the question there and and i i'm i'm not sure i i think it would be really cool
