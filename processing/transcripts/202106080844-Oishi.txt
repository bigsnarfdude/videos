This is a joint work with my PhD student from the University of Sao Paulo. And then, first, I would like to thank for the organizer, because for me, it's a great pleasure to be participating of this so important conference in numerical methods for non-Newtonian flows. Today, I will prepare some slides just to comment about our idea. Our idea to solve numerically to solve viscoelastic droplet collisions. And then I this first slides I prepared just to transmit the idea in terms of motivation. We have the droplet-droplet collision, and then it's very common to analyze in the four outcomes of this problem. And then you can see in this Can see in this image when the first option is the bouncing. In the second column, we have a type of coalescence and reflexive separation and the stretching separation. Okay, I use this figure from the works on physics of fluids published by Audi Raio and Bailey. And then we have some interest in terms of application. Interest in terms of applications, for example, for chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industry. In particular, for the food industry, one nice result was presented by Giulia Finatello and collaborators in Fermes to analyze the milk droplet-droplet collision. And then, this is you can analyze this production of powdered milk, and we can observe a very simple. We can observe a very similar outcomes that the previous figurine. In this case, we don't not have the bouncing effect, but we have the coalescence and different types of separation. In terms of regime map for Newtonian fluids or Newtonian materials, we have very important works in terms of theoretical and experimental. And then, this is the type of region and map where you can analyze the boundary. Analyze the boundary lines and the difference or transition between two different outcomes. We can characterize this process or these phenomenons using some parameters, like for example, the Weber and B is the impact parameter. Okay, and then in the previous, yes, in this map, you can see this B and the Weber, and then we have some. And then we have some information if you are using these parameters. I did not include an on-source number because you can produce using the Weber and the Reynolds number. When these equals zero, you had the head-on collision. And then there are a lot of challenges to analyze this problem in terms of theoretical and experimental results. For example, non-monatonic variation among the outcomes when you have different types. You have different types of materials or fluids. In terms of non-Newtonian materials, I would like to present one motivation for us. It's another work from Giulia Finatello and collaborators, where they use a Shantan solution and then try to analyze using some experiments the transition between Bausing coalescence and coalescence in separation. There are few experimental works. There are few experimental works. We know that's very difficult in terms of the generation and to control the droplets and other problems involving visualization. In terms of numerical results for these problems, in particular for non-Newtonian fluids, the literature is too scarce. I just include some few papers. In general, these papers are General, these papers are assuming generalizing Newtonian type model, Kahui, Asuda, or power law. And it's important to say in the majority of the works, the authors have used the volume of fluid schemes. And of course, we have some advantage because in this type of implicit representation, quality sensor separations are automatically modelled. Automatically model. And then the difficulty is to treat the bouncing effect, but we have some numerical strategy to include this response of the mechanical response related to the bouncing. We are more interested in front tracking schemes and compared to VOF scheme, then there is a couple of works. Works, in particular, just for Newtonian materials, and then this is the main motivation of our study. We are using some specific strategies to deal with the coalescence and separation because in the front track skin, you need to include this algorithm to treat this condition. Then, our main motivation is to develop a front-tracking system. Develop a front-tracking single-phase methodology for dealing with no-Newtonian drop-down collision. Today, I will just talk some preliminary results using Viscalask effects in the simulations. In particular, we adopted the PTT and simple linear version in the constitutive equation. It's very important just to highlight the difference of two-phase and single-phase. We are in this scenario where our idea is. Where our idea is to solve it just in omega d, where is the domain of the droplets, and then we can reduce the CPU time in the memory requirement in comparison with two-phase methodology where we needed to solve equations in all parts of the domain. Okay, just this is the mathematical model and the formulation using. We are using a two-dimensional formulation. And then this is the PTT constitutive equation. It's important to mention that we have some additional non-dimensional parameters to analyze now, in particular the Weisenberg number described in this expression. Okay, to solve this moving interface problem, then we needed to include some boundary conditions. For us, we are using us we are using the the normal and tangential boundary conditions or normal stress condition given by these equations where gamma is the interface or they represent the interface of the drop. Another important point is the computation of the curvature in this type of boundary condition. I will mention some few slides about this. About this. One overview of the numerical discretization, we are using a finite difference schemes. The Navier-Sox equations and the boundary conditions are solved by one improved projection scheme for free surface in order to gain more stability. The constitutive equations are solved by a second-order Runjikuda, and we are adopting the mark and sell formulation in order to. Formulation in order to classify our cells in the domain. Just this one illustration in terms of fluid, the interface, and the empty represent the air or just when you don't have fluid in the cells. Just to summarize, we have these equations in this representation. Okay, in terms of single-phase free surface framework, we have Work: We have some important comments in terms of, for example, we are using marking cells or in marker particles using a connectivity to use these particles. The curvature and the normal vectors are obtained by using one approximation of the particles. Due to the nature of the front-track representation, it's important to implement a topological change algorithm. Implement the topological change algorithm. Okay. And then in this point, we use a rupture time just to specify when we needed to do this topological change in the interface. Okay, I will just comment quickly this part of the details of the schemes. We have some advection of the particles. We are using one representation by Representation by a parabola just to analyze better the local curvature in the cells. In terms of topological change, it's important to say that we are using a strategy proposed by Glenn and collaborators, where you can look for the coalescence and sometimes we have the breakup of the interface. Apparently, we have some, apparently, we have basically two. Apparently, we have basically two cases to treat it during the simulation: it's a merging and separation, and then I will skip the details about this, but it's important just to mention. Okay, and then this is the sketch of the problem. We prepare a computational geometry to solve this type of impact. First, we have validate our code using Newtonian droplet. Newtonian droplet collision and then basin the parameters are the parameters that we use we adopted from PAN and collaborators these just non-dimensional parameters in this table but look for the first simulation we can see a qualitative good agreement between the numerical and the experimental results in this case it's just for coalescence okay when you When you look for the bouncing case, is the parameters rain and rubber? And again, we are using a head-on impact and then B equals zero. Again, we can see a qualitative good agreement. Now we decided to analyze the outcomes using the Newtonian materials based in this paper from Audirayo and Bailey. We have the dimensional parameters in this table. Parameters in this table and the non-dimensional in the top table. This is the map, the region map proposed or published by the authors in terms of experimental results. Okay, then we have coalescence, bouncing coalescence, and separation. And in the right, we have our numerical results for Newtonian material. And note that we capture the outcome. Capture the outcomes similar to the experimental results. This is just some illustration or visualization comparing when you change the B, for example, B equals zero and B5, then we have a different type of outcomes. But it's very important to analyze the comparison between Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids. And then we start with the simulation. Then we start with the simulation using the PTT with Weisenberg equals five. Okay. And then in this case, we adopted the bouncing parameters in terms of Newtonian Newtonian fluid. And then we can observe in red the Newtonian results. And when you compare with the blue, we can observe some visual difference. Okay. And then we quantify this difference. This difference. I can show for okay. We quantify this difference just looking for the variation in the radials and the maximum radium of the droplet. Note that we observe more oscillation for the disco-scale droplets after the collision. Okay, the next comparison, then we use the coalescence case where it's possible to Where it's possible to observe some difference in the final shape of the droplet. Note that the maximum radial diameter for the visco-ASCII droplet is greater. It's important to note that for Newtonian material, we can see more effect of the surface tension, while for the viscoelastic, we can look for a reduction in terms of the effect. In terms of the effect when you increase it in Weisenberg, I think, okay, I will show for us in the next slide. Yes, because in order to quantify this difference, we analyze the energy dynamics in the simulation, then we have some definitions. It's important to look for the kinetic and the surface energy, and then we compare after during the simulation. Okay, yes. Okay, yes. Just some videos to summarize the information of after the coalescence and then the variation in the kinetic and the surface energy. The solid line I am using to represent the kinetic surface, while for the dashed line, is the surface. Okay. Note that in this case, the surface and kinetic energies are greater for the viscoelastic during the simulation. The next is the separation case. We analyze different parameters, in particular for B equal 0.5, and then we note some important difference in terms of qualitative difference. Qualitative difference. For example, we observe in the simulation that if you increase the Weisenberg number, then we can note more the creation of child droplets, like for example, this situation. Okay. Maybe I, oh yes, I have the video in terms of the energy dynamic just to show the difference after the creation of the subteleted droplets or charge. The subtelet droplets or child droplets. Finally, we analyze the main difference that we observe up to now. It's when you have a coalescence for Newtonian, while for viscous, we have the separation. Okay, and then note for this in the red, we have the droplet after the coalescence, the droplet continues to. Sense the droplet continues to stay altogether in terms of the final droplet, while for the viscous, we observe the separation after some times. And then I can show again this dynamic of the kinetic and the surface energy for Newtonians in the red, and this Kolaski is represented by blue curves. Okay. Okay. This is yes, this is the energy plot. And finally, we decided to include some preliminar or tentative regime map for a viscoelastic case. We have modified the Weisenberg number. And then note that, for example, in the left, we have the Newtonian regime map, while in the right we have the PTT regime. Right, we have the PTT with vice versa equal to three. The main difference up to now, up to this moment, is we observe in this part of the map when you increase the Weber number, or in other words, when you reduce the effects of the surface tension. And then we note that we have more separation cases for this. For viscoelastic fluid. The bouncing coalescence boundary regime is very similar when you compare the viscoelastic and the Newtonian. And then we are analyzing more details these results. Okay, yes, okay, good. I have some minutes just to comment on my final conclusions or final considerations. This is, it's important to say that. This is it's important to say that we this is the first attempt to analyze in terms of visco-elaska droplet collision because previous works just using a shear thinning model and then we decided to include more information in the numerical analysis. Of course, it's very important to include more investigation in terms of one improved criterion for quality safe. Criterion for qualescence and separation because we are using the front track scheme in a single phase framework. We have two options to include more physical insights, for example, energy models. It's a good strategy to include in our algorithm, or filmy drainage model. And then we are analyzing this type of methodology. It's very, very important to say for we needed a collaboration with some experimental groups because it's very important when we are looking for the outcomes to look the relation between the Weber and the Weisenberg or the Weber, the surface tension and the elasticity response of the material. Response of the material, and then we are hoping to create new collaborations in terms to compare our numerical results with experimental results. In this case, of course, today I just present 2D results, but it's important to construct one axiometric version. We are working now with this code just to analyze for b equals zero and then to. For B equals zero, and then to compare with some experimental results. And after this, we are planning to construct a 3D solver to deal with the coalescence and separation that is very hard from tracking skin, but we are thinking about the best strategy to do this. Finally, it's important to say that we are. Important to say that we are looking for different types of non-Newtonian models, for example, including more information about the rheology, like for example, plasticity effect. And then probably we can look this result using Elastoviscoplastic model. And then we are planning to construct this code for the next steps. Next steps. Okay, I think I have the time to open for questions. And then thank you very much for your attention. Muchisimas gracias for the organizers. Okay, good. Thank you, Cassio, for the nice talks and presentation. I think there are a number of questions here. Of questions here. The first one is from Syed is regarding effects of droplet size. Perhaps, Sayed, you might want to formulate a question more specifically yourself. Thank you, Marco. Nice presentation and very interesting results. So I have two questions, very quick ones. So are the droplets, I think they're of the same size, right? The ones that you have considered. Is there any difference in terms of the regime? Is there any difference in terms of the regimes if one droplet is much smaller than the other one? Is it like a dominant regime all the time? We just use the same diameter, but there are some papers using different diameters and then analyze this question. But at this moment, we use just the same diameter. Okay. Can I ask my second question, Marco? Or okay, very good. Marco, or okay, very quickly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you were you gave the um a time step in the list of the dimensionless numbers of the flow, but uh, I was wondering if the time step should affect the results. Otherwise, perhaps yeah, this is a very important question because we analyze the gradient independence and also analyze the influence of the time steps for these outcomes. Outcomes. Then our argo, the first tentative for our algorithm is just to use one fixed time step using a Newtonian simulation, just to avoid the influence of another computational details in the algorithm. Then we fixed the time step for all simulations, Newtonian and non-Newtonian. Very tall. Thank you very much. Oh, thank you. Okay, there is a question. Okay, there is a question from Tim Phillips. Perhaps, Tim, you want to. Yes, thank you, Marco, and thank you, Cassio, for a great talk. So, my question is about mass conservation after you perform the parabolic reconstruction of the interface as you track the front. Yes, high team. Then the front tracking scheme is very accurate in terms of mass conservation. Mass conservation. And then we have checked just using Newtonian materials. And apparently, we can maintain a good accuracy when you compare with the, for example, V of volume of fluid or level set schemes. But to be honest, we did not up to this moment analyze for viscoelasque after the, for example, the separation, because we have some fragmentation in the computational domain. And then we Computational domain, and then we needed to analyze in more detail to be more confident in terms of the correct mass conservation. It would be interesting to monitor that through the breakup and coalescence. Thank you. It's a very important comment about this validation for the code. Thank you. Okay. Okay, so we have also a question from Rekka Rao. question from Rekka Rao concerning the effects of air on the fix perhaps Rekka you want to ask the questions yes thank you for a very nice talk I was just wondering it looked like you were ignoring the air phase just to be more expedient does the air ever play a part in these coalescence events I have to assume they would be important the air phase is important at some point oh Reco record it's uh yes we we have just avoided the the the equation to solve the equations in the out of the domain but during the impact we have a thin film between the interface and then we now we analyze the influence of this thin film the formation of the the coalescence and then i don't know if i replied correctly for your question but Reply correctly for your question, but we have just the interest to analyze close to the point of the collision, not out of the droplet. Okay, thank you. Yeah, in fact, I think that maybe this is something that could play a role, the way in which you determine, for example, when you have a filament, the rupture from the thickness, it will depend on the resolution, depends on the numerical parameter that you choose to define when the rupture occur, for example. The rupture occurs, for example. In this case, I'm just wondering whether you do yes, we have the option to stretch the grid, to stretch the mesh close to the interface or the contact of the interface. But we avoided this because we would like to observe in different parts of the domain the formation of the child or satellite droplets, and then in the first. And then, in the first simulation, we fix a degree, but it's possible to improve the analysis looking for more detail close to the coalescence or separation. Okay, okay, good. Thank you, Cassio, for the nice talk and also for the answer. Okay, so we can move to the next speaker, who is Soran Norozi from Laval University. He will discuss viscolastic nanofiber formation through centrifugal spinning. Through centrifugal spinning method. So, hello? Hi. So, please share the screen and maybe Cassio, you need to stop sharing, perhaps? I am not sharing. Okay, no, wait, no, it's okay. Okay. Yeah, okay. Hi, Saran. Um, do you agree to be recorded? To be recorded, yes, yes. Thank you. Okay, can you see my guest? Yes, sir. Maybe just put in full screen mode. Is it okay? Well, it's not the full screen. It's okay. Now it's also you have the Windows double slide view because I have to we need to share and unshare another screen because this one is giving you the two slide view it's okay if there is a problem we can move on with that. I don't think there is any from the point of view of viewing the we can we can Of viewing, we can see it. Okay, okay, beautiful. Okay, hello, everyone, and thanks for having me here today. My presentation is about viscal acid nanofiber formation through centrifugal spinning methods. I'm working in Laval University in complex fellow research lab under said Mohammed Tabavi's supervision.
