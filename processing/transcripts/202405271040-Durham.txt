  I always drink way more than I usually do when I'm like wandering. I should know better about that. Okay, we're going to get started one question before Matt's talk. Tomorrow we're going to have some mentoring theme launch discussions. So the idea is that we're going to have some, break all of us up into groups sitting at different tables. Each table will have a theme and then each one senior person who wants to discuss that theme. Discuss that theme. And what we're looking for from you is ideas of themes. So, for example, we're sort of at all different ranges in our career. So, it might be things like finding jobs, job applications for postdocs, job applications for tenure track jobs, mentoring your first graduate student, things sort of of that nature, professional development. So, there's some paper where you pick up your schedules by the entrance to the courier here. Interest to the courier here. So, if you could just write any ideas you have down on a piece of paper and hand it to one of the organizers, our little bag that we were going to put them in got recycled, so we don't have a bag to put them in anymore. So just hand it to one of us, and then we'll talk more about it tomorrow. This is very informal, right? It's not meant to be any kind of high pressure. We just give a place for you to have discussions. The other thing is, like Jason mentioned before, that since the guided tour is canceled, we'll have a longer lunch, we're going to push everything back. Longer lunch. We're going to push everything fast, 10 minutes. But be sure to come back in the foyer where coffee is at 2 o'clock for the group photo. And then we'll do again this way. Okay. And so we have Matthew from the C Group Aside, and they're going to talk about Aboriginal cubicle possibilities. All right, so thanks to you organizers for the invitation and for organizing this. I think it probably took a couple years of work, or maybe not constant work, but two years of planning. Not constant work, but two years of planning to do. I appreciate doing all of that. Yeah, so I'm going to talk about a few things, these cubicle approximations, which will be a discussion later today, and sort of variations on this, including the strengthening due to joint work with Jagaminsky and Alex Sisto. And here's the base theorem. Do the Bairstock Igmenset kill. Bearstock Higgins. Misspelled many names apparently. I think this is from 17. And there is sort of a course median version of footage from 18. And then I will plan to talk at the end about some refinement from my command sphere. And this is informal. And this isn't formal, so very formally, hyperbolic spaces are locally modeled by Ketzer complexes. So I will write down a more explicit theorem later. What do I literally mean? You take a finite set of points, you take the hierarchical hall of that finite set of points. That thing is quasi-askins. Finite set of points, that thing is quasi-isometric to Q-complex, or the quasi-medium quasi-isometric Q-complex, where the quality only depends on the number of points perhaps. And so you can think about, so maybe the philosophy here, or an analogy, you know, is that this is like having an atlas of turfs on a manifold. So I'm going to call any such thing, I'll call the cubical model theorem. And I will shorthand it by CMT. And if you can't read anything I'm writing, then bad handwriting. Bad handwriting. Okay, um so like the philosophy here is that HHSs are complicated, q complexes are nicer. If we can take a problem in an HHS and export it to a Q complex where we have more tools, then we can prove some cool theorems. And this was a breakthrough result, and there were a bunch of breakthrough results that came after it. And I'm going to tell you about what some of those were. Still at the informal level, still. So, with Yair and Alex, we proved some sort of refinement of this in the context of colorable hierarchical HHS. I'll not be saying those words too many times. And this is sort of a slightly stronger version of this. So, we call it the stable architectural model theorem. This is with model. This is with notice in here. Still informal. And what we prove is we have sort of stability, also coherence for these cubicle models. And in this analogy, so the analogy for the first theorem was that. The analogy for the first theorem was that you have some complicated objects and you can sort of locally model it by some nice space, like you can with, say, a manifold with an atomic charts. And what we're providing here are sort of nice transition maps. And by nice, I mean they're sort of almost cupalisomorphic maps. And by almost And by an almost cupical isomorphism, I mean up to an additive error, leading valid eliminating hyperplanes. I'll talk about that. What I've decided to do in this talk, even though my abstract slide, is that I'm going to mainly just talk about this sort of construction. But I do want to talk about some applications. Yes. Can I? Yes. Phillility means like you approximate a couple points and you move them a little bit. Right, sorry. Things are kind of like the same, right? No, no, so there's the original theorem where you can take your finite set of points and you wiggle them a little bit. You get a different Q complex, and we show that the Q complexes are basically the same after deleting down the hyperplanes. This is about, say, you can add points to the Q complex, which may not have been related to the ones you started with. Related to the ones you started with. Or, I mean, literally, with transition line, you have two finite sets, you have some overlap for those finite sets. And the point is that you have a cubicle model for the finite set, the finite set, and the intersection. And all these things sort of are the same. All these things sort of, well, you have a convex embedding of the intersection into the two different components. Almost convex. Up to and out of it there. I will be very formal right now, I will tell you. Being very formal right now, I will tell you explicit statements about, I don't know how. So the main new application for this is that we can build new metrics on colorable HHSs. Let's just say this is water. So this is a very broad but indeed restricted classified general work. Strictly classified Jeremy Port, but includes mapping class groups and type molar spaces and all your favorite examples. So new metrics on, say, these HHSs. And Harry's going to tell you about this work with the dual, which they do some of the things we can do in a much, much nicer way. So I won't bore you with those. But the thing, the sort of new thing that we do is we build We build an asymptotically pet zero metric. So you can use these cubicle approximations to literally take your space and define any metric on it. And being asymptotically cut zero, this is a notion due to DT Carr in thesis from 2011. It says that there's some sublinear function which sort of controls some error, and the error that you want to control is. And the error that you want to control is the cat zero inequality on a triangle of geodesics, or in this case, almost geodesics. So any almost geodesic triangle satisfies the cat zero inequality up to some sublinear error in the diameter of the triangle. And what this allows you to do is employ with some definite work sort of cat zero type arguments. And what I will say. What I will say very quickly. So, Matt, these metrics are equivariantly QI'd to the original. Equivariantly QI to the original, thank you. Yes, you're just putting a new metric on the space and the groups that say the map has group prints and still acts by itself. Anytime you have a performance. Thank you. And what are some. So, with respect to this asymptotic we get zero metric, we have a contractible Ritz constant. We have a contractible Ritz complex. So, any of you may be familiar with Ritz's work. He says in a hyperbolic group, you can sort of just slightly thicken the space into a simplicial complex where you have two vertices in your, say, your graph, which is your group, adjoined by an edge if they satisfy a distance balance or some threshold. And you slightly thicken, say, your hyperbolic. Slightly thicken, say, your hyperbolic group, and then it becomes contractable. Just like a cat-zero space is contractable. And the point is, for this, we can do the same thing. And really, once you have an asymptotically cat zero metric, there's the theorem of Zarinsky that tells you that you get a contractible Ritz complex. We get some sort of what I'll call scare quotes, a visual type boundary. So you have, like in the cat zero space, you have the visual boundary points are geodesic rays. And two geodesic rays sort of are close in the topology if they stay close to each other for a long time. So here, instead of taking geodesic rays, we want to take equivalence classes of geodesic rays which stay sublinearly close. Oh, sorry, which stay sublinearly close forever. That's the equivalence class, and two such equivalence classes are. Two such equivalence classes are going to be close in the topology if they stay close for, sublinearly close for a long time. So, very sort of sublinear generalization here, different than the sublinear Morse boundary, but for sure. Boundary, which gives you I'm putting all the theorems in the corner, which is bound. Right, boundary, which, so it's compactification and is And it is a finite dimensional, so we can prove it has finite covering dimension Z boundary. And I won't have time to tell you what a Z boundary is, but what I will tell you is that this is sort of coming out of work of Basque and Mess, in which they show that hyperbolic groups satisfy this property, and what this property does is it has a boundary whose topology is linked to the alpha. Whose topology is linked to the algebra of the group itself, the algebraic topology of the group itself. So sort of formalized. And later in work with Bessmina, maybe I will continue with these applications discussion very quickly over here. So suggestively, here is maybe the main corollary of the fact that you have The main corollary of the fact that you have a Z boundary is that, for instance, I'm going to call it boundary V. This is not notation that we're using, but Hogs is probably grumpy about it, but that's okay. So if you have this sort of visual type boundary on the asymptotic and kitzero metric on the mapping class group, then the point is that the covering dimension of this boundary We prove it's finite, and it's equal to the cohomological dimension of Matt and Haz group plus or minus one, minus one. So it's sort of encode, the topology of this boundary, an easy boundary, is encoding the cohomological dimension of the group. And so whatever this boundary is, it's certainly encoding something intrinsic to the macro class. V C D? Oh, maybe with torsion. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Okay. Oh, and then the last thing, which I won't again spend much time talking about, is that many, one thing we show is that many HHGs satisfy Satisfy the Farrell-Jones conjecture. Okay, and the real, the point is that there's this breakthrough sort of structural result of Bartels and Basquina in which they developed a sort of axiomatic setup to prove it for the mapping class group. So we get this for the mapping class group. So we get this for the mapping class group. One reason you would care about it for the mapping class group is that this Farrell-Jones conjecture passes the subgroups. I'll tell you in a second how you might care about this theorem. It passes the subgroups, and so you get it for surplus bundles. What the Farrell-Jones conjecture says is some sort of classification theorem for manifolds. And it says that if you have, for instance, here's an example theorem, if you have two aspherical closed n-manifolds or n is bigger than or equal to five, and you have, they have isomorphic fundamentals. And they have isomorphic fundamental groups, and that fundamental group satisfies this Ferrell-Jones conjecture, then the manifolds are homeomorphic. With some sort of classification theorem, how much algebraic information do I need to know in order to conclude that my manifold is? And again, there's some axiomatic setup, and the kinds of things you need to show is that you have some sort of nice Z. Sort of nice Z boundary and some sort of nice topological properties on your space with a compactification engine. You can make a zero boundary. You can always put a fetis itself with Metro. So one thing I will say about this boundary is that, unlike, say, the HHS boundary, the curve graph boundary is not embedded. Confined on the lines. So this metric is quasi-isometric to the original one and confined. To the original one, and you can find, say, it would be like Chris and Cosmos work. You can find type mortgage, let's say, for example, that have the same limit in the curve graph boundary, but separated. All right, that's all I'm going to say about any of that. And this is an HHS conference. I mean, part of the point about this is that, like, there are no HHSs involved in it. There are no HHSs involved in any of this basically at all using these techniques. Boundaries for the math? That's not one of the analytical boundaries. That was the thing I just described before. You have this different metric, and you have, which is like sublinearly cat zero, and you have sublinear asymptotic classes. Yes. We don't know what it is. We don't know what it is. Yeah, I don't think we have. We know it's, for instance, it's not the HIGJS buffer. And it's, I would imagine that it's very much not, for that reason, YML for techno space, I would guess. Yeah, no, there's definitely two points for the number of technology. Yeah, definitely not the boundary technology. Oh, right, that too. There you go. Thank you. There you go, thank you. Longer than I thought it would. All right, so the other theorem that I'm not going to talk about, but I'm going to talk about the machinery and some that's used to prove it, in part because the machinery that's used to prove it is used to prove the theorem that I conveniently just erased. Just a race is a theorem about the HHS boundary. What it says is that, so there's other things to be said here, but one sort of upshot of point I do. So the original theorem, stable cupulation theorem. Theorem, the stable cupulation theorem which used to be here, sorry, the cupulation theorem which used to be here, which is that take a finite piece, say the mapping class group, take its convex hall, that thing is quasi-isymmetric to the Q complex. This is going to be about saying we take a finite collection of pieces of the HHS boundary and look at its hall, that thing is quasi-isometric to the Q complex. And what's more, you can describe the boundary at infinity using cubical patterns. So any finite Any finite collection of simple C's. So HHS bounds with the simplical complex, simple C's and the HHS boundary of proper HHS. I should say the whole, all of, and you find I can. All of, and you find a collection of simple C's in the HHS boundary of a proper HHS. It's uniformly approximated by a cat zero Q complex. And what's more, the simplicial boundary of the Q complex So it is isomorphic to the HHS module, to the simplicies, to this piece of the HHS module. So let me say this out loud again. You take a finite collection of simplicies in this simplicial complex which sort of lives at the boundary at infinity. You take the convex hull, maybe you need to fix a base point. You take the convex hull at that base point and you find out how many simplicies. That base point, and we find out how many simplicies. And there's some cube complex which approximates that hall. What's more, there's this map between the cube complex and the hall, and this extends to a simplicial isomorphism from the simplicial boundary of the cube complex to the piece of the HHS boundary that you're trying to model on. And what I should say is that when Alex and Mark and I define the HHS boundary, The HHS boundary, one of the theorems we proved is that if you have a cubical HHS, so an HHS which is already a Q complex, then you get a global simplicial isomorphism between the simplicial boundary of that Q complex and the HHS boundary. And the point is that this is a local regional boundary. So not only, maybe the upshot here is not only are like finite interior pieces of an HHS all locally modeled by Q complexes, but so also a method as well. Maybe the last thing I'll say that I write down is that there is this stabler accubulation theorem which said that I can take my finite pieces and sort of move them around and as long as I have overlap I can sort of coherently combine their cubicle approximations. There's a version of this that I'm working on as well. Hopefully someday I'll have time to write it down because I have things to do. We have to finish writing the original theorem. To finish writing the original theorem that I talked about, it'll be done in this summer. Okay. And the last thing I'm going to say is that both of these theorems, this keeping. I know. It's good. It's good. Is it recorded actually? The last thing I'll say is that these both sort of depend on this new version. Sort of depend on this new version of this cubicle model theorem. And I will try to talk about that, though my time is evaporating rapidly. But I want to say that you can take these cubicle models to be our sort of exact HH estimates. HHS with like the nicest it'll be able to say a possible HHS structure. And so if you've never thought about HHSs before, you're talking to someone who's never thought about HHSs before, probably the space that you cam in is Z pre-product Z squared, the tree of flats. This is like a really nice space. It has, you know, it's relatively hyperbolic, it's hierarchically hyperbolic. Hyperbolic, it's hierarchically hyperbolic. You can sort of describe all of the sort of basic constructions, visual boundaries, synchronous boundaries, all that very nicely. But it has, so globally, though, the HHS structure of this, every single hyperbolic space is a tree. You have like the tree that sort of tells you where all the flats are. Then you have a vertical and a horizontal line for each of the flats. And in the HTTP. And in the HHS structure, all of the relative projections are just like closest point projections to the relative thing. And so all the information in each of these trees corresponding to transverse domains or nested domains are all encoded in vertices of the trees. And the distance in this space is literally just, the L1 distance in this space is literally just the sum of the distances in these trees. So it's like the nicest possible HHS structure, and the point is that. HHS structure, and the point is that you can take these cubical models to be exactly that. So, not at a global level, but locally. So, every, they are Q complexes, but they're a fact like sort of HHS Q complexes where every hyperbolic space is just a tree. All the relative projections are vertices. And in fact, the way you build the Q complex is by realizing that the zero-consistent set is exactly the Q complex. Maybe I'll have time to talk about that later. We'll talk about that later. But the reason this is nice for these sorts of applications is that you really need to sort of get into the weeds to prove structural theorems like this. And having a very nice description of what the weeds looks like makes it possible. Alright, so I've been talking in generalities. Let's get a little more specific. Any questions before we go on? See any questions for anyone? So now I want to get into the part of the talk where I tell you about why a bunch of people have done using this stuff. Um let me remind you um Briefly, about Paul's Hess's. This is sort of due to Veristan, Kleiner, Mensky-Moscher, and the mapping class group case, and then Veristo-Sanfrancisto. This is 12, but only about 15 or something like that. Well, this is a publication date, and that's probably a preprint date. Okay, so for the first time, So, for the moment, I just want to take any set, any set of NHHS. So, like, what do you want to do is you want to, well, you have a bunch of hyperbolic spaces. You project it to each of the hyperbolic spaces, and you do something hyperbolic. So, a hierarchical hole. And what you do is you, for each, so this is supposed to be some math frac S thing. I don't know how to draw that in person, so I had to squiggle, swiggle, squiggle. So for each U, you just project down yourself. And this is now some set in that hypervolved space. Okay, so you're in a hyperbolic space. You can take the convex hull, that is all the geodesics that connect points on this set. One set, maybe HU of F should be the hull in Cu of this projection set. And then we can define And we can define the hall. I'm sort of fibbling about constants here. Of course, they're thresholds, but maybe I'll have a threshold. Hall F. What this should be, it should be all the points in your HHS so that if I look down in this hyperbolic space and I look where this point projects, it should be close to this hull. So, you know, I have some ambient object I projected downstairs. I sort of connect it up and get this quasi-convex thing. And then I just want to know which points in my space actually project close to them. And sort of my proposition, though, is that if you pick your threshold sufficiently large, sort of depending only on the structure, then Then this all is a median, quasi-median, or a median convex. What's median convex? We want to talk about median structure of an all and what's called hierarchically quasi-convex. And the point is not what is the definition here, the point is that there is a really nice notion of complexity. Nice notion of convexity, for which you, for instance, like once you have something that's hierarchically quantum convex, you have a notion of a gate map to that. So you have closest point projection, of course, closest point projection in your space, and lots of different sort of basic level techniques that you can develop using this. And really, the point about these holes is that they encode all the hierarchical information relevant to this set F. Relevant to this set F. For instance, for most hyperbolic spaces, probably, especially if you choose F to be a finite set, most of the diameters of the projection is down to these, so these spaces is bounded. So you can just ignore most of them. So most of the time, this is just some, the only place, the only set you have to care about is some sort of finite collection of things. And that will become relevant. So we can state the theorem. A theorem. Since we know what a whole is now. So the Cupal Model Theorem. Again, this is breakthrough result with Eric Stockhagman and Cisco, 2017. There's this median version, slightly more general, but using medians instead of the sort of realization and consistency perspective that they. And consistency perspective that they were, and then sort of a later version. And that is that, so for any finite set, and some HHS just an L. Your L depends on, say, the HHS structure and just the number of points in the set. And a vector Q complex, which I'll denote by CCC QF, and also a L quasimedian, L L quasi-symmetric embedding from this cube complex to this whole, which I will erase in many. Will erase all conveniently right. But here it's important that we're using finite sets. Absolutely essential that we're using a finite set here. Why does it mean it's called phi f from qf to x? So that you want to know, you want to know that like the hell scope distance or space between the image of it. Q complex and all. And for instance, it would also be nice to know that we have these finitely many points. They should be modeled in a reasonable way. So for every f in my finite set, there's some vertex in my cube complex. So that if I look at So that if I look at the distance between f and the image under this qi embedding of my vertex, this is less than L. And the other thing you can say is that QF is actually just the whole. And here I mean cubicle whole, the skew complex of the unions of union ideas. So you're literally getting a cube complex whose whole, which is the whole of these points, which are these vertices which are reasonably identified. So some basic facts. You'll just see these basic facts. So the fact that this, of course, I erased it. Brilliant. Okay, so one of the things that was probably right here was that this is a quasi-median embedding of this cube complex into this space. And I have all these nice points, for instance, that sort of coarsely map to the right place. So for instance, if I take my finite set to be two points, I have a cube complex whose models are tall, and I can take, say, a cat. It's hole, and I can take, say, a cat0 or a L1 geodesic, particular L1 geodesic, between those two points, and that maps into the space. The endpoints are near to the points I started with, and what's more, the median property is going to tell me that it's a hierarchy path. So really the point here is that this construction is so fundamental to what an HHS is, that I'm going to tell you about all these cool theorems that I and other people have proven. I and other people have proven show that. But so this basic fact, basic things you could do here. For instance, you can build hierarchy paths. Build hierarchy paths and prove the distance formula. So Hodish does this. So do I? I mean, they weren't first acting as a curse. They weren't interested. There's technical system could have, they weren't interested in doing that. Have you done it? True. The other thing is that each hyperplane is labeled by some element of, well, I'll just say the relevant set. So these are the set of all domains in my hierarchy. So that when I look at the projection. So that when I look at the projection of f downwards down to the set, it's bigger than some threshold k. It's just sufficiently large k, et cetera, et cetera. But each hyperplane in my Q complex is labeled by one of these. And what's more, two hyperplanes cross if and only if their labels are orthogonal. Planes HU and HV. HU and H V cross. So U and V are the labels. And U complex, if and only if U and V are orthogonal. Remember from an HHS, orthogonality is exactly given products. So one nice observation from this is that the dimension of this Q complex is bounded above by the complexity. Of this HHS. Another nice thing is that this is sort of crucial to the first theorem that I'm going to tell you about, is that cubicle products, cubicle product subspaces and Q, F, they map close to standard product, standard HHS. Product subspaces. For instance, something like a dangerous flat map. Okay. Can someone tell me how much time I have left while I twirl in a circle? Anyone think? 20 minutes? Okay. Let's see where we get it. I thought it might read. I thought about a way to control again. But anyway, too many times I'll get dizzy and then I'll fall over. As funny as that would be for all of you. Okay, so let's talk about, I've already talked about some sort of more later applications in the sense that a theorem from last year, some theorems that don't yet exist on the archive, this one. Is this one over a week or something like that? And the first one is the original reason that they proved the theorem, which is you can use it to prove the quasi-plus theorem. Or the quasi-class conjecture. So the quasi-plus conjecture says that if I have, especially nice HHS like the mapping class group, I take a top-dimensional dimension and control by the complexity, a top-dimensional quasi-isometric. A top-dimensional quasi-isometrically embedded copy of R to the N. And it'd be really nice to know that somehow whatever it's doing is related to these sort of standard hierarchical flats. So there's standard flats in an HHS, which are controlled by this orthogonality relation. And what the theorem says is that what the theorem says is that all of those are, that any top-dimensional fuzzy flat is in bounded house. Top-dimensional quasi-flat is in bounded Hausdorff distance from some standard union, a union of standard orthings, so some products of hierarchies. And Bodic, I should also say that Bodic has a different from a couple years later, which can someone confirm, does he use the cubable approximation form, his market here? He does. He does? Okay. He uses history. He does? Okay. He uses his version. His version. He says something stronger. Yeah, his sin says something stronger, but it will. Okay. So, what's another? So, I mean, basic fundamental thing. Where are the flats? Like, that's the thing you want to know. It's like a basic fundamental question about your space. So semi-hyperbolicity, the mapping class group. Get the mapping class group. And also, I'll say course injectivity. So Yair and Alex and I, and then Homaheto and Mimhoda and Harry Pettit simultaneously proved this using two very different constructions. Different constructions, but both of which depend on this people-cole model construction in a very strong way. So they proved this. This is how they show semi-hyperbolicities. They show this core subjectivity. Harry will tell you about this this afternoon. So later, we also get, who cares? Doesn't matter. And we get a different proof of it. Why doesn't it matter? Because you can build wall space. We go wall space. Wall spaces on HHSs. This is the loom and heading. And it kind of doesn't matter what we did. I mean, it was nice to have done it, and I'm really glad that we understand things. And I'll tell you about it. And the way that we did this, again, by controlling how the Q complex, you take your points and you sort of wiggle your points because we want to build paths that wiggle the end points. To build paths that if we wiggle the endpoints, this is sort of how it's travel. We'll spend time talking about some interpolicity, but Harry's going to tell you about this fantastic new construction of wall spaces on HHS. Abdul just gave a mini course at Riverside. It was fantastic. And if Harry's talk is half as nice as the proofs in this paper, it's going to be a great talk. All right. No pressure. I gave you a 50%. I gave you 50%, right? The proofs are so nice. They're just so, I mean, this is a really hard theorem. This is a really hard theorem. There are definitely hard parts of this, but it's like so nice. I was just like watching and Google is telling me that I hadn't understood, and now I understand. Other, so again, like you want to be able to know how to move through your space, right? You want to know where the flats are, you want to be able to know how to move through your space. Basic fundamental stuff. So, with Carolyn and Jason, another basic thing, seventeen, sixteen, something like that. Um What we did is we showed that you can build a sort of maximal HHS structure. So for instance, you could, we know now that, so like for instance, one can say is that the top level hyperbolic space in any sufficiently nice HHS, which is basically all of them, including every hyperbolic group, compose sort of all hyperbolic directions. Directions. They were also able to show this, use this fact to show that, in a recent paper with Jacob Russell, to show that the HHS boundaries has a sort of nice canonical topology. And again, this is like, you want to know where the hyperbolic stuff is in your space is, right? You want to be able to understand where it is, how it moves. And the way the cubical model theorem plays a role in here is that you have, maybe you have an HHS structure where some of the hyperbolic stuff is like. Just structure where some of the hyperbolic stuff is like buried down deep into the hierarchy. And what you want to do is you want to bring it up to the top. So you cut away all the other stuff and sort of stick all the hyperbolic pieces that you want into one space. And then you want to know it's hyperbolic. But actually showing that it has like thin triangles or something like that is really hard. So instead you just ma wave the magic one and you know that you're in a HHS without any orthogonality and therefore all your cubicle models are trees. And therefore you're in a hyperbolic space. And therefore, you're in a hyperbolic space. So I will say there's also this very nice study of sort of asymptotic cones that Mark is going to tell you about sometime later this week. Out sometime later this week. So MCG has a unique asymptotic colon up to by which it's homeomorphism. Super cool stuff. Definitely using this cup of hole approximation technology. And last thing I wanted to talk about is sort of along these lines. These lines and moving towards, let us work with Abdul. And what we showed is that you can use, so part of this theorem involves taking, you need to show that you have your top right quasi-flat, you need to somehow shove it into a cube complex. And you use some sort of ultra-limit argument and some ideas and photos to do that, technical, and you'd Just to do that, technical, and you could ask them about it. But we sort of took their ultra-limits idea to use these sort of infinite cubicle models. And this project was one of the reasons why I started thinking about that more complicated construction. Infinite cubical models for hierarchy rates, any finite collection of hierarchy rates. Finite collection of hierarchy rates. And like one of the upshots of this discussion was to get a characterization of this sublinear Morse property due to Yuan and Cosma, Julio, and HHSs. And I'm going to shove this theorem to the bottom. And so, like, here, what is the idea? You have the sublender. So, like, here, what is the idea? You have the subliminary Morse boundary state of the mapping class group emits a continuous injection into the boundary group. In fact, we get a new proof for the Morse bentony as well. But the point is, again, you want to know where your hyperbolic things are. And these cubicle models give you tools for studying those things. Like I said, I didn't say this, but obviously you want to know what it looks like, your space looks like when you took off on a rocket ship, right? Took off in a rocket ship, right? So I think that's what an asymptotic goes. The last thing I'll say I want to write it down is that Harry has this very nice proof that doesn't use the cubable model theorem that mapping cos groups are quasi-isometric to Q-complexes. You get a lot of stuff out of that, for instance, you get a bicombing, but you don't get an equivariant state. You can't equivariate have a geometric action of a mapping class q point q. Ten minutes. All right, we'll see what I can do. I'm going to try to tell you about the construction of these cubicle models, or do you want to hear about this sort of structural theorem with theory analysis? Someone say something. Someone say something. No, two different things. Maybe for me, I'll try to say something. So these symmetric constructions, I particularly want to go to these sort of new metric constructions. So the new metric constructions. And so the idea is that if I take two points and my HHS, I get this q complex, which models this fall of these two points. And so I could say, oh, I have, like, I don't know, the L2 metric, the L1 metric, the L affinity metric, LP metric, whatever you want. I have a bunch of metrics over here. And can I just. Over here, and can I just say that? I don't know, the distance, can I define like an LP metric between these two points on the space just and just set it equal to, I don't know, the LP metric on this two complex. Okay, I had these two, remember I had these two vertices that represent points. Can I just do this? Is this a metric? And the answer is no, because of the triangle I'm called. Triangle inequality. How do you prove the triangle inequality? Sure, I can do a reasonable thing for two points, but when I want to start talking about three points, do I have enough control over these cubicle models to know that I satisfy the triangle? And really, what you want is you want, you want, if I have three points now, what you really want is you want to know, you want like a common space where you You want a common space where you know for sure the triangle will move all over points. You can take a cubical model for these three points. And then, but the problem is that with the theorem, with the original theorem, is that these are all sort of like L, L quasi-isometric embeddings. So you end up getting a multiplicative term, which causes you trouble. And the theorem is that you can. Is that you can build a new construction so that you turn this into a one. And you get an additive error. And so now you know that you satisfy the triangle inequality, you have to do an additive error. What I'll do is I'll just tell you how we can, if Carolyn wants me to talk about the construction section. Or the discuss Well, I don't want to take over the discussion section. I don't want to take over the discussion section. With the boring seven motor cells. All right. So maybe I'll just say theorem, just make it clear with Linsky and Sisto is that an upgrade to 1L, making all of these maps 1LQN. All these maps, one lqin layers. So only up to the value of error. And what's the actual theorem? And we call it, I call it, Alex doesn't call it this, probably, the stabler cubulation theorem because we had a stable cubulation theorem. It's very deep reasonable. What does it say? It says that, so what do I want? I have two five. I have two finite sets of my HHS on the finite. So, what I want, I want another constant, what I'll depend on, the HHS constants, and then say just the number of points in the bigger set. For the smaller set, I mean, you need both. And cubicle models. So, what do I have? I have a cubicle model for F. A cubicle model for F. That's my bigger son. I have a cubicle model for little F. Okay, I really like to say that somehow these are related. Like, I can just, I can get a, I mean, magic wish, right? I can get a convex embedding of this Q complex into that complete, right? That's whatever it would like. Okay, well, both of these embed maps into the space, I have these quasi-median, quasi-isometric embeddings in here. And what I'm not done writing down the cubable models. I'm not done writing down the cubicle models that I have. I have two more cubicle models, QF prime 0 and QF0. And then I have a convex embedding. Okay, so there's purple. I'll say, so pink, these delete at most L hyperplanes. And purple, this is a convex button. So, oops, and there's of course maps in here. So, let me say this, this is going on here again. I'm trying to model some points in my space, in particular the hierarchical Halton points. I have, what do I want to do? Well, here I'm like, okay, well, I know what to do. Do? Well, here I'm like, okay, well, I know what to do for two points. Can I add a third and have it be sort of coherent so that I can prove the triangle? For instance, so I have a set, I have a bigger set that maybe adds some points, only finitely many. I can control everything up to the number of points. And I have this nice commutative diagram where I have, what do I want to do? All I need to do is delete, say, L hyperplanes from QF prime and L hyperplanes from QF. And L hyperplanes from QF. I get these two different Q complexes, and I get a convex embedding of this Q complex of that Q complex. What that tells me is that I get like an almost convex embedding of this one and that one just by following, all these maps have reverse maps, universe maps. So there's a up to an additive error. This Q complex sits inside of that Q complex is a convex subcomplex. My out of prime, same thing point. My other five seemed automatic. Five minutes. Five minutes? How well can you tell? I guess I can stop and then if someone wants to ask some questions. Oh, all right. What I want to say is that, so, wait, I don't want to stop because there's a corollary. Jesus. Okay. Okay. So, corollary is that these, so you want to, what you want to do, you want So, what you want to do, you want to define LP metrics between your pair of planes. What do you do? You take the 2-metric, or sorry, the Q metric on your cubicle model, and then you just add, I don't know, like 3L or something like that. And this says that this satisfies, since this without the 3L satisfies it up to an additive error, this definitely satisfies. Here, this definitely satisfies the triangle inequality. You might also have been worried about like two points that aren't the same having distance zero, but that also takes care of that distribution. And what's more, so corollary of this construction is that this, if I take my HHS with this, one of these key metrics. One of the Emetrics. This is quasi-isometric with, say, LL quasi-isometric to HHS with its original metric. But also, what's really nice as well is that if I take one of these cubicle models and I take the p-metric on it, this with this new metric, this is a one. This is a 1L quasi-isomer 3 embedding. And so, in particular, this says that these metrics are almost G plus. And the last thing I'll say is that, so I've told you that you can do this for any P. If you take P equals to, you take the sup metric, P equals zero, then you get, of course, the objective metric, but who cares? The proof is better. If you take the two metric, that's where you get the, take the L2 metric. That's where you get to take the L2 metric, that's the asymptotically countries. And the point is that you can embed everything inside of one triple of Q complexes, and then you have, but they're all, all the geodesics that you start with are like 1C quasi-geodes, and you convince yourself that a triangle of 1C quasi-geodes in a Katzero space satisfies the Katzero inequality up to a sublinear error diagonal. There's also this hyperbolic metric that you can build on it, but they Metric that you can build on it, but I think you can have a better proof. And I think that's colour, that's for colour alone. Oh, yes, thank you. Yeah, everything here is for, but as you said, you know. But as you said, you know, non-color right to justice are the thing that we said. So thank you, thank you. Yes. I should be using color more. Thank you. So in particular, it goes for the mapping class with the text number space. And you can build asymptotic and cat zero module. How difficult is it to show you that it's asymptotic in cat0 and should build this method? This theorem's hard. Whatever that theorem's hard on. It's very technical. And it uses the stuff for my long paper, and then also a bunch of, and the stuff from our original paper, this original stable, so that like we puts it all together. And if anyone's interested, sort of how those two papers fit together, I have an expository paper on my website that explains, in the case where you're just taking two points, the the basic case, how all these machines talk to each other. I really like the fact that the boundary you get is compact because, like, you know, you have an action-fg on injected matrix with properly equal boundary. It's not locally finite, so you should not expect to get like finite boundaries. You get a compact boundary. And like one thing you should probably do, you can maybe try to prove that Morse elements have strongly contracting axis and this like contractable space. And then you get rid of Puncher AC as the merges of the critical exponents, which. Emerges in the critical exponent, which leads you to give a nice potassium solar on the afternoon, which seems you. I have a question. Do you have? So you mentioned lots of nice applications as well, like the capital metric. Do you have applications for the P metric that you mentioned? No, not yet. So it's one channel. We're going to come back here at 1 o'clock. Yes, it stops starting lunch at 1.30. It stopped serving lunch at 1.30. You know what I'll start answering. I would think. Oh my god, I realized it's like a complicated one. That's right, that's Yeah, sure. That's right. That's right. Oh yeah, it's an accurate. Okay, was this enough?
