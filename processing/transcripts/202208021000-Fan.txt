Yes, please proceed. Thank you. Thank you very much for the invitation. It is very exciting to involve in this particular workshop. And Professor Venosa, this gave me a very good, insightful discussion of the machine learning application to various turbulence phenomenas. And I'd like to add to it: this is a mouthful title: the aspect of Title, the aspect relating to the particle. And I would like to, as a chemical engineer, to contribute to the conversation with respect to multi-physics, multi-scale, multi-phase, and also the multi-chemistry. Let's see. Okay, this is pretty much the sort of the guiding principle of. Or the guiding principle for my own many years of research. And if you look at microchemistry and, of course, microphysics involving the turbulence, which is very clearly discussed already in the keynote, because turbulent itself is a cluster of molecules to begin with, it's 80. And in terms of the particle, and then you will start to think of multi-scales and the molecules. And they have electrons, you have. Electrons, you have neutrons, protons, and so forth, and undergoing chemical reactions. And if you move from the multi-scale, either the chemistry or physics, in next scale, meso-scale would be dealing with the particle, the droplets, and the bubble. And then next one would be this re-axis. And they're talking about, you know, you have the coupling, the momentum transfers and the heat transfer, mass transfer. Transfers and the heat transfer, mass transfer. And obviously, it's equations to describe the reactor system that would be in the physics aspect of the flow. And then beyond that point, there would be this system where you essentially build a plane using your reactors to produce the product you want. And I put down below six different books which I was in my career authored and described each one of those areas. Know areas, and and uh, and if I can use uh this cursor to show, and this is the latest book I just want to introduce in case you are teaching uh dynamics of multi-phase flow. This is the title of this book published in 2021, Cambridge University Press. It is a textbook. It has examples, homework, and an instructor solution as well. But turbulence component is. Is small as compared to the other model phase systems. And then currently I use the principal gas solid flow, which is a textbook as well for teaching the particle technology. And then there are a couple of books dealing with the chemistries. So I wanted to just give a few examples here. In molecular scale, you can see the atoms, they have a cluster of atoms and how. Of atoms and how the reaction is taking place in terms of adsorption. So, you're looking at adsorption energies and then this cluster, the sizes, and really affect how strong the adsorption can take places. And then in a particle scale, and eventually you have enough large number of the molecules to build this particle. And the particle actually is the driver to really carry out as an engineer. Carry out as an engineer, you work on the particles. And if it is a bubbles, and you can see bubble, bubble wakes, and you know, this is a you know, the rising bubble and with the chemical reaction, bubble columns, slurry bubble columns, and so forth. And bubble rising in the liquid solid suspension where the wake is clearly shown here as mixing or induced bubble wakes and structures. And then you look at that reactor scale and the biggest. Look at that reactor scale and the bigger things, and you start to see, and they have a three-phase most complex ones. You see a vertical motion. Actually, you see the vortex, you see the downward flow of the gas and the bubbles and particles and so forth. It's very complex. But you need to understand this rectal scale of behavior in order to model the system. And this is a big, you know, one of the questions. Bigger, you know, one of the questions a moment ago was dealing with the industrial scale. And in fact, we work on an industrial scale. This is something I want to talk about in this particular presentation. And then cyst scale and how you capture the CO2 and how do you produce chemicals and you couple the reactor eventually become a cyst with produced product of practicing industry. Oh, sorry, and I want to use as a background information. The climate change is the background, and there are a lot of decarbonization activity going on right now. And it started with 2015, and this conferences of Paris essentially said the global temperature cannot exceed 1.5 degrees from the pre-industrial age. And that's, as a result, producing a lot of mission innovation groups worldwide. Innovation groups worldwide and want to solve those climate problems to meet that particular target. So you can see, you can see, I just point out a carbon capture is one of those. You have a sustainable sunlight, solar, clean energies, and so forth. And so one of the areas which is the most exciting has to do with CO2 capture from the air and from point source and so forth. And you can see many, many different techniques they use. See many, many different techniques they use, and one of the most exciting ones, which has been attempted for 120 years, has never been successful. It's called a chemical ruby. But I have a good news to share, and it is on the verge of commercialization. And I want to essentially talking about this machine learning and particle issues and drugs and attritions. And in the context of this particular technology, it's very relevant to what we do. So, Department of Energy. Promi Energy and has several of this earth shock initiative. One of the first one is hydrogen. You want to produce hydrogen because it's clean fuel, very clear, and then you burn hydrogen or using chemical, there's no carbon in it. And it said a goal was $1 per kilogram of the hydrogen to be produced. This is a very ambitious attempt. And I'm very happy to talk about chemical looping. About chemical looping is directly associated, and this is actually the way in the largest cigar production they project to be might be the only way can closely reaching this particular goal. And I'm sure this is really the effort from my research team over the last 30 years and coming from the material itself, which is talk about the multi-scale. Which is talk about the multi-scale things and understand how material is to be reacted to synthesized at the molecular levels, and they do the testings and the sub-pilot units and eventually pilot units. And so this is all the multi-scale multi-physics and the multi-phase assistance. And I add up our multi chemistry. So the power plan was demonstrated in 2015, completed. And then the next step we are doing is to commercialize. It is to commercialize. And this is a power plane scale. You can see everything I'm talking about is related to this kind of scale. And of course, and it has which has a method, a small scale and in a sub-pilot condition as well. And then you can see the heart units, and then you lay down the high-pressure vessel and compare to the coal model and the plastic columns, and they are just one-to-one in scale. So it is very important to understand the So, it is very important to understand the real reactor situation relative to the usual in the university setting, lab situation using essentially air, water, and then particles, sent particle to see the phenomena. But there's a reality, and then they are all connected eventually. And then this is another pilot plan, and this is one to do the combustions, and you do. To do the combustions, and you do the, for example, fossil fuel and the coal combustion is being tested successfully with our partner Welcock. And the previous one is to produce hydrogen. And it is just simply to say, and this technology is realistic in the sense is in the process of building a commercial plant. And by Babcock Walcock, our partner, we licensed the technology from Ohio State. So I wanted to put So, I wanted to put it in perspective. This is the system we're talking about: chemical ruby. You can see it's circulating fluidized bed, and the particle is moving around from fluidized bed combustor. And you have air, you have a gas going in and bubbling fluid bed, and you have a pneumatic conveying system and going in, and the particle is then separated from the cyclone with the gas going out, and the particle. Gas going out, and the particle is then coming down and in contact with the reacting gas. And then eventually, particle will go back to the fluidized bed, and then there's a circular system. And on the right-hand side, it is different here is your reactant is feeded in the co-current fashion. You can see feedstocks are going in in the same direction as a particle where this is counter-current, it's different. And so, what happened? Different. And so, what happened is, and you have a moving bed system here in a reducer, and you have food ice bed in a combustor. So, you can see this is really as complex as you can see in terms of various stock flow regime from the moving packed bed and to the pneumatic conveyance system and the fluidized bed in between. Okay, so this is the kind of system talking about a non-mechanical valving valve. So, everything is. valve invalve so everything is is non-mechanical non-mechanical valve you have a l valve your zone seal stem pipe and to control and solid flow at any rate you want to have it okay so i think it's important uh you know in terms of application let's say you have a methane coming in and uh being oxidized to co2 and then metal oxide is then reduced to a metal and then being oxidized back into the metal oxide Dies it back into the metal oxide and by air. So, in this particular case, CO2 separation using traditional arming techniques can be avoided. That's why this technique is so attractive. And because CO2 come out together with H2O, you just condense H2O, you have a CO2 coming out. Okay, and then in terms of these two major reactors, basically, you have the material, metal oxide, and then being reduced to metal, and then there was. Metal, and then they were circulated between these two different reactors and to carry out this particular chemical looping fundamental reactions. Okay. And then, you know, talking about this molecular scale and the meaning of this reaction, you look at the particle on the surface, it's molecular structures. And this is just simply, let's say, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, you know, CO2, and coming in contact with respect to the surface, and it will be activated. Respect to the surface and it will be activated. And density functional calculation needs to be taking place to understand the sorption energies and also deformation, the bond formation, electron transfer energy, and so forth. So those are the scale necessary to know in order to eventually calculate endothermic, ecothermic heat requirements at the particle or the reactor scale. And you see, a complexity is because you are having, you know, the I have a, you know, the atom is moving. So you can see that's metal oxide, let's say iron oxide, you have ustile, magnetile, and hematite, the structure is different. So each time you go to the reduction reaction, this goes this direction and oxidation reaction, the structure of the crystal change. As a consequence, you can imagine the particle will not be sustained to this particular shape, crystal tool. Particular shape, crystal, too long. So they would break. And that's the reason this technology has been attempted by so many research teams. It's for so long, was unable to keep the particle integrity, you know, be sustained and so forth. And unfortunately, we understand exactly how this iron is migrated. And for example, metal, you know, at a high temperature, you're talking about thousand degrees C, and the pressure could be mbi n to 30. Pressure could be ambient to 30 atmosphere. Under those conditions, particle is under enormous thermal stress. And of course, in addition to the shear stress, the particle encountered in shearing and shearing were causing basically attrition. So this is the first problem I will tackle and machine learning come into play, understand the full mechanics of the system and to do so. So basically, this is the system we just discussed. And you have the reducer and you have a combustor. Reducer, and you have a combustor, and this particle is circulating, and you can do the pressure measurement. You know, in a reactor, you can measure anywhere pressure measurement is automatic information. Okay. And then, you know, once you did this pressure measurement and you have all sorts of time variant information, so that basically, you know, pressure at any location, just give some idea. You know, this is a specific. Now, this is a specific modeling for the attrition. So, we wanted to monitor attrition. If the particle attrition into small particle, the minimum frequency velocity of the bed becomes lower. If a particle is very large, minimum fusion is very large. But if it's small and the minimum position velocity is low, that means if we're given velocity and that treated part. That treated particle will form a bubble, and because you have your velocity exceeds the manifestation already bubble, so we are monitoring the bubble formation. If there's a bubble formation, then that means there's a treason problem and you have to deal with it. And usually you just remove those fine particles and it goes through the operating schemes. So it is just simply to say pressure is directly related to the bubble. Related to the bubble or bubbling, so you can see the signal pressure fluctuations are different. I'm just show you, and that is the reason you monitor the pressure distribution of variation, you will be able to tell the bubble and then in turn attrition. So, this is a kind of things we do. So, what do we do is we'll train the data and we train the data. And I will talk to you about the deep machine learning model in a minute. And you train the data, and this is a You trend the data, and this is how many seconds this is. This is recurring neural network system, and time series data you're dealing with. You trend 8,000 seconds and follow, you know, the training data and follow by training data is supervised and then validation is unsupervised. You train, you know, you validate it for 700 some seconds and then you test it, you know, 2000 seconds, you do the test. Seconds you do the testing. And so this is basically an assembly at a sampling frequency 2000 hertz. Okay. And this is LSTM, the long-short-term memory model, which is conceived. And then given input variables, the time. And it contains the various pressure data, which is recorded. Data, which is recorded at many different locations, usually we have 10 different measurements. So you have those, you know, the data is input variables. And of course, this particular data is changing respect to time. And then LSTM units has the hidden states and that is treating this particular data and then passing on from this particular data. Passing on from this particular time segment to the next time segment, and also passing on to the same time segments into the hidden states and another hidden stage, which is called the pen state, and then give you the output results. So, output resulting essentially is zero and one. Zero means no bubble, and one meaning this bubble. So, you are under this condition, and so uh, and then the model itself, STM models, and in the next slide, I will talk about it. Next slide, I want to talk about this gate functions and to manipulate the data coming at a different time scale. And then this data is serving as output from this particular time and into the next time and so forth. Eventually, it will produce the output results. And then these are the gate functions, activation function in this manipulation of the data and so forth. And now, of course, there's a loss function and compared to actually And compare to actually you experimental measurements versus the predicted values, and that was decided, and how you modify or correct your model, LSTM model parameters. Okay, and this is the fundamental model and taking from Ola's work. So, LSTM, this is work out quite well. The sigma is 0, 1, the data come in. This is the time t minus 1. This is current time t. This is current time t. So, whatever the output coming from the time t minus one goes to the t condition. So, the signal will go to, you know, we call it a forgot, forgot a gate. So, either zero or one, you take the data, you don't take the data. So, this is an activation gate. And then what is very unique for this model here is it has another variable, which is a state variable. So, in the output and the state variable carry information as well. So, you have two, you know, Well, so you have two trends of the data processing. You can see, and this is basically what happened. And you have a gate at which a hyperbolic tangent, which is smoothing out the signal coming in. And then, you know, you add it or subtract it or multiply it. And eventually you will get it output result of this particular time into the next time t plus one output. And here you also pass down the state information. You know, information into the next time scale as well. So, this is a basic model. And, but the model is being trained. Of course, you don't trend in a model just based on the trend loss. This is you can see there are two sort of signals. One is a validation signal, the other one is a trend signal. And trend, we could be over trendy, keeping going down. But the validation is the one will tell you when to stop. So, when you start to see the loss calculated by the value. The loss calculated by the validation, which I mentioned it. You have a training, you have validation, your testing validation step, and it will be the one deciding when to stop, once you stop it, and you will take that particular variables and as your model. And I think this is the outcome, and it's quite interesting. And basically, you can see, and each one of the LSTM, the steps, and you have three different, well, you have a variable, and the first one. And the first one and our first unit is 128, data coming going in, and 64 and 32 with the output of just one. As you can see here, loss function is given. But I think it's the most important test result. You can see an accuracy based on whatever, you know, we call it true positive. You know, it's actually, you have a bubble and actually predict the bubble. And the true negative, you know, if there's no bubble, you predict no bubble. There's no bubble, you predict no bubble, and then compare to all the cases. And you can, this is your precise accuracy, and which is very, very high in terms of prediction. But a shortcut way, and I would call this record that I said as well. And what is it true, positive, and here is a false negative. So we think this is quite important. It's just like at home, you have an alarm. And if there's no file and it's no file, you. no file um you you know um you you predict the file and or if it and and and uh and versus if uh if there's a file you predict no file so your prediction is negative that means they actually has a file but but you predict negative that would be catastrophe that kill the people and then so we put this as one of the uh you know denominators to describe this accuracy so so even record you know you know a calculation Record calculation shows is a very decent prediction as well. So, this is LSDM, and we found it's quite a powerful way to decide this particular particle attrition property. I want to talk just very briefly because of the time, the drag force, this has been an area which we spend a lot of energy to talk about it. And so, and a particle, why is important? Because attrition, you know, you change the particle size and eventually. Particle size. And eventually, particle could be any size and any irregular shape. I'm not talking about just any small deviation from the spherical. It could be any ellipsoidal shapes or any shape. And I'm talking about, and this happened in any flu particle system, which you talk about. A lot of machine learning work has been carried out and more or less dealing with, you know, not too much deviate, you know, at least so low and it's very cool, a particle shape. So I wanted to just. So, I wanted to just first talk about, you know, how to characterize the shape, any shape, and we're using spherical harmonic methods. And it created spherical harmonic function, and which is the solution of the Laplace equations on the spherical coordinates. It represents smooth, you know, the displacement distribution on a Distribution on a spherical smooth surface. And because of this combination, you are able to produce any shapes. And so you can see here, and this is just like a very similar to Fourier transform for signal analysis, but this is for the shape. And then there are practical parameters you have to specify. And the one is roughness and elongation and flatness. So what you usually do, and you have the basic function, which you call the basis. Basic function, which you call the basis. And then once you define the roughness, and you are able to predict the coefficient. And then this coefficient gives you the magnitude of each one of those functions. And then the AI will give you the shapes. You can see this shape is totally irregular. And they can reproduce without issue. And I want to talk about this variational auto-encodes and once. Auto encodes and it was discussed in the previous presentation as well, and it produced the latent heat. So, what is happening? And we have many of the shape effects produced by these spherical harmonic methods. And we actually train the system using 2000 different shapes. And then it has its own particle coordinates. And then you go to the CNN convolutional neural network. Convolutional neural network is very similar to what's been discussed previously, and to recover the latent vector. And the latent vectors, which essentially is downgrade the dimensions of the signal and of the particles, which really come from the voxel, which is very large, most of the time we have 48 by 48 voxel. And then you add the Reynolds number and the flow conditions, and then followed by the multi-layer. By the multi-layer projectrons model, and to calculate the force functions, velocities, and the pressure. And from there, you predict drag forces in particular, which are interesting, lift the forces and the torque in a particles in multi-particle field. So this gives you some idea and how this scheme is configured. And we've been working extensively focused on these very irregular particles. On these very irregular particles. So, this is just, you know, the VAE, you know, basically scheme. You still have one skin and the CNN approaches. And we can see those dimensions given here and down to one dimensional vector. So basically, we started with this 40A by 48 by 48. By 48 by 48, and the CNN will come down to 128 by 1. And then you do the encoding and decoding process to reproduce this particular particle. You can see a little bit smooth, but it's serving a good purpose for this as well. So, this is unsupervised training. And in real situation, you can do the imaging. You can do the imaging to recover this particular vaccine and go through this model for the VAE CNN model and to calculate the latent vectors and use valid vectors to compute with this geometry and the drag force and other things. So, which is showing in the next slide. Okay, so you can see here and direct the numerical stimulation. And directly numerical simulation using particle results, direct numeric simulations, and we compute about 10,000 particles and various geometries and to come out with the torque and the lift forces, which has, you know, lift the forces, which correspond to drag forces and lift the forces and the drag forces. And you can see here, And you can see here, and pretty much, you know, the Reynolds number increases, the drag coefficient actually decreases. But you can see this roughness factors, if it's zero, that means it's phi. So you can see many of the particles with a D higher than the lower, you know, the higher D, you can see here, this corresponds to the D value, and your drag force is actually larger, which is a consistent, which is correct. Consistent, which is correct, and physically, and there's a lift of force, and there's a some scattering actually scattering is not that bad because you look at it, you know, look at the magnitude, which is in the log scales, and the torque as well. So, what happened is a spherical particle, and you don't have the lift, and you don't have a torque, but you know, it's irregular particle under the stable condition, and as there's no mechanism forces, you would have this kind of lift force and torque forces, you know, calculated. And torque forces calculated. And the single-party isolated prediction. So we have done the prediction, and there's the equations reported in the literatures, and this is for the sphericals and the solid particles. And we are able to use this equation to just to predict it. And for the situation, if it is not as irregular, and it's followed by ellipsoidal, and it can come up and compare with respect to. With respect to the variance type of situation with the roughness, you can see here in a direct numerical simulation, the roughness equals zero. That means you know spherical particle. And you can see the work calculation, and they are about the same, you know, completely produced. And the roughness is 0.25. You start to see increase of the direct forces and a direct numerical simulation and the neural network. Simulation and the neural network, and is in an artificial neural network is pretty consistent. And equation two, based on literature work, is a little bit lower. And so, we'll just simply say they are computing in parity plots, and they are pretty decent. And the particular drag force is the one we are looking for, and they can predict quite decent. And the individual particle flow field prediction, and I mentioned about, you know, once you get the latent vectors. The latent vectors, and you start to train the system under various flow conditions. And this is for single particle. And this is training using, you can use it in multi-layer projectile methods to calculate or to train the system for the drag forces. And using transpose convolutional neuron. Convolutional neural network to train the velocity and the pressure. And then this information comes from direct and numerical simulation. So you can see already the results output. You can see the output and calculation and directed numerical simulation versus the neural network. And they are very, very closely reproduced. And this is just repeated what I have just said, and they're using. Just said, and using transposed neural the convolutional neural network to produce produce velocity. So basically, you know, the latent vector has a dimension of 128, and but we add a Reynolds number to it, so 129, and you will produce the two-dimensional velocity and the pressure information at the 163. 63 and actually is a three-dimensional uh three-dimensional uh one to 160 by 160 160 uh you know the uh the the data uh output and uh and then for uh for both the velocity as pressures and uh for the uh for the drag forces uh the starter is 120a and then reynolds number one and the 129 and it will generate the six uh variables and the one-dimensional and that And the one-dimensional, and that is the drag forces and the lipid forces. And you have a diphther force in the y and z direction, and the torque in the x, y, z direction. So, six of them. So, that's the data we do. And this particular training, and we're using 10,000 particles to do that. And latent vector, as I said before, is 2,000 particles to produce. And then, so, and then based on that, we are able to train, you know, essentially used to calculate a multi-particle system based on the single particle. Particle system based on the single particle and the linear linear superposition model is being used. And there's a model equation given here. It's a quasi-steady forces, which is based on, let's say, whatever the particle within the computational domain, you average them, and then this quasi-steady forces, and then add the microscopic behavior due to the pressure and due to the velocity, and following this particular. This particular complex model predictions and the calculating. So, the idea here is: super imposition is always they have a three-particle, and you're using two-particle, and suppose you are looking for drag of the third particle, and you have velocity adding up, and using that velocity of pressure field, and substitute into this equation to calculate this particular and drag equation. So, you can see the final result here in neural network, and it's just a single particle compared to. It's just single particle compared to directly numerical simulation for multi-particle system off. But then, if you look at this linear, we call the linear shapar position, we call it pairwise interaction extended point particle approaches. And then this value, and it will drop to 1.38 compared to 1.4, which is directly numerical simulation. And a single particle directly numerical simulation and versus the single particle. And versus the single particle neural network, artificial network is just about the same. So we are quite happy with this particular approach. It's some of the correlation equations reported in the literature and to account for the multi-particle situation, it works quite well. And then, of course, the comparison, you have many, many more particle comparisons. You can see in a transpose convolution on your work, and you can see inside the flow field, they may not be totally identical. For example, the flow field is much stronger. For example, the flow field is much stronger here and it's less. So that is reflected in the overall comparison. We compare very wide respect on the CD and the CD large and the CD very small is and we concluded that and it's a clear linear superimposition method may not be the best sometimes for these extreme cases and non-linear effect of the effect need to be bringing in in the Effecting the people in addition just with the near system. So, so it's consistent in terms of the projection we have seen, and in general type of range of the drag forces, this prediction is still pretty decent. So I wanted to conclude by saying that the chemical looping technology for clean energy conversion system represents an important contemporary multi-phase, multi-scale, multi-fixed, and multi-chemistry system. Multi-fix and the multi-chemistry system deal with the reaction and the flow experimentation and MOP. And the machine learning model provides a viable approach to account for complexity phenomena as illustrated by prediction of the particle attrition and the drag force for irregular particles in the gas holy flow of the chemical looping system. And thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. Thank you, Professor Fann. Excellent talk. Thank you. Thank you. So we have a short break, but before that, we can take some quick questions from the audience over here. Yes, so let's start with Ricardo. Thank you for the very nice presentation. I'm wondering for the temporal predictions. You mentioned recurrent networks, LSTMs. Have you tried transformers for that? Can you repeat a question? Yeah, for the temple predictions. Yeah, for the temple predictions, besides the LSTMs, have you tried transformers? We in a STM system, and I think we take the system, we did not have a transformer, we take a segment and a discrete data. We're using discrete data and at a given delta t and each one of the time elements, and we do a transformer and then use that data directly in input to the next time segment. And input it to the next time segments. But in principle, if you have the time sequences, if you use the LSTM, you can also use a transformer network. That's right. We can do that too. But I think that we haven't done so. And we were looking into this in the future. Because we have tried in the context of turbulence, transformers work better than LSTMs in terms of the horizon of the predictions. And maybe for your problem, they could be suitable as well. Maybe. Okay, okay. I think I was very impressed with you using CAPRO several. When you're using a couple of several neural networks and interacting, this is kind of things we sort of gather from your talk, and we will look into that. I'm happy to discuss the usage of transformers if it's of interest. Okay, very, very good. I think this is actually an excellent approach. Thank you for the presentation. Thank you. Go ahead. Thank you for the presentation. So I have a question: if you have elongated particles, are your techniques? Are your techniques able to kind of capture if there's preferential alignment that would affect the drag? Or are those alignment issues something that would be encapsulated in the drag coefficients? Yeah, I think you see already roughness will tell you and the deviation from the spherical object. And then there are two more variables come into play. And one is elongation. Elongation and your Y and Z. And your Y and Z direction is still a cross-section area is a circular. And then, you know, and then you have this compressions will make it three-dimensional, Y and Z direction are different. So you need to have this particular elongation and the compression to configure all the internal configuration of this particular particle. This particular particle, so you need to have that, and another thing has to do with the theta, and uh, and you can see that we trend, and that you know, it's not just that uh picking up, you know, because it's not a sphere, so so the rotating theta is very important. So, we also trained the system with the different theta and uh into considerations. And and the theta, of course, you started with elongation and then when you started to look at the different theta and Get the different theta, and that will factor into that particular and direct force differences as well. And so, so elongation and a compaction is just one way to give additional freedom to construct this irregular shape of the particle in addition, just to have displacement variation from the surface. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Any more questions, or should we take a short break? Thank you, Professor Fan. Excellent talk. And hopefully in the next birth meeting, we'll see you all in person too. Okay. Okay, wonderful. And thank you very much for the invitation. Thank you. So we will take a short break and we'll resume at 11 a.m. U.S. Central Time. And the next talk would be by Damir Zurid. Okay. Bye.
