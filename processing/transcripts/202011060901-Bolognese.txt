All right, that's probably good. So, welcome back to the last day of our band conference. It's my pleasure to welcome Barbara Bolognese from Rome, who's going to tell us about a partial compactification of the Bridgeland Stability Manifold. Okay. Well, let me first obviously thank the organizers for. Obviously, thank the organizers for inviting me here. It is a great honor to be speaking at this conference. Had we been in Banff at this time, we would be surrounded by beautiful woods and deers, which would of course be very agreeable. But as I was saying, I guess we have to be thankful to technology for allowing us to do conferences, even at these times. Okay, so what I would like to talk about today is About today is this work. It's one of my recent constructions. And I will explain you the idea later on. But if I had to say what the idea is in two words, I would probably say that the bridge and unstability manifold actually often appears as the covering space of something which has holes of some kind. Of some kind. So we would like to fill in these holes in a meaningful way, where a meaningful way means both topologically and geometrically meaningful and also categorically meaningful. Okay, let me be a little bit more precise. So of course, I mean, I'll start with what my setup is. My setup is that I take a triangulated category. So I will be mostly thinking of Calabiao. Thinking of Calabiao categories. So, if you guys don't know it, a Calabiao category is just something whose serfunctor is just the end shift. But this is actually not a hypothesis. I mean, it's just that, you know, some of these phenomena that I'm going to describe occur more often in a Calabiao setting rather than in some other type of setting. Okay. So you can think, for instance, of the instance of the derive category of a smooth projective variety. If you're thinking of a Calabiao category, of course you're going to take the derive category of a Calabiao variety. Or if you want to work for instance in a more algebraic setting then if you take a quiver with potential there is something which is called the Ginsburg algebra attached to it and you can take the direct category of that. You know, you can take the dry category of that too. Okay, and this is also, you know, we will be mostly thinking of these two types of setup for what is to come. Okay, so I'm going to be working with bridgeland stability conditions. So I'm sorry to remind if you guys already know what they are, but in case somebody doesn't, let me remind very quickly what a stability condition is. So a stability condition is So, a stability condition is given equivalently as a pair of a central charge, which is a group homomorphism going from the grotendy group of my triangulated category to the complex numbers. And then again, equivalently, either by the heart of a bounded structure on my triangulated category or something which is called a slicing. So, what is a Call a slicing. So, what is a slicing? Well, morally, a slicing is a collection of a billion subcategories labeled by the reals, which basically contain semi-stable objects remembering their faces. So, you can think of it if you want, and if you don't know what it is, as something like a real-valued T structure, okay, because it kind of acts like this, right? So, every object in one of these kinds of In one of these categories, get sent to an array in the complex plane. And what I'm calling m is usually called its mass, and what I'm calling phi is usually called its phase. So there are some conditions. The first and the most important, which is probably going to be the main character of today, is the positivity, which says, well, I mean, it depends on which definition you're working on. I mean, it depends on which definition you're working, but it says that if you are an object in the heart of disease structure, then you get sent to the positive upper health plane, which is the thing that I'm drawing. So I'm taking the strict upper health plane, but I'm also including the negative real line. Or equivalently, if you are an object in one of these categories, then you get sent to the corresponding positive ray. To the corresponding positive range. So, in other words, I mean, you want this m, this number, to be a positive number, right? Plus, there is another condition which is basically a local finiteness condition, and it's called the support property, which I'm probably also going to be mentioning later on because I will need, let's say, an analog of that in my case. Okay, so what's good about stability conditions is that they actually have the structure. They actually have the structure of a complex manifold. Let me remind you in which way. So, if we consider the set of stability conditions of a triangulated category, this can be seen to have a natural distance function, which I am writing down not out of myself being mean, but because I actually, I mean, I will want it. I actually, I mean, I will want it later on because I will want to make an observation about it later on. But so, what it basically does is that it, you know, if I mean, it takes objects, it takes an object, and then it measures the difference between the phases with respect to the two stability conditions, and then it takes the log of the ratio of the mass. Okay. Okay, so the big theorem by Bridgeland. The big theorem by Bridgeland says that this, you know, that, you know, if you take the forgetful map, oh, of course, I mean, I didn't write what it does, but well, I mean, this goes from the stability, the set of stability conditions to the complex vector space of group homomorphisms from the Grothendieck group of the triangulated category to the complex plane. And I mean, it just takes a pair Z and P, and it forgets. And P, and it forgets P. I mean, it just sends it to this Z that I had over here, which is called the central charge. Okay? So something that I'm not saying in here is that I am assuming somehow that the growth-indic group of D has finite rank. And if it doesn't, I'm going to do something else. I mean, I'm usually going to factor through a quotient of it which has finite rank and only taking stability conditions that do factor through that. factor through that. Well, so the theorem is that this forgetful map is actually can be seen to be a local homeomorphism. Okay, so this set, well actually now this topological space, acquires the structure of a complex manifold. So why is this complex manifold of interest? Well actually for a number of reasons. I mean yeah first of all you know for all you know for instance if when d is the derived category of a um of a smooth projective variety i mean you know we are always looking for invariants of a smooth projective variety the derived category itself provides with one uh which is though a very fine invariant and it's actually i mean it's pretty complicated to study because i mean it has a very rich structure um then i mean of course the Then I mean of course the its lactis provides with another invariant which is very coarse though. It doesn't retain much information about it. But then you know somehow the stability manifold and even more importantly the stability manifold mod out its action its natural action by the outer equivalencies of the triangulated category are some Itself. Okay. Then it has a wall and chamber structure and some very interesting wall crossing phenomena. Well, I mean, there are people in this virtual room who knows much more than me about this. But basically, one can consider the moduli spaces of stable objects. stable object I think your internet connection is not you're frozen at least for me yeah I don't know if you can hear us we lost you Barbara we can't hear you we can't hear you and your image is frozen Can you reconnect? Hi, I'm sorry. You're back. Okay. Yeah, I'm back. Sorry, yeah, no problem. Okay. Okay, you were actually talking about the auto equivalence action, the action, this third bullet point when you started cutting out. Okay, yeah, I told you that this could happen. I'm sorry. I mean, my apologies. Let's stay stable until the end of the talk. Yeah, no, I was saying that, you know, these two, actually, stab and stub mod out, are somehow other two invariants. Somehow, other two invariants that one might consider studying of the smooth projective variety. Okay. So then the second reason is that it has a wool and chamber structure and there are some interesting wall crossing phenomena that happen. I mean, of course, I mean, there are people in the room who, in the virtual room, who know much more than me about this. But so basically, what happens is that one can consider One can consider moduli spaces of stable objects, and the stability manifold kind of behaves like a base space for that. So, one can see that usually when one moves on this base space and crosses one of the walls, then usually birationality phenomena happen between the corresponding moduli spaces. And I mean, of course, I mean, this allows us to study the birational geometry of moduli spaces, which is Geometry of moduli spaces, which is, I mean, of course, very, very interesting and important in algebraic geometry. And well, one, let's say that a third reason of interest is that the stability manifold seems to have somehow a mirror symmetric interpretation. So we know that the homological mirror symmetry conjecture predicts that if we take a Calabiao, then there should be an equivalent. Then there should be an equivalence of categories between the derived category of its Foucault category and the derived category of coherent sheaves of its mirror, x hat. So under this correspondence, there should be a correspondence of moduli spaces, which is the moduli space of complex structures on one side and something which is not very well defined at the moment, which is called the stringy color moduli space on X hat. On X hat. And yeah, I mean, the point is precisely that, you know, there doesn't seem to be a reasonable definition yet of the stringy color moduli space. But, you know, somehow one expects that the moduli space of complex structures on X embeds into a quotient of the stability manifold of the derived category of X hat. So this space over here or This space over here, or at least part of it, should actually be something like this ringy color moduli space. Okay, and what is the C action? So the C action is actually, so okay, so the C action is what you expect. So it's basically, so C for me actually goes into C star by the exponential map, and C star acts basically. And C star acts basically by rescaling the central charge. Okay, by sorry, by moving the central charge and moving the phases accordingly. Okay. So essentially, it's C star action, right? It's a C star action, yes, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, but then you can... Yes, it is. Not GL2R? Well, I mean, you can see C star inside GL2R, right? I mean, it acts again. I mean, it acts exactly like C star inside GL2R. But usually consider the universal covering called GL2R, no? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right. And this is exactly why I'm taking C rather than C star. So C sits inside this universal. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Does this answer your question, Sasha? Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, good question, of course. Okay, okay, okay, so let's talk about a couple of examples. So, in here, I'm trying to see a pattern in what the stability manifold looks like, which I am later on going to use to motivate my construction. So, if we consider, for instance, K3. instance K3 surfaces. So X to me is a projective K tree surface, of course. Well then I want to consider, you know, when I write stub of X, what I mean is stub of the derived category, bounded derived category of X. And there is a plus over here because what we don't know yet whether this is connected or not. And so we are just selecting a connected component that we A connected component that we know exists. Okay. So then what happens is that this connected component appears to be a covering space of something that I called P0 plus of X, which is, let's say, a nice open subset of the vector space that contains the central charges minus a collection of hyperplanes. Hyperplanes, okay, which are labeled actually. So, these deltas, I didn't write, but these deltas are spherical classes. Okay. So, this sub actually covers a, again, something like an open subset in a vector space minus a collection of hyperplanes. And the same actually happens for quivers, although, I mean, I know that it has been proved in some cases. I know that it's still, like, for instance, in the AN case, it has been proved. I know that it's still. Improved, I know that it's still a conjecture in other cases. But if one considers the category that I was talking about at the beginning, so the drive category of the Ginsburg category attached to the quiver, and one takes the stability manifold of it, then this also covers something like, so this is the Cartan algebra attached to the Lie algebra of the quiver. The regular part The regular part of it, then there is also an action of the Weyl group. The philosophy is kind of the same, right? So this covers something like an affine space minus a collection of hyperplanes. And what is n in dn of q? n is whatever you want it to be. So you can, so as I was saying at the beginning, whenever you Saying at the beginning, whenever you have a quiver with potential, you can attach the n Calabiao category to it, and you can choose n as whatever you want. I mean, you can do this construction with any n. I mean, of course, then people focus is more on the n equal to 3 case, but you can actually do this construction with any n. Okay. So again, yeah, so I mean, the thing that you get over here is an N Calabiao category. Yeah, I realize that using capital N here and something else above, yes. And I'm confused. What is W on the right side? Is this the potential? No, no, no. I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry. This is really bad. No, this is some kind of vial group. Okay, yeah. What is the vial group of aquiver? the whale group of equiver? So you can consider the okay, well so you can consider the path algebra of the quiver and then you can do I mean all the construction with Lie algebras and then there is a notion of a Weyl group in that case too. Don't ask me to Don't ask me to be more precise about it, but so QQ is not necessarily a dint requiver, it's an arbitrary requiver, is it? No, again, so as I'm saying, I mean, this thing, I mean, this is not being proved. I mean, yeah, I mean, I think that you have this thing for sure when Q is a dinking quiver. And then is the usual wild group. Yes, exactly. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I think you can do things even more in general, but I don't. Do things even more in general, but I don't know about it, honestly. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, so we are interested in all the cases when the stability manifold, or at least one of its connected components, is, well, I mean, as in these two cases, namely, the covering of a hyperplane complement of some kind. a hyperplane complement of some kind okay and why are we interesting in why are we interested in that because okay so usually like especially in these two cases but you know usually when when when this is the case it appears that the missing hyperplanes actually correspond to uh degenerate stability conditions namely stability conditions that fail positivity okay and failing positivity means that they they acquire a massless object so they're sent A massless object, so their central charge vanishes on something. I said on some spherical object because this is usually what happens. So, when you know, like, you know, these observations actually tell us that usually when the central charge vanishes, it vanishes on some spherical object. Okay. So, what do we want to do? We want to fill in the holes, namely, we want to fill in the missing hyperplanes. Of course, I mean. Hyperplanes. Of course, I mean, filling in the missing hyperplanes at the level of central charges is very easy because, I mean, again, we are living in a complex vector space. I mean, so there isn't, you know, especially like geometrically speaking, there isn't much to do. But then, I mean, of course, we want to see, we want to do it also at the level of stability conditions. Namely, we want to cook up a space which is reasonable, and I'm going to explain how reasonable later on. Which basically has something above those missing strata downstairs. Okay, so we basically, yes, so we want to find a partial compactification. I'm writing partial because I mean the object that we are gonna find at the end is not a compact object because I mean we are not we are not adding strata at infinity. We are adding strata of things that are missing inside the space. Okay, so we want a partial compactification which is also modular of course, namely Which is also modular, of course. Namely, we want to be able to say what kind of degenerate objects we have that appear above those missing strata. Okay. Is it going to contain something like large volume limit? No, no, actually not. I mean, again, I mean, no, I'm not interested in those types of degenerations. I'm interested in some other types of the generations, but not the large. But not the large volume limit. Okay. Okay. So, okay. So there are two ways that in which it is kind of reasonable to do that. One is from the categorical viewpoint, namely only thinking of what is reasonable as a candidate, the generate stability condition to appear upstairs. Upstairs. And then from a topological viewpoint, namely, again, I mean, at the end of the day, we still want to get a reasonable geometric object. Okay. So from a categorical viewpoint, well, I mean, the very natural idea would be to just pretty much mod out the locus where the central charge vanishes. Okay. So we consider this set over here that I'm calling G stub of D, which is the set of the stub of D which is the set of generalized stability conditions. So this is going to be the set of pairs of K and sigma where K is a thick subcategory of my triangulated category and sigma is a stability condition in the quotient of D mod K. Okay, you know of course that I mean when K is a thick subcategory when then it is possible to basically localize D with respect to K and still Respect to k and still obtain a triangulated category in here. So, I mean, it makes sense to consider the stability manifold of it. Okay. And we can kind of imagine, again, this K to be, and we will see this notion made more precise later on, to basically to contain the objects on which the central charges of, sorry, the masses of certain stability conditions vanish. Stability conditions vanish. Okay. So, of course, the stability manifold itself sits very nicely inside in here by just considering k equal to zero. So the zeroth subcategory. And I mean, we could have this as a candidate compactification, but you know, there are basically two problems. The first is that this set is way too big. So, of course, I mean, there is no reason in the world to expect that every triangle, every thick set. Uh, triangular every thick subcategory of D arises in this way, and uh, most importantly, uh, this does not appear to have any natural geometric structure, okay? I mean, I mean, I personally did not even manage to give it a topology directly, okay? Uh, so um, it completely fails us from the topological and geometrical viewpoint in general, okay. Okay, so from a topological viewpoint, instead, what would you like to do? So, you would like to see these degenerate stability conditions, sigma, so the stability conditions that acquire a massless object, as limits of sequences of regular stability conditions, right? I mean, you just imagine, you know, you're a nice sequence of stability conditions, and then I mean, at the limit, one of the masses becomes zero, okay? Becomes zero. Okay. The good thing is that, well, I mean, a nice, an interesting thing is that, so what one would like to do is take some sort of metric completion, right? But then, you know, the natural metric that one has on the stability manifold actually does not work because, I mean, if you look at it by, you know, this is By, you know, this is the natural distance. If one looks at this part of the distance, one sees that actually these points where one of the masses vanishes actually go to the infinity or push to the infinity in this metric. Okay. And they are not, I mean, inside the space as we would like to have instead. And I mean, what in fact is true is this result by Wolf is that, I mean, the stability manifold with its natural topology. With its natural topology, it is a complete metric space. Okay. So we have to, so we cannot use this metric. I mean, we cannot use this metric just because it does not do what we want it to do. Okay. So we would like to come up with a new metric. Possibly with a new metric which kind of mirrors what is happening at the level of central charges to the level of stability. To the level of stability conditions themselves. And this is exactly what we're trying to do. So, what do we do? I mean, this metric is per se something very simple. We can take any scalar product on this vector space, and we can consider its pullback Riemannian metric via the forgetful map, and then take the geodesic distance associated to it. Do you mean you consider it a? Do you mean you consider it as a real vector space and take yes exactly? Yeah, I'm taking a real scalar product. Yes, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry, I should have written it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So any real scalar product on this complex vector space, and then I take the pullback metric. Okay. And then I take the geodesic distance, and so I get another metric, and then I take the metric completion. Take the metric completion with respect to this new metric. Again, in the hope that it will mirror what's happening at the level of central charges, precisely because it's, again, it's a pullback metric. So also in here, what happens is that, of course, the stability manifold sits very nicely inside in here. I mean, of course, I mean, a space sits inside its metric completion. But, okay. So, we could also declare this one to be our partial compactification, but then, I mean, of course, by itself, the points that appear in this metric completion do not have any modular interpretation a priori, right? In the sense that I mean, we would not be able to characterize at all the stability cond like the degenerate stability conditions that appear in the new strata that we are adding. Okay. Strata that we are adding. Okay, so it would be very nice to relate these two constructions. And yeah, so this is, I mean, this is precisely the main result of this talk. And so this is basically that there, you know, one is actually able to construct a map between these two, which is actually an injective correspondence. I mean, just of sets. I mean, just because, I mean, this does not have any other structure. This is just a set. Structure: This is just a set going from this magic completion, actually, a big open set inside it. This is why there is a star in here, but I'll be more precise on this point later on, into the set of generalized stability conditions. And we take our partial compactification to be the image of this map. Okay, so let me tell you a little bit. Okay, so let me tell you a little bit about how it works, how one can do this, and then I will elaborate more on what I would like to do with it, hopefully. Okay, so how does it work? So, whenever I take an element in here, which is an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of stability conditions, I have to give you three elements. Conditions, I have to give you three elements, right? So I have to give you, first of all, a thick subcategory of D, of my triangulated category. Then I have to give you a central charge, and then I have to give you a slicing or the heart of a T structure, whatever you prefer, and then you're going to reconstruct the other using the central charge. Okay, so let's actually start with the thick subcategory. With the thick subcategory. Okay, and this comes from an observation by Aikida. So this observation is the following. If I consider, I take a Cauchy sequence of stability conditions, okay, and then I consider the subcategory of LM of objects of D such that if I take the masses. That if I take the masses with respect to the stability conditions in this Cauchy sequence and I take their limit, then this is zero. Okay? So this is exactly, I mean, the type of object that we were thinking of before. And well, I mean, this observation by Aikida actually lets us prove that this is actually a ethic subcategory of D. Okay. So, I mean, a priori, I would have this k. This K. The problem, though, that one has to fix right away is that this is not well defined on equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences. So if I change my Cauchy sequence in my equivalence class, nobody is going to tell me that the k of sigma n that I get is going to be the same. Okay, so how do we fix this? So I'm going to give you a definition. Definition, which is kind of key to the entirety of my construction. So, the definition that I'm going to give you is that of a pi-local Cauchy sequence. So, pi is again my forgetful map. So, a pi-local Cauchy sequence is basically a Cauchy sequence which is entirely contained in an open subset, which gets mapped homeomorphically onto its image by the forgetful morphism. By the forgetful morphism. Okay? So, what is the advantage of considering those objects? That you know, in this metric, it is very, very difficult to control the distances between the slicings of points in a Cauchy sequence, right? Well, I mean, in this way, I'm kind of fixing this problem because I'm forcing them to be close also with respect to the previous metric, to the natural metric. With respect to the previous metric, to the natural metric, right? And so I am also, I mean, I'm gaining some advantage that allows me to actually control the distance between their slicings as well. Okay. So what are the properties that one has to, that one can show? The first is that actually, the very nice thing is that every Cauchy sequence actually has a bilocal representative. So I can just work with bi local representatives and forget everything else. And forget everything else. And then, so if I take any true pilocal equivalent Cauchy sequences, then the thick subcategories that they give rise to are equivalent. Okay, so this definition works well as long as I work on pilocal Cauchy sequences. Okay, so yeah, of course, I mean, the thing, so I need. So, I need some hypothesis for this. This does not come for free. And the hypothesis that I need is that, oh, yeah, I didn't write it here. I think I missed the most important thing. So the hypothesis that I need in here is that actually pi has to be a covering space. It cannot just be a local homeomorphism. And the image of pi inside this vector space actually has to look like something like, yeah, Like something like, yeah, a locally finite hyperplane arrangement. Do you mean a complement of a finite hyperplane? Oh, I'm sorry, yeah, yeah, of course I do, yeah. The complement of a locally finite hyperplane arrangement. I'm sorry, yeah, agree. Yes, okay. Actually, I mean, I can get away with some more general setup, but it almost never occurs. Almost never occurs, and I mean, this is actually the case that I want to have in mind in any case. So, the case of a locally finite hyperplane complement. Okay. And again, I mean, I need pi to be a covering map. I mean, it cannot just be a local homeomorphism. But again, I mean, I have it in a few cases of great interest. And so, I mean, for me, for the moment, it is pretty much enough. So, okay. So, okay. Okay, fine. So I have given you your k. Then I have to give you a stability condition on the quotient of d mod k. So I have to give you a central charge and then a slicing. So the central charge is pretty much the only easy thing in the picture. So what one wants to do is just to take the limit of the central charges in The central charges in this vector space. And okay, so then there is an exact sequence of Grotendi groups that basically allows us to induce a central charge on the quotient triangulated category as well. Okay, so this basically, I mean, it does exactly what we want it to do. So it basically mods out the object whose mass costs. The object whose mass goes to zero. Okay, and so we get a proper central charge. Okay, fine. Okay, so then I have to give you a slicing, all right? So for that, I actually need an additional hypothesis, which gives me the star in my map, in the way I defined my map before, which is called the limiting support property. Limiting support property. So, this is this basically ensures that the support property that, oh, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening in here. Okay. Can you see my screen, my presentation again? Yeah, okay, cool. Lovely. Okay. So, where was I? Uh-huh. Okay, I was here. Okay, yeah, I was telling you about this limiting support property. So, the limiting support property is something that basically ensures that the support property that stability conditions have still carries out at the limit. Okay, so the support property basically tells us that, so we want. So, we want the semi-stable objects to lie outside of some big circle, let's say. Then, okay, so we want these, you know, one can take the inf of precisely of these things and then take the limit. And we also want the limit to be greater than zero. So, we also want that our limiting, let's say, our limiting central charge has this property. Has this property. Okay. So, okay. Fine. Okay. So then when this is the case, then one can show that if we take this pi infinity of phi, so pi infinity of phi, I define it to be the set of objects in the triangulated category whose faces with respect to Phases with respect to the stability conditions in my Cauchy sequence tend precisely to phi, this is actually a slicing. Not only it is a slicing, but the cool thing is that it can actually be descended to a slicing, which I'm calling pi infinity bar on the quotient category. Okay, so I don't know how to do this directly. This directly, but what I do instead is: I mean, I consider the natural heart I associate it to this slicing. Then, you know, I show that actually I can descend this heart to the quotient. And then, again, since I can also descend the central charge, I reconstruct the slicing in this way. Okay, and so I also have a slicing in the In the quotient category. Okay. Okay. So then I have my three pieces. Of course, I mean, something that I also didn't write down is that, I mean, of course, one shows that there are all the possible compatibilities that you can think of, namely that Z infinity bar and P infinity bar actually make a stability condition on the quotient category. Portion category. Okay. Something that I didn't say as well in here is that I mean, this also has to be done by taking a pilocal representative. But I mean, of course, again, it's not a problem because, I mean, every Cauchy sequence has one. Okay. So, examples. Well, I mean, of course, I mean, there is a stupid She's frozen again. Barbara, can you try reconnecting again? Sorry, we lost you. I don't know if you can hear us. Welcome back. Your audio is still off. Okay, I'm back. Okay, fine. Sorry. Hopefully, it's not going to happen again. Okay. Okay. Yeah, the internet connection of my math department these days is just not working properly. Too many people doing this at the same time, I guess. Okay, so where did you get to? I don't remember. I started talking about the first example. Okay, yeah, yeah. So I was just saying that this is a stupid example. Stupid example. So, yeah, I mean, the stupid example is just, yeah, the derived category of a point. So, in here, the stability manifold is just the universal cover of C star over C star. C star, I mean, of course, is the image of the forgetful map, which is most definitely locally finite hyperplane complement. Then the set of generalized stability conditions. Set of generalized stability conditions is just you know the set of regular stability conditions plus i mean zero okay the stability condition on the zero category which is zero and i mean if one actually does this const this construction and constructs this new metric and looks at the metric completion then i mean it is exactly what it should be namely i mean one adds exactly one point at the beginning you know in in the middle of this uh this big spiral given by the expression This big spiral given by the exponential, which is the forgetful map in this case. Okay, so I should probably have drawn a picture for this, but I thought it was trivial and so I didn't do it. But so yeah, I mean, of course, I mean, even if you think about it, like, I mean, the only way a stability condition on this very simple category can degenerate is by just sending everything to zero, okay? Everything to zero. Okay, so it is reasonable that one actually only has one point in the stability manifold. Okay, so okay. Then I mean right now I'm working on K3 surfaces, K3 surfaces of Pica rank one. This is still very much in progress, so I don't claim to have these results. Have these results, and in particular, I don't claim to have these results written down. But so, what I expect and what I conjecture to happen is a bunch of things that could possibly give us a couple, you know, that could give us some more information about the way this construction should work in a manageable example. So, what I think is that the image of my map. Image of my map of this J is actually given by all the pairs where the thick subcategory is just the thick envelope of a spherical object. So what I only get is a thick subcategories generated by a single spherical object. So then in this case, I expect my map J to be actually one-to-one onto its image. To its image. Okay. So then, okay, what is the local model? This is another thing that one would, of course, like to understand. I mean, what kind of points lie above the locals that I'm adding downstairs? What do they look like and what do they behave like? So, you know, what I expect is that above every Is that above every point in the boundary component, we have many copies of, you know, locally, we see many copies of, you know, the universal cover of C star over C and as many as the spherical objects that I have minus the spherical objects where I'm lying in the special locus. So, something else that one expects is that Else that one expects is that, well, I mean, okay, so in here, I have an action by, oh, this should be a pi 1, by the fundamental group of this pi 0 plus of x. And on the other side, I mean, it is very easy to see that one has an action of the outer equivalencies of the triangulated category that one can also extend to the other strata. And actually, these two actions should correspond via this map J. And I also expect this action to be transitive on special fibers. And so, I mean, if I take the quotient, then this should actually be what I see, what I have downstairs, plus these special strata added. And then another example, so this is even more work in progress in the sense that I mean, it is just an intuition, but I'm thinking about it right now, is what would happen, what Right now, is what happens with the moduli space of project differentials. So it happens that in some special cases, if one has a Riemann surface with a set of marked points, so then there is a way to construct a triangulation and then a quiver attached to it. And one can consider the stability manifold of it. So then this should be related. So then this should be related to some moduli space of quadratic differentials on this Mark-Triemann surface. You know, but these quadratic differentials have the hypothesis that they have simple zeros. And this is pretty, you know, this disappears from the construction. And, you know, the idea is that actually, I mean, what one expects is that this, you know, with this partial compactification should actually remove the hypothesis of having simple zeros. Of having simple zeros. And I mean, this has some importance, I mean, apparently in physics when physics is related to stability manifolds. Okay, and I think I am two minutes early, but I am done. So thank you very much for your attention. Okay, let's thank Barbara for a very nice talk. Questions? So I was kind of wondering, so like you talked about the stringy KLAR moduli space interpretation at the start. What is the interpretation of like this partial compactification in terms of? Oh, I have no idea, and I would dearly like to know. I mean, of course, I mean, this would be very interesting. I mean, of course, I mean, this would be very interesting, and it would would probably be the direction in which I go first after looking at what happens in a couple of more meaningful examples. But yeah, I mean, it's, I mean, of course, it's a very interesting question. And again, I would very much like to know that. So. Okay, and does this metric also have some kind of interpretation from like the metric that you wrote down? So, I mean, at some point, you wrote down a different metric, right? Point wrote down a different metric, right? From the one that yes, exactly, yeah, which is the metric that I'm using throughout this construction. Not really, I mean, not that I know of. Again, I mean, I'm using this metric precisely because it does exactly what I want it to do. And also because, yeah, again, I mean, people usually, I mean, people tend not to use the natural metric very much. And so, I mean, I didn't feel too guilty changing the metric, but yeah. Changing the metric. But yeah, I don't know if it has any interpretation in those terms. Okay, yeah, thanks. All right. So when you do this partial compactification, what's the relationship then with the stringy Taylor moduli space or the space of complex structures on it? Yeah, again, I mean, this is the same thing that Nathan asked, I think. This is the same thing that Nitin asked, I think. Yeah, I don't know. I would very much like to know. It is, yeah, I mean, I think it is probably the most interesting question in this thing. I don't know. I mean, I haven't thought about it yet, but I mean, of course, this is probably the first direction in which I go once I get the hang of what's going to happen in that case as well, if I ever get the hang of what's going to happen. Well, if I ever get the hang of what's going to happen in that case. Any other questions? Okay, if not, let's thank Barbara for a very nice talk again. And in nine minutes.
