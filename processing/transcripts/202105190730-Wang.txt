Okay, so our next speaker is Professor Xiodan Wang from the Michigan State University, and he will speak about improved Sobolef inequality under constraints on the sphere. Thank you very much, please. Okay, thank you. Thanks for the introduction. I want to thank the organizers for the invitation. For the invitation. So, I'll talk about recent joint work with Feng Bo Hang on improved subliophene quality and the constraints on the sphere. So, I wrote my slides by hand. I hope you can read my handwriting. Well, actually, it's kind of awkward. I don't know how to turn pages with one note. Okay, so first, let me explain the background and motivation for our. Motivation of our work. Singular set is dense. Okay, so the sublime of inequality with the sharp constant is a fundamental result. So on our n, p is bigger than one and less than n, we denote n p over. We denote np over n minus p by p star. So we know that for any function u on Rn, the L P star norm of U can be bounded by a constant times the L P norm of gradient U. And the base constant is given by this expression. Okay, it's kind of complicated. Moreover, equality holds. Moreover, equality holds if and only if u is of this form. So it's plus or minus a plus b and times the norm of x minus x0 to p over p minus 1 and then the whole expression to p minus n over p for some positive constants a and b and some point x0 in Rn. So the inequality for some with For some with some constant S, of course, is the classic work of Soblov. I think it dates to maybe 1940s, I'm not sure. But the base constant and the extremal functions were only determined by Orban Talenti independently in 1976. Okay, and then on any closed manifold, Oban showed that for any positive epsilon, you can bound the Lp star norm of U to the pth power by S to the P plus epsilon. So S is that sharp constant. And then times the L P norm of gradient u to the pth. The Lp norm of gradient u to the pth power and plus some constant c which depends on epsilon and then times the L P norm of u to the pth power. So in some sense it says that on any closed manifold you can do almost as well as on the model space. So it's just S to the P plus some epsilon. But in many problems But in many problems, you want to know if you can find a better constant, right? A smaller constant. So it's actually related to coerciveness of a certain function or compactness. For example, in the Yamabi problem, right? So you or in the problem of prescribing scalar curvature on the sphere. So if you have some geometric information. Well, if you have some geometric information on the manifold, yes, oftentimes you can show that you have a smaller constants. And on Sn, Oban proved another result. So if the function u satisfies some moment zero condition or the center of mass of this. of this power u absolute value of u to the p star equals zero okay so x i just the coordinate functions i from one to n plus one and then uh indeed you can improve the constants so here we have an extra factor two to the power negative p over n so so you lower the the constant so if if this condition is satisfied so this is Condition is satisfied. So, this is a center of mass equal zero condition. And this is, I think, it was motivated probably by the prescribing scalar curvature problem. And in fact, this inequality was used by Professor Chan and Professor Yang in their work on prescribing scalar curvature. So, this lower constant restores coerciveness for functions satisfying this constraint. This constraint, and then you can minimize. Yeah, so then, of course, you still have to deal with the Lagrange multipliers from the constraint. But that's another question. Okay, so yeah, so how you can find a better constant, or what's the best constant in front of the gradient term is an interesting problem. So our work is kind of a new approach to OBEN's result. And moreover, this new strategy actually yields generalizations for higher moments. Before I discuss our results, let me first mention that prior to our work, the classical, the critical case. Classical, no, the critical case when p equals n was studied first in dimension 2 by Professor Chan and Yang, by Professor Chan and Feng Bu in 2019. And then for dimension N bigger than 2, and also a higher order case studied by Fengbe himself. So the new strategy was introduced in the paper of Chang Ai Hai. In the paper of Changnai Han. So, roughly speaking, it's a proof by contradiction using the principle of concentration compactness. But in the critical case, so Chang and Hang had to, I mean, they had to understand the concentration compactness much deeper. Deeper. So, this is a very beautiful work. So, our work is inspired by these two previous works. So, in the critical case, in the limit, you get a measure which is supported on finite and many points. And so, you want to minimize the number of points. So, in the case I'm going to talk about, in the limit, we get a measure which is supported on A measure which is supported on countably many points, then we have to minimize a certain weighted total mass. So it's kind of a different extremal problem. I think it has some interest. So now let me explain our results. Okay, so we fix a positive integer m, so that's going to So that's going to be the degree. So let Pm be the space of all polynomials on Rn plus 1 with degree at most m. And then Pm circle, it just consists of all those with mean value 0. So mu is always the economic measure on the sphere. So actually we can write this as the direct sum of lambda. the direct sum of lambda d, say. Lambda d is just the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree d. And it's also the kind of the eigenspace, right? Lambda D corresponds to the eigenspace, it's dm plus d minus one. Yeah, so this is restrict to Rn, to Sn. R n to S n, it's also the eigen space with eigenvalue lambda d. And then we consider this space of probability measures on Sn. So it consists of all probability measures null supported on countably many points such that the integral of f with respect to null is zero for all f in this space PM circle. Circle. So in other words, null is a measure with moments zero up to degree m. Okay, so you can say like that. So when m equals one, it's the center of mass equals zero or moment to one condition considered by O band. So this is the space The space MCM on Sn. And then so for any theta between 0 and 1, we can consider this invariant capital theta. So it's defined as the infimum of this sum, sigma nu i to the theta with some over i. So nu i is kind of just the So, if no is supported on this countable set, KCI, and to each KCI, the mass is, oh, this is a typo, so it's nu i, so at each cosi i, the mass is nu i. So we want to sum nu i to the power theta, okay, and and so we. And so we take an infinum over all null. So this is our invariant capital theta. So the main result is the following. So for any u in w1p satisfying this constraint, okay, so u to the p star, absolute value of u to the p star multiplied by f, you integrate with back. You integrate with respect to the canonical measure, and it's zero for all f in this space PM circle. Okay, so if you satisfy this constraint, then we can improve the Soblov inequality. So we have this constant basically. So you have this extra factor theta in the denominator. And of course, if M is high. If m is higher, this invariant is bigger, so you get a beta constant. So that's the idea. All right, and now so to get useful results, of course, you want to evaluate this invariant capital theta, right? So we are able to do it for m equals 1 and m equals 2. 2. So for m equals 1, we showed that this invariant is 2 to 1 minus theta. And moreover, it's achieved at probability measure nu in this space. If and only if nu is just half delta Kc plus delta minus Kc. So these are just two delta masses at a pair of antipodal points. So this actually reproves Orban's. So, this actually reproves Oban's result. So, Oban's original proof was quite complicated, I think. So, this is conceptually much simpler, but of course, you have to solve this extremal problem. But that's just kind of a classical analysis. All right, so that's that's one m equals one. So, and then for m equals And then for m equals 2, we found that this invariant capital theta equals m plus 2 to 1 minus theta. And moreover, it's achieved at a probabilistic measure null. I don't know if null is of this form. So it's just the average of n plus 2 delta Dirac masses. And these points form form a regular n plus 1 simplex. So when n equals 2 we have four points. So these four points are vertices of a regular tetrahedron in S2. So the configuration is kind of interesting. And so let me just restart And so let me just restate this result. So it tells us that for any u in w1p with this constraint, so the absolute value of u to p star power multiplied by any f you integrate against the close canonical measure is zero for all f in p2 circle, so up to degree two. Up to degree 2. And then we have this improved Sobliov inequality. So we have m plus 2 to p over n in the denominator. So it's a better constant. Okay, so I also should mention that we also generalized this. We also generalize these results to higher-order cases. So, namely, if you consider WSP, well, S is a positive integer and P is an exponent, so that SP is less than N. So, this is non-critical. And so we have similar results. Okay, Let me also mention that, yeah, so we even didn't try m equals 3. It seemed pretty hard. But a few months after we posted our paper on archive, there's a preprint, okay, so by Puterman titled Titled Kubacher formulas and the Soblov Inequalities. So he found theta 3, so when the degree is 3. It turns out to be quite nice. So this is a pleasant surprise. So it's 2n plus 2 to 1 minus theta. And it's achieved at null if and only if null is this form. So it's 1 over 2n plus 2 delta cosi i plus Delta Casi plus delta minus Casi. So this is a pair of antipodal points. So you have n plus one pairs of antipodal points. And moreover, actually, so these guys form just an auto-normal basis of Rn plus one. So apparently the extremal problem we were led to consider is of interest. Is of interest for people working in approximation theory. So, yeah, so in approximation theory, you want to approximate an integral by a finite sum. So, in particular, on the sphere, if you want to integrate a homogeneous polynomial, say, and you want to just find To just find out many points and then take a certain average. Now, of course, you want to find a good configuration, right? So to yield better approximation. So I think that's this word Kubacha means. So yeah, so they have some interesting insight. So this. So, this person was able to find theta for degree 3. I don't know, maybe for higher degrees, is it possible to find this invariant explicitly? Yeah, it's probably pretty hard. I don't know. Alright, since I still have a few minutes, let me just A few minutes. Let me just explain the strategy, the basic strategy, how this goes. So the basic strategy is, as I mentioned, is just proof by contradiction using the principle of approximation. So we want to find a constant A such that That we have this inequality, right? So u L P star to the pth power less or equal to A gradient to U L P to the pth power plus C A U L P. So we want to find the best A for this inequality to hold. So if A is too small for this to happen, Happen. Then that means we can find a sequence. Okay, maybe I use black. There exists a sequence UI such that the LP norm of UI is 1 and let's see. And this inequality doesn't hold. So that means UI. it doesn't hold so that means ui p l p star minus a delta u i p this goes to infinity right so if if is too small for this to be true so then you have a sequence okay and so so then this mi which is uh is just uh the L P norm of gradient Ui to the pth power has to go to infinity. has to go to infinity, right? So then you just normalize, so you write ui as mi to the power 1 over p and then vi. So then gradient of vi has LP norm equals 1 and the LP norm of vi itself actually goes to 0 because mi goes to infinity and from this actually you see that gradient you see that gradient VI PLP star is big or equal to at least it's big or equal to A okay and actually if I write as P star here so it's just n over n minus P all right and then yeah so this is actually the situation The situation where you apply the principle of concentration compactness. So, actually, you can show that, okay, so we can take a sub-sequence, so we can assume that this converges to a probability measure, sigma. So, this is a probability measure. And Vi P star d mu is converges to a measure, a finite measure, null. And then you can show that the two measures satisfy a reversed Holder inequality, namely for any phi p star, okay, so Okay, so D no one over P star, so this is less or equal to, I think it's S and then phi P d mu. Okay, so because P star is bigger, so this is a reverse Holden equality. So then there's a classical result of Lyons. Result of Lyons. So this shows that null is finite measure, so it's concentrated on countably many points. And sigma is bigger or equal to s minus p and then sigma null i and minus p over n delta. over n delta pi on the same uh on the same countable set and uh so from this actually you can you can show that uh a is less or equal to sp over uh capital theta yeah so so we already have these two measures and and yeah so it's it's easy then to see that uh a has to be less or equal to sp over theta. equal to sp over theta. So therefore, if is bigger than this number, so if this is this number plus some epsilon, then this inequality must be true. So this is how we prove the main result. Okay, so it's actually very very simple. Okay, and then yeah, so then it's just about solving the extremal problem. Solving the extremal problem. Okay, so I stop here. Thanks for your attention. Thank you very much for your talk. Nice talk. Are there any question? Hi, this is Rupert Frank. I have a question, namely, can you take epsilon equal to zero? Is there a chance that the inequality holds in that case? That the inequality holds in that case? Probably you need a more complicated proof, I understand. That's right, because as I just explained, right, it doesn't work if epsilon is zero. Yes, sir. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I haven't thought about that. Yeah, then probably you need a different argument. It is somewhat reminiscent. There's this paper by I. Somewhat reminiscent, there's this paper by Ebet and Vaughan, where they prove with the Sobolev inequality that you can always take the same S. So you also can get the epsilon. I mean, right, exactly. Yeah, they have this AB program. Yeah, so I think, yeah, so they show that for any P, you can make this, or they can only consider P equals 2. I was aware of their work. Yeah, so you can take actually on any closed manifold, you can take epsilon to be zero. Epsilon to be zero. Maybe for only p equals two, I'm not sure. Yeah, some blow-up analysis. Yes. eBay, yeah. So you do perhaps a very refined blow-up analysis, and perhaps you can use the knowledge that you know how your limiting measure looks like. Go ahead. Go ahead. Let me remark. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes. Oh, yeah. Let me remark on S2. And when M equal to 1, one does know that epsilon is dropped. And that's by the recent work of Gui Tang Feng and his co-authors. So on S2, you know that Epsom can drop, but that's only for this one-moment case. For this one-moment case. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, it's definitely an interesting problem, but our work doesn't address that. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, any other question? If not, let me thank the speaker. Thank you very much for your nice talk. Thank you.
