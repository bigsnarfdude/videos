Good morning of three talks. Pierre Peruchot from University of Notre Dame presently and looking for a job for next year. So it's done the market. So Pierre will be talking to us about geometric convolution, an angausion kernel for hypolytic diffusions. It's up to you, Pierre. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction. Thank you for the invitation. It's been a pleasure following the workshop. I think that many people that I know and do not know me, but I'm very happy to see them. So that's been very nice. Yeah, and I'm glad you're not tired of French people yet. Okay, so I'm talking mostly about geometric convolution. Don't let me. Convolution. Don't get fooled by the title. And I guess here's what I'm interested in. So I'll be considering a diffusion, a good old diffusion possibly on a manifold that's given here in Stratonovich form. And my question will be, what is the density of that diffusion at a very small time? That diffusion at a very small time. So basically, what I'm thinking about that is: if I have an elliptic diffusion, then I know that from a given point I can go more or less everywhere. But if I have something that is sub-elliptic, or if I just have diffusion in one subspace, then I will be able very easily to get to that subspace. And it's going to be difficult to go against that direction. And the question is, how difficult? Is how difficult? Yeah, and that's basically what I want to talk about. Okay, so the very, very basic results I will need is that if your Bronian motion on R, just good old standard Bronian motion on R, the standard displacement is going to be over the squared of t. And maybe it's because I'm new, but that's the only thing I'm trying to like I'm going to rely only on this. Like I'm going to rely only on this and maybe the fact that if it's a vector field, then I'm just going to if it's a drift it's going to be of order t but I want to reduce everything to just this well it's easy to do if we just have a Euclidean space with a constant metric so that's my R D with G is supposed to be in this case my G right here is Here is constant in Euclidean space, then we know that this is just an affine transformation of the usual RD with the Euclidean metric. And so the scaling is also of psi square root of t. It's just a constant times square root of t, and the constant is given by a nice matrix. We don't really, so the A that I'm describing is not unique, but it doesn't matter if we're It doesn't matter if we're just considering the kernel, the kernel is like invariant by rotation, so it doesn't matter. And I'm interested in probably more not completely rigid settings, more smooth rather than just algebraic. And if the metric is not constant, then I'm expecting that the kernel is not going to see at large scale the At large scale, the fact that the metric is not constant, so locally it should look more or less the same, right? It should still have scalings of square root of t. It should still have the same kind of shape given by the A. The A will depend on my P0 in this case. This will still be more or less the same. So this is the Euclidean case, sorry, elliptic case of Allergic case. Of course, this is the easiest one, but I think it's probably enough to build intuition about the techniques that I'm going to talk about. So how do we show that kind of result? Well, how do I show that kind of result? I'm sorry. So the precise meaning of this is going to be right here. So let me maybe highlight that. This is what I want to talk about. This is what I want to talk about. So I have on the left my kernel. So this is my initial position and my final position, right? I'm starting at P0 and then I look at P, what is the density at P. So this is going to be a time singularity. So for now, let's ignore that. But some smooth function of some kind of p-check. And my p-check here is p, but I'm but I'm looking very close to p0, and I'm just looking at the neighborhood of size squared of t. In the neighborhood of size squared of t, I have new coordinates that I call p check, and I want my ut to be a smooth function up to the square root of t equals zero. So even up to the boundary, I don't want it to explode when t is equal to zero. Explode when t is equal to zero, provided I'm in the good coordinates, because obviously it's going to be a very sharp peak, right, when seen in the usual coordinates. But if you zoom in, it's just going to be Gaussian, basically. So it's going to be smooth for all t. Okay, so this is the kind of result I have in mind. And actually, we can show, of course, a lot more. Course, a lot more. So, this is the usual expansion. Usually, you see it on the diagonal, but it's true more or less everywhere. So if you have your kernel, you can write it as a summer function of this type. So my function right here was for k equals zero. For k equals zero, I have precisely this. And then I will gain powers, well, powers of square root of t. square root of t and all these functions are going to be smooth and it's actually it's an actual expansion in the sense that the remainder is indeed of size t to be k of 2 well with the the pre-factor yeah hopefully this is clear what I want to do is write my UT as U t as something that behaves well in the new coordinates my p-check. So how do I do that? So again, I'm going to talk about the elliptic case for now, and then I'm going to give different examples. But in the elliptic case, I have my just a Brownian motion. Let's say that I'm in Rd, but I have a non-constant. But I have a non-constant metric, right? Something that's smooth. I'll give you precise alpines about that G, but for now, I have R D with a smooth metric. So I don't know, Cartoon Adam manifold or something like this. And the density of my protein motion satisfies the heat equation, of course. And I'm going. And I'm going to take the approximation, and it's kind of a family of approximation, that u tilde, right here, u tilde, should be solution to the same equation, but I'm freezing the metric at P0. Again, at small times, the Brownian motion should not be able to see what's happening too far away from my P0. So it should not make a big difference if I just freeze the metric. Difference if I just freeze the metric at P0. So for fixed P0, I'm defining that you tell the right here the density of the Brownian motion started at P0 with metric D of P0. So hopefully, well, of course we know exactly the density of that Proudhon motion. It's completely explicit and it satisfies the kind of And it satisfies the kind of scalings we're expecting, right? The square root of t, and there's some like squishing and stretching in the direction of A of P0 and the notations I had at the beginning. So hopefully it's a good approximation. And then, like the main character of the story, I guess, is the GML formula. It looks something like this. This. So I know that. Oh, I should have given a name to that L, should explain what that is. So I know that my U tilde is not solution to the actual equation, right? It's solution to an approximate equation. So it makes some error when I plug it into the actual equation. So the L here is my one-half of delta, and it's going to be later. I'm going to change my. Be later, I'm going to change my L to different things. So I'm making some kind of error. So if I plug in the U, then I will just have zero. And hopefully, what the GML formula tells us is that we should expect U to be equal to that series. So I start with U tilde, which is my dominant term, and then I take the convolution of U tilde with the error. With the error. So again, the smaller the errors, the smaller this term is going to be. Plus, you take the covolution once more and then once more, etc. It's definitely not a precise result, but it's probably what we should expect for some reason. And I claim that if we know that convolution. If we know that convolution preserves scalings in the way that I described, so we have the square root of t in all directions, and provided you're in that in that scaling, you will be smooth until the boundary. So providing convolution trees of that kind of structure and providing it increases regularity in T, then these will play the role of my, what we'll call. My, we were called FK before. So it's my expansion that is correct before. Maybe, yeah, I have it here. So this is my time singularity. And then I'll get functions that get more and more regular, more and more regular, because hopefully the regularity will increase when I take convolutions. And also I want them to still be in my new kind of scaling. New kind of scaling, new coordinates. I want them to be smooth with respect to these coordinates. And again, if the convolution behaves well, then it should be true. So the bulk of my talk is I'm going to describe three examples of diffusions. The first one is the yellow tech that I basically already dealt with. Um and then I do two more and the plan is to define uh function spaces that I call my uh sine a right here such that more or less they behave or they represent functions that scale as you expect. So for the for the elliptic case, it's going to be just square root of t in small time with the time series. With the time singularity of this form, t to the negative some constant plus a, I will prove that my u tilde and my e are both in some size with the exponent that is positive. And I will prove that the convolution sends nice function spaces to nice function spaces. function spaces to nice function spaces. So if I have u tilde in site one, this is going to give me my first term and then I have in my second term in the GML asymptotics, I have E convoluted with U. So this is going to be the sum of the two, so one plus E. And then I take the convolution again by E, so I will have one plus two e, and then I take the convolution again, and so every term in my Every term in my formula, in my Dugam L expansion, is going to belong to some kind of psi with the regularity that increases. So hopefully they will, when the regularity is high enough, I can invoke some abstract argument telling me that everything is going to converge. And at this point, I can write this formula right here with, so again, So again, each of these convolutions represents one of the functions in my sum. So this is the plan, defining my u, defining my psi, showing that kind of result about them, and then the GML formula gives me everything I need. The part where, so when the series converge, it's not very difficult to prove that it converges to you. It converts to you. If it converts to something, it's very likely that it's going to converge to you. That's not the difficult part. Okay. So let's crack on. Let's see some examples. The first one is, as I told you, just an elliptic motion. So I'm considering proud motion in RD. I have a metric in RD. Have a metric in audio. Sorry, there is a question in the chat from Bruce. Can I see the chat? Uh, does your convolution have T integral in it? Yes, it's a space-time convolution, yes. And I'm taking, yeah, space-time convolution, integral between 0 and t, integral over the whole space of f between times 0 and s, and then g between times time s and. Between times time s and t with the same in space. Thank you. Okay. So I'm considering Boehner motion in Rd with some smooth metric. For the sake of the talk, I'm going to take G smooth bounded and uniformly bounded below. So it's Uniformly bounded below, so it's uniformly elliptic. Although, by the way, because of this, it's going to be stochastically complete as well, which is always good to have. And what I told you is that the scalings, right, the scale that is good to consider my diffusion is square root of t, right, square root of t around my point p0. And I'm And I'm going to call the D that happens in the Jacobian. So in the Jacobian, I have, so if you think about the Gaussian, you have one over square root of two pi t to the d. So I have the square root of t to the d. This is my tau to the d and in all d, the d is just the dimension. And I'm calling this the analytic all dimension for the sake of the talk. Analytical dimension for the sake of the talk. And using that dimension and using the scalings, I'm defining my function spaces. It turns out that this function space does not need anything more than just the t's and the dimension. It's going to be the same for all examples that I will give. So, basically, what I want is that my function, when I read it in the nice coordinates, so In it. So the time here for some reason is going to be square root of t instead of t. So I'm considering it at tau squared. And I consider a scaling. So I'm zooming in, right, around zero at scale squared of t. So in these coordinates, it should be some smooth function. How smooth? Smooth like that? If you want to be precise, it's going to be. To be precise, it's going to be so you can take every derivative, all the derivatives you want in tau p0 p check. You can multiply that by a power of p check. So this is my schwatz. And then you can take the sub, the supremum over all p0, all p check, and tau less than some time horizon. It's technical. What I want is for it. What I want is for it to be smooth enough and decrease at infinity fast enough. And on top of that, I want some time singularity. I need to allow some time singularity, and it's going to be of this form. So I have, so tau to be negative two is just t to one over t to be this, right? This is the dimension, the analytical dimension divided by two. So if you think again of brilliant motion. So if you think again of bruniant motion, it's just square root of one over square root of t to the t. There's a plus one that comes more or less from time. If you look at the convolution spaces, well convolution operators, it's clear enough why we should have a one. And then minus a, so the minus is with the minus here, so it's a plus a, so it's some like the higher the a, the more regular my function is going to be. The more regular my function is going to be in time. So basically, I have a time singularity that smooths out as a gets larger. And in the right coordinate, I have something that is all smooth up to the boundary, no problem. And so in that example of the Brownian motion, it's just a scaling of square root of t everywhere. So now I need to show the nice properties of u tilde and psi. So u tilde is the one I defined. It's just the density of Brownian motion when I freeze the metric. Let's just decide that the metric everywhere is just going to be the metric at my initial point. And obviously we have explicit expressions for that density. It's going to be the right singularity in time, the one I described to you with the Time, the one I described to you with the TO2, the right singularity in time, and some function that is all regular, bounded, all derivative, bounded. Everything's super nice. Obviously, it's just a Gaussian. So there's really nothing to do here. It's all good. Maybe I should say that you have one over the determinant here, so that's why I need G to be bounded below, but that is just. But that is just very regular. So this is all fine. I have my u tilde, I have my function spaces, and I know that my u tilde is in size one. Okay, so this is example one. Example two, I wanted to talk about something that is sub-Riemannian. Well, so this one, this picture is the one you'll see everywhere, obviously. So I'm considering. So I'm considering contact geometry in just R3. So I have diffusion along two directions. That'll give me, that'll give me two vector fields, x and y. And I'm assuming that these give me a contact structure, basically. So what I want is that I can propagate. want is that I can propagate everywhere. So I want the Lee bracket of the two to generate the tangent space everywhere. And I can, if I want, add just a vector field, provided it's still in the same privileged direction, right? The nice direction where everything happens. Technically, I still want everything to be smooth-bounded, and I still want a condition of something that is uniform. A condition of something that is uniformly bounded below. It's just technical. I feel like I'm missing something. No. Okay. So what's happening here? So I know that in the direction of x and y, I'm going to propagate. There's no problem here. I'm going to be of size more less squared of t in the two directions of x and y. That's fine. That's fine. Now I have a third direction, right? My Z that is in the complement. And it's going to be more difficult to go this way, right? Basically, it's like you have to go up the lead bracket. So more or less, if you... So I think that's my next slide. Yeah. So if you go in the direction of x, then the direction of y, and then back x and y. So you do kind of a loop like. X and Y, so you do kind of a loop like this to go up the contact structure. Then you'll go up by a factor time squared, right? So you go, so in time t, you'll go square root of t in x squared of t of y, which means that in the direction of the Lie bracket, you'll be more or less at height t. So typical displacement, at least what I think it should be. At least what I think it should be is square root of t in the directions of x and y and t in the direction of z. So my scaling is going to be this one. Around p0, I'm at square root of t, so tau is squared of t, squared of t in the direction of x, squared of t in the direction of y, and t, square root of t squared, in the direction of c. Hopefully, in these coordinates, everything is going to be nice. Hopefully, at small time. So I have my scalings. So let me jump first. So I have my scalings right here. I know that the Jacobian is some determinant time. Some determinant times tau squared, tau four, sorry. So I'm counting that four as the analytical dimension. And I can define as before, I can define as before the psi as it behaves well in these coordinates up to some time singularity of this form, t to the negative q of 2 minus 1 plus the a. And I'm talking about. The A, and I'm talking about u tilde here, so the A is one, but it's just the A. So let me go back here. So I need to, so I have my function spaces and I need an approximation. And once I have my approximation and the nice function spaces, I can take the convolution and everything is going to be nice. Problem is, I can't just freeze the Just freeze the coefficients and the diffusion. If I did the same thing as the elliptic case, then I would have just diffusion along hyperplanes, right? And it's going to be zero everywhere. Well, it's going to be, sorry, it's going to be singular, right? I don't have hypolliptic condition. So what I'm going to do is just expand my x and y. My X and Y up to a certain order, up to order one. Maybe I'm not going to go into the details, but my X and Y instead of being just frozen or expanded up to order one around P0. Yeah, let's just assume it works and it just does. If you do this, you will see that you tell the The u tilde behaves like you want as you want, right? In the right coordinates, the u tilde is basically the density of two Bronyan motions, B X B Y, and some levy area. So it behaves very well, even as t goes to zero in the right coordinates. Again, you should do that. You should do that properly, but it definitely works. So we have a nice U tilde belonging to psi 1 again. Good. Third example is hypolliptic diffusion. So the one I know is kinetic brownian motion. Is kinetic-Bronian motion. So, what is kinetic-Bronian motion? So, I'm looking at R3 and I'm thinking about it this way. So, my xy is some point in the plane. So, here the blue thing is a trajectory of my xy. And my phi, my third coordinate, is the angle of, well, that direction, right? So, the end goal can be more or less an R, hopefully. And I have that kind of equation. So, my Xt here is moving in that direction. So, my XY is just going along the direction given by phi. It's cosine sine. And on top of this, I have some Broniant motion in the direction of the angle. So, my angle is Bruniant. So, my angle is a Bronyan motion, and I'm following that Brunian motion in my plane. I'm doing Stratonovich here, but I don't really need. It's just a constant vector field. Turns out. Can you just check time? Because you are it's planned for 40 minutes actually. Actually, you give 25 minutes, so you still have a big five minutes. Five minutes is what I have. Good. Yeah? Well, five, ten minutes, Max? Yeah. So what I want to say is, so the hope is that what I'm going to do is in phi, I will have the phi is disappointing. The phi is just a point in motion, so it's going to be square root of t, my variation. In the direction of x, I will have some variation here that should be more or less cosine of phi that I integrate. So it's going to be, sorry, let me write down. So in that direction, I have cosine. So in that direction I have cosine of my variation in phi that I integrate so I have some t same thing more or less for y and if you expand everything you you expect that kind of scaling so it's all very nice and we can see that if you do if you expand If you expand the equation up to the right order, you'll get something that is nice enough. So I'm expanding my equation up to second order in the same way that I extended to the first order before in the subellic case. And it turns out that my u tilde is in Is in my u tilde is in the right space. It's in my u tilde of side one. All of this is more or less because I have my equation now that I've expanded up to order two. It's just it's quadratic and it's algebraic. So I can more or less take the Fourier transform and everything behaves well enough. It is a bit technical, but It is a bit technical, but it works. So here's what I did for all these motions. I have some equation, so the elliptic one, the sub-elliptic one, and the hypoelliptic one. And what I did is expand the SDE just enough to still be hypoelliptic, to still have diffusion everywhere. Have diffusion everywhere. So, in the elliptic case, that was just order zero, sub-elliptic case, that was order one, and my kinetic Brownian motion was order two. And using this, I'm defining my u tilde to be the solution of the Taylor expansion of the diffusion. And somehow it turns out to be invariant under some scaling, and I can define my size, and somehow. Size and somehow it is all super regular in that scaling, schwatz and everything. This looks a bit magical to me, right? So there are many, so in the, at least in the sub-elliptic case, when I zoom in, I have some models that I know, like Kano groups and all that, when like I can expect that things would behave well. But for hypoellic, But for hypoelliptic diffusions, as far as I know, there's nothing very well known about algebraic models for hypoelliptic diffusions. So I don't know. Maybe there's something here. Somehow we can make the model depend only on p-check. So this is not entirely true. I have some p0 appearing. Have some P0 appearing everywhere, but it's kind of my choice. How should I say that? It is more or less like we can isolate the dependency on P0. It's really not difficult. The dependence on PCEC is really what's happening here. And why should the model be more or less everywhere the same? The model be more or less everywhere the same? I don't know. Yeah, everything behaves well, and I don't know why. Although, maybe in the sub-elliptic case, there are some results. Yeah, so I guess I'm kind of getting over time, so I'm just going to say two words about the rest. So, what I told you is that you should have the GML expansion like so. So and the things that we need is to for the error to be in some site E. This is the two things that I didn't show you is we need the error to be in some site E and we need the convolution theorem. For the error to be in site E, it's going to be more or less automatic. I have some arguments here, but it's really not a problem. For the For the convolution, I will need some results that are a bit more complicated. What I want to do is I want to consider p in some kind of neighborhood of p0. And this is my coordinates, the coordinates of p in my neighborhood of p0. When I zoom in, I need things to behave well. And since I'm going through in my convolution, this is the expression for my convolution. Is the expression for my convolution. Since I'm going through another point, there is a difficult way of splitting my p-check here, my normalized things, into two normalized things at different points. This one is normalized from P0 and this one is normalized from P star. So this is kind of the bulk of the argument. Maybe. But yeah, apart from that, I think I told you the whole story. That I think I told you the whole story. So let me just skip to references. So I learned all of this from Kiesa, who did nice notes on that book of Melrose, just for elliptic diffusions. Then I did something about that. So the third example that I gave you is in my PhD. It turns out that I discovered, I rediscovered last. I rediscovered last week that all that thing about in the sub-elliptic case has been done by these people in this article. So yeah, if you want to do something in that area, you should probably consider the hyperliptic case rather than the sub-elliptic one. All right, thank you very much. And I'm ready for questions. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Tian.
