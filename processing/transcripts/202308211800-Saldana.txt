We continue with our first Mexican participant from CIMAT Conapado, Amilita Seltania Muncada, speaking on magnetic mindports in the non-commutative sphere. Thank you. Good evening. First of all, I would like to thank you to the organizers for letting me give this talk. Let me give this talk, which is titled On Magnetic Monopoles in a Non-Commutative Space-Time. Okay, first of all, I would like to start with this well-known formulation in differential geometry and classical physics by considering the trivial principle U1 bundle. On Neminkowski spacetime, we have that the space of principal connections is in bijection with the space of differential conforms. The curvature of principal connections, the set of curvatures of principal connections are in bijection with this set of two forms. Here, the operator d omega is the covariant derivative associated to the principal connection. And then the unke identity. And then the unc identity, the covariant derivative of the curvature equals to zero, implies this other equation, the differential of the two form f omega is equal to zero. On the other hand, the Young-Mills functional is a functional from the space of principal connections to R, which measures the squared norm of the curvature of principal connections. And the Jang-Mills equation comes from a very From a vibrational principle in which we are looking for critical points. For this case, we have that the Young-Mills equation is the codifferential of the two form of omega equals to zero. Okay. Well, no, I'm doing. Okay, well, we with this, we can get. But with this, we can get the Maxwell equations just by defining this one form. We have that the two form f omega is given by that matrix, where the vector in is electric field and the vector p is the magnetic field. In this way, the Bianke identity implies these two equations while the the Jank-Mills equation implies the other two equations. Equation implies the other two equations. So, this is a well-known development. Okay, well, in particular, the non-magnetic monopole equation comes from the Bianke identity and the trivial way in which R4 and U1 has been mixed, but also it comes from the commutativity and the integrated commutativity of the spaces. In this way, the purpose of this work is to describe the electromagnetic theory with magnetic. Magnetic theory with magnetic bundles by recreating all the previous developments in the context of non-commutative geometry and the theory of quantum principal bundles in Michael-Durdevich framework. And we are going to present two models for that. So this talk breaks down into six parts. First of all, the non-commutative space-time that we will use. Second, The quantum group of U1 and the quantum duality algebra that we will use. Next, we are talking about the trivial quantum bundles in which we will work on. And then we are going to get the non-cumminative geometric and Marxelle equations, all of this for the first model. So, in the fifth part, we are going to talk about the second model, and we will conclude in this talk with some Talk with some comments. Okay. Well, let us start by considering the twisted product given by equation one, where the mu nu is an anti-symmetric matrix. And this product can be extended to the algebra differential forms. And we will denote this space by omega m, omega zero m. Omega 0m is just m and it receives the name of the module by algebra. And I have to mention that I will not use the classical star notation for the product because I will use the star for the hot star operator. So I hope nobody gets angry for that. Okay. Well, the quantity the Lee group you want. The Lie group U1 has an associated quantum group whose dense Hof algebra will be denoted by G Pi, Epsilon, and Kappa, where Pi is the coproduct, Epsilon is the co-unity, and Kappa is the converse in Boronovich notation. Okay, now let us consider this first-order differential calculus given by this. Binance when we are taking a space of invariant elements of dimension one or the quantum dual Lie algebra of dimension, such that C anti-commutes. In Durdebich framework, we have to take the Uversal Embroid differential algebra, a differential algebra in which the coproduct can be extended and maximum with this property. So for this. So, for this particular case, we have two forms, which is a big difference with the space of differential forms of U1. Excuse me? Can you explain that at this point? Have you introduced? I don't... Where do you introduce Moncomi? Ah, there. Yeah. In that part. So this is your choice. Yeah, this is my choice of the structure of the one. The structure of the volume. Well, with this relation, the envelope differential has no top-grade forms. In particular, there are two forms. And this will be useful for my purpose. Because in well in the general theory, we need to embed this space into tensor product and then projects all of this again to this space. So if you don't have Don't have to give at least two forms, all of these collapse to zero, and you recreate this classical theory. And I don't want the classical theory. So, your choice that Z theta equals minus theta z is the choice dictated by some thinking that coordinates. It's definitely one example. Yes. It's not the classical case. No. Yeah. Well, the first motivation is that, like I said, I need that space is not zero. First of all. And well, in the second example that I will talk about, actually I take a two-dimensional Actually, I take a two-dimensional space here because I need that the space of two forms will not trivial. Yeah, so this is my elections of the bundle. Now, I will take this trivial quantum bundle by the tensor product of the model algebra and the start and the Hoff algebra and the differential. And the differential calculus on the total space will be the tensor product of omega m and this envelope differential. In this case, and this is why I choose this known standard calculus for U1. In this case, principal connections are invisible with differential one forms. That's okay. However, the set of The set of curvatures of quantum principle connections, again, dÏ‰ is the covariant derivative, is in bijection with this kind of two forms. So if you don't have a calculus on U1 with at least dimension two, this term is zero and you get the classic electromagnetic theory. That's one of the reasons. Like I say, sorry, the specific form of F omega comes for the general definition of the curvature. This form comes for the general definition of the curvature. In accordance with the general theorem, every quantum principle connection without assuming any condition in every quantum principle bundle satisfies the no-commuted. Satisfies the non-commutative Bianca identity, which is equation two. Here, this new operator, S omega, measures the lack of regularity of the quantum principle connection, and a quantum principle connection is regular if and only if its covariant derivative satisfies the greatest Leibniz rule. So, this is like a kind of measure that how non-commutative is your quantum connection. Mutative is your quantum connection. If the quantum principle connection comes from a classical situation, the operator is zero, this part is zero, and you get the classical Viancade identity. And for our quantum bundle, equation two is equation three. Here, this is the commutator in the Mojal. On the other hand, in accordance with the general theory, In accordance with the general theory, a non-commutative geometrical Jung-Mills functional is now a functional from the space of quantum principal connections to R, which measures the square norm of the curvature of a quantum principal connection. And the non-commutative geometrical Jang-Mills equations come from a variational principle in which we are looking for critical points, and it can be given by equation four. Here, d omega star and s omega star are the formal and joint operators of the omega. Operators of the omega and s omega, respectively. And equation four for our bundle is equation five. Here, the star is the differential, and this star is the Hodge star operator. Excuse me? What do you mean this this formula? Ah, the the que young mill the documentative young mill equation. Yeah, uh, you can do it in the well, in this specific case, all of this is in the modal algebra, in the differential forms and the module algebra. Yeah, yeah, that's the reason I start for this. Okay, um, now we can get max equations if you consider this. If you consider this one form, the curvature is given by this matrix. Now the vector D is the non-commutative electric field and the vector H is the non-commutative magnetic field. Notice that both of them have classical parts and non-commutative parts. In this way, the non-commutative Yankee identity implies. Yankee identity implies equation six and seven, while the non-commutative Young-Mill equation implies equation eight and nine. Notice that there are magnetic charges and current magnetic currents, electric charges and electric currents. So, there are no trivia solutions, sorry? You put magnetic charges by hand, or they are generated by your they are generated by your they are generated by my equation by the non-commutative bianke identity then b minus s yeah what is okay yeah um i don't what um yeah Okay. For example, in this specific case, in this model, in the second model, it will not happen, but in this model, at this part is zero, and the operator S becomes in the current. In the currents and charges. And the general definition of the operator is if you have a Thank you. Where that's the reason I don't write the definition because it's too low.  In pseudo notation. And this is why I need that the space of two forms in U1 is not zero. Because if it's zero, this part is zero, this part is zero, this part is zero, this part in this case is always zero, and you get the classical theory. The classical theory. So I need at least that the space of two forms of U1 is not trivial. At least. Well, where am I? Okay. There are solutions. If you take this differential one form and do all the figures, this. Figures, yes, and solutions with magnetic charts. Okay. Create the covariant formulation. Just taking these four potential a mu and the is given by equation 10. No commutative identity now is given. Tibiaki identity now is given equation 11. This antimeter anti-symmetric tensor, J mu nu lambda is defined in this way with the magnetic currents or magnetic charges. And the Jagmills, the non-commutative Jagmills equation is expressed like equation 12, where this is the for current. There are conservation laws for There are conservation laws for our two currents, which I show in section 14. The solution in terms of the potential, the Lorentz gauge is given by 15. And in this sense, the Lagrangian of the system is given by equation 16. And it is worth remarking that the result presented in this paper of Professor Achieri and Colab. Of Professor Akiri and collaborators and other papers can be recreated in this way. At least for you one. This is general formula that this paper shows. Well, question 12 and 13. So at least for you, one and probably for the other groups, you can recreate the results of this paper among other papers. That's another reason why I choose this particular choice of differential forms of view one. Okay, well, the second model. Second model is, well, now we will work with the same differential algebra. However, we will use an However, we will use another first-order differential calculus on U1. Now, the soft invariant elements has dimension two. Again, the envelope differential has the property that space of two forms is not zero. Actually, it has dimension two as well. And now, And now the set of quantum principle connections is in bijection with pairs of two forms of one forms, and of curved quantum principle connections is in biology with pairs of two forms. And those two forms are given like this. Notice the way that E and A M appear in these equations. The mutative geometrical VNK identity equation 18. Notice that satisfy the same equation, while the non-commutative Young-Milson gives rise to these two equations. Again, this is the codifferential, and this is the Hope star operator. The one form E has to be interpreted as electric potential one form, while the one form AM has to be interpreted as magnetic potential form. And now we can get the corresponding Maxwell equations like in the previous cases, take this one form, take this one form, do all the calculations, and you get that the curvature is now. That the curvature is now given like by this. It will be the electric field associated to A E. This will be the magnetic field associated to AM. They have classical parts and no commutative parts. For AM, we have the The magnetic field and the electric field. Again, you have classical parts and magnetic and non-commutative parts. The identity for A is these two equations. The Young-Mills equation for AE implies these other equations. Again, there are Magnetic charges and magnetic currents, and you can do the same for AN. And notice that, well, like in the previous model, electric potential produces charges while the magnetic potential produces electric charges. And we're mentioning that the magnetic charge and current produce. Charge and current produced by AE is the same as the electric charge and current produced by AM. And charges are created by the interaction between AE and AM, connection between AE with itself and AM with itself, just each other. Okay, you can do your covariant formulation. Now is given by the equation. Now is given by equation 8, where this is the electromagnetic field associated to AE, this is the electromagnetic field associated to AM, your electric current, your magnetic current. The non-commutative YNK identity now looks like equation 3. Notice that F E and F M satisfy the same equation. and fm side the same equation and your non-commutative sorry your non-commutative young mill equation is now 1033 and you have conservation loss for your three currents there are an internal symmetry you can by interchanging a e Can by interchanging AE with A, it is the same that interchange the order of the basis in the dual in the quantum algebra. Well, finally, some concluding comments. There exists a general theory to describe Young-Mills fields in the framework of quantum principal quantum. Bundles. We present only two examples, but of course, there are more examples with their own chips. Moreover, the general theory involves scalar matter fields and scalar matter anti-fields. By using a non-standard one-dimensional calculus on G1, it is possible to describe magnetic monopoles and reproduce results of other papers of the subject, for example, this paper. Excuse me? Which colour is that one? That one. Yeah. Yeah, that one. Don't worry. How? Where am I? Here. The idea of using two potential magnetic bond policies is well known. The literature actually is in Wikipedia. Even using Wikipedia. Wikipedia, even using Wikipedia. However, by using this theory of quantum principal bundles, it is possible to describe the model with only one in a very natural way just by taking a dimension two, a space of invariance of dimension two. By the generality of the theory, it is possible to use other spaces used in other quantum gravity models, for example, the K-Minkowski. For example, the K-Minkowski space-time. It is not necessary to take the modular algebra. This is just to give one example. In the classical case, the formulation gets Maxwell equations in the vacuum and commutative case should be the same. However, there are a current generated by self-interaction even in the vacuum. This model describes naturally magnetic. This model describes naturally magnetic monopoles in the trivial bundle, and they are arised from the non-commutative geometrical VNK identity, which again is satisfied by all quantum principal connections in all quantum principal bundles. Exactly like in the classical case, the operator, this omega, this operator, plays the principal role in description, and it is the key operator to deal with any quantum principle connection without assuming any condition on. Connection without assuming any condition on it. The generality in terms of quantum principle connection is one of the most important characteristics of this theory. For example, there is no need to assume that the connection is strong, which is quite important in the Young-Milton tech because connections plays the main role. There are other works that deal with the electromagnetic theory in a model of quantum gravity, for example. Quantum gravity, for example, this paper. And it looks like all these papers, the authors deal with the operator S omega without knowing it. Nevertheless, the generality of our approaching allows to develop other cases, other cases, like in the second model that we have presented. Finally, the general theory applied in other quantum groups, sorry, quantum model in particular, it has been applied in the quantum co-fibration. Applied in the quantum configuration, also known as the Q Dirac monopole bundle. In this situation, it has been proven that the non-commutative Young's equation is equal to its classical part. There is no surprises here. However, in the scalar matter part, the general theory produces two Laplacians that do not commote each other. Them reduces to in the classical limit to the well-known Laplacian of differential geometry. One of these Laplacians has begun in order for volatility. This Laplace has begun in other formulations, for example, in this paper of Professor Landik. However, the other one is a new operator, a completely new operator. This is the reference in which all. And thank you for your attention. This is the list of reference.  Um I don't know, this is a very recently worked. That's all I want. Oh, I think huh? Sorry? Like only two months? Don't know too much about models. What is the best way to go? Okay. Well, everything comes in, everything comes from the blank identity. And in a more general sense, it comes for the not commutative of the spaces. So I don't know the physical meaning, but at least like a At least like uh automatic collections for how to get a discussion for the telephonics is something that when I look like gravity in terms of many things. But it's not only uh it's uh for the first time. It's something willing for forget magnetic monopoles. Forget magnetic monopoles without changing the triviality of the monopolies, which I might engage in. To be honest, I don't know. Well, this is not exactly my area. I would like a physicist to help me in that part. Physicists to help me in that part, but no, actually, I don't know very well. Don't worry. This is a trivial bundle. No, in the trivial bundle, the monopoles arises from the non-commutative for the yeah. Yeah. Yeah, in other cases that they can be bundled, you don't need strong connection, but it's previous because of the existing connection. In this case, yeah, but in the general case, you don't need a strong connection. In the general case, you can work with any connection without assuming nothing on it. Well, in this case, in this case, why is it reality? Excuse me again? Sorry? Yeah. In the yeah, like I say, the co-fibration, in the quantum co-fibration, there are, yeah. Excuse me, sorry. Excuse me, sorry uh-huh yes not the drinker line no no it's not that people from there that take it all out of the machine. I don't know. Probably probably not Yeah, it's just a field yeah, actually it has the the the wave at least for the solution that I presented takes the form of a wave. Yeah. Well, you can integrate the here. Yeah, you can integrate the right. Right in your favorite surface. Yeah, probably it's a work in progress. More questions? There is a UML that we're complex. Yeah, yeah, that's another problem. Yeah, well, this is I'm sorry. You're on the right hand side, today I located screen. So your waves. For your waves with some convex points, they will not waves as we know them, because there are a real path in the system. Because you have IK3, there's an extra shadow IK3, so there will be shadow time. And so it's not a monopole as we know, because a monopole as we know needs to communicate. To communicate with the particle with macro equations for only there are more solutions. Yeah, it could be. This is one example to show that there are no trivial solutions. No, I'm not sure if I can do it. No, our extreme nonlinear Excuse me sorry ah look in this in the white topic yeah Yeah, pro yeah, but yeah, yeah, you can do it. I don't know. The problem is another slide. Yeah. I think you're uh let's let's put it out. Put it out in Australia. Yeah, to the right. Yeah, equation 15. Yeah, it's extremely non-linear. Want me to contribute to the discussion? Thanks, you got the thank you.
