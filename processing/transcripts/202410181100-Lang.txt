I really, to be honest, I only work in the in person geometry, only work in person geometry for the past few days. I have learned quite a lot and got a lot of fresh ideas from you. And so I have like several notions in my title, like little algebras and forms, differential forms. This is ungroup wand, also Causy person group wand. Point, also cost point. I will explain what they are. And this is joint work with Professor George and John Julio. But don't worry, I only have one theorem like in this work. Okay. Let's see. So this is our motivation. So I start instead of a personal algebra, we start from a personal manifold. We start from a personal manifold, and it is a smooth manifold. Is a smooth manifold and p is a Poisson bivector field. Okay, and then actually on the here, I wrote it down. On the right-hand side, this is a space of vector fields. And with the Scotten bracket, it is a Lie algebra. Well, on the left-hand side, this is our one forms. And once we have like a Poisson bivector field here, Bivactor field here, and then we also have a Lie algebra on the space of forms. So this is like determined by this relation. Well, this F1, F2 are functions, like this is the Poisson bracket on the functions. Okay, so we also have like a nice global formula for general one-forms in this way. Clear, L is a lead derivative, lead derivative, and D is. And D is the ROM differential. Well, we know, like, the bracket, the Scotten bracket can be defined on all vector fields, on multi-vector fields, not just on one vector field. And so that's a graded layer algebra. Well, on the left-hand side, we also have like a graded layer algebra. So this is called a closure bracket. It also has an Clauso bracket. It also has a nice formula. Look at here. Well, alpha, beta, alpha is a k form, beta is l form. And so the wedge, this is a wedge. This LP is not lead derivative. It is defined in this way. Here D increases the degree by one. Well, the contraction by this bi-vector field lowers the degree by two. So altogether, it lowers the degree by one. So we will get like a causal bracket. This is also a Causou bracket, this is also a graded Lie algebra. And moreover, the Poisson bivector field, which sends one form to one vector field, so it sends k form to k vector field. So this is like a graded Lie algebra homomorphism. So this is what we know from Poisson geometry. And also when P is non-degenerate, so it is a symplectic structure, and then this. Is a symplectic structure, and then this is an isomorphism. Okay, so I wrote it down. This is the motivation. Well, this is the only theorem in my, like in our work. And now we start from, we generalize from like a Poisson manifold and now to some Cosi-Poisson group. And let me just first wrote it down. Rotate the rotation. And here G is a group one, P is a biovector field. It is not a personal animal, and there's some homotopy term. And we will get an actual result is now instead of a Lie algebra, gridded Lie algebra, now we have like a D2 algebra. This is the right-hand side, is the one on the vector field, and the left-hand side. One on the vector field, and the left-hand side is the one on the forms. And between them, we use the Poisson structure to build a weak of them. Okay, let me first write it down. Then we don't forget about the results. And this is a little algebra. This is actually strict. This is a little algebra that does not depend on. That does not depend on the personal structure and on these things. So, once we have a group one, we have this little algebra, like this gotten bracket. And this is a work. And this little algebra appeared in this paper, shifted Poisson structure on differentiable stack, like by Ping Shi and his collaborators. So, what we do is starting from a classic person group. Starting from a Caucasi person group, and we also like we studied the one on the form space. And okay, this is what we do. This is what we do. And also we build the morphism in between. Which is a group point. The J is like the map, if we have a form. Like the map, if we have a form here, this is it maps to the pullback by the source and by the target difference. So this one is always multiplicative, as you are see. Okay. Okay, and actually, we have worked on this multiplicative geometric structures on group points for like almost seven, eight years, like collaborated with Chen Zhuo and Jiang Julio. John Julio. And actually, this, why do we study geometric structure on group points? Well, maybe it started from Alan Winston's work and on group points, like symplectic group points and Poisson manifolds. And here, the symplectic structure on group points are actually multiplicative two forms. Okay, so, and also in loose. And also in Lu's thesis, she started this multiplicative and also a fine vector fields, multi-vector fields on the groups. Okay. You will see the definition soon. Yeah. Multiplicative means just the compatible countability with the multiplication. Now what? Multiplication of the group one or the group structure. Of the group point or the group structure. Yes. So not geometric structures on the group point. So they are supposed to be compatible with the group point multiplication. Yeah. And then there are several papers about like multiplicative structures on multiplicative vector fields, forms, and also tensors on group ones. And also, what we do, what's important here is. What's important here is they always consider the one-one correspondence between the structure on the group points and also the structure on the Lie algebra and also the integral, the integrability, the integration. And here, this is like a review paper, like this multiplicativity started from Lieu groups and then now to generalize the complex geometry. Everywhere. Everywhere. No, okay. As an advantage of the last talk, there's no need to give the definition of a group one. But here I just emphasize, this is my notation. G and M, both the morphism space and the base space are smooth manifolds. And S and T and the multiplication are all smooth maps. Or smooth maps. Here, G2 is the notation of the set of composable pairs because, like two arrows, if they match, then they can be multiplied together. Okay. And so, like, we use groups for symmetry. So, we use group one for more general symmetry. So, I would recommend you, like, if this is the first time you hear group one, I would recommend you this paper by. And I would recommend you this paper by Alan West. Like Groupwand, Groupwand unifies internal and external symmetries. And we also have the Chinese translation did many years ago by Professor Zhang Ji Liu. Okay. So as a Lie group has a Lie algebra, a Lie group one has a Lie algebra. Okay, what's a Lie algebra? It is a vector bundle instead of vectors. A vector bundle instead of vector space and with a Libracket on the section space and a bundle map satisfying this like Leibniz rule. Well, Tm, you can take A as Tm, then this anchor map is identity. So this is the formula we know from like a manifold class. So given a group end, we take the kernel of the tangent map of S. kernel of the tangent map of S, the source map, and then we get our vector bundle. And the anchor is the tangent map of the target map. And if we identify sections of A as right invariant vector fields on the group point, and then we use a Scotton bracket, induces a Lie bracket on A. So that's where the Lie bracket comes from. Then we get a Lie algebraic. Get a Lieutenant. Okay, but so from Lie group one, we have like a Lieutenant Bride, but the other direction, the other direction, the integration is very difficult. And actually, it has obstructions. This is like a very important paper by Rui, who was here, who just left yesterday, like an important paper by him. So I know Rui's paper. So, I know Rui's paper for many years. Okay. Okay, now many examples. So, Lie group is a Lie group point with the base manifold of point. Lie algebra is the Lie algebra. Second one is the Lie group bundle, it's the Lie algebra bundle. And the third is a pair group point, like a pair. Pair group point whose Lie algebra is a tangent bundle. And the next one is the action group point. Here, Li T is the Lie group. point here t the li group acts on smooth manifold and the action lyric board is is like this and the next one is fundamental group fundamental group point which consists of homotopy classes of paths relative to fixed endpoints okay in this uh like the multiplication in this example is a concatenation of paths okay the east Lie algebra is like tiny bundle Road is like ten in the bundle. The next one is like the gauge group point. Like once we have principal bundles, then we'll have the gauge group point and also the TI algebra. So and the last one is in appeared in Louis' talk about the symplectic group point of Poisson manifold and whose Lie algebra is a cotangent bundle. So I just mentioned these examples to let you know that like You know, that like LibrePons are useful, like they appear naturally in many fields, like in like in topology, in mathematical physics, they're everywhere. And also, there are more, like foliation group and jet group and holonomic group and etc. Okay, now Li2 algebra and with here Li2 algebras are actually Here Li2 algebras are actually categorification of Lie algebras. And here I use an equivalent definition as the two-term infinity algebra, also called strongly homotopy Lie algebras, introduced by Stashov. It has a data d is like a linear map between two vector spaces. And now we have two brackets, g0, g0 to g0 and g0 g minus 1 to g minus 1. So g minus 1 is likely eligible model. So, G max one is like a legendable module. Okay. And the third bracket. Through bracket. In my title, I have this week just to emphasize the non-trivial of this through bracket. 3G0 to 1C minus 1. Such is that the following condition. The first one is kind of natural, the compatibility condition of D and the 2 bracket. And then the 2 bracket does not satisfy the Jacobian identity. By the Jacobi identity. But not too bad. They are controlled by the through bracket, or we call the homotopy per. Okay, well, we still need a condition for the through bracket, right? It's own. Like this is like a cosycle condition. Here, the C means Chauvelin-Allenberg. Like, if T0 is a Lie algebra, G minus one is a Lie algebra module, then exactly this condition is the 3Cycle condition of this three bracket. Cycle condition of this through bracket. So there are two particular cases that are very interesting. The first case is when three bracket is zero. When three bracket is zero, then we don't have four. One three means T0 is a Lie algebra, T minus one is a Lie algebra module, and we only have the first condition. And the second case is when T is zero. When D is zero. When d is zero, when d is zero by two, is again t zero is a Lie algebra, t minus one is a Lie algebra module, and we don't have one, but we have four. Four means this is a real Lie algebra circle cycle. Okay, two examples. The first one is this one is like a strictly two algebra. Here G is a Lie algebra. This is the Lie algebra of the derivatives. And the AD maps an element to an index. To an inner derivative. How skeletal one is like this is also called the strings, the string lead to algebra. Like R is a real number, G is Li algebra, and here the non-trivial 3 bracket is the Gaussian 3 form, K is the Km form. So also like a morphism between Like a morphism between two little algebras goes like this way. Here, let's just look at the picture. This is the picture that I draw here. F0, F1 is a chain map, but we still need F2. F2 maps two elements in G0 to one, G prime, T prime minus one. Well, they preserve these two brackets and three brackets up to the homotopy term F2. Okay, now let's go to multiplicative, multiplicative like vector fields only groups. And like in the first, like in the first, I use the notion like polyvector fields. Many people use polyvector fields and multi-vector fields. And I was like told by like a senior professor in my field that My field that multi-vector field is a better name. Yeah, by some language reason. Yeah. Okay. I forgot the reason, but I just changed it to this. Okay. Like this thing, maybe physics likes to use polyvector fields. Yeah. Okay. So a k vector field, only group is multiplicative. It satisfies this condition. This means the value of pi. The value of pi at GR related with pi r and pi g in this relation. Here, Lg and R are just the left translation and the right translation. Okay, or there's like a geometric point of view, mean the graph of the group multiplication is a coisotropic manifold, some manifold. Okay. Okay. So here I reserve the P for just the quote two vector field. And for general one, I use pi. Okay, sorry for the notations. Well, like give an example. Our vector space are treating each other Billian Lie group. In this case, this multiplicativity just means linear. You can say like the linear, like the multiplicative one. Like the multiplicative one vector field on a vector space is just a linear vector field. Well, by June field, like a Poisson Lie group is a Lie group with a multiplicative bivector field, such that it is also Poisson. So as Poisson Lie group is a semi-classical limit of Hof algebras, so there are a lot of things like in common what we are doing. Okay. Well, so if you like personal algebra, let me explain this notion like in the algebraic language. It means the functions, this function space is a personal algebra, and moreover, it is compatible with the group multiplication in this way. Okay, there's a formula here. Okay. Like the easiest example of a Poisson League group is T star. Is the T star. T is a Lie algebra. On Steel, there's the Kirilov constant Soro person structure, which is a Lie group, the Poisson Lie group. The group structure is a billing group structure. And the next one, this is actually we call a dream field double, a dream field double personally groups. There are like a, I wrote down four matrices, matrices. They are all personally groups, though there are many in this theory. Okay. Okay, I won't explain why I don't use. Okay, I won't explain why I don't use this like in my talk, just to let you know, I know a lot of examples of personal groups. Yeah. Okay, let's continue. So then we generalized the definition of multiplicative from vector fields on group to a group point. And now, okay. The geometric definition means the graph still the same. The graph of group point multiplication. Same. The graph of group one multiplication is a coisotrophic sum manifold. Now, let's write it down in the algebraic way. Okay, let's see. It's more complicated. The first one is like appeared in the previous slide. The value of pi at gr. Here, gr is like a composable pair. This is gr morphisms. So this point is x. So the value of pi at gr relates with pi r, pi g. Relates with pi r, pi z, and pi x, like in this way. Here, we have to use bisections or group lines. So, this is like a formula that is kind of hard to understand. Okay. And another way it means we identify the sections of A as a right-invariant vector field. So, this condition holds if and only if the scotten bracket of pi with the right-invariant vector field is again write-in variant. Field is a Gin-Wright invariant. Okay. And the second one is the bracket of pi with the writing invariant functions is a Guinea write invariant. Okay, the last one means like the base manifold. The base manifold is coisotrophic sum manifold. Okay. There's no big difference. Yeah, no big difference. Well, Difference. Well, for all, for general, okay. General, okay. Okay, so this is an example. This is an example. For like a sections of A, so this is the map here. So for like a section, A, if you don't like K, you can just take K. If you don't like k, you can just take k as one. Take k as one. So this is a map. The difference of the right invariant vector field, the right invariant, the right translation and the left translation is always multiplicative. So if we just use the right or the left, that is fine. That is not multiplicative. Okay, this is this map. This is this map. Okay. Well, also, if this is if case tool and If case two and if tau satisfies the young boxer equation, and then it will give the Poisson. So that's the relation of Poisson e groups with like Youngbach equations. Well, now this is their theorem. This is this side. There is a natural strict. In this case, it's strict. The zero bracket vanishes. This is only two algebra on this complex. Well, the bracket here is Scott and bracket and this. bracket and this like the image the image of this differential is an ideal in this way it induces an action of like a t0 on g mass one okay so this is a little algebra okay why this little algebra is important okay there are two important facts the first one is this little algebra is marital invariant what does this mean it means for two marital equivalent group points Data equivalent group points, the two Li2 algebras are homotopy equivalent. So we have to use higher structures and the language of higher algebras to explain this thing. It's very hard to prove, actually. It takes pages. Yes, yes. Homotopy, yeah, equivalent as an affinity algebra. Actually, as a two-algebra homomorphic, just the two level is enough. Yeah. Yeah, as a infinity algebra, you're right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yes. You see, I already like take the truncation. Like we only need the up to the morphism. Do you know the morphism? I still have one here, something like here. This is enough. And so the homotopy equivalent. The homotopy equivalent classes of this Li2 algebra, or you can say this Li2 algebra is viewed as the vector fields on the differentiable stack. Okay. And the second one is the Margadon elements of these two algebras are actually Causi-Poisson structures on the group point. Yes, and so then the And so then they find a way to define this personal structure on the stack. So they define the personal structure on the stack as the marital equivalence classes of quasi-poisson group points. So quasi-poisson group point appears naturally in this point of view. Okay, they are just the mercantile elements. Okay, so now we ask this question. So we are still, we are working on these multiplicative structures and the Multiplicative structures, and then Liu just asked what's the structure on this form. Do we have a little algebra structure? Okay. So as I understood, these multiplicative forms are easier than multiplicative vector fields. You see from the definition, a K-form on Lie group bond is multiplicative if it satisfies this relation. If it satisfies this relation, only one relation. Here, M is the group point of multiplication. PR1, PR2 are just the two projections. And so this is a formula of k-forms on G2. Okay, or we can give it like, or there's also a geometric definition, equivalent definition. Like one example. Like one example. So that's the difference. You see, for Lie group, when k is greater or equal than two, all the multiplicative forms are zero. So this means only group, we only have a non-trivial multiplicative one form. So that's why we study possible groups a lot, but no sympathetic group. Okay. The second one is like give an example, like for vector space. Like for vector space viewing as a billion group, so it's multiplicative vector form, it's just a v star. Well, now remember we have our actually we don't need p to be positive. If p is like a multiplicative two two vector field, then we will have the p bracket on forms. Yeah, the same as what we have here in. What we have here in like in the person world. So we have this, we just record two formulas: one on one form and one on all forms, the Kazu bracket. Then we ask, are multiplicative one forms closed with respect to this p bracket? Which means the p bracket of two multiplicative one forms, it is still multiplicative. Yeah, it is this way. Yeah, it is this. To prove this, we need to develop the carton calculus on multiplicative vector fields and forms. This is not too hard. Okay, but the second one, what about all forms? Are they closed with respect to the Kazu bracket? The second one? This is not trivial, actually. It's not obvious because the wedge product, there's wedge here. The wedge products of two multipliers. Products of two multiplicative forms is no longer multiplicative anymore. So it seems these three terms are not multiplicative, but the answer is yes. The answer is yes. We came up with some like techniques, techniques to prove this is still right. So to this, I want to emphasize that the generalization from one Uh, the generalization from one to k is not direct, it's not straightforward. Okay, so let's have a look at spectral case, the Poisson case. So, for Poisson group one, there's a natural street case. So, this is the map. The S star, gamma, S is the source on the map, T is the target. The difference is always multi-picative. So, this is a complex here. And with the P bracket, and also. With the p bracket, and also, and also the image of this thing, the image is an ideal. And so, we get an action of this one on this. So, we have a Lie algebra, which is strict here, and also a strict morphism in between, which is given by the puzzle. This is a special case. Okay. So, then we ask about the Caucasi Poisson group one. Can we get a weak little algebra? At first, we were pretty sure this is right. We can do Sure, this is right. We can do something like this, but it takes like more than one year, two years for me to prove this theorem. To write down this theorem, it takes like a minute, but to prove it, it takes like more than one year. Okay, now what is a Causive Poisson group and it is a group bond with a multiplicative bivector field on G and And see, there is a phi, which is a three-section of the Lie algebra. If you don't like it, just take it as a Lie algebra. Think about the special case. Okay, so Pb is not zero anymore. Pb is not personal anymore, but it is controlled by the co-boundary case. Let's see. It's controlled by the like the difference of phi, controlled by phi. And also p and phi satisfy this relation. So P and Phi satisfy this relation. What is the arrow translation, left translation, right translation? Yeah, it's like Lie algebra. We can identify Lie algebra as left environment vector fields only group. Yeah, the same idea. So are there examples? Yes, they appear also naturally. And the first one is like a G, if P is zero, this five is cut down three four. five card on three four this is a personally this is a causal personally group and for causing personally group one i took this this uh uh example here g acts on g acts on itself by conjugation i don't know i think so because anton alexi uh Anton Lakshel has a paper of Dreamfield Associator, and also he wrote down this example. This is his example. Yeah. And so you see, there's like this person, Poisson, it's not personal, it's a bivector field in this way. So This is the equation. Yeah, this is what I know. Yeah, this is the condition. Okay, so like in Poisson geometry, we prefer or cannot prefer to write on the bracket like by vector field. So, for example, in this way, what's So, for example, in this way, what's the meaning of the how to write the person bracket? I have no idea how to do that. Yeah, by using local coordinates. Okay. Okay, and this one, and this example has applications in moment map, in mathematical physics. Okay, let's see. There's another example of a Caucasy Poisson group point, Caucasy Poisson group point. Cosi-Poisson group and well, the Lie, the dual of a Lie algebra is like a Poisson Lie group. That's the easiest one. So it's the same, like the dual, the dual Lie algebra, the dual of a Li2 algebra is a Causi-Person group end. And actually, this is the first question as a PhD student, my brother gave me. This is the first question. So from here, I learned all these things. And nowadays, we And nowadays, we understood there's a better understanding. It is the dual value to algebra is also like a Causive person to group. It has a group one structure there and also a bidding group structure. They are a match. Okay. And this is an action group one. And well, the two brackets here on the algebra side, the two bracket gives the bivacual field. And the three bracket will give this phi. Okay, you know, there's a there's like. Okay, you know, there's a there's like this example, you call it linear quasi-Poisson group ones. Okay, now this is our theorem for like one forms. So the theorem is like still the same complex, the same complex. And then we have a non-trivial zero bracket. Non-trivial through bracket. The zero bracket is given. All I want to say is like the two. All I want to say is like the two bracket is given by p, and the three bracket is given by phi. It's kind of a very natural. Well, now let me show you some important formulas here. The first two, like well known for many years, is like the Poisson bracket of the p bracket, the Jacobi identity of the p bracket is controlled. P bracket is controlled by P P, the scotten bracket of P P in this way. So if P P is zero, then this is a Lie algebra. So when P P is zero, when P is Poisson, then this is the Lie algebra. Otherwise, we have the right-hand side. That's a nice formula here. And the second one is like this P, this is the map. P preserves the bracket, like up to this term. This term. There are nice formulas here. So now, because PP is not zero, so we need the general formulas. And so to prove our theorem, to prove our theorem, the difficulty is like to prove the difficulty is we know the compatibility to prove this is a lead to algebra. We need to prove the Jacobi identity of the homotopy is not difficult to prove. The difficulty lies in. The difficulty lies in the last one, like the compatibility condition of the 2 and 3 back, the last one, the cycle condition. And to prove this, I know like it must be controlled by this condition, P P, P and Phi. Well, at first we made the guess, it equals to this term. It equals to the left-hand side equals the last term, but there are a lot of extra terms that couldn't cancel, couldn't be canceled out. Couldn't be cancelled out. So one day we just figured there is another term here. So from this formula, we see, and actually, let me return. Okay, just from formula, we know the theorem is preserved. The theorem is proved like this. This formula, this formula guarantees the Jacobi of the two. The Jacobi of the two brackets are controlled by the three bracket, the Jacobi identity. And this one on this formula makes sure the 3Co cycle condition of the three bracket. Okay, that's how we prove it. That's the idea. Okay, then this is the general. This is the only theorem in this paper. Also, like because from one to From one to general forms, it looks similar, but it is different because we can't just use the wedge. We can't use wedge here because a multiplicative two form is not the wedge of two multiplicative one form. That's a problem. So we can't just use wedge here. So we have to like use a general formula. So here, to write down the formula, we know there's one here, but to write down the formula, we have to use multiplication. formula we have to use multiplicative tensors multiplicative tensor vector fields yeah and this is like the morphism in between it's a weak morphism the weak term is given by phi okay okay okay here is the technique I'm going to let's have a look at the corollary so have a group one if we consider the core knowledge of the complex Consider the co-movage of the complex, or if we consider the quotient, and they are nice graded Lie algebra, and this is a gradient Lie algebra in between, because the difference just lies in the difference is there, like in the commodity sense. Okay, so actually these two give information on stack. Here, in our definition, differentiable stack means the Marita equivalence class of group points. Class of group points. Tilda means the co-merge of the complex. There's a complex here, right? Means, yeah, quotient to the image. Here is just the quotient. Here is just the quotient the image. This one quotient the image. No, no, no. No, this is closing to the image. Okay, then there are some examples. The first one is the group case. For the group case, look at it. For the group case, look at this picture. For the group, let's just look at the diagram, this special case of this one. So, in this case, no m. So, the right-hand side is like no, it's not weak, it is a strict, it is just a Lie algebra. The algebra is always a Li2 algebra. And by the vector field side, this is non-trivial. Okay, so this is a weak morpheme between two strictly two algebras. Okay, so this is the case. Okay, so this is the case. And the next one is also remember the dual value algebra is the linear quasi-poisson group on the case. And actually, by take a decomposition, we can write down the multiplicative vector field and forms like clearly we can understand it, but they are kind of infinite dimensional, but which we don't like. And then we consider because it's vector spaces, there's a It's vector spaces. There's a billing group structure there. And so we consider, we like to consider the vector fields and forms that are multiplicative with respect to both the group one structure and the group structure. So that's why we use B. B is both. And then the space becomes like a finite dimensional. And this diagram, this diagram now. Now turns to this one for which we know it's like from G from the Li algebra, from the Li2 algebra to this is actually the coordinate action of a Li2 algebra. Because it comes, this example, this example comes from Li2 algebra. So finally, we got, so in the end, we got the Coradon action of this derbar. Well, now I kind of finished my main theorem. So, what am I going to do, volume? It's like because now we have the structure of a group point. And now sensible group point has a lead algebra. Like for the paper, for the references I mentioned at the very beginning, people study a lot about the geometric structures on local points and its infinity. points and it's infinitesimal structures on the algebraic and so for pretty so we're pretty sure there's like a diagram of this like in the algebraic level and okay that's that's what i'm going to say so it's from dream field like there is a one-one correspondence between connected and simply connected personally groups and libi algebras okay Okay, this side, this infinitesimal level is just a linear algebra. It seems it's easier to understand. Okay, so over the years, like they study, they generalize this theorem from personally group to personally group one. And infinitesimals easily by algebra. And actually, when my advisor was a student, he did work with pinch. He did work with Pinxu and with the animals. And the important work is they consider the minimum triple or the double, the menu triple of the bio-algebraids. And they invented the cron algebraid, which is very important. Okay. And so there's also a correspondence between causing person group 1 and Caucasy Li Libiodibroids. So what's that? A caucile biogeibride is a Li-Aldebroid. Algebraide is a Lie algebra because we have group one, so we first have a Lie algebra A, and D star is like a co-bracket. It gives a bracket on A star, but it is not V. It's a co-bracket and still a phi. It satisfies these three conditions. Okay, so I don't want to go into a detail, just to show you the, I just detail just to show you the I just want to show you the formulas. So we have one here. We have one here. This is the one form. This is just the infinitesimal multiplicative one forms on the algebraic, just the infinitesimal thing of this one. And actually this little algebra is easier to define. It's like everything is explicitly Everything is explicitly. It's easy to write on, it's easy to explain because here is like commutator. And this is, we only use the lead derivative. We don't need to use a multiplicativity. Okay, I don't want to talk more about these details. Okay, so this is the diagram. This is the diagram, the same diagram, the infinitesimal version of this diagram. There's one here. Also, for the Lie algebra, Lie bi algebra, cause the Lie bi algebra example. Because in the bio algebra example, it looks like this. Okay. Okay, so as a summary. Okay, as a summary, so in like in the references they proved for over the years, people prove if this group point, if this caused Poisson group point is connected and simply connected, and actually there are two universal theorems between multiplication. Between multiplicative, this can be general k. Multiplicative k forms on the Lie group and on the Lie algebra, we have something like this differential. Like for ones, that is covariant differential operators, actually. And also, like for forms, there's one, one correspondence between multi-focused forms on new group and something on. forms on Lie group and something on the Lie algebra. And this one, one correspondence is hard to prove. The other side is kind of the integration. The integration part is, yeah, it's difficult. It's more difficult. Okay, so then we finally get this diagram. Let's look at it again. The front face is actually the picture I draw down here. The front face. And the back face is infinite. phase is an infinitesimal version. So these two diagrams are actually independent, independent. But once we make this assumption, this group point is as connected as simply connected, and so then we get this isomorphism. We get these two isomorphisms. So this is the picture we get. But there are still a lot of that's the theorem we got by now, but there are still At by now, but there are still more works to do. Like the first one is because for their work, they spend a lot of, they spend half of their the pages of their paper to prove this little algebra is a marital invariant. And so the first question is, can we prove our little algebra is also Marietta invariant? So this, yeah, this, this, I'm trying to. Yeah, this I'm trying to do at this moment. Okay, is our little algebra marital invariant? Okay, the first question. The second one is I was asked by several people, what about the case of Caucasi symplectic points? Because, like, in this case, we know if this P is symplectic, then if P is If P is sympathetic, so it gives us sympathetic, if P is non-degenerate, so non-degenerate person is symplectic. And so we have, again, we have a theorem like this. But the relation of a causal person and a causal symplectic is like more subtle. Causy person. Let me write it down. Maybe you can give me some ideas how to understand this. So the relation of these two is like the complex is Causy isomorphism. So there's no way to just take the inverse. Yeah, so that's the relation of Caucasi force and Causi symplectic. And Causi symplectic. So I can't just get from a Caucasi sympathetic group one. There's a two form here. From this two form, I don't know how to get a two vector field, so I can define the bracket on forms. So I have no idea. And another reason we care about this question is this causi-posing this causi-symplectic group points are very useful. Like, for example, in characterizing Characterizing the model class of flat connections on surfaces, like to characterize the TRBOT syntax structure there. So they use this framework a lot nowadays. Yes, yes. Oh, okay. So that's that's I o I only work in final education now, so I don't know the the the the techniques. Oh, that's keyboards there. The techniques or the skills there. Yeah, and also, like, for me, I like to write down the explicit formulas. For example, from like a two-form here, I would like to write down the two vector fields, like write down the formulas. Yeah, and yeah, fine and yeah. Okay, and the last one is like I mentioned this so fine, and this of fun actually there's like understanding like. there's like understanding like this what are the algebraic structures of fine vector fields and these two the direct sum the direct sum of these two gradient spaces actually is isomorphism is equal to the affine forms and so maybe we'll have like a new point of view by using a fine vector fields so okay this is all i would like So, okay, this is all I would like to say. Thank you so much. Thanks for attention.
