The provision of a potential synchronity formation. Yeah, Jiao Hong, please. Okay, thank you very much. So, let me first thank Monica, Bob, and Jensen for kindly giving me this opportunity. I really appreciate it. And this is really a great learning opportunity for me. So, today, I would like to present two examples of semi-universal smoothness. universal smoothing and the stabilizing phenomenon for PD systems modeling fluid. So here by universal I really mean that the same stabilizing phenomenon occurs in different systems modeling quite different fluids. It appears that the stabilizing effect from the interaction inside the system really helps. System really helps to prevent potential fanatical singularity formation. So, the first example involves the three-dimensional incompressible older ride B model. So, the older ride B model is a model for basically elastic fluids in the system. It couples the fluid velocity with the nano tuning, suggest tensor. The 9-year-old handing stress tensor. So, when there is no stress tensor, the free velocity satisfies the three-dimensional incompressible weather equation. It's suggested by the results of Tom and also Tarak LGindi and the really dedicated numerical simulation of Tom and Noah. The 3D weather can potentially blow up in a finite time. Potentially blow up in finite time. However, when we couple this really well with the non-uthanous just tensor with the older RIDE B model, then we can show that the system has more data global wild hoseness. So is it really the coupling in the older Riley B model actually prevents any potential singularity in a way? Potential singularity in a whaler. So, as we know, the whaler itself, in general, has no mechanism for small data global results because small data can become large rather quickly. So the second example is a two-dimensional magnetic hydrodynamic system modeling the inactive. Modeling the electrically conducting fluids. So, without the magnetic field, the fluid obeys a Euler-like equation. So, this is an equation with extra term. So, it's given by the singular integral operator. And this Euler-like equation is not alone to be globally well posed. So, even though it's a 2D, but know it's a 2D, but still differ this extra term, we do not know the global vibrance. But when this 2D Euler-like equation is coupled with the magnetic field by this MHD system, we can show global well position is near background magnetic field. And furthermore, we can show that the solution actually decays if Decays exponentially at algebraic rates. So, this example implies that the magnetic field can actually stabilize the fluid. This same stabilizing phenomenon actually occurs in several other systems for fluids, and the phenomenon has also been observed in experiments. In experiments. So, another significant example is the Business system in which the buoyancy force can actually stabilize the fluids. So now let me give you the details. So first, let me quickly mention that the 3D incompressible weller can potentially form Felderham singularity. And this is And this is suggested by the work of Tom and his collaborators, and also the work of Al Gindi. So these are the references. So rough solutions without finite energy blues up, indeed blows up in finite time. And also many of the beautiful numerical simulations in the work of Tom and Work of Tom and Noel. And also the work of Atarik L. Gendi. And I would also like to mention that inspired by the numerical simulations of Tom and Nogu, there are several beautiful theoretical results. So, in particular, I want to mention the work of Sasha and Vladimir Svarek. So in this annual paper, they showed that for the 2D welder, you can actually construct an initial vorticity on the unit disk so that the corresponding vorticity gradient actually grows double exponentially in time. So, what that means is that even for 2D wheeler, in general, In general, we don't really expect stability type results near the CBO solution. Of course, near some very special steady states like the shear, as Haujia talked about in this morning, you could have invasive dumping and asymptotic stability. But in general, if you indeed have the trivial solution, then the solution are expected to grow even. I expect it to grow even for total oil. So now let me tell you about the older radar B model. So in this older radar B model here, so this is done in recent work with Peter Constantine and Jia Zhao and Yu Zhu. So here's the older Rodel is for general D dimension. A general d dimension, so two, three, or higher dimensions. So, uh, this is in the whole space R D. So, as we can see from here, the velocity equation is 3D is, well, if we're talking about 3D order ID B, then this is exactly the Euler equation with extra force in terms comes from the non-utaneous stress tensor, tau. And tau here represents the non-Newtonian part of the suggest tensor. Mathematically is given by a symmetrical matrix. It is transported by the fluid, and here we also include a fractional dissipation term. So here's a Laplace beta. Beta can be one. That would be the standard dissipation. And then And then the equation of tau also has two extra terms. So let me tell you what they are. So Q here is a bilinear term. It's pretty typical in physical elastic models. So here it is. So D here is the symmetrical part of the velocity gradient. So that's just a gradi U plus gradi U transpose half. those half and q here is a bilinear uh term in terms of tau and gradient u so it's tau times w u and minus w times tau and here w u here is the skew symmetric part of the gradient u so that's just gradient u minus gradi u transpose and half b here is a parameter between negative one and one and then the times the semantic And then times the symmetrical part tau plus tau the symmetrical part. So that's the Q plot. So that's the equation of tau. So our goal here is to show the global vaposonists. Of course, the best we can show will be only small data global vaposones because we're talking about three well. Oh, let me quickly. Oh, let me quickly tell you the fractional Naples. So, the fractional Naples in whole space is defined in terms of Fourier transform. So when we take the Fourier transform, it becomes multiplied to 2 gamma times the Fourier transform of F. So sometimes we use lambda here for La plus half. So, the older IB governs the motion of a class of complex fluids, such as absorbent with particles suspended in it, and has become often used in models in a visible university flows. So the small data global web poses problem is not completely trivial. The main reason is that, so the first equation is inviscid. Is invested is the Wele equation with a forcing term. So, in classical approaches, the Falcon term is normally treated as a better term. So, since we just mentioned that 3D weather can, the solution of 3D weather can behave betterly, can even possibly become single in finite time. So, this model global positive problem seems to be. Problem seems to be difficult. The new idea here is to treat the divergence of Tao term here as a good term. So it's not, so we cannot really afford to treat it as a bad term. And we make use of the stabilizing effect due to the coupling and interaction. So mathematically, the interaction actually needs to assist some wave equation. To a system of wave equations, as I'll show you later time. The main result we are able to obtain is the following. So we consider again the older right B model, 2D, 3D, or general higher dimensional spaces. And the fractional plus power here, so beta here is between one half and one, including one half, including one. And assume the initial data here. And assume the initial data here, the initial velocity, initial nanotechnist stress tensor is in a solved space Hs. And here S is bigger than one plus half D to guarantee the uniqueness. Again, of course, the Freedom is divergence fray, tau zero is symmetric. So we show that if the initial Sobrioff norm of the data is Of the data is sufficiently small. So we can find epsilon sufficiently small such that if the data is small than epsilon, then the system has a unique global solution. And we also have the stability. So that means that for any later time, the solution in HS norm remains bounded by as constant times epsilon. Furthermore, we actually obtained some preliminary decay rates for the derivatives of u and tau. So that means that any derivatives of u and tau decays at least like one plus t to negative half. So that's the stability, the model global web hoseness and stability results. injury results. And also in a follow-up work, we also obtained sharper decay rates. So if we're wanting to assume the initial condition, also in L1. So in general, if you want to get a decay, even for level-Stokes type equations, you also need to make an extra assumption besides the assumption on the solvent-level space. So if I assume that the initial data is also in L. Assuming that the initial data is worse in L1 besides in the solvent of space, then we can now obtain sharp decrease. So, this is our decrease here. Okay, so this is our main result. I would like to remark that the older ride B model has attracted a lot of attention. So, the extensive studies in the last 30 to 40 years, the lots of buildable work has been done. lots of beautiful work has been done so uh i will not get into them uh at this moment so uh so it's a it's a really really long news and also uh there's a large very large initiative on other viscos elastic models for example uh fang huan and sangyu and also fanghuan and zhenyu and shenhong have done beautiful work um a so i would just So, I would just like to mention one of the most closely related results. So, that's the work of Tarek and Tarek and Rosetta. So, for the 2D older ride B model. So, in the paper I put it here, they look at a very close older rideby model, mainly the focus on two-dimensional case. So, in their model here, So in their model here, they have an extra dunking term. So the coefficient A is a constant. And then they have a full Laplacian dissipation. And the main result they have, so the difference between this one and the model I put before is that in our model, we have a low dumping and we have a general fractional dissipation. So the main result. So the main result states that they consider mainly a two-dimensional case. So assume the initial data velocity and the non-nutritionous registance in a solid level space HS with S greater than two. Assume the initial data here is small in the sense that the H1 normal is small plus the initial vorticity and as a stress tensor in this best space, the homogeneous. Space, the homogeneous P0 infinity one is less than or equal to epsilon, then they obtain a unique global solution in HS. The solution satisfies this growth rate. So the alpha bound for the gradient velocity in L infinity and then integrating time is bounded linearly in time. So what that means is that if you look at the solution in a solve You look at the solution in a solved space, the upper bound would be exponential in time. So, in the result here, both the dumping term and the for Laplacian dissipation plays a crucial role. So, I would like to quickly explain the idea. It's already pretty cool idea, in fact. So, the idea here is trying to eliminate the best. Eliminate the better term. So as we focus on two-dimensional case, so the look at the vorticity equation. So let me just take the k and the force and term becomes the kill of divergence tau. So this term here in general is treated as a bell term. So the idea here is to use a Gouda term to eliminate this bell term. So the Gouda term here is um so the good term here is uh the dissipation from the equation of tau so uh so what they did is uh they apply a operate so r which is defined to be this so this is uh so kill divergence now plus inverse to the second equation so then uh the second equation is converted into this form so then this dissipation term exactly converted to this term here that's the same as the Term here. That's the same as in the vorticity equation. And then you take the difference. So then they will obtain an equation for the combined quantity omega minus r tau. So r is defined here. So they take the difference. So what is the equation and the equation of r tau? And then this better term here will be gone. So then there will be a new equation for g for the combined quantity. Buying a quantity. So, what's really crucial here is that they really need the dumping term here so that in a process, when they apply the operate, so they get a term here in terms of the combined quantity as a dumping term. So that means that this new quantity G here obtain a damper equation. So, therefore, the So, therefore, they can control G. So, once you control G, because Tau has a control, Tau has a dumping and dissipation. So, then you can control the vorticity. And that's the idea. So, our idea here is different. So, in this approach here, you cannot really ignore tau. Tau is very crucial. Without tau here, you cannot really form the dumping term in G. So, the idea we have. So, the idea we have here is quite different. So, the new observation here is that the older radio B model actually has a wave structure. So, to explain this, we first eliminate the pressure term by apply the narrow projection to divergence the free vector fields. So, you project the P here, then you enimulate the pressure term. Eliminate the pressure term. So the equation becomes this. And then we form an equation for divergence tau and the projection operate on the divergence tau. So equation for this quantity, for this special quantity here. And what we found is that the U and projection divergence tau, the formal wave equation. So for some position in it, let me just ignore the nanina terms. The non-linear terms, and then put a sum of the coefficients equal to one. So if you just look at the linear part, and that's the equation for u and p divergence of tau. If we differentiate in time, so differentiate the u equation in time, one more, so you get a second derivative of u, and then you make several substitutions. So then the linear pause becomes. The linear pulse becomes actually decoupled. So you have a wave equation for u, and then exactly the wave equation, the same wave equation for p divergence tau. So if we make a comparison of this wave structure here with the original linear path of the velocity equation, you can actually see that this wave equation here has much more regularization. So it has a regularization. So it has a dumping that means dissipation. It also has this wave structure here that means dissipation. So by sort of coupling these two equations, we actually see some of the heightened regularization and stabilization in a system. So to make a use of this regularization from the system here, we construct an upgrade. We construct a Neapolitan functional. So it's a functional including the standard HS norm. So that's the standard energy piece. And then we also include inner product term. So the inner product of U and the other quantity projection divergence tau. So here I did not write the projection because U is divergence free. And then by choosing suitable By choosing suitable solar inner product, so that if we take a case sufficiently small, these two terms will dominate. So in other words, this is always positive. And then if we differentiate less than the output function in time, and we will generate the really better-needed dissipation in the velocity equation. So when you differentiate this inner product in You differentiate this inner product here in time, so when you differentiate the projection divergence tau equation, so then you have in that equation, you actually have a Laplace U. So the inner product with U would generate a gradient U, which is something that already helps. So in general, when you differentiate this inner product, you also get a better terms. So for example, get a better term in... So, for example, we get a better term in terms of tau. But fortunately, because tau has a dissipation, so this bear term can be controlled by the dissipation in the equation of tau. So, and then you obtain quite a few non-linear terms. So, fortunately, all the non-linear terms can be controlled. Once you have the dissipation in tau, and then you have this extra. Extra dissipation from the company in you, then all the terms can be suitable bounded. So, here, for example, for one of the terms here, the bound is actually not very hot. So, you can just use solid embedding holders in quality. You can bound them. And then, so if we estimate all the terms, I did not put down all the details here, and then we integrate them. And then we're integrating time, then that allows us to show the energy functional. So the energy functional, including the standard HS normal subordinate and also the dissipation from the tau equation, that's a fractional dissipation, and then the extra dissipation for the velocity field generated from the inner product. So we can show that this energy function. So we can show that this energy function now is actually satisfies this type of inequality. So the E t less than or equal to E zero and then plus say E2 three halves. So once we have this type of inequality, then we can apply a standard Bulletstring argument. Then we can show that that will say if a G0 is small enough, say Small enough, say for some epsilon sufficient small, then we can show that E remains small for all time. And then it's actually bounded by constant times the initial smallness. And that will give us the global HS bound. And then that allows us to show the global web hoseness. So, okay, so that's pretty much the first part. So let me move on to Me move on to the second example. So, the second example here involves a two-dimensional MHG system. So, let's say. But let me quickly just review a simple fact on the 2D-Whaler-like equation. So, this is the 2D-Whaler equation, and this is our vorticity transported by the velocity field. So, for the Tudi-Whaler equation, the classical Eudovich theory says that if all Eudovich's theory says that if omega zero and L1 intersect in L infinity, you have a unique global weak solution. Eudovich's approach really relies on the fact that the vorticity is bounded appearily. So when the vorticity is not alone to be bounded, then the UWH approach would fail. So as in the following example here, so in this example here, the equation has actually term. Has X u term given by R1's vorticity. So if this is zero, this is pretty well. So R1 here is a Raised transform. The standard Raisi transform is partial xi lambda inverse. So for this equation here, the vorticity here is not alone to be bounded because Ries transform is not bounded in L infinity. So the vorticity L infinity is not known to be bounded. Is not known to be bounded, so the university approach fails. So, in fact, whether or not this equation has a global solution remains open. In addition, so in a recent work of Tarek and Nethermass Modi, they showed that in fact this equation has L infinity normal inflation. So they constructed an exponential initial vorticity such that initial vorticity such that the L infinity of the vorticity here can grow quite large in short time. So in this sense, this system, this simple equation here is actually Eopose. So however, as I'll show you, if we couple this Euler-like equation with the magnetic field, we can show the smoother detectable viposonis near background magnetic field. near background magnetic fail. So and the addition, the solution here is actually decay algebraically in time. So you don't see the normal inflation. So this is done in a recent work with Borderman and Ahuan Shanin. So let me tell you this or the system is. So here we have the we can either start with the velocity equation or directly start Velocity equation will directly start with the vorticity formulation. So for the velocity formulation here, it's a 2D Euler with an extra term. So the dumping is only in the second component, not in the first component. And the magnetic field satisfies the induction equation with magnetic diffusion. So that's the equation here. If we take the K, we will get the vorticity formulation. Vorticity formulation. So the vorticity formulation is exactly the totally well-alike equation and then with the extra term. So Jensen, so when Tommy is up, tell me to stop. Okay, so you still have five minutes. I still have five minutes. Okay. Great. So what he said is certifies the way I like equation. So, and then with extra term comes from the Lorentz-Forsen term. The Lorenzo Forsenthem. So the goal here is to show the global regularity and the stability near background magnetic field. So the steady state is taken to be velocity to be zero, and the magnetic field is taken to be zero, one. So it's in the X2 direction. So we have near this. So we have nearness a steady state. So we write down the equation for the perturbation. So that means that the little B here is a perturbation. So then the equation becomes this. So the only difference between this one and the original system is that the perturbation equation has two extra terms. So it's partial to B and partial to U. So you will write it again. So, you will write it again in terms of vorticity, and it is this system here. So, when b is zero, then j is also zero. And then this is exactly the 2D weather-like equation. So, that's the simple equation here. And the 2D weather-like equation can behave betterly. So, what that means is that we have to make a use of the magnetic. And we have to make a use of the magnetic field in order to show the global viposeness and the stability because this cool part, this velocity part, vorticity part here is already bad enough. So what we found here is that we also found a wave structure in the system. So if we again differentiate the vorticity equation in time and then make a several substantial And then make several substitutions, and then we found that the vorticity satisfies a wave equation. And also, the Karma density, which is the K of the magnetic field, so J is the K of magnetic field, satisfies exactly the same linear part of the wave equation. But of course, you got a lot of non-linear terms that are different. So if we know. If we look at this wave equation here, if you compare with the original vorticity equation, this one here shows much more regularization. So for example, here, so the first two terms, so partial T2 omega here and gamma R1 squared, partial T omega here, this directly comes from the original Nina pieces. Uh, nina pieces, but besides these two terms, uh, originally in your system, you actually say that eta la plus partial omega and gamma eta partial y1 omega. So these two terms, the cleanery, you can see has eta in it. It comes from the interaction, comes from magnetic field. So in addition, you also have partial total vorticity, and that comes from the expansion, yeah, the background magnetic field. Expansion near the background magnetic field. So you see that this is pretty much a dumping and a wave equation. So we can make a use of this regularization in a wave structure. What we can do here is that we construct a multi-layered energy function. So in terms of vorticity, so you have the L2 level energy, and then besides that, we have And now besides that, we have to sort of incorporate a term comes from the regularization due to the background magnetic field. So it mainly comes from the term here. So this extra energy piece comes from. So then the main efforts would be to show that this energy function of E, so you add all of them up as you. So, you add all of them up as your energy functional. So, we don't, we really need the last keys in order to control the non-linearity. So, then you can show that. Okay, so just your internet is not stable and we lost you for one second, but now it's okay. Now it's okay. It's okay now. You still have two minutes. Still have two minutes. Okay, so I'll stop in time. So, we can show that the energy function though actually sensifies this energy inequality. This involves, of course, lots of tedious estimates. And again, once we have this type of inequality, then the Burden-Schemi argument will show that if the initial energy function energy function E0 is sufficiently small, then ET is bounded uniformly for one time. So a constant times epsilon. And then that will allow us to get the global bounds and that will allow us to show the stability. So that's the main result. So the main result states that if the initial HS3 norm is sufficiently small, then we have a unique global solution. Then we have a unique global solution that remains small. And furthermore, we also show that if we make an extra assumption on the L1 norm of the data, we can obtain optimal decay rates. So there's no normal inflation, but instead the decay like a heat equation. So let me just make a final remark. So this is the So this is the stability problem near background magnetic field is a big subject and lots of progress has been made. So for the university case, it was first done by Badosh, Sulem and Sulem in 88. For the partial deservation case, it was first done by San Huanin, Shunyi, and Pynzhang. So later on, this direction here was already developed. Any has already developed, and then lots of work has been done. And so, finally, the stabilizing effect for the magnetic field, so actually has observed in physical experiments. So here are some of the references in which the detail what is observed involving electric conducting fluids. So, all right. So, thank you very much. I'll stop here. Okay. Thank you, Jahon, for the very nice, interesting talk. Maybe we can have one question if anyone has one. Please unmute yourself if you have any question for Jia Hong. Yeah, I have a quick question for the first model. You should global web post is for small data. Right, right. So this does not contradict with the blob, you know, the Tom Tom Hall and the numerical competition because the the data maybe is large, right? So so for large data, maybe it's Maybe for large data, this is an open problem. So for 3D oil alone, in general, it does not really have the modular global results because for oil, it's a skinny environment. But for this equation here, it's really the other physical quantity, the nanotechnologist stress tensor here has a smooth. Tensor here has a smoothing and a stabilizing effect on the fluid. So, even though you don't see it from the equation itself, but if you manipulate it and then make sort of several substitutions, you will find that the velocity equation actually satisfy a much regularized system. So, it's like the wave structure we like this. So, physically, the other physical quantity regulates and stabilizes the fluid so that it don't really have any potential singularity. Okay, thank you for the nice talk. And yeah, thank you very much. Yeah, let's thank Jia Hong again for the nice talk and Nada.
