From uh global theory for one frequency shutting output. So please go ahead. Okay, thanks for the introduction. I also like to say thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to give this talk. Okay, the title of my talk is Multiplicative Jensen's Formula and Quantitative Global Theory for Bound Frequency Huntering Objects. Okay, in this title, you can see two couple of words. The first Two couple of words. The first couple of awards is multiplicative Jensen's formula. The second couple of awards is quantitative global theory. So I will first explain these words. Okay, before I start to talk, this is a joint work with Sweater Lana Jesus Nikai, Jiang Gong Yu and Qizhou. Okay, first I'd like to explain to you what does multiplicative mean? You, what does multiplicative mean? So, it actually comes from a multiplicative Jensen ergodic theorem. So, we all know that the classical ergodic theorem says if we have a triple pair, this triple pair is ergodic, certainly x mu t, it is ergodic. And we have a marriable function. Then you can consider the average of this function along this orbit. Then, the ergodic system says this limit. The Egodus theorem says this limit exists for almost every x, and actually, this limit equals to the space average of this f. Okay, this is egotistical theorem. And later, Kingman generalized this egg theorem to the so-called, nowadays we call it the modificative egotism theorem. So the difference is you still consider a triple pair x mu t, but you replace this. But you replace this Mabel function here by a Mabel matrix. Then you can consider the product of this matrix, then you take a logarithm norm of this matrix, and then you consider the average of the logarithm norm of this product and take the limit. And this guy, if you consider this A as a function, then the logarithm of the products of function just means the sum of this function. The sum of this function. So it reduces to the eigotic theorem. But here, here, now this is a matrix. It is a we know the modification of matrix is not commutable. So this is why we call it a modificative eigotic theorem. And anyway, this limit theory exists for mu almost every x. And the still we have a name for this limit. It is called the maximum Liam exponent. Okay, this is. Exponent. Okay, this is the from egg theorem to multiplicative egotism. You just replace a function, variable function, by a variable matrix, and then you can do the same thing. And now maybe you have the feeling that what does a multiplicative chance formula mean? So just first you have a chance formula here. And then you replace the native function by an added matrix in this Jensen's formula. In this gen's formula. It is of this flavor, but not exactly the same way. But not let's explain. First, I'd like to introduce to you what is Jesus' formula. This is a very fundamental formula. Everyone knows it. It is a fundamental formula in complex analysis. So this formula says if you have a native function on some closed stick about the origin, and you know all the zeros. You all know you know all the zeros of this function in the interior of this disk. Then, this formula says if you consider the logarithm norm of this function, the average of the logarithm norm of this function over this circle or radius e to epsilon. You can represent this integral by the zeros of this function in this circle, inside this circle. Okay. This circle. Okay, so it just means if you consider the average of this integrals, then if you know all the zeros of this function, then you can give a representation formula of this integral. And actually, you can see here, if you use the right side as a function of epsilon, it is a piecewise affine function. And now if we denote this integral. We denote this integral here. This integral, this means the integral of this logarithm fz over this circle, this circle, the radius of this circle is e to epsilon. So we know this, we use this notation. Then you can rewrite this multiplication, rewrite this Jensen's formula in this way. It equals to this equal integral equals to the integral of over the unit circle plus some. Over the unit circle plus some linear piecewise affine function. Okay. And actually, you can see the turning points of this piecewise affine function are exactly the logarithm AI. AI is zeros. Okay. This is the classical Jensen's formula. And we can take another look at this Jensen formula. Actually, you know that Jensen's formula has nothing to do with dynamics. Do with dynamics, so where the modificative comes, and actually, you can take a look at this ergodic theorem for a function. If you take this as a log f, then this integral of log f appears in this ergodic theorem. So, actually, we have another representation of this I epsilon f artificially, you can it can be written. Artificially, you can it can be written in this way by Eggard's theorem and uh and uh okay multiplicative uh says you can replace this function f by a matrix, right? Here, because we want to prove something for for Jensen's formula. So instead of considering mirror matrix, we consider a netting matrix. Then, by multiplying new ergodic theorem, you can know this limit if you No, this limit, if you replace the function f by a matrix A here, this limit still exists. This is just the maximum Lyman exponent. So it's natural since this R epsilon F and L epsilon A is exactly similar quantity. So just replace the function by a matrix, it's natural to ask: do we have a similar Jensen's formula for this? For this L epsilon A. So here A is a netting method. So this is what we mean by the multiplicative Jensen's formula. Okay, in general, if you consider any M by M an adding matrix, this question can be not so difficult, not so easy. And today we will talk about special case. This is perhaps we will consider a special metric. A special matrix. This matrix is the so-called one-frequency shooting orbiter. I'd like to point out that here, this shooting cycle is perhaps the most important class of SL2R cycles that is homotopic to the identity. Okay, anyway, we do not consider very general metrics, but here we consider a special case, we consider the Schrodinger cycle. Case we consider the shortening of cycle. Motivation for this is one is from the general generalization on Jensen's formula. Another one is because this Schrodinger crystal is closely related to the spectral theory of Schrodinger orbiters. We do expect this formula will have some spectral applications. Actually, it does. We will talk about this later. Okay, anyway, we will consider this Shuden Kusako. Jingo and Yixian also mentioned the Jingong and Yixian also mentioned this guy many times, so I will not talk too much about it. Anyway, you consider a very special two by two announcing matrix, then you can define, you can define the Lyman exponent of this cuclear, right? And actually, this is exactly this epsilon E is exactly this maximum Lyman exponent. Maximum Liam exponent. So, here now the question is: can we prove Jian Sen's formula for this guy, for this Liam exponent? So, today the main result is to answer this question. The answer is yes. So, actually, we can prove that you can find some two or Liam exponents. This two Liam exponents are not artificial. They are topological. Are not artificial, they are topological invariants actually. And anyway, you can find some coordinates here, and then you will have a representation of this L epsilon E is equals to L0E plus some piecewise a following function. Okay, now you can compare this formula with the Jensen's formula. The Jensen's formula here says this I epsilon f equals to I0F plus some piecewise a function. Some piecewise affine functions, and this is exactly this formula is exactly in the same way, but you only need to replace the only difference is you replace this the log AI in Jason's formula by this RIE. And this AIE later will explain what does this RIE mean. Actually, they are not artificial quantities. They are some Lyman exponents. Some Lamb exponents of the dual system. They are very defined quantities. Okay, anyway, we have exactly the same formula for this Liam exponent just as the functions. And since we know for a non-different function, the genesis formula is a very powerful tool to study many problems such as the distribution of values of a native function. So now you So now you can expect this formula also plays some very important role to study the symptotics of the Schrodinger cycles or the spectral. Actually, this formula is closely related to spectral theory of Schrodinger orbiters. So here, so in this formula, you will see that this RIE are very important. Actually, they will play a fundamental. Actually, they will play a fundamental role as the log AI, these zeros as a functions. Okay, now, as I promised, I should first explain what does this two Yama exponents mean. So let's first, to explain this, we will consider a special case. Instead of consider a native function, you consider the trigonometric polynomial case. metric polynomial case. In this case, here is the shorting, this is the shorting orbiter. Okay, Jingong and Yixian also mentioned this for many times, so I will not say anything about it. And for this orbiter, a very important concept for this orbit, one frequency shooting orbiter is the duality, orbit duality. So for this operator, certainly you can define, we can define a dual operator in this way. So see here, BK. So see here, Vk is just the free coefficient, coefficients of this trigonometrical polynomial. So you just change this free Labla channel to some 2D difference or better. And you change this potential V to some two cosine. Two cosine was generated by this disgrace Laplace. So roughly speaking, this kind of arbitrary is some kind of Fourier transformation of the first equation. Transformation of the first equation. So you get another equation. And now we can explain what the dual diameter exponents mean. So for the dual system, actually you can see that it induces a family of quasi-puriodic, complex symbolic cycles. So this is 2D by 2D matrix. For this 2D by 2D matrix, you can define Lyman exponents. Actually, you have Actually, you have you like the SL2R case, you have you have 2D Lyman exponents. But since it is complex symplectic, so the Lyman exponents come into pairs. So actually you have D non-negative Lama exponents. And in this case, this gamma and I are exactly the dual Lama exponents. Okay. I'm sorry, so you assume, so you assume that your potential is delta to. This is the assumption for this theorem, it is for any real magic, real real analytic V. But here to explain this, actually for any real analytic V, we have a way to define this dual Liam exponents. But for trigonometrical polynomial case, it is a very natural way. In general case, we will use approximation. will use our approximation yeah if the function is analytic you it will have infinitely many of lambda exponents uh yeah actually it has many lambda exponents but uh since we only consider this function uh in in a strip right x1 is smaller than h so only finite many lyama exponents uh plays a role for for the other lymph exponents that do not play any role okay okay thank you Okay, thank you. Okay, and so why we call this dual Lyman exponents? Because in the trigonometric polynomial case, this LI exactly the Lyman exponents of the dual system. So actually, if we consider this Lyman exponent, so we can denote this distinct Lyman exponents by this gamma ny, gamma n1, gamma n2 to gamma n. n1 gamma n2 to gamma n l so they have some multiplicities and then you since this is a piecewise of fine function to to state it's more clear clear to see see what this piecewise of function uh is so we can rewrite this piecewise of function uh piecewise affine function in this way so in this formula any anyway you do not need to look at this formula just just look at this picture you will find actually You will find actually for this piecewise function affine function, it is determined by the turning points and the slope, right? So you will find this gamma, the distinct gamma exponent of the dual system are exactly the turning points. So here you have several turning points, gamma n1, gamma n2 here, gamma n L. These are exactly the distinct Liam exponents of the dual system. And the slope is related to the multiplicity. Is related to the multiplicity of this gamma exponent. For example, the increase of this slope compared to the former one is exactly the multiplicity of this gamma and two. So it just means you have a piece of SL fine function and the turning points are the gamma exponents and the increase of the slope on each piece is exactly the multiplicity of this turning point. The multiplicity of these turning points. Okay. Okay, this is the picture of this epsilon E. And now this is a zero from a mathematical point. You just want to generalize the GNS formula to multiplicative genes formula. And as I said, that we another motivation for our Another motivation for our consideration for why we consider this Schrodinger cycle, not the others, is because we want to use this formula to study the spectral theory of Schrödinger orbiters. So we all know that Schrodinger cycles are closely related to the spectral theory of Schrodinger orbiters in this way. So also this Zhengong and Yi Xian mentioned this, I will skip this. So just just I will just say here. I will just say here: if you have a formal solution of this eigen equation, then this solution will satisfy some second-order recurrent relation. So if you have an initial data u0, u negative one, you can use the shoting of cycle to the iteration of the shorting of cycle to get the whole solution. So this Schrodinger cycle is certainly closely related to Schrodinger orbiters. And to start And to start with the second part, we start from Avalanche's global theory. Since, as I said at the beginning, that the second part is called the quantitative version of Avalanche's global theory. So, what does this quantitative version mean? So, first, let's talk about Avila's global theory. The global theory, why it is related to this, because Avila's global theory is based on Theory is based on the analysis on this R epson E. This L epsilon E is the complexified Lamb exponent. So exactly this L epsilon E appeared in our Jensen's formula, multiplicative Jensen's formula. Okay, for our global theory, in that paper, there are two fundamental facts. One fact is One fact is, I will first prove that for any real energy E, that if you consider this epsilon E, this function as a function of epsilon. So you fix E, consider it as a function as epsilon. And he proved that it is an even function and it is convex and it's a piecewise affine function in epsilon. And each slope, the slope of each piece is an integer. Piece is an integer. Okay. In other words, you proved that L epsilon E is exactly this picture, but you should delete these turning points, the information about the turning points and the information about the slope. So anyway, he proved that Erpson exactly has this picture, but this kind of picture is already very powerful. Already very powerful to prove some spectral problems. So, maybe you will ask if this picture is enough to study all spectral problems, then you do not need to know your information about the turning points and the slope. But the answer is no. Actually, the information about the slope and the turning points, the exact value of the turning points are also very important. For example, one very concept, very important. Important concept introduced by the global theory is called the acceleration. Defined in this way. So now you know this epsilon E is a piecewise function, a fine function. Actually, this acceleration is the slope of the first piece, right? So, and he Avla also in Avla's paper, he expects that this omega E and this Leoma. And this Lyme exponent, this is the original Lyme exponent. You do not consider complex extension. So, this is a Lyme exponent of the Schrodinger cycle. And this is the expression. He expects that this two quantity will control the dynamical behavior of all alpha A. So, this acceleration is nothing but the slope of the first piece. So, actually, this quantity says this slope. quantity says this slope actually also plays the number of the slope also plays an important role later i will explain that actually the the the exact exact value of the turning points also plays a role to study the spectral problems and okay and before i go further it's always good to first consider uh a typical example that let's first apply our global theory to the almost mass theory operator actually you Actually, you will see the global theory exactly was exactly motivated by this case. So we consider a special case, you consider the almost massive orbiter. And this potential is very simple, just two lambda cosine, two pi theta. And it is well known that the spectrum of this orbiter does not depend on this theta. And for this orbiter, if you For this orbiter, if you, as I said here, the Lyme exponent and the acceleration where omega E will determine the total behavior of alpha S. So the good thing is for almost massive orbital, you can calculate almost everything for it. For example, you will find four typical situations. So the first one is if the energy is not in the spectrum, then the gamma exponent is larger than. The gamma exponent is larger than zero and the acceleration equals to zero. And if the energy is in the spectrum, then depending on the values of this lambda, you will find there are three different cases. So if lambda is modeled one, this is what we call the subcritical case. Then the lab exponent equals to zero and the acceleration equals to zero. So both of the values equal to zero. And for the third To zero. And for the so-called critical case, if lambda equals to one, then you will find the lambda exponent is still zero, but the acceleration is larger than zero here. And moreover, this acceleration is very special. It equals to one. And Lennar Albert said this value one is also important. So actually, the exact value of this acceleration is very important, also very important to study the spectral theory. And for the so-called supercritical case, then you. So-called supercultural case, then you will find that both the Lamb exponent and the acceleration are larger than zero. And the acceleration is also one. This is very special for almost massive orbit. And it turns out that this classification also is also true for general one-frequency shooting orbiters. So this is a very beautiful result that you can prove for general one-frequency shooting orbiter, you also have four situations. You also have four situations. So if E is not in the spectrum, you have the same characterization. And if E is in the spectrum, this spectrum means the spectrum of general one-focused shield orbiters. And actually, similar to the almost massive orbiter, you can define three cases depending on the vanishing of the M exponents and the Liam exponent and the acceleration. So the first case is a cybercutrap case. A supercontroller case and the second is critical. So, here the difference is the third case is supercontrolled. The difference between the general case and the shooting case is here. For the almost massive orbiter, you will find the acceleration is always small than or equal to one in the spectrum. But in general, you only know the acceleration. For example, for the silver card curves, the acceleration is larger than zero. It can be any number. Than zero, it can be any number, it can be much larger than one. So, after that, we will explain this is why for in the general case, it is much more complicated than the almost material case. So, okay. So, when you have this classification, we know for almost material orbiter, there is a one well known result called the metal insulator transition. So, for this classification, it For this classification, it actually determines the spectral properties of the almost massive orbit. For example, if lambda is smaller one, it has pure AC spectrum. If lambda equals to one, it has pure AC spectrum. If lambda is larger than this is the localization region. So actually, this classification is also closely related to the spectral decomposition of this operator. So a very big conjecture is when you have a When you have, you have a very general have the same classification for general long frequency shooting orbiters, you should expect so the similar phenomena happens for this orbiter. For example, one big conjecture, several big conjectures says one is the cybercrudo region supports the POAC spectrum. And similar things happens for the other regions, but this is widely open. But this is widely open. And for the subclutter regime, actually, there is already an answer. This conjecture is true that the proof is based on a famous conjecture by Avila, the so-called almost irreducibility conjecture. This conjecture says alpha A is almost irreducible if and only if I will not explain this concept. This concept just means some tool to study this coscal. If and only if this acceleration equals to zero. So, in other words, that it means this cybercritical, if this energy is supercritical, then the corresponding cuisine is almost irreducible. And actually, if you admit this conjecture is true, and then you can prove that the cybercritical region will only support AC spectrum. So this is a very big, big, very beautiful description of the spectrum for general low-frequency shooting operators. And okay, since we have a multiplicative gene formula for this airs on E, so we have some several calculations of this RX1E and this classification is based on LE and omega E. uh are and omega e omega e is the first logo of epsilon e so it's natural to expect that our our uh formula will have some applications for this classification theorem so it turns out uh the answer is true that we can give a completely new classization of all of this all these regions the first one is a new characterization of the spectrum Of the spectrum. So the spectrum, the energy in the spectrum means either the Liam exponent of the original system or the minimal Liam exponent. So this is the minimal Liam exponent of the dual system. And either one of them equals to zero. Okay, so this is the new calculation of the spectrum. And the next stage is we can give all different calculations. Or different categorizations of we can give different categorizations of all other regions. For example, the subcultural region means the dual. So the original one is categorized by LE equals to zero and omega e equals to zero. Here we replace omega e by this L e by the Lyman exponent. So so here you can have a general feeling. We know for the almost massive orbital, if you consider the duality. you if you consider the duality of orbit dual of the of the supercritical almost material orbiter it is a supercritical almost massive orbiter and here this confirms the the general feeling feeling that if you consider a general system you can have still have a dual system it means if this original system is subcritical it just means the dual system is supercritical here supercritical means for its dual system it has many many lambda exponents and all Many Lyman exponents, and all its Liam exponents are positive. So, this is one characterization for the subcritical region. And similarly, we can prove that the critical regime just means both the Liam exponent of original system and the minimum Liam exponent of the dual system equals to there. And another way is a new version of the supercoder region. You will find this is a supercoder if only if it's If only if its dual system has a zero Liam exponent, actually, the result is stronger. You can prove if this system is supercritical, then its dual system is supercritical. Later, I'll explain what does the supercritical of the dual system mean. Okay, now we have a new classification theorem. So you have new definitions of different regions. Also, maybe you can still ask: does this new classification help to study the spectral theory? Otherwise, why do you need this new classification? So the answer is also true. Actually, this new characterization of different regimes will bring us some new point of view to deal with different regimes. So before I go further, maybe I should first. Maybe I should first give some give the first application is to give a quantitative calculation of the acceleration. Okay, so as I promised here, we said for almost massive orbital the acceleration, one very important feature is the acceleration equals to one. And for general one frequency shooting orbiter, it is more complicated because the acceleration More complicated because the acceleration may be very large. So, that says the value of acceleration will play a role to study the spectral theory. So, what is this value here is characterization? And we prove that the value of the acceleration equals to the pair of zero Liam exponents of the dual system. So, for the dual system, you have many, many Liam expansion. So, for the dual system, you have many, many Liam exponents, but the acceleration just means the pair of dual Liam exponents of the dual system. So, since the dual system is symplectic, so the Liam exponents always come into pairs. Okay, so this actually gives a quantitative categorization of this acceleration. And from this categorization, a very, very easy corollary is acceleration is is acceleration is upper semi-continuous function in energy E because for the dual system you it is known that the all Liam exponents are positive so when you perm this energy E a little bit this the positive we know the positive Liam exponent Liam exponent is stable so so only the zero Liam exponent will decrease so so so the number of zero if you perturb the Liam exponent the energy E a little bit The energy E a little bit, the number of zero Liam exponents will only decrease. So this says the acceleration is the upper semicontinuous function. And from here, you can also see that if the acceleration becomes larger, then the pair of zero Liam exponents will become more. This also explains why from the point of dynamic system, why is when the acceleration becomes larger than the... becomes larger then then the system becomes becomes more complicated because you will see it will have more and more zero lambda exponents okay now now it's time to say something about our the applic the application of our new characterization theorem so the first one is so for for simplicity i will i will always assume the potential is analytic in is analytic in the following. So actually some of the rules also hold for general real analytic V. Here. Anyway, here we consider the potential is a trigonometric polynomial. Then this is the dual operator we defined before. And one important observation is, so we have a dual system. This dual system have many, many linear maximents. The observation is that this system is not so complicated. This system is not so complicated. It is a partially hyperbolic system. That means you will have associated to this cycle, you will have a decomposition. This is a 2D space. You will have partially hyperbolic decomposition. So here is the most expanded direction. Here is the most contracted direction. Here is the zero sin. Is the zero center direction. Okay, so although this system may have many, many Liam exponents, but actually only zero Liam exponent matters, since it is a partial hyperbolic system. And moreover, the dimension of the zero center equals to two times the acceleration. So if the acceleration equals to one, that just means the dimension of Just means the dimension of zero center direction equals to two. So this is a two by two matrix, and everything is complete, right? So this also explains why acceleration one potential is different from the others, because if acceleration is larger than one, for example, equals to two, here we have four-dimensional subspace. This is much more complicated than a two-dimensional subspace. And one important conjecture, so we have. One important conjecture we have here is for the since we can prove the dual system of the positive Lamb exponent is a subcritical. So, and now this is this is a high dimensional cybercritical cycle. This just means you have this is high, this is a two, for example, this is a 2D by 2D matrix, and it is also a separate in the sense of Avalas global theory. So, you can also put Global theory. So, you can also for a high-dimensional cosine, you can also define the subcritical. And so, the big conjecture here is so you can conjecture this cosine is almost irreducible. So, just mean something that the dual or positive land maximum, so the system is a 2D by 2D difference orbital, and it is, we have a cusy here. This cusy is almost irreducible. This is a symplectic cusy. cycle so so uh this is a wide and open conjecture it is uh very very very difficult to to to prove but anyway here it pro it provides us a new way to study the supercritical shooting orbiters because because it's dual system we expect that its dual system is almost reducible so that that indicates that one may use the almost reducibility uh technique to study the supercritical Technique to study the supercritical spectral performance just like the almost massive orbiter. And for the reducibility of the almost reducibility of the symbolic cycle, I refer you to the quicker talk, our first day talk, some interesting results on the reducibility of this simple. Of this symplectic cycle, I think maybe it is helpful to study the supercritical spectral problems by duality. Okay. Anyway, it provides a new way to deal with supercritical spectral problems. So this is how to deal with the supercritical spectral problems. Another point of view is to Point of view is to a new way to view the cybercritical region. And so the first application is to give a quantitative characterization of the cybercritical radius. So now let me explain what does the supercritical radius mean. So it just means, so cybercritical means the acceleration equals to zero. So that just means the first slope equal to the The slope of the first piece equals to zero. Okay, in this picture. Here, the first piece is flat. So the cybercritical radius just means the first turning point, this gamma n1. So the maximum epsilon such that epsilon E equals to zero. So just means this gamma n1. Okay, from this picture, you can also see that. You can also see that this separate critical radius actually equals to the minimal Liam exponent. So the first turning point is just the minimal Liam exponent, L hat 1E. Okay, actually there are two different quantities. One is subtle radius is defined from a subtle cross cycle. Another is the minimal Lambda exponent of the dual system. We know the dual system system is The dual system system is supercritical. So, this is actually this for the dual system, it is expected to take place under some localization. So, this is the minimum positive Liam exponent. So, actually, here, this formula relates this localization length of this two orbiter and the subcurrent radius of the original cycle. So, the two different quantities are closely related. And so, And so, why do we need to study this type of field radius? And another reason is actually it plays a very important role to give some optimal spectral estimates for the cybercritical cycles. For example, for the cybercritical almost massive orbiter, this cybercritical radius equals to negative log lambda, we know. Actually, this value plays a very important. Actually, this value plays a very important role in several sharp spectral estimates. For example, the asymptotics of spectral gaps or some growth of the generalized eigenfunctions, this exact value of this separate radius will play a very important role. So here is the exact calculation of this value. And a more important way is the new point to view the cypher region. As we mentioned before, that Before that, from our new definition, we can see that this original cuisine is subcritical if and only if the diamond exponents of this dual system are opposite. So that means this dual system is a strip orbiter. Actually, this is a finite difference orbiter, and all its realm exponents are positive. So it's natural to expect it has localization. And actually, when it indicates that one. It indicates that one can use the almost localization technique to prove the to study the almost reducibility conjecture and to use it to study the whole separatory region. Actually, here we will say a little bit about the almost reducibility conjecture, as I said before. Actually, for this conjecture, it depends on this arithmetic properties of this alpha. For beta alpha larger than zero, For beta alpha larger than zero, beta alpha larger than zero, because this frequency is due. This is this was proved by Avila in 2010. And if beta alpha equals to zero, that is in the density case, this is more difficult. And Avla announced this result in 2012. And his proof is based on the dynamic system. system dynamic system method and since here we we can we we see here we have a new way to view this separate region so uh based on this observation uh i give a new proof of this of this conjecture for shorting of cusy so that means for for the defining case if beta alpha equals to zero then uh this cusy is subcritical then we want to prove it is almost irreducible actually we would Actually, one can say more since here one have optimal, one has a characterization of the separate radius. Actually, in the trigonometric polynomial case, one can prove a strongest version of the almost reducibility. Actually, one can prove for almost reducibility, one only needs to shrink the analytic radius for arbitrary small. So, this is a very strong version of almost. This is a very strong version of almost reducibility. Okay, so as you can see, our new definition gives new point to view different regions, the supremacy region and the cypocritical region. And both of them were, we expect it to have, they will have some special applications. So the remaining part is the critical case. So the question is, do you also have an application for the critical case? Application for the critical case. So, actually, the answer is also yes. So, here is a very simple application for the critical case. So, we know that for the critical almost massive orbiter, the spectrum is purely singular. This follows by this fact that the back measure of the spectral set is zero. And from Quotani theory, you know it has this over the critical. It have this orbiter, the critical almost massive orbiter over how purely singular spectrum. And one generalization is you don't need to consider the almost massive orbiter. You just consider a shooting orbiter with trigonometric polynomial potential. And you only need to need that the largest the Fourier coefficient corresponding to the largest order. Into the largest order here. Vt equals to one, then we can prove this orbit also has purely single spectrum. This is the generalization for the almost method for this result. And actually, this result is based on our new calculation of the critical region. By our calculation, we can prove this orbiter, if LE equals to zero, it can only corresponding to the critical energy E. So that means there is no subcritical energy. There is no subcritical energy E. So it means since by renormalization, we know that the critical energy, the Lebesgue measure of the critical energy equals to zero. So by Cotani theory, you can also prove the similar result. So actually, this application has also have some other spectral application and the physical applications. I think I should run out of time. Here, then the proof, I will skip the proof. Okay, thank you so much for your attention. In principle, you still had a few minutes, though. But are there some maybe shortly give some short overview of what you want? Some short overview of what you wanted to say at the end in the proof. Ah, okay, okay. Thank you. So, for the general idea of the proof is you still need to use over duality. The original orbitality holds for only the real analytic potentials. But for general, for things we need to consider the complexified Liam exponents. So, certainly you need to consider the complex. Consider the complexified shorting orbiter. So the difficulty is for this new orbiter, it is not self-adjoint anymore. Because when this is a complex, V is a now is a complex function. So it is not self-adjoint. But you can still consider the operator of this orbiter. You will find from this orbiter, the original orbiter, you do not see any directly the relationship between Directly the relationship between V theta plus and the V theta plus is on you don't know the relationship, but from its two orbiter you can see it clearly that its two orbiter is now is a new one. This new orbiter is non-self-adjoint, but it is not so worth. It is a new one, but it is closely related to the original one because the original one here epsilon equals to zero, but the new one But the new one here we have E2K epsilon. And this relationship is very simple. And actually, if you write the cosycle of this new difference orbiter, you will find a very simple, observed relationship that the cusycle corresponding to L theta epsilon is similar to the original one. So the original L means this epsilon equals. L means this epsilon equals to zero is similar to this original one up to scaling. Scaling is e to epsilon. So although this the original cosine, we don't know the information about the original one, but for the it's dual orbiter, we know when epsilon is not zero, we know the relation between the L epsilon and the L. So this observation will give you some observation will give you some observation of the lamb exponent of the new system because because the new system is just similar to the original the new cushion is just similar to the original cusy and up to a scaling so if you consider the system the lamb exponents of the new system is just just the original the lama exponents of the original system plus some epsilon then there is a no result for when There is a no result for when epsilon equals to zero, there's a result that this L E equals to the sum of non-negative Lyman exponent of the dual system. So the Lyam exponents of the original system and the dual system have some certain relationship. So when you consider this L epsilon E, it is certainly natural to expect this L epsilon E also has some relationship to the dual, the Lamb exponent of The Liam exponent of the new tool system. And we know the Liam exponent of the new tool system is exactly these guys. And we will actually prove a similar result that the Liam exponent of this new system equals to also equals to the non-negative Liam exponent of the dual system. But now you should check that for the new system, the Liam exponent, the non-negative Liam exponent will increase because. Negative Liam exponent will increase because when epsilon you will plus epsilon here, so some negative Liam exponent will become non-negative. So here you will see the change when epsilon goes through this turning point here. But the difficulty is here. For Pug and Harrow's proof, they use the self-adjointness of this orbiter. Actually, they prove if there is an epsilon equals to zero. If there is an epsilon equals to zero, then both of these orbitals are self-adjoint, and then you can define the integrated states. Then, this result actually follows from the Solar's formula. For both sides, you have Solus formula, and for integrated states, they are equal. So, you can prove this formula by the invariance of the integrated states of these two systems. But the difficulty is now if epsilon is not zero, then there's not no self-adjointness. There's not no self-adjointness. So certainly there is some way to define the inward denial states, but that way it does not work. And one cannot use the spectrum method to prove this formula. One should use some other method to prove this. Actually, we have struggled with this for more than one or two years. Finally, we find that there is a dynamical way to prove this formula. Prove this formula and from some information about the Green's function and from solutions from a dynamic system way to prove this formula. So this is the most technical part of our result. Okay. I think I should stop here. Okay, okay, just the last piece. So here now we only consider the trigonometrical polynomial case and Polynomial case. And so for the real analytic case, so actually there are some difficulties. This is an infinite dimensional difference orbiter. So one cannot, there is no cosine. You cannot define Lyman exponents. But maybe there is some way to define orbiter-valued cosico. You can define Lyman exponents. The cosine, you can define lambda exponent, but it seems not trivial to define the exponents. But our idea is to use trigonometrical polynomial approximation this V. And for trigonometric polynomial case, we know we can define the Lamb exponents. And our strategy is to prove that actually this Lyman exponents will converges to some point, and we will use the limit point. The limit point of the trigonometrical polynomial case to define the Lyman exponent for this real analytic case. So, this is the whole part. Actually, another technical part is this limit exists is also an issue because we don't know why this is not trivial why this limit exists. This is also one thing we need to prove. Okay, this is the whole proof. Thank you so much for your attention. Thank you so much for your attention. Okay, thank you very much. Are there questions from the audience online or in person? So maybe I start. So you showed us at the beginning this Jensen's formula, this generalized one, right? Can you say again how this enters in all the considerations? Enters in all the considerations you had at the end. So, yeah, this is the one for the matrices, the Jensen's multiplicative formula. Yeah. Can you explain again how it enters there? So, so you mean multiplicative Jensen's formula, right? The multiplicative. The multiplicative, so not this side, it was some slide later. Yeah, yeah. So, so we know that Jensen's formula was for this I epsilon f, right? Yes. And this I epsilon f actually equals to, by ergodic theorem, it equals to this limit for almost every z, right? In this on this circle. Yeah. And Yeah, and then in the right side, you can replace this function f by a matrix, right? My question is more like, so you said this is useful for what you're doing, right? Later on, and my question was: can you explain where it is useful, so where it enters? That's what I okay, okay, thank you. Uh, this is the Euro exactly, where does this enter? That was my question. Exactly, where does this get to? That was my question. Okay, okay, okay. So, for this formula, you know that we give this in this formula, the most important information is you give the this R I E. It is a piecewise function. This was approved by Avila. And the information we give, more information we give is, we give the turning points of this piecewise function. Here, I should see this picture. This see this picture. So for this picture, I will already prove that this picture is piecewise a fine function, but he did not give any information on this turning point and on this slope. And if we have this formula here, if we have this formula, we can guide down, from this formula, we can know all the turning points and all the slope. But in the later theorems, it seems like that most of the time had one head from all the right. Okay. Then in Aba's global theory, one important thing is this quantity is the slope of the first piece, right? This is the slope of the first piece of this piecewise of fine function. Of fine function. And actually, this our formula actually certainly gives us the information about the slope of the first piece. For example, for this function, if the first turning point is larger than zero, that means the first piece is flat, right? If the first turning point is zero, then depends on the value of the first turning points. the the value of the first 10 points this this uh this this uh first piece will be different right and uh and uh actually uh for our global theory for this global classification it it it matters that uh if the for the first piece the the the slope is zero the slope is positive right and so from this picture you can see the first piece if the slope The first piece, if the slope is zero, that just means the first turning point is larger than zero. If for the first piece, the slope is positive, that just means the first turning points is zero, right? So here is why we can give a new classification. Here, omega zero equals to zero. The slope equals to zero just means the first turning points is positive here. This is the first turning points. This is by our. Is the first turning point? This is by our formula because in our formula, we can show you that all the turning points are exactly this RI. So, this is the first turning points. So, in our global theory, actually, the first slope, for the first piece, the slope is zero. Just means the minimal Yam exponent, this first turning point is positive. And here, for the first piece, the acceleration, for the first. The acceleration for the first piece, the slope is positive, just means the first turning point is zero. And how does the other turning points come into the game? Yeah, here. This guy is larger than zero. That just means the first turning point is zero, right? In this picture. And the first turning point is zero. Turning point is zero, we proved the first turning point is this L1. Because in our formula, we can prove the first the turning points, the turning points are exactly this Li. This Ri. So we can prove, so if the first turning point is zero, that just means this R1 equals zero, because R1 is the first turning point by our formula. And this omega equal to larger than zero means. Mega E equals larger than zero means the first turning point is zero. So this means L1 equals to zero. Make sense? Thank you very much. First questions. Thank you. I just have a clarifying question. Everything here refers to the analytic category, right? That's true and metric polynomials, but that was just illustration, right? For you you mean for the general case? You mean for the general case? Yes. Yeah. You mean for general case, do we expect similar formula for? Yes. Yeah. In general case, I think if this is a netting matrix, then by Avella, Determinista, and Sador's paper, you can still prove this. Paper, you can still prove this is a piecewise a fine function, but the slope is maybe the slope is not an integer, can be some fractional. So the question is, in this case, we do not know how to find a dual system because in the Schrodinger case, we can define the over duality and you can use duality and these two systems are naturally related. But in the general case, suddenly you. But in the general case, certainly you have some turning points and you have some, it is a piecewise fine function, but we don't know how to use a natural way to define some dual system to find these turning points. So that's the main difficulty now. For what? Is the paper already on the archive? You mean our paper? Yes, this paper. Is it on the archive already? Not now, but maybe yes, may appear soon. Joachim has a question. Okay. Okay, well, I think it's not that it will, we are running out of time, I think, and I will just to say a comment. Just that I would like to, I mean, I had been working in thinking in this kind of problems and wondering about this bundle decomposition that you talk about. And it's, I think, it, I am very happy, and I would like to congratulate all the authors because I think it's. The authors, because I think it's in my from a personal perspective, is a very beautiful result. And I think it can open the door to many, many applications and to some. It can add even more diversity to this already very diverse field of work. So thanks for pushing these problems. Thank you. Thank you so much. So you mean this partially hyperbolic system? Partially hyperbolic system, right? Yes. Yes, thank you so much. Yeah, yeah. It's very beautiful that you can find, relate the dimension of the central bundle with the acceleration of the core cycle. I think for me, it's very beautiful, really. Thank you so much. Yeah, it's also very inspiring for us. Yeah. Yes, thanks, Joachim, and indeed. Yes, thanks, Joachim. And indeed, your work on abridguality, your work with Karov has been inspirational for us. And Lingro, I wanted to ask, so your proof of the almost reducibility conjecture, I think it's really remarkable, but you listed on the slide, which says trigonometric polynomial case. But do I understand correctly that your proof actually works for general analytics? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The this this result is for real analytic case, but for the trigonometrical polynomial case, we can give a stronger result. So for the real analytic case, we can prove the almost irreducibility. But one need to shrink the analytic radius in some great loss. But for the trigonometric polynomial case, we can improve this result. We can shrink the analytic radius for arbitrarily small. For arbitrary small. Yeah, thank you. Is there any online question that I missed that I don't see? Okay, so then let's thank the speaker again for his nice talk and all the speakers of the morning session brief. But yeah, let's thank that.
