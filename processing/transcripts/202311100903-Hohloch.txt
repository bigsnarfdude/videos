The last day of the workshop. So the first talk will be by Sonia Holloff and the title title. Yeah, it's not exactly the same. The null title is Hyper Symmetoric Systems, Recent Developments, Advances. Okay, great. Okay, thanks a lot. And I also would like to thank the organizers to invite me to such a beautiful place. I haven't been To such a beautiful place. I haven't been here before, and it's great, I would say. And I guess everybody shares this opinion. And I think we also were quite lucky with the weather this week, so no fault, but I think it's really great. But I mean, what I'm talking about here is, well, let's put it like that. I mean, this conference was, at least half of all the talks were about something with fluids. And although I've done a lot of dynamical systems, so mainly Hamiltonian or Redding flows, with fluids, I have not. With fluids, I have not yet really been busy. So it's an opportunity maybe to pick up a couple of things. And originally, I'm coming from symplectic geometry, philomology, these kind of things. So questions of topology or geometry or symplectic manifolds were of interest to me. But not just by playing with topology, but also coming from, let's call it, somewhat hard analysis, because when you work with flow homology, you're busy with the Cauchy-Riemann equation, so this is PDE, and you have to do all these. With CPDE, and you have to do all these standard fretom estimates and regularity and so on and so on to prove to a certain extent at some point that the space of solution you're working with is compact and so on and so on. And at some point where I then ended up as postdoc with studio, he got me interested in a problem that has to do more with toric or integrable systems. And so somehow I got hooked there because that way one could find a load of Course, that way one could find in low dimensions nice examples for symplectic manifolds. Because when you're taking an integral of a system, I mean, it's it's well, I mean, it's living on a symplectic manifold, but it comes with the extra structure of having a nice vibration, particularly a nice Lagrangian vibration. And when you're interested in rigidity phen phenomena and these kinds of things, then I mean it's the point to start with. And in symbolic geometry they had a lot of, let's say, generic results, but not really maybe concrete results. But not really many concrete results, and so somehow this was the way I got hooked into these kinds of things. And I mean, we had already a bunch of different definitions of what integrable means. I'm busy here with dual integrability of Hamiltonian systems, so let me maybe briefly define that. So we have here m, omega, and f given by Given by F1 to Rn going from M to Rn. And this here is a selected manifold of dimension 2n. And here, I mean, this is a smooth map. And I won't have the additional properties. Well, I mean first of all the thing shouldn't be totally trivial. So I want to have that here the rank of the differential is n, but it's very like that rank f, which is more or less the same thing as the rank of the span of the adjoint Hamiltonian vector fields. And this I want to have almost everywhere because otherwise, I mean it's not really interesting. So, technically, I mean the Z where the system can do singularities is zero Z. And the other thing I want to have is, well, I need interprability and Well, I need integrability and UV integrability. This means that here the Poisson bracket is vanishing of the components of the function, and this is defined here via the symplectic form. So this is possible. Okay, so this is uh I should maybe say that this here is uh new management programmatic. So, I mean for those who are not familiar with it, the technical means we have n Hamiltonian systems and they are quite compatible in the sense that Quite compatible in the sense that the flow of one of them stays within the level set of the other one, so the solution restricts to the intersection of the level sets. Otherwise, from the point of view of physics, you could say that it's a system which has nice symmetries, n of them. The back measure, or you can take the symplectic volume, which is given by Is given by omega batch batch. Doesn't matter about that. Okay, and I mean, when you work with integral systems, you can look at them from different point of views. You could come just from the flows here, or you could look at it from the point of view of vibrations of that map, or you can have a look at uh actions, because what you certainly get is uh end action on end. Our end engine on end via just sending, let's say, the flow parameters t1 to the n at the point on the manifold to the concatenation of the flows. I mean, I can write it like this here. And this here is just a concatenation. Okay, and so I can always switch between various points of views. And also for the future, usually when I do something with actions, I assume them to be uh effective or faceful. So I mean I don't want to have that the thing is doubling up. And when you're working with integrals When you're working with integral system or with dynamical systems in general, I mean, there's a bunch of, let's say, classical questions you can ask yourself: like, can I classify? Can I classify globally, or can I classify at least locally, so local normal forms? You can also ask yourself, okay, given a bunch of properties that my system should have, can I come up with an explicit constructive way to construct it? And, well, I mean, if you're totally general, I mean, it's usually. I mean, it's usually quite hopeless to do anything because anything could happen more or less. So the point is one needs to impose some conditions. And usually one starts with easier stuff and then tries to get more involved. Let's say maybe something like that. Must be one as classification. And then you could ask local. And then you could ask local, global, or then you can ask under this aspect, subplectic, ecological, and so on. And certainly the other way is constructions. Okay, and if you're looking here at the nicest and easiest of all big groups, more or less in situation, you would end up with an eight class. So you're busy with toric systems. And for so So, if you have that this thing here is in fact a P in action, then you're busy with Toric systems. And they have been classified symplectically already in 1988, so by the zone. By their zone. And I mean, if one comes from this totally general situation, where anything could happen, I at least found it very surprising that this situation here is not just very nice, but super nice. And when you come originally from the point of view of PDEs, you're also somehow tempted to say it's totally trivial. Because what's happening is, if you have it say such a manifold here, Say such a manifold here, then that if you map that thing here just to the image of the momentum map, so here you have some whatever manifold with a flow on it and whatever else, that thing turns out to be a polytope in the sense of really nice. And I mean a polytope with straight edges or a basin zone is determined by its vertices. So you have here. So you have here an infinite number of points that determine everything here. And I mean, on the one hand, so as it's coming from PDEs, first you don't believe it, and then you think, oh, this is trivial. And then when you give it a second thought, you can think of it as some kind of skeleton. It's a little bit like if you consider, let's say, a human being. I mean, in the human being, you have the skeleton. And around the skeleton, you have the flesh, the muscles, the organs, and so on and so on. And so on and so on. And so, if one comes here from the species situation and tries to generalize it, one could try to save along the way parts of the supernatur situation. So, to give you some idea, what I mean is this is not the only thing that was somehow classified. Then, for example, Carson, and I think 1999. I mean, she was in dimension four. I hear I should say, maybe the men. Here I should say maybe the manifold here is compact because otherwise it's otherwise it's a little bit more difficult. And here also dimension 4 and compact. I mean that by now it has been somewhat generalized. And she managed to classify as one actions. And I should also say here this is And I should also say here, this is a symplectic classification, not topological. So really, I mean, given that polytope, you can reconstruct a symbolic manifold with the thing on it explicitly. And this is a classification of S1 actions or helium S1 actions. I mean as one action doesn't sound as general, let's say, as if you would talk about just having to system with some periodic flow. And I mean the point was that thing could be justified via some kind of graph. And here again, I mean, it's the thing is a discrete thing. Discrete thing, which is also quite astonishing that given Hamiltonian with a parallel flow on a compact manifold, by the number of things tells you what's going on. So again, you can use these things as some kind of skeleton if you could generalize. Okay, and well done this also happened somehow. I think it started somewhere around 2003, 2004 or so, that Stanton Bog, I think he's the land, said, but okay, I mean, let's be here in dimension 4 and let's see if I have an octor. Let's see if I have an octoric, but if I have a second integral, which may give me an R action. What can we do then? So let's say it's called F one, F two, somewhat related to What related to S1 times R actually? Okay, but I mean here we look at this situation, you still can have lots of sub cases. I mean when we are torque, let me maybe draw here a picture, but I feel such a nice polytope and I want to know the vibration over it, so I come from M here with my vibration F over that thing sitting in our N or R2 or whatever. Or n or two, or whatever. Here, the dimension of the strata tells me actually what the fiber is. In this situation, I mean, here over the vertices, I just can have a fixed point. Here, over, I mean, no, in dimension two, here you could have circles, here in the middle you have the the final circle rank, and so on and so on. So, I mean, that way some of one can see that one can nicely build up the metaphor over this kind of things here. Manifold over this kind of things here. So one can explicitly see what's going on. And here, so technically, here the singularities that it could have are some mixture out of well these kind of fixed points or well this elliptic with something that moves. So let me maybe remark here somewhere that if you are looking for non-determined singularities, there's a local normal form. A normal form where, whenever one quotes the thing in the paper, one has to be very careful when one gives as references to prove that thing, because I mean this was an ongoing process since 50 years to get that thing, and the person whose name attached to it somehow did it in the thesis, but there's a bunch of gaps in it, so other people fix stuff. And so let's just call it local normal form. for one-degenerate singularities of pink-turbo systems. And there you could splitting nicely, so you could have regular components, you could have elliptic components, you could have pumps and pairs, focus focus. Focus, or you can have hyperbolic. And now let's see what's actually happening there. So the storage, you have combinations of elliptic and regular, let's say. And with whatever von Bogden started, technically you could have more, but what he wanted to have was something which he calls sigmitoric. And there he said, Well, okay, I want to have elliptic stuff. I want to have focus-focus. And stuff is also emitted. So when you draw a picture of what's going on, I mean here in this toric situation, you could have fixed points or fibers could be, let's say, circles or toy. I mean, this is all not leaville that gives us in the middle. I mean, this is Arnold Leuvel that gives us in the middle if you're in a compact situation. And what's happening here is when you look at the image of the momentum map, that thing is not a nice polygon in the sense that you have straight edges, but it is still somewhat of a polygon in the sense that it's just some kind of curvy thing, where you still can see somehow some vertices, and you have the same behavior more or less that you have here in the interior. Same behavior, more or less, that you have here in the interior, the nice non-degenerate tori. Here you have fixed points, here you have with a surface over that thing. But in addition, you could also have some kind of singularities here in the middle, isolated ones, where you have a so-called focus-focus fiber. And from a geometric point of view, you can see it as some kind of torus where you pinched one here, one cell. I mean, it's a little bit the same thing which would show up in Leftshare's vibrations. Complexity of the image. Yeah. But I mean, now it comes. This was the thing where I'm talking about the skeleton. Humbug noticed that he was busy here with S1 times R plus this constraint that he only wants to admit this here as new stuff. And then he notices. New stuff, and then you notice actually that you can come up with construction to straighten that thing out. I mean, the main trouble is that thing here introduces curvature, so it's twisting the image, it's twisting everything. So to get rid of it, he said, well, okay, let's just cut from the boundary to that thing and keep everything else. If you do that, then, I mean, technically on a learial or whatever this tells you, everywhere, you don't have any kind of nasty stuff, you have actually anger coordinates. Nasty stuff with actual angle coordinates. So by paying some kind of price for having this kind of cut here, you're again nice and tall apart from where you have here this cut, whatever. Of course, it's also a choice of cut from above or from below and so on and so on. But at least you can see that this is quite topic. And I mean then you also manage to look at how to classify in your How to classify here these focus values, and we came up with some description by means of a Taylor series, which is some kind of Birkov normal form, I would say, to see what kind of how the vibration would look nearby. And he was also looking for other couple of things, and at some point, I think it was 2009 until 2011, I mean it is together with Albuquerque. Albo Pelayo, they managed to classify this stuff sympathetically and depend on how you write it down. Usually one says in terms of five invariants, but they depend a little bit so you can Okay, good. But this here is a patchwork classification. In the sense of they have a bunch of local maps, local things that could happen, they patch it together, so I mean, and then come up with a system. And they could also say what you need in order to classify. So this is not constructive in the sense or not global. Not constructive in the sense of global, not glo really constructive. Okay, and I mean the funny thing was they wrote down this classification without being able to calculate one single example in full glory, let's say, because how should I say? I mean, first we need nice. I mean, first, we need nice examples. This is not that bad. You can have coupled angle momentum or coupled spin oscillator. So, technically, let's say you take two spheres, coupled rotation, and then you look at the preserved angle, and this is your second integral. So, I mean, it's not a big deal to come up with these examples. But here to get some of these invariants is non-trivial. I mean, you need to calculate really, I mean, these Taylor series that tell you how this looks like. This looks like, and this was then done by Broad Durin, a PhD student of mine, and myself. Later on, I mean, we managed then after some preliminary work for other people to classify or calculate myself. So we calculated that for coupled spin oscillator and coupled angular momentum. And I mean these are systems that only have one focus focus point and then nevertheless you think some maybe not so super interesting. But then at some point we well first comes the question can we construct globally in a nice way systems that have more than one focus, focus point? Have more than one focus, focus point. So, for example, when you look at it from the point of view of bifurcation theory, you just take a nice toric system which has this kind of here as image of the mental map, so as f on m here you have these elliptic points, and then you could just think about some deformation to make them work here and then get here in that way this. And then get here, in that way, these focus, focus virus. But you have one, it was done by Sadostin Zielinski some 20 years ago, but nobody had done it for a tour, not in an explicit way. And together with Joseph Palmer, we managed to construct that scenario. And it was a little bit like fiddling around. Like fiddling around. I mean, we had seen what Sedostin Silvinsky did, and so we thought, well, it's a duct develop the parameters and so on. And it worked out after some payloads in the beginning. But the question, of course, is there some general theory behind it? Because here, in this situation, there's an excellent construction. I mean, it's mainly linear algebra, so you can ask the master students to do this, just works out. To do this, just works out, but I mean, so the question comes: there's something sitting behind. And I mean, somehow the attempt here was to look at it as a convex combination of perfect systems with some bifurcation parameter, or attack we were busy with for in the beginning. And inspired by that thing, Joey Palmer teamed up with John LeFloch and they wrote two big preprints. I mean, I'm talking about 100 plus something. I'm talking about 100 plus 150 pages or something like that, where they somehow came up with minimal models and good strategies how to get from via complex combinations of Tauric systems or via adding certain terms, the higher order terms, how to explain decent, let's call it the design-like construction, so a global construction, how to get symmetric systems. So let's say this went to this role. This is the flow prime one. So, I mean, they data point minimum models plus the zone type construction. So, they were going from toric to semi-toric in this direction? Yep, I mean, usually what they try to do is they try to start with one to. With one torque system, one torque system, and then you try to connect their connects combination or something like that and see what's happening in the middle. Control that, and in particular to come up with some good understanding why you need to do what. So, what technically happened was at some point you look at the reduced spaces, and on the reduced basis, you're starting out here from 24-dimensional fibers. Fibers of the system, then, I mean, level sets, dimension three, of the S1 action. You divide by this one action, we're down to dimension two of the reduced phase. And in dimension two, I mean, many things between MOS theory and here the Hamilton systems, they have some kind of mirror. And there you can do explicit construction, you can understand what's actually going on, what kind of invariant functions you need to add, and that way you could find good criteria, what kind of What kind of drums to add, and also to make it more general? Originally, they came from interpolating Turk stuff, but then they have more general methods. So, this is quite interesting. What I also should say is here, Johannel Floch, together with Selm from Bog, they are also more coming from the mathematical physics side or from the operator theory side. So, they're working also with quantile systems. And after somehow, this situation was understood in the classical side. Understood in a classical sense, they managed last year, I think, to solve the so-called inverse problem for the joint spectrum. So, what they could do is they work as semi-to-systems, calculate the so-called joint spectrum, so the eigenvalues and so on, these kind of things, and from these kind of things reconstruct all the invariants. And so, altogether, I mean, when I now look at the calculated examples, the construction method, and so on, I'm a little bit tempted to. I'm a little bit tempted to say that the symmetric situation is somewhat solved in the sense that one understands it quite well, at least compared to 10 years ago. And I come to course the question, what now? Because when I'm talking about constructions, there's also a bunch of other things you could be interested in. Maybe this is only dimensional work or it's a There, but it's PC, I think, in dimension four, but I think they also have Plato's examples in higher dimensions. As far as I know, I think Joy is together with Pseudonym, busy, and also in higher dimensions, I think. And there was also a PhD student here of Self-Roman Gog, who was also PCI single in dimension six, if you remember. Okay. But then now that I have this, so could also ask somewhat different question or if we want to construct stuff and if this as one action is something which should characterize these things, if we want to get rid of These things, and we want to get rid of this restriction to only elliptical and focus-focus things to see what also may happen here, let's say, of hyperbolic stuff. You could also see somehow what's happening if you don't admit it. In a sense that look at there is one action on the four-dimensional Let's say that thing here is described by integral of 1. So, what is the momentum map of that thing? And now you want a second thing such that f given by f1, f2 is 1. F1, F2, is a nice integral system. Okay, I mean, this question is not totally new. I mean, Kashon, when she did her classification, said conditions when you could extend the toric. This has to do with what kind. This has to do with what kind of stabilizers and so on could appear in the reaction. Then, at some point, together with Lyris Abattini, Daniel Seppe and Marguerite Simultan, we never really wrote it down. We found conditions such that that thing here is limitoric, fine, and together with Joseph Palmer. This was one or two years ago. We somehow could actually lift any kind of S1 action to a noisy system at one action. And then you notice actually you need to include hyperbolic stuff. And maybe to give you some idea why, it's a little bit like this. Here, the image was always something which was, well, I mean, nice polygon. This was not a branched cover or anything. This is just you have a nice fiber over a nice base. The very moment you admit hyperpoint singularities, it looks a little bit like this. Here, you have your base, then you would have, let's say, Then you would have, let's say, some line of hyperbolic points, and then you have some kind of flap, let's say, coming up, for example, which you could pull up a little bit like if the table here would be the base, that thing would be, you could think a little bit like that. So your fibers are disconnected. Let's say if you would have here this point, here the fiber then would be the point here coming from this edge plus from the underlying single. Plus, on the underlying thing, let's say it all. So it becomes much more complicated because the fibers are disconnected and you can have much more situations. But that way you can also get more tricky things. So you can cut off here these kind of things and that way you can get, let's say, more stabilizers, because somehow the edges here of polygons, they somehow, I should say, correspond to To destabilize in this one action. So you need that if you want to be totally general. And then that we saw how this stuff looked like. I mean, of course you can have to give the thing a name. And so a hypersymmetric system. This is, let's call it symmetric plus hyperbolic. Plus hyperbolic stuff. But since you have an underlying one action, you cannot have hyperbolic, hyperbolic. This cannot be. Everything else could appear. And I mean, actually, to do this lifting, we only need nice degeneracies. Usually here at the end, you end up with parabolic points. And so I mean, right now, the state of the artist that this kind of program is that being pushed through for the Symmetoric situation. Push through for the symmetric situation, we try to push for the hypersymmetric situation because this gives you control over integral systems in dimension four. There's lots of natural systems, including dimensional physics and everyone, but in a controlled way, you know what's going on, you can get your hands-on, you can construct that stuff. And so, this is at the moment, I mean, state of the art. There's a bunch of projects going on, and I hope in two or three years that you would be a little bit closer to what are not in the semi-transpiration. Work on loss in the CM2 acceleration. Thanks. Thank you very much. Do we have some questions? Anybody can briefly? So essentially the point is that more or less any semi-turic system with very similar similarities can be pushed to to Tauric or to to inevitable, but uh no, it's very No, it's very so it what is kind of the statement that uh the last one that was that one yeah it means given an introne system with a periodic flow on a form default you can find a nice second integral such that your periodic thing plus the second the the additional one gives you an integer of a system where the singularities are not bad. Where the singularities are not bad. With not bad, I mean, you have non-generic singularities, elliptic, elliptic regular, hyperbolic regular, elliptic, hyperbolic, what else is there? Well, except hyperbolic, hyperbolic. And if you admit hyperbolic regular, which we need, you naturally end up usually unless the thing runs here into the boundary that you have here at the end parabolic points. This is the nicest way of having the general system. So starting with this system, you end up with this hyper-symmetric. And it is always possible. So you don't have any abstractions there. Yeah, I mean, we found a way how to do that. I mean, this is, I think, very nice because in the beginning I never would have thought that you could do that, at least not with systems that are really nice. And I'm pretty convinced that we actually, I mean, we did some construction that does. I mean, we did some construction that does the job. I'm pretty convinced that I could still clean up the construction in a certain way and make it much easier than what we did. I mean, but so I'm really surprised how much control this kind of S1 skeleton gives you that underlies these situations. It just would be very interesting if there were some abstraction, so that you could say that system only with this type of constraints could be pushed to Constraints could be pushed to. I mean, you see that the problems or the non-problems when you come from this situation here. Let's draw it like this. Imagine you have a Cachon graph, as one action. You have a look at the Cachon graph. And this technical means you have here a bunch of stuff. I mean, let's say you have here some kind of tent vertices, you could have here some kind of Tense vertices, you could have here some kind of so-called edges, you can have here a bunch of isolated points floating around, and then you need to understand what does this mean in terms of this one action. So I mean these fat things, they correspond to fixed surfaces. These things here correspond to stabilizers with stabilization, how you call it. It's how it's called set melocase. And then you have to go to details. And then you have to go to details, yeah. Okay, now you can easily follow through what's happening here. These things, in the end, when you map it to a polygon, which you always get when you want to have an image of a momentum map, these things go to edges. So from a totally Tauric point of view, three of these things here and at the same time you cannot have, because a polygon has an upper boundary and a lower boundary, but not three boundaries. So at the very moment you have more of these two things. So at the very moment you have more of these two things, you cannot be torque. Next thing. Okay, now imagine you're in a situation where you have here also too many of these fixed points. I mean to have in a torque situation fixed points, they are sitting here, I mean, on at the vertices one way or other. So technically you can also only have in one vertical section here maximally two of them. Maximally two of them. I mean. So if you have more of them in one line in the graph, you immediately know you need something in the interior. So this gives you the intuition that when you have more of them in one line, you should need something like this. Thank you. Yeah, we'll describe this later. And so, I mean, coming from there, you see somehow what you need. And then for us, it was just important to come up with a way how to get these edges. And we got them via. And we got them via adding a flap, cutting here the tip off, and getting here then some again elliptic regular points. This was a little bit the idea. I'm pretty sure we could do it maybe differently, but for us somehow the idea was we wanted to have a candidate, and we so far did not yet care about other stuff. I mean, the paper has 70 pages, so narrowing it down to more topology conditions, how nice or how whatever one could get, this was left to the future because I mean. The future because I mean, as I said, I tried to already get a paper in the journal that says 70 pages. I mean, this is for the reason. Maybe we can continue the discussion later on. But thanks, Sonia, for the nice presentation. So I suggest we meet again at 10 o'clock here. I think I might break the recording system because it's uh it's programmed to to start with. It's programmed to start when I don't know if we have anything.
