So I'm going to talk about the decarbon method for solving degenerate interface problem with the extreme conditions, which means the extreme condition has a very big jump result. At this moment, the solution has a very strong singularities. So when I did the research, So when I did the research on the interface problem, I'm always thinking a question, can we find the decoupled method to solve the interface problem? At this moment, I have the answer no and yes, which means if we want to use the traditional method to solve the interface problem, To solve the interface problem, it's the answer is no. If you want to use the traditional method coupled with the non-traditional method, the answer is yes. So my talk related with the two part. The first part, we use the traditional method to solve the interface problem, but it's so hard to construct the Construct the decoupled method to solve the interface problem. We call that it's a semi-decoupled method to solve the interface problem. The second part, we use the traditional math, the copper unit, the deep learning, so we can use the construct the decarpetal method to solve the interface problem. So I'd like to thank all my collaborators. The first one is my former student, Teng Jing Zhou. The second one is my PhD student, Cheng Fen. And the third one is my academic brothers. He works at the Tianjin Normal University, Pung Kevan Professor, and from the Normal University. And from North Carolina, the professor Kaja Fumu Ito. So we call this problem is the degenerate or the single interface problem. So we can see the beta is the elliptic, the coefficient of elliptic operators. So, usually for the general interface problem, beta should be positive and has the positive lower bounded. So, for this beta, you know, the beta can be can equal to zero on the interface. So, we call this one the degenerative interface problem. For the degenerative equations, you know, the Increasing the problem lost the uniform ellipticities. So it's quite a challenge for constructing the traditional method for solving this problem. So we have to look for another new method to solve this problem. So I like to use the 1D problem to express the idea. How do we do to How do we do to construct the semi-decoupling method for solving this kind of problem? So if we suppose u minus alpha alpha is the interface, so equal to a. In fact, a is unknown now. So the u plus alpha equal to a plus w. So there. W. So then we can supply the interface as the equation one, problem one, problem two, coupled with the second jump condition. So if we know A, so this is the, it seems the, you know, the two-pound boundary condition boundary problem, we can solve this one, we can solve this one, right? But then they But now it is unknown. So if we solve this one, we have to couple with the second jump condition. So if we construct some scheme solving this system, we have to solve the problem one, problem two, coupled with center jump condition together. Mechanism together, then we can get the numerical solution. So, this is why we call the semi-decoupled method because you have to decouple these tails. So, this is the interface. So, how can we do that? So, in the So in the minus domain and plus domain, so we take the delta minus delta plus. So we call this close near the interface area is the singular area or singular domain. So the other one called the regular domain. So we construct the numerical scheme on the regular domain. So how can Domain. So, how can we treat the singularity on a singular domain? So, we use the series. This series is related with the augmented variable, which related with the singularity. So, because under this singular domain, there is an augmented variable. The other one. Variable the other one in this on this singular domain, so uh we have to you know the increase the pond to make the our compact stencil. It means we have to increase the equation to make the system become the closed. So we know We know there is a there is a three unknown variable we call the augmented variable A and A zero minus A plus A plus zero. So for this problem, the fundamental the fundamental problem The fundamental problem to be solved this interface is the half of them. So now I can construct the numerical scheme for the half of them. Then we can solve the interface problem. For this one, if we know the boundary condition, know the boundary condition here is the you know the x equal to a uh a is the single pond it's degenerate on the boundary so we can solve we can construct the scheme for solving this this problem so how can we handle the singularities if we we know as we know you know the As we know, you know, for the smooth function, we have the Tyler series. But if the function is not non-smooth, so we have a PSO series like this kind of. So I can show an example. If the F1 equals this one, so X equal to zero is a single point, so we have this kind of P0 expressions. Pisot expansions. So we can show near the single point. So the Piso expansion and the original function matched very well. So this is the absolute area. So we can see near the single point. So the accurity is very high. And when the point goes away from the single Goes away from the single point, the error increased so fast. So we call this appearance is the local properties of the pixel series. This is the same thing, so I skip. Well, so for this kind of fundamental problem, so A. So A is the universal degenerate point. Degenerate point. So we near the singular point, we take that data. So this is the regular domain, this is the singular domain. So on the singular domain, we use the piece series to approximate the solution of this problem. For the example before, we can see. For the example before, we can see if you give me a function, I can get the expensive. But now, the solution of the problem is unknown. It's so hard to directly give the PO expansion. So, how can we get the PSO expensing? We have to reconstruct our reconstruct the expensing on the It will expand on the singlest domain. When we construct the piece of series, piece of experiencing on the singular domain, it should be related with the augmented variable. And this augmented variable should be related with the singularities. So we contact the singular domain and the regular domain by the And the regular domain by the augmented variable organically between the two subdomain. So this is the first advantage of our method. The second one is so we can use the uniform grid to solve the problem on the regular domain. The regular domain. So the third one is, you know, the for the whole or where the problem on the whole domain, the convergence order should be determined by a good problem on the regular subdomain. And you know the And you know the uh when we use the this method to process the Homo Fermi equations, we find that the initial slope is our augmented variable because the two mass for the two mass Fermi equation initial solutions is very important in the physics. So So the augmented variable in the mathematics is still very important because this augmented variable related with the singularities. So then we can use the use the formula of the solution like this one. Of the solution like this one, you use the green functions. We have the two summation for this one. Suppose the solution of the problem have this kind of a piece of series, and the right-hand side have this kind of a piece of series. So, beta GSCG is the power and Is the power and the coefficient for F. Alpha G A G is the power and the coefficient for U. So then we can get this relation shape. You know, from this relationship, we can say if we know the beta G, C G, so we can get a A G alpha G. It means when you get, when you get the Get the T0 expansion for F so we can get the T0 expansion of U. But you know the A0 equal to this series, this infinity series. So beta G C G, although we have the beta G C G, but this is the, you know, the infinity, it's so hard for us to get it. So you have to. So you have to get the approximate mission of the A0. So we take the A0 as the augmented variable. So at the beginning, we use the key card iteration to get the expensing on the single. Depends on the singular domain. So we take an initial value u0 equal to this one. At the beginning, we just use the a to recover the piece series. It's so hard for us because if a0 equal to 0, it's so hard to recover, correctly recover the history expensive. If your solution has an your solution has x minus a power to alpha, it's still so hard correctly to recover the picture series. So after then we just take the u0 equal to this one. So if we know the u0 then we know the f u x u 0 then we use the kizo zero we can get the first Can get the first terms c1 and the beta 1. So, when we get the c1 and beta 1, we can get the alpha 1 and a1. So, we update the u1 like this. So, we construct the first term of the pso expansion. Then we update the u1 as u0. So, around this circle, so we can we can get the The finite terms, what you want to do. So, this is the we gave, we proved this lemma likes that the tile expansion. If the terms increase, the errors be decreased. And this lemma guarantees us Guaranteed that the power and the coefficient don't change with the G increases. So when we recover the PC series on the singular domain, so we can see like this one, like this one. This is the expansion of the PC. The expansion of the PC on the singular domain. So here has the A0. We call the A0 is the augmented variable. So the AG is related with A0. So in fact, if you give the value of the X, this should be the function of the A0. Then the following things we construct the Since we construct the compact finite volume scheme on the regular domain, so I skip up this one. This is very normal. Okay, so we can get this augmented compact finite volume scheme. So, we give the error its time about our method. So, I like this theory very much because this is just the media, you know, the results. We have the or assumed these conditions, then we get this result. Then we get this result. So this, we, you know, we hope the convergence order should be H4 minus alpha. So in fact, under this condition, we get H5, you know, around the 2.5, you know, the convergence out decreased. What's the reason? The reason is we We assume this condition. We assume this. This theorem explains why the people use the graded mesh or adaptive mass to decrease the area after they cut off the single point. Because when you Because when you test the convergence order, you know the delta equal to h. If you h become smaller, it means the delta goes to the singular point. So this means if you cut off the singular point, but the singularity still affect your computational domain. So this is why the people use the greedy. the people use the gridded mesh and the adaptive mesh to decrease the to decrease the error after they cut off the single point so why we can why um we can get the higher order of the scheme because we express the singularity a curious Singularity accurately on the singular domain. This is the main reason we can get the high-order results. So for the augmented variable, we still have this convergence order. So this is the media result. After that, we get the final result. We saw that. We unstood that condition. This is the for the interface problem, we can get a false order of the error timings. We test some example. The first one is a generalized Adam Foley equation for this example: A0 equals 0. So the We can see that this is the augmented, this is the value of the augmented variable. This is the convergence order, it's the fourth order. This is on the single domain. The conversion order is still the fourth order. So we test the R2 norm, H1 norm, infinite norm. So we can see the infinite norm is still. The infinite norm is still the false out. For the U, what's the U2H? U2 to H is the compact finite volume of the false order scheme. But we didn't we didn't handle it. Handle the singularity. We just used the force order to calculate the problem. The conventions order dropped so quickly. So we can see the green line is the method we just used theory method to solve this problem. So the error is around the It's around the minus 10 to minus 3. So, this is the blank one. We just use the high-order scheme to solve the problem. It's the area around the 10 to minus 5. So, for the baseline, so on the singular domain, we use the piece of series, but the this But this boundary, we cannot, we generated this boundary, left boundary is unknown. So we can use the right hand side to get the A0. Then we obtain the left boundary. So when we solve the together, the error increases up. The red line is our problem. So we solved. Problem. So we solved, we solved the use, we call the hybrid augmented method to solve this on the whole domain by the slow the automatic variable connected with the singular domain and the regular domain. So the the error, you know, the arrival at at the 10 to minus 10. 10 to minus 10. So from this features, our hybrid approach is too much, is a better performance than the other method. So I'll skip the homogeneous cases. We can see the Non-homogeneous cases So for the jump result is 10 to power 4. So this is the piece of series on the you know the negative domain this on the positive This on the positive domain. So we can see the augmented variable A0 plus A0 minus. So and A. So the conventions order is all the falsehood. False out. And on the single domain, this convention order is a falsehood. For the whole domain with the infinite number, it's still the falsehood. The foresaw. So when the Jampariso became the pen to power minus four, we have the similar results about this one. The convincing order is still the false order. So we can do the we can do the very large jamparis or like the Jamperes are like the 10 to minus 7. So the convinces all the steel had the fossil. So the other interesting example is the coefficient blow up when alpha is less than zero. So the coefficient blow up, our method can obtain the false. Opting the false conventions order for the big jump result. Okay, so this is the first part. This is the second part. Our goal wants to construct the decoupled scheme for solving the interface problem. So I'm thinking about how we can, if we get the if we get the a solution as the if we get the function as the solution of the problem on the singular domain so we can split the interface problem as this kind of this kind of problem so you you can use the any traditional scheme for solving the Scheme for solving the sub-problem on this singular on a regular domain. So how can we get the function on the singular domain? So we use the deep neural network to learn a function as the approximation of the problem. So this is the main idea. Main idea. So we can do the very large jump result like 10 to 12, 10 to power 12 or 10 to power minus 10. 12. This is the decay of the lost function, so S D of I this is for divided. This is for the y-dimensional. So this line for the loss function, the decay of the loss function, this case is for the small jump result. This is for the very large jump result cases. So we tested the simple. the simple interface this is the you know the non-homogeneous cases you know have the the figures can see the two piece this is the 2d cases so we have the you know the uh on the whole domain we have the second order conversion out for the this keys jamp result this case jump result this case we have the second out result so this we we test the flower shape interface the numerical result is very similar and they this is the same per point in the omega minus and the omega plus so we design the two network to solve this problem To solve this problem, this is the happy face piece still have the second out. Oh, this is the sharp edge interface. We tested for the L2 norm, the convergence order is the second order. This paper is my former student, Chu Chang Wang. This one is the Li Qing Wang is here. So we published, we used the immersed finite volume element method to solve the interface problem. So this is our result in these papers. So the for the infinite norm is around is like this. is like this. So this is the this is our method. So improve the too much the convention stop. This is the numerical results and the exact solution. So for our method we can did the singularity interface. Interface like the fine-pound star interface. So this is the on the whole domain convention out is the second. This is the numerical results. This is the exact solution. So this example, we come in the We combine the geometry singularity with the analytical singularity. It means the degeneraties with the geometry singularity. So we can see the conventions order on who domain is the second order. For the next one, we can't be. Next one, we come in the geometry singularities, analytic singularity, and the very big jump result for solving this cases. So we can see jump ratio for the 10 to power 10 or 10 to power minus 10. So on the whole, mean the convincing order is the second order. It's so hard to use the traditional method to solve these cases. And this we give there is no exact solution. This example, there is no exact solution. So we test the convergence order for the right-hand side. So we can see the convergence order We can see the convictor is very stable. So, because the solution operator is bounded, so we can guess the solution of the problem at the very stable convention out. So, this is another, you know, the examples. I will skip up. I will skip up so some extensions we can see our you know the hybrid augmented approach we we extended this method to the to the time-dependent problem it became too complex because there are too many augmented variables because this is Variable because this is related with the time and we construct the second order, first order, and we test the design wave equations and construct the energy preserving scheme. This is the energy with the time, with the large time, the behavior we can see that the energy keeped very well. This is the relative. Well, this is the relative energy area is the arrival at 10 to minus 14. We also saw the other keys. So, our method can extend to the 2D keys. It still works. So, we can see the new method. We can see the numerical results, numerical results, convergence order, it still arrives at the falsehood. This is some references related with the hybrid augmented approach. Okay, thank you very much.
