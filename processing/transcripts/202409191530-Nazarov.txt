And my talk is based on joint work with Alexandra Shiglova from St. Petersburg, who is also here. And this work was published in Calculus of Variations and PDEs. Okay. Uh we deal with a domain in Rn, and the dimension is two or greater. And the parameter S, the order of The order of Laplacian is between zero and one. Also, we use the notation two-star S as the critical Sobolev exponent for the fractional Sobolev-Slobodevsky space. And 4Q is in this interval. In this interval, we consider such an equation in the whole space. And here is the operator minus delta in the power s is it is the standard conventional fraction of Laplacian in the whole space. This equation This equation was studied earlier, but as I know, only radial solutions were investigated and we wish to obtain some more classes of solutions. In the local case, if s is equal to one, this equation Uh uh this equation was uh uh studied uh by many uh authors and for the model equation mostly but not only not only for this exponent and uh four years ago in the paper In the paper with my paper with Alef Lehrman and Petr Narishkin, we suggested a variational approach, which is which, first of all, is applicable also for some more general equations with pillarplacians, for example. And it allows And it allows to construct many solutions with different symmetries in a unified way. Now we modify this method for the equations with fractional Laplacian. And I can say that it was not easy, not so easy. Not so easy to transfer this method for the non-local equations. First of all, I consider a domain, Lipschitz and bounded, and consider the so-called Neumann fractional Laplacian. It is a self-agency. A self-adjoint operator generated by this quadratic form. Muj and phij are standard eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Neumann Laplacian. And if s is equal to one, this operator is just Neumann-Laplacian. But if s Laplacian, but if s is between 0 and 1, it is the fractional power in the spectral sense of this operator. And I point out that the domain of this quadratic form just coincides with the Soblee-Slobodevsky space in omega. Space in omega. Then we consider a family of expanded domains. Omega R is a domain obtained by dilation of omega. And in this omega r, we consider the functional in the numerator we have. Here we have an equivalent norm in the Sobrevs-Lobodevsky space, and here we have norm in LQ. Corresponding embedding of these spaces is compact and so the minimum of this functional is attained and the minimizer is defined up to a multiple. Defined up to a multiplicative constant, and if we take this constant in a proper way, we obtain just a solution and a non-negative solution of equation 3, which is quite similar to the equation 1, but you have here a different operator. Different operator. And this is just the difference between local situation where we had standard, the same operator, and non-local one. And we call this solution a minimal energy solution. And then we prove such a lemma that, in fact, this solution is strictly positive inside omega, and it is moreover, it is infinitely smooth. And the next step is we take omega as a convergent. Omega as a convex polyhedron and prove the following theorem: that if we take a mirror symmetry of omega r. So we take omega r and this symmetric domain obtained by reflection. Obtained by reflection and take a so-called double domain and consider corresponding extension, even extension of solution U. So then we obtain a solution in the domain omega r tilde. It is not a minimal energy solution in the double domain, but it is a Double domain, but it is a solution. And this proof deeply uses the so-called stingatari extension for the fractional Laplacians. And now we consider such polyhedrons which can We can feel by reflections the whole space. And moreover, corresponding filling can be colored checker-wise. And we will say about this polyhedron as about fundamental domain. Fundamental domain. Then, surely using even reflections, we extend the least energy solution in omega R to some function in Rn in the whole space. Denote this function by bold U. And the main theorem is that. Is that this function is just a positive solution of the original equation? So we begin with a different operator, but in the limit, we obtain the original operator. And the proof uses the Schonklis-Biberbach theorem and the redecomposition of the corresponding Of the corresponding three-year series. Okay, we obtain a solution in the whole space, but we know that, for example, the constant identically one is a solution, and why our solution is not. The result of Nikita Ustinov from 2020 shows that, in fact, if the original domain was sufficiently small, then we indeed obtain a constant in the result. But if it was sufficiently large, then it is definitely not constant. But in fact, we have more. We have more the so-called concentration theory. That if it is, if we have a normalized minimizer of our original functional, then for sufficiently large parameter dilation parameter R we have a concentration. Have a concentration of a solution in some point, in a neighborhood of some point. It is strictly positive everywhere, but it is not very small, only in a neighborhood of some point, which I call XR. If the original domain was a Domain was a rectangle in R2, then there are only two, only three possibilities that this XR is inside the domain for large R the X R is on the on a side. Side and XR is in a vertex. And it turns out that for parameter R large enough, for the concentration sequence cannot be as in the picture two and as in the picture three. So the concentration The concentration point should be situated in a vertex. And so, in the result, we obtain a solution which is shown in the picture on the left. So, the red points here are the points of concentration. So, the solution is solved. Is small outside of neighborhoods of these points. And so it has a rectangular structure. In the same way, we can obtain solutions with a triangular structure if we begin with the With the domain equilateral triangle. The result is shown in the right picture. If we take a triangle with angles pi six, pi three, pi two then Simple minimization gives the same result as we saw in the previous picture, triangular structure. But we deal in a different way. We minimize the energy functional under additional restriction that the integral of The integral over a gray gray subdomain is small. Here, set Q is some parameter which is chosen in a proper way. And in this case, it turns In this case, it turns out that the solution, the minimal energy solution, concentrates for sufficiently large R in the vertex Y, as it is shown on the left. And in the result, we obtain a solution in the whole space, in the whole plane, with Uh with um hexagonal structure. It is shown on the right picture. The next, we can consider the same triangle, but take two restrictions that this integral is small. This integral is small. This integral is small and this integral is big in this case. We obtain concentration in the vertex z and this gives another hexagonal structure of corresponding solution in the whole plane, which is shown on the right. On the right picture. The next we can consider sign-changing solutions. All solutions obtained earlier were of constant sign, but we can consider to consider sign-changing solutions, we introduce fractional Dirichlet Laplacian. fractional Dirichlet Laplacian. It is defined in the similar way, but we use here the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of corresponding Dirichlet Laplacian in y, in omega, the domain of corresponding quadratic forms, coincides with the space H S. The space H S tilde. It is also a Sobolev-Slobodevsky type space. We consider corresponding equation in the domain. Here we have not Neumann, but Dirichlet fractional Laplacian and functional Laplacian and consider a corresponding energy functional and we minimize this functional in a domain we obtain the least energy solution and extend it to the whole space in the by what By odd reflections. The proof is more or less the same, and we obtain sign-changing solutions in the whole space. In the domain, we can obtain again rectangular solution, solutions, triangular solutions. triangular solutions, octagonal solutions, and Dodehodron solutions shown here. Plus and minus show the domains of positivity and negativity of these solutions respectively. Also, we can consider So we can consider the so-called brother-type solutions. They are in the plane, they are periodic in one variable and rapidly decay in another one. To do this, we begin with. With a strip and obtain the minimal energy solution in a strip and then extend them in correspondingly in odd reflection with odd reflections or even reflections and obtain positive sign changing. Sign-changing or positive breathers, respectively. And also, we can consider even complex valued solutions with skew periodic or quasi-periodic structure. This is all about R two. In R n, we can We can obtain the solutions of different types if we take original fundamental domain as Cartesian product of fundamental domains in smaller In smaller dimensions. And also, we can obtain many different types of solutions. The radial solutions, which were, as I said, considered earlier, can be obtained by this method also. Also, it is not a problem, but I would not like to explain it. And I think this is all. Thank you for your attention.
