So thanks a lot for coming back. So far it seems to be that I did not lose too many of you and but I think I have to speed up a little bit. To avoid losing you, simply interrupt me if something is not clear. But I would like to talk about bilinear systems in say 10 minutes or something. Okay, so this is the result, the scalar case, which we discussed before the break. And now there comes this, I call it major result because I don't understand it. I can compute things, but I don't understand why it happens. And it's of the following form: still a single input. Let's assume that these necessary conditions we have seen are satisfied. And then let's assume that for all theta, the characteristic polynomial of a theta is of this form, which says that only the constant term depends on theta, and all the others must. And then we result in. And then the result is that you have uniform sample control effect. Keep in mind that the previous case, this one was of course a special form, because here you are in the scalar case, there are there is only one term different from set in your characteristic polynomial. It is it's linear. No, it's linear. It's set minus and n a theta. So it definitely satisfies this assumption. So let's see whether we can understand, or at least whether we can follow the proof. So first what you do is you bring the system in a normal form, control the bill key or solo bill key. I never remember what is right. Remember what is the right term. And you can do this simply by applying this transformation. And be careful, the transformation is continuous in data. So it doesn't destroy any continuity of your data. And then someone told me, I think, mathematically, computationally. I think it was some. I think it was some person yesterday here in the audience. So I started. I started completely. That was very quick. Okay. Yeah. So D is equal to U. Then we have to compute A Compute A, our new A, A times E1, which is of course A2. And then we continue till we have A theta to the power of, what is it, n minus 1. No, I think n minus two we have En, something like that. And then the next one is E to the power of N minus one. e to the power of n minus 1, you get here the the last drop a 0, a 1 up to a n minus 1 theta. And what you can do, and now you can consider linear combinations. Finally what we want to do is we want to see that these approximation conditions These approximation conditions hold that you finally that you can have that you can approximate all continuous functions. But now it's not a scalar one you want to approximate. Now we want to approximate continuous functions with n components. So since we have all these here, actually we can set all of them to be zero. That's of course no longer an inequality, but we can start Quality, but we can start with this as new, let's say, vector, let's call it V1. And we start again computing A to the A theta applied to V one. A theta applied to V one, we get what do we get? We get Uh what do we get A n minus one theta and zeros here Oh there is something that's wrong that's on that's not the right position other way around we get the last column so it's a one a zero A1, A0 theta, and then A1 up to AN minus 1. Okay, then we have to pill these. And so computing this one, it shifts down to 1A, 1 theta, and here again zeros. And if you continue, you end up with you end up with A1 theta at the bottom. And in the next step, if you apply this again, if you apply A theta again to this one, you have something like A theta applied to this one here. You have the square of square of a theta of this one to the power of two and here you have a one times a zero theta and so on and again all these terms here are already there so you can again kill all these terms and you can continue with a A zero theta to the power of two. Apply A, this shifts down, and at last, after n steps, this the power here raises from two to three, and all the terms which show up here are already there, so you can kill them. So, what you finally get is that you have all these terms, that you have all these vectors in, you have all the vectors of the form A0 theta A 0 oh sorry A 0 theta now the square can't stay Now the square comes A that square zeros finally is the square here and so on. And now again since you have these you have all these independently you can find linear combinations for each row to approximate again Again, by Weierstrass or Megelian any function of this type, any continuous function of this type f of f n of theta again by Weierstrass or maybe in here depends. Depends on whether you have set here whether this A0 theta, whether this maps to the real line or whether it's sitting somewhere in the complex plane. And so it works, but if someone can tell me why, I would be happy. So we played a little bit with what happens if some of the other coefficients are Some of the other coefficients are dependent on theta and so on. No chance. Do you have to assume PSP to be one-dimensional? To be one-dimensional. So you have to assume P is compact and tractable. Okay, I have the assumption that P is compact. Yeah, yeah. But I know from the necessary conditions that if I do not assume that P is compact and contractible, Oh, so that's all from the previous. That's, yeah, I actually, in principle, I could erase that if it's already here. These are the necessary conditions which forced me to assume that. Okay, so now finally, I think finally I have to apply again Weierstross or Margelian. And now what we can do, and this is just And this is just a cluing result. So, what you can do is now, if you start with a system. So, you have to assume some technical assumptions about the spectrum. The easiest one is that all of the That all of the eigenvalues are simple. But in principle, it's not that it's the easiest way to guarantee this, but this technical condition, I didn't want to write it down in full detail, can be satisfied in other cases too. And the idea is, so let's assume that P is simply Is simply a real interval. And let's assume that all the eigenvalues are real, so I can draw a picture. So here is my theta 1 and here is theta 2. And now you have some eigenvalue curves. These are the eigenvalues of your operator. And some of them are disjoint, and some of them may May uh um may not. And then, according to you can collect, so to say, those which do not interconnect and the other ones which are interconnected, and then you can transform the system to at least to a kind of block structure. In the simplest case, if all of them are disconnected, or if they not disconnected, if all of them do not intersect, the block structure will be a diagonal matrix. Here it's not necessarily a diagonal matrix to do this. But you get a block structure. And then what you have to assume that all the blocks they have to satisfy this this magic condition. This magic condition. So if they are single, they have to satisfy the conditions of the lemma. If the blocks are bigger, then they have to satisfy this characteristic polynomial condition, which is of course the same in the single case the two conditions of crease. Then you know that the individual blocks are controllable or uniformly controllable. Controllable. These are the two results we had so far. And now we use the one, the theorem which I presented was the last general result about these putting together two systems which are uniformly together under a certain, again, under some spectral conditions, you can now put things again together and you know that the entire system will be ensemble control. With the ensemble control. So that's it. First, break this down to this block structure, which is guaranteed by the spectral condition. Then assume that this block structure satisfy the metric condition. And then you can again, under a further spectral condition, which was this non-separating condition, then you can glue everything together to end up with. End up if your desired controllability could start. Okay. This is about LP case. So let's go to that very quickly because we have not that not not the results are not that convincing as in the continuous case. We have some necessary conditions which look a bit similar. Which look a bit similar as the one for the continuous case. Of course, here we required that for all theta, the subsystems have to be controllable. Here it's important. Now it's not for all. Here we have to require this only for all almost all. Then the same, of course, for this multiplicity condition. And this is something like a little bit, it is not exactly the condition. It's not exactly the condition that the spectral map is, so to say, injective, but it's similar to that if you choose an L infinity eigenvalue selection. So taking a selection means that for each theta I put, I choose one of these eigenvalue uh eigenvalues and the selection should be finally L infinity at least, maybe not continuous, but L infinity. Then it has to be essentially one to one. has to be essentially one to one. Essentially one to one means that if I remove a set of measure zero, it's one to one. And with this, and these are the necessary conditions we came up with, I don't know how far away they are from sufficient conditions. What was this? Yeah, okay. It might be important that so far here material points are not excluded. This is a characterization for the again for the scalar case. This, I think, is still pretty nice. But now comes an interesting result by Sudong. Because so far I said we have no restrictions concerning interior points and there is a beautiful And there's a beautiful paper by Soudon, I think, so far only on the icing, but I guess it it will be to appear outside. So it will be appear some. Oh. It's accepted, but it's viewed under some direction. Okay. Okay, and it says that if the domain here, the dimension of the domain is greater than Of the domain is greater than 2. Where is it? It seems to be that I forgot that. So that's really important. Sorry for that. So D, if D is greater or equal to two and T is also greater or equal to two, but I guess one can get rid of that. But Get rid of that, but yeah, that's a little bit lucky. I think that that can be weak, but the other one, of course. Then, and you assume and you assume that your data are more or less real analytic. Not all over you can restrict to the case that you have one interior point in your domain where your data are real analytic in a neighbourhood of that. Real analytic in a neighborhood of that point. Then you can show here that the system won't be ensemble and won't be LQ controllable, Q beta will equal to 2. And it's, of course, enough to show this for Q equal to 2, because if you have for Q equal to 2, it will immediately imply that you have the same result for all Q greater than one. Q greater than 2. And I found it interesting to reformulate this slightly. We are approaching the right condition. The 2 is still missing. So for d greater than 2 and p also greater than 2, this multiplication operator here in the In this LQ space, so that's the here now. It's the Lebesgue measure. Not any fancy other measure, it's the Lebesgue measure. This operator has cyclic vectors. That's interesting. There's a beautiful paper by Brahman, which is pretty old, around the 70s. And then some other people kept on working on this, and he proved. This and he proved that a multiplication operator defined on a set of the open, of the complex plane. So actually he proved that this type of multiplication operator He proved much more. He proved that this type of multiplication operator has cycle vectors. And if you choose the right domain here, it tells you that the shift operator is equivalent to a shift operator. The shift operator has cyclic vectors. Try to find one in the afternoon if you don't know what to do. And here, this result seems to be. Seems to be interpreted in the way that these psychic vectors, which are there, have to have a kind of wide structure. At least not real analytic. Okay, now a few remarks concerning the proof. You correct me if I'm wrong. It's your work. So you so first idea was to First idea was to transform the original problem to a problem where A maps from an open or a set of the complex plane with interior points to the complex plane. Then a further reduction allows again to consider the multiplication operator by the independent variable. So, and then So, and then let's assume that this key, you can always restrict this so that you finally end up with something which is more or less the unit disk or a scale form of the unit disk. So let's assume that we have the unit disk and let's assume that all the columns of B are holomorphic. And then what you compute, you compute the closure of these guys. All of them are All of them are holomorphic. These are holomorphic functions. So you will end up in the Huddy space, R2. And this is, of course, not the entire L2 space. There's a lot missing. But I'm cheating a little bit because Troudon did not assume that they are holomorphic. He assumed that you have real analytic analyticity and that makes the problem much harder. And that makes the problem much harder. So that was the easy proof. My easy proof for the automotive case. Yeah, the tricky part is the real instance. Okay, I think so far I'm done with the linear ensembles and these are some references of other people who contributed significant results to this area, in my opinion. I hope I did not miss someone. I did not miss someone. There are several papers by Yushin Li and his co-authors. There's a work by Sua Suwa and how to pronounce him? I'm sorry. And then there is this work by there are two papers, one There are two papers, the one I talked about a few minutes ago, and there's another interesting paper together with where I referred to most of these results are in this. Most of the other results are in this paper, or the corresponding references are in this paper. Okay. So let's talk about bilinear sources. Again, I would like to start with finite bilinear sources, and then from there I would like to pass to the infinite case. A few words about bilinear systems. So that's the standard way of bilinear systems represented. Everything else. Everything is on matrix L groups, so no fancy other lead groups. And of course, you can have more than one control term. And what I usually, or what people usually do, they disregard the equation here on Rn and they immediately pass to the lifted equation where capital X now was itself an equation. And they analyze this. This is the lifted equation, and then you can bring back, or you can conclude from the results of the lifted equation, results about the equation down in the state space. For example, Prob did in his paper about bilinear systems on spheres and things like that. So you want to have finally controllability. Have finally controllability on some sub-manifolds down in your space. You have to know whether the group you end up here with this system, that this acts finally transitive on the manifold here, in this case. Talking about the sphere, so you know which groups are acting transitively on the sphere to solve the controllability problem on the sphere. Controllability problem on the sphere. But the idea is first investigate the lifted system, consider which groups can show up there, and then you know do some classification results. These leaf groups, they are acting transitively on this field, the other ones not. And then you have to solve the problem. And the techniques are: you compute the Lie algebra generated by A and B, and if they are further A and B, and if they are further terms, of course, you compute the Lie algorithm generated by all these drift and control terms. And then there is this beautiful result. And I don't know exactly who was the first who did that. Maybe I know that art contributed to this, but not in the league. Also, in the Libro case, or more the general case? No, in more general case. Okay. So in the LibreOffice, you have this. Book case, you have this nice description that you know the system will be accessible, maybe not on GLN, but on the Lie group. So your system matrices are sitting in, or they are not sitting in the Lie group, they are sitting in the Lie algebra, the corresponding Lie algebra. So you start with the Lie group, we have a Lie algebra to this Lie group, and then, for example, instead of GLN, you consider the order. Of GLA, you consider the orthogonal group. All of the AB are skew symmetric, so you compute the B algebra generated by these skew symmetric matrices. If you end up with SON, you know that you have controllability. No, sorry, first of all, you know that you have accessibility on SON, but then you see here in the case of SON, you can even conclude controlability, because if your group G is compact or your drift is almost periodic. Is almost periodic, then you are, so to say, you are allowed to use the drift for checking controllability. And that's well known. Okay, now a very simple toy example, because we want to consider ensembles of bilinear systems. This is a very small ensemble. It has only two subsystems, x. Subsystems X1 and X2, and these two they evolve on, let's say that X1 and X2, that they are positive, so the system evolves on the Li group R plus under multiplication. And both of them are controllable under assumption that B1 and B2 are different from zero. And now consider the parallel. Now consider the parallel connection which can be easily visualized as this block structure. Now consider this block structure and ask yourself is now the block structure or is now this bilinear system? Is again a bilinear system? Is this now controllable? Now of course it is not meaningful, not a controllable convenience. Okay, so the problem is how can we guarantee that such a We guarantee that such a final collection of bilinear systems is controllable. Yeah, so let's make this co-example a little bit more general. So now we have finitely many of these bilinear systems. In principle, the Lie groups, they could depend on the parameter I. On the parameter i. And we have here one controller that we have here. M controls, but the m controls, the m corresponds to the number of control terms. The controls are independent of i, and i is the parameter of the system. Okay. And yeah, that's the structure of our finite or sounder and One key problem, maybe not that key problem, is can we say anything about controllability of this ensemble under some appropriate assumptions on the individual subsystems. And here, for simplicity, M will be in the future, in most cases In most cases, m will be one. There are some examples where m is two. Okay, as in the toy example, of course, the state space, as in the finite dimensional case, the state space is again the Cartesian product of the individual Lie groups. And again, as in the linear case, building these block structures is an easy Is an easy way to visualize how our system acts on this state space. So keep in mind that we have always this block structure. There's nothing outside. And if we analyze controllability or something like that, we want to guarantee only that we can within, they have controllability within this block structure. Because everything else is cute that you cannot get rid of this block structure, simply due to the fact how the Simply due to the fact how the drift terms and the controllability term terms look like. Yeah, so here is now the entire system here. These are the new drift term, this is the new control term, and it acts on this block, so to say, system. So it's clear if the initial value is of this block structure. Value is of this block structure, you stay in this block structure. Okay, so yeah, now this is okay, this is simply two definitions you would expect. An ensemble is called simultaneously accessible if sigma A is accessible on this. This should be a bold phase G, I think, if this is accessible on this state space. Space and of course the system is controlled, called ensemble controllable if E is controllable on this block structure group. Yeah. And the key, I would say, notion to solve the problem, or to solve the problem partly of we did not solve it completely, but we have a good INA. But we have a good understanding of what happens if the individual leaf groups are simple. So the crucial notion we came up with is that a pair AB and an other pair A prime B prime A and A prime are in In the Lie algebra G, and the other two are in the Lie algebra G prime is called Lie related if there exists a Lie isomorphism which from G to G prime, which maps A prime to A and which ma maps B to B prime, I heard it. B to B prime, I relate to it from B prime and A to A. Then I call this pair A B B related. What kind of, how should you think of this? Typical Lie Author isomorphisms are inner isomorphisms or something like that. Well then you would have here something like G minus T minus, for example. Now we came up with this result. I think that the first time I talked about this was twenty twelve in in Uber Wolfer. And uh a bit later uh I I found a paper by I found a paper by Tovinici completely independent, which we just does the same. And now the idea is we have a semi-simple Lie algebra. A semi-simple Lie algebra is simply a direct sum of simple Lie algebras. And the Lie algebra is simple if it has no non-trivial ideals. And the abelian case I think. And the abelian case, I think you also keep that also. So you have this semi-simple Lie algebra with simple ideals, Gi and of course there corresponds to this Lie algebra, a unique connected Lie group. And now you want to know whether your system, which is of this form, is accessible on G. And what you should And what you should do is you should break up these A and these B's according to your direct sum. So then you have something like A can be written as a majority of the column A can be written as, yeah, this A1 plus A2 plus AN are sitting in these ideals, GI and the same with PC. And then what you require is that the pairs here, and that these pairs means that all these pairs here, which we can form out of this decomposition, that all these pairs are Lie unrelated. So they should not be really related. And if this is the case, you can guarantee that the You can guarantee that the Lie algebra guarantees that the Li altru are generated by A and B is the entire Li altruism. Brown condition is a linear condition. I never thought about this, but maybe we can interpret it like that. Okay. Okay, here I think that we can skip that here. It's simply what you already mentioned, semi-simple, some of simple and so on. And these are standard examples for simple Lie algebras. Simply algebra is the one, the samely simple one, which is not of this block form, it's a little bit more tricky. And of course, if we have the individual, or if the entire league group here, this G, if this is compact, then we know that accessibility always is equivalent to controllability. And then this gives us a controllability result. Accessibility is quite weak, but if the G is compact, we know. The G is compact, we know that it is controllability or effect. And we can apply this now to our ensemble, because the ensemble is exactly of this form. If we assume that G0, where is it here, or yeah, sorry. Here, this is a let us assume that the Gi are simple. All of them are simple. They don't have to be equal. They are simple. They don't have to be equal. It's enough that all of them are simple and then replace this definition or this g here simply by g is g1 times g2 times g8. Here this was for the case that all of them are equal, but it's not necessary. Not necessary. You can state the result without this assumption that all of them are the same. The important is only that what you get out of this is the same as Embeliotic. And then you can apply the previous result and you immediately see how these components, how these AI and BI components are, how they look like, they are exactly the matches of A and B here. Be here. So all we have to check is that these pairs are unrelated, and sorry, maybe I talked about that before. And of course, the individual subsystems have to be accessible, which means that we have to guarantee that Ai and Bi generates Gi. So the individuals have to be accessible and the for different uh pairs of indices we have the G unremittedness. Have this E unrelatedness. And this is in general not that difficult to check. It seems to be difficult, but it's not that difficult to check due to this fact. For many semi-simple Lie groups, for the classical semi-simple Lie groups, one knows how these uh Lie algebra automorphisms or uh uh automorphisms, how they look like. Automorphisms, how they look like. So there's a can simply take a book about semi-simple Leo, you can check what kind of what kind of automorphisms can show up, and then you are in business. And you have to check them, and then you see the C are Li-relatedness. Is satisfied or not? Good. This is a sketch of the proof, but The proof, but I skip that. Because I think I would like to continue with a bit about infinite bilinear systems. Okay, now here is now the form of an infinite bilinear system. And again, theta now can be either again running through the natural numbers or theta is running through some. It that is running through some compact subset here of RF. Of course, there are other possibilities, but these are the possibilities we are interested in. And again, first we have to think about how to choose the right safe space, and once we have the right safe space, we can think about checking controllability and so on. Let's consider the countable case. And again, there are not many results for the countable case. There are not many results for the county book case. I'm only aware of one publication from Francesca Picardo. Now it is her last name. Everything else is done for the continuous case. Okay, first approach again to consider all maps from the natural numbers to The natural numbers to g. Here, again, I did assume that now all g's are identical, and then you have something a good candidate for the corresponding Lie algebra if this is a Lie group. But then you have to think about, yeah, is it really a Lie group and in what sense? And again, you end up with the problem that you are forced to investigate if you want to investigate things in a more general setting, that you are. More general setting, then you are forced to consider freshie-liber loops. And that doesn't make fun, not to me. And so I thought maybe one should find other constructions which lead again to Banach E-groups and Banach E-algebra. And that would be maybe one way to do this by simply saying, okay, I think of this huge A matrix again as a huge block diagonal object. Huge block diagonal operator, and then I impose some conditions on these block terms. So then A is of this form A1, A2, A3, and so on. And that's a multiplication operator on some sequence space. But to get some hand on the spectrum of this operator, Spectrum of this operator, one could, for example, require something like that, or at least that the AK goes to zero or something like then you know it's a compact operator and then things might be easier. Because if simply consider the scalar case, if you have here A1, A2, A3, and so on. And so on. And you do not require anything else than that this sequence here is bounded. You have no idea about the spectrum of this operator. Because this sequence here, it could be, you could choose a numeration of the rational numbers in the unit interval, and then you know all of these terms here. All of these terms here, which we hear on the diagonal, they are in the spectrum, but the spectrum has to be closed, and suddenly you get the entire unit interval spectrum. So we have to have some ideas how to control the spectrum of A and one is simply by saying, okay, let's assume that the norm of each guy goes to zero if I'm speaking largely. Yeah, and as I said, there are only Yeah, and then as I said, there are almost no results available. You can do the same now for the local frequent X pace. You should not work with. So again, you restrict yourself to, and probably the most prominent example is that you restrict yourself here to maps, continuous maps from your parameter space to the The group G. The group G is the one which have all subsystems in common. And then it is not that difficult to see that this is the right candidate for the corresponding Lie altra block, the Bana Lie altra block. And everything, if you want to, everything can be embedded as a multiplication operator on, let's say, the space of continuous function on a space of. function on a space of LP function. That's always good to have ideas this abstract construction now can be embedded as a subset of some operator space, bounded operators. Okay, now let's come back to this neat equation from the very beginning. And here this is the bloch equation we have seen at the beginning. In this In this case, I think I slightly changed the parameters. Here, I think I have only one parameter. In the other case, there were two parameters. I think in the paper of Kanisha and he, they discussed both cases. So sorry for this mismatch. Okay, but the statement now is that this system here is uniformly ensemble controllable on G, and what is G? What is G? G and what is G? What is G? Oldface G is this huge group. So you consider all continuous maps from AB to SO3. And the omega 1 and the omega 2 are these standard rotators. And what was here simply again written down how the formal definition of this uniform or normal controllability here. Controllability here, since it's continuous functions, we are working with the maximum norm, and this is what we want to guarantee if we choose any pair of initial and final states. There are similar results by a group in Paris by Pierre Rouchot, Michel Corot, and Carine Carrine. And Karin Bush. Okay, how was, or how did Kanisha and Yershin, how did they prove this result? I guess they thought mathematically, but they started computation. Simply, they started computing commutators. So the commutator between omega 1 and m2, you have to Omega 1 and 2, you have to keep this theta as pyramid, gives you theta square omega 3. So this is again, then depending on how omega 3 is defined, you get omega 2 plus or minus, but that doesn't matter, times theta to the power of 3. Then here again, here you apply this one to omega 1. This one to omega 1. Here you apply this one to omega 2. You have this one located third power of omega 1. And then computing this here, you get a fourth power of omega 3. So now let's do the bookkeeping. So omega one. For omega 1, we have as pre-factors theta, theta to the power of 3, theta to the power of 5, and so on. For omega 2, the same. And for omega 3, I think the pre-factors are theta squared, theta to the power of 4, and to the power of 6, and so on. And now, keeping in mind. And now keep in mind that your power interval was of this form, AB, and then you see that these powers are enough to approximate any continuous function. Want to use these ones? Then if you have one here, and yeah, what if you want to maybe extend this? Symmetric way, and then you can see that if you want to approximate this one, maybe, but not on that one, you only need the odd ones, and then the same trick can be done here. So these powers are at least enough to approximate any continuous function here on this interval B. And then again, Weierstrass came into play here we are. Okay, there we are. There we are. Okay, these are the computators. And then again, you can use wider scrolls to see that the closure of the To see that the closure of the Lie algebra is the entire Lie algebra, and then from there you conclude that the closure of the reach of the set is the entire Lie group. And here and here, you should not argue that SON is compact. That's not a good argument to say we have. Argument to say we have approximate accessibility, and this implies then approximate controllability due to the fact that SO3 is compact. Of course, SO3 is compact, but this space we are interested in is, of course, not compact. And the reason was, but we can conclude because we have no drift term and we have two controls. That's the reason why we can use the result. Okay. Okay, now another quite which we found quite interesting a neat result by Toulon. He generalized this idea. You correct me again if something is wrong. He generalized this idea to arbitrary semi-simple E groups and higher dimensional domains. So he could show that Show that whenever you have a semi-simple Lie group, there exists, so it's now more a design than a criterion to check whether something is controllability, it's more design argument that you can design vector fields such that the resulting or solvent is uniformly controllable. Here you see you have to choose these BI appropriately. Appropriately in the Lie algebra. Construct them explicitly so one knows roughly how many one has to choose. And then, depending on this d, you have to choose here appropriate scaling functions. In many cases, similar theta or some power of theta is enough to see that the entire ensemble now. Here, ensemble now is uniformly ensemble control. Beautiful paper. So finally, there's another result which is so far unpublished, but the The proof, I will show you the ideas of the proof, and so I guess I can convince you that the result is true. Now, to keep things simple, I did assume that we have again a one-dimensional parameter space, and we have here instead of because people in quantum computing or quantum control are also interested in these things, so they prefer to work with. Things so they prefer to work with SUN instead of SON, but they play the same game on SON. Okay, and there's a drifter which is uncontrolled. There are two control terms. That's important. I don't have no idea how to handle only one control term in this case, because these standard recurrence or compactness arguments usually fail. And this And this system is uniformly of sample controller if these conditions are satisfied. So we assume that for the term H2, the off-diagonal terms do not vanish. So all of the off-diagonal terms are there, and this is for all theta. So would be a wrong condition, but this is what I need. I assume that H1. I assume that H1 is already in diagonal forms. Of course, one can add additional conditions on the spectrum, which allows us, which allows one to transform H in this diagonal form. But it would make the statement even more complicated. So let's assume that is from the very beginning in diagonal form. And it says, and it is strongly regular, when I say strongly regular in the fulling sense, that it satisfies this. sense, that it satisfies these two regularity conditions. The first one says that for fixed theta, here the theta is fixed, for fixed theta it's really a strongly regular matrix in the sense that all the differences of the eigenvalues are different. Finally we want to work with the add operator and this guarantees that the add operator has maximal rank. Maximal rate. There are always some zeros we cannot avoid, but all the other eigenvalues are under this condition then simpler. And now here theta is no longer fixed. Now here we compared these eigenvalues with non- non-vanishing eigenvalues for different theta, for theta and theta prime. And also those have to be different. The result we have seen by Kanisha and Lee is this assumption. And under these assumptions, I claim that That the system is ensemble controllable. And first, to give you an idea why these conditions may be useful, I would like to show you how to use these conditions in the parameter independent case. So if you have only one system. So you know your operator H by what was it? Was it one or two? One? So no no theta. Constant. And it has some eigenvalues, lambda one, lambda two and lambda three. And you do assume that this one This one has on the diagonal, it can be anything, but let's put zeros on the diagonal for simplicity. But the off-diagonal terms, they should not vanish. So now I compute communicators between these two guys. So I Nice. So I and what do you get? You get zero on the diagonal and you get here zero is on the diagonal. Here is something like one minus of the two. One? One, the one minus not the two. Yeah, it is. So it's lambda one minus lambda two times i and here is i minus lambda two minus lambda one. I think you have seen this a couple of times. So all these here are multiplied with lambda i minus lambda j. Okay, so then you consider Then you consider hat ih1 to the power of k applied to ih2, the span of this space, the span of this, where k is, let's say, runs all the natural numbers. runs all the natural numbers. This is an invariant subspace, an undi H1 invariant subspace, and since it contains all these components, you know it has to be all of your Lie algebra except you have to keep these zeros. So that's here a subspace of the entire Lie algebra of the form zeros on the diagonal. Yeah, zeros on the diagonal, but all the other terms are now, you can choose all the other terms completely independently. There's a simple argument of invariant subspaces. And if you have a linear operator and you have invariant subspaces, and you know that for each simple eigenvalue, there's a vector with a non-vanishing component. A vector with a non-vanishing component in that subspace, then the entire subspace is spanned by this eigenspace. That's the idea. Right? So once you have all these matrices in small, this is small SUN of everything, then you can start taking commutators here to obtain also the other ones on the diagonal. So important is to generate these matrices then. To generate these matrices, then taking commutators between those matrices, you get everything which is on the so you can also create those which are missing. And this is the same idea, but now not for constant h1 and constant h2. Now we have here this odd operator depending on theta. But this is a linear operator which is. Is acting on this space, but we have to remove zeros on the diagonal. So now we are again in the case of a linear ensemble. This is a linear ensemble. More or less on this space, or it's better to regard to kick out the diagonal or to set the the elements on the diagonal to zero, because on that space it has On that space, it has, according to the conditions before, it has simple eigenvalues. And that was a criterion for this case, which guaranteed that then we have ensemble controllability for this linear operator. This is and this criterion which guarantees this is the criteria which. This is the criterion which guarantees ensovable controllability is nothing else than a reformulation of this one, or to put the other way around. This is a reformulation of the criterion which we had in the linear case, which guaranteed us the ensemble controllability of this linear problem, so to say. Once we have this, we can argue as in In Yashin's and Kanisha's work, we have the entire Lie algebra, and then finally we get the entire Lie group, always taking closures. We do not need any compactness or recurrence arguments because we have two controls. That's important. If we have only one control, I would say even accessibility is not obvious because the standard accessibility criterion Because the standard accessibility criterion, as in finite dimensional, does not hold for Banner spaces or Fubana. Thanks a lot for your attention. I hope I entertained you a little bit during the last two hours. And again, thanks to the organizers for inviting me for this discussion. All right, so any questions for all? I was wondering, has anyone studied some notion of feedback stabilization for ensemble systems as opposed to ensemble controllability, but like the stabilizability? Maybe this is a kind of partial answer to your question. These are other references. These are other references. And there are a couple of people who did, who contributed much more than I. This is the beautiful paper by Narin and Yeshin. This is the paper I was referring to by Karin Bouchard, Jean-Michel Corbont, and Pierre Bouchon. They used more kind of linearization technique to show that the linearization. To show that the linearization of the input-output map is, I think, active, and from there they concluded that at least locally one has this kind of controllability. Then I talked about this story. Sorry that I had no time to talk about the two papers by you, Akhachev and Sarichev. And Sarichev. They go beyond bilinear systems, they analyze affine systems, but the controllability tasks are slightly different. But it's beautiful stuff and I would recommend it. But yeah, sorry. And there are several papers by the group around Uberhof's pain and my Uber Hospain and Mario Sigalotti from Paris, and they have a couple of interesting papers. Most of their techniques are based on adiabatic control. So doing the control very slowly, that's probably the idea. Doing the control very slowly and due to the fact that you do this very slowly, you can handle also small parameter va variations. Variations. And there's this one paper about stabilizability of an infinite number of blockations. What would be the measurements, the feedback case through the entire ensemble? Maybe Michael. Maybe Michael will say a little bit more about that, but I think they'll say if you think that you have a broadcast control due to the fact that you cannot address the systems individually, it might be a stupid idea to think that you can measure them individually. So you usually have to think about some average measures. And that's. Yeah, this is just me. So can I make a comment? This is just Jen. So can I make a comment? Of course. To address Ali's question. So actually, because you are right, so we only can have population level measurements. So we have been working on how to use these aggregated type of measurements to do feedback. And then our approach is actually to transform everything into the moment domain. And then we can close the loop. And again, we have to argue everything in the approximation sense using. Sent using population measurements. There can be time, so I can talk to you guys more if you guys are interested in this. And I can also send some references.
