And the presentation is this one, and the authors are me and Professor Daniele, both from Politecnio Torino. And here is some background of my talk. There is our two recent monography published in Wiley in 2020 related to wedge diffractions. To wedge diffractions in electromagnetics when we have the wedges that are made by penetrable and petenetrable material, and these wedges are immersed in isotropic medium. Then there is some extensions of the method to generalize Vinerov equation applied to different kinds of problems from wedges. You can see some more complex configuration where you have planner. Configuration where you have planar angular regions mixed together, always immersed in isotropic media. Then we have started to think about to develop a generalized Vinerov technique in arbitrary linear media. And we have published in Proceeding of Royal Society paper that comes from our presentation at the Newton Institutes. And recently, we have published a paper on applied science that deals with. Science that deals with generalized Winerov equations for practical AM problems with angular region immersed in arbitrary linear media, where we develop all mathematical tools that will be used for developing solutions in wedge problems immersed in arbitrary linear media. And one of these tools is the freedom factorization method directly applied to generalized Wineroff equations. This framework can be used also in different physics, like So, in different physics like acoustic and elasticity. So, let me show some motivation. We know that in one propagation constant problems, we can analyze the wedges, wedge diffractions, and we have very effective tools like the Sommer Fermalusinix technique, the counter-ov Lebrev technique, and the one presented in the two monographies before, the generalized Vinarov equation. In one propagation constant problem, we made Propagation constant problem: we may define the useful complex plane that is called a complex angular plane, and w is the common variable used in this complex plane. And we can use some Merfully integrals that simplify the spectral problem, in particular, effectively handling the physical branch cut of the problem. But in arbitrary linear media, often in electromagnetic, you have more than one propagation constant. In this case, Constant. In this case, only in particular cases of non-isotropic media, you can resort this kind of problem by decoupling into sub-problem with one propagation constant. If you can do that for different polarization normal incidents, then you can use the spectral methods shown above for one propagation constant problem. But in general, in arbitrary complex media, you have more than one propagation. Complex media, you have more than one propagation constants. So you cannot resort to a Unix complex angular variable. And also, you cannot use our classical technique used in generalized Winerov equation that resources to a unique spectral mapping that transforms generalized Winerov equation to classical Winerov equation. Now, in this talk, I'm revisiting the generalized Winerov equation method. Vinerov equation method to handle wedge scattering problems in arbitrary linear media based in this new tool that the freedom factorization directly applied to generalized Vinarov equation. So let me show some flowchart of the classical solution for a wedge problem using generalized Vinarov technique and then the new tools that allow us to investigate To investigate wedge scattering from isotropic media going to more general media. So, the classical method is based on Bresler-Markritz transverse equation theory in stratified media. Then, we extend this theory to angular region shaped regions, and using analyzing the differential form of the operator, you can investigate the property. Operator, you can investigate the properties of different this differential operator, get a solution in using characteristic and green functions procedure before imposing a boundary condition. And this kind of solution can be interpreted like spectral functional equation in angular regions, where the unknowns are the field components along special directions. And then you can impose boundary conditions and you get the generalized Winerov equation. Equation. For a generalized Winerov equation, we intend that we have some unknown defined in one complex plane, some other unknown defined in different complex plane, but these complex planes are related together. So we have plus and minus unknown defined into different complex planes, but they are related together. When we are in isotropic media, then we can use special mapping that transforms the generalized Winerov equation to classical Wineroff equation. Wineroff equation. Then we can perform a zap factorization in some cases, or we can resource to freedom factorization when we need the approximate factorization technique for solution. We get spectral solution and then we can perform asymptotic to get far-field solution in terms of field component. When we deal with more general media, the problem is that the generalized Winerov equations are defined in more than two complex planes. Than two complex planes, at least three, four, or and so on. So, in this case, we cannot resort to a unique mapping to transform the generalized Vinarov equation to classical Vinarov equation. So, we have this difficulty that we need to investigate. In more general media, we have developed two differences from the classical position shown in the flowchart. One is that we can anticipate the freedom of authorization instead. Characterization instead to apply them to generalization of equations, we can apply before boundary conditions in spectral functional equations. The other tool is that we can apply a modified freedom factorization that is directly applied to general Laws-Winorov equation defined into multiple complex planes instead of resorting to special mappings. So let me go back to the first step. Step of a flowchart. The Bresla-Markovic transfer equation theory is reported here for stratified media in YM. You have the classical report from Breslau-Markovic reported here. So we rephrase the Maxwell equation into an abstract formalism, like here. You have a differential operator defined here. You have field components, C and theta reported here, and then you have some constitutive parameters defined. Some constitutive parameters defined here. You have direct repetitivity, pagetic permittivity, permeability, and then you have magnetoelectric coupling here. All these parameters are of tertiary form in these presentations. Then we can apply stratification along y directions, one of the Cartesian coordinates, and we get the transverse equation where you have partial derivative here in these coordinates. here in these coordinates in this coordinate in the other side you have psi t are the tangent field components to the stratifications and these are a partial differential equation we have a particular structure of the m differential operator if we consider invariance along z direction of the media that in the problem then you have m is of this structure so you you can define exactly in a closed form the m0 m1 m2 mat The M0, M1, M2 matrices, and the derivative along X appear on the right side only. So here you apply Fourier transform along X, we get from the partial differential equations system or ordinary differential equation, we can analyze the M operator here and it takes this form. M0, M1, M2 are the one of the previous slides. Then you can investigate again value, eigenvector of this. Again value, again vector of these problems. And this again value, again vector can have physical properties. Two are progressive, related to progressive wave, two are related to regressive waves. You can perform solution for particular problems in stratified media using characteristic green function procedure, using homogeneous solution and particular solution. And all this framework can be repeated also in angular regions in the same way. And we have a special Way, and we have a special linked properties among the stratified regions and the angular regions that I'm showing here. You have a region here that is defined into four angular regions, region 1, 4, 3, 2, defined by aperture angle gamma. Then you can define oblique Cartesian coordinates with this formula according to the aperture angle. And if you take the equation done for stratified media. Equation done for stratified media, and you rephrase them to this oblique Cartesian coordinate, then you get a very similar problem. Here we have applied Fourier transform along x equal u, these directions, and invariance along z. You see that is the same form of the equations, where m gamma operator is slightly different from before. You have this connection between the matrices for stratified regions and therefore the angular regions. And therefore, the angular regions, you see the dependence on gamma, on the aperture angle gamma here. And we have particular properties for these differential problems. If we have a connection between the eigenvalues of the stratified problems and the angular region problems, you see these are the gain value of the stratified and these are the gain value for the angular regions and depends on gamma. And then we have a particular property. We have the same eigenvectors. Now, Now, let's apply Laplace transform, unilateral Laplace transform, instead of Fourier transform, because we want to impose boundary conditions. If we consider Laplace transform to our differential problem, we have that the differential problem comes with a source here that is related to boundary condition defined for u equals zero. U equals zero means this phase, so this source term is. So this Schwartz term is a boundary condition on this phase, and then we have the Laplace transforms along x of all components. Then you can perform a solution in terms of homogeneous and particular solution here, and you get this kind of representation. And then, if we study asymptotic behavior according to the behavior of eigenvalues, progressive and regressive wave, and you Regressive wave, and you analyze the properties of the solution for v equals zero, it means on phase O, here is phase O, then you get this kind of solution where you have this relationship among the quantities. And then you can weight this solution to the reciprocal eigenvectors, and then you get this connection between these quantities and these quantities let represent. Quantices let represent let interpret these quantities. These are Laplace transform of field components along phase O, then these are Laplace transforms of field components along phase A. So we have a connection among the Laplace transform of the two true comprehension. You can see here you have some sort of a plus function say in eta and here you have some sort of minus functions along mi. I recall you that m i I recall you that Mi in arbitrary linear media are more than one, so we cannot resort to mappings in this general case. And this theory for isotropic media is developed in these two papers. Here you have the functional equations shown before for region one, this one. You know that the quantities here are Laplace transforms of a field component that are. Transforms of a field component that are tangent to phase O. So we want to rephrase these field components into tangent components to phase I. And to do that, we use this T matrix that depends on the physical parameter of the problem. You see all the parameters of the electromagnetics material and the gamma purtle angle here. And you saw now you have the connection between Laplace transforms that are tangent here to tangent here. That are tangent here to tangent here. And these are the first spectral equations, functional equations on region one. We can do the same thing on region two when we have a symmetric aperture angle here, very similar. There are only some change on the sign of quantities, and then you have you use the same T matrices. You can do that. It's useful to develop a solution for a similar. Developed solution for symmetric wedge problems. And here is a very simple problem that we have published in 2006 in Asotropic Media. You have the Malusinit problem at EZ polarization. Just to show you what is the explicit expression of this kind of problem is that the functional equation I shown in the slide before in abstract form of this form, you can see the field components at each depolarization. Components at each polarization. Then you impose boundary conditions, you get the generalized Vinarov equation. This is the kind of generalized Winerov equation with this unknown, very classical in this case. Then, in the case of isotropic media, like in this problem, you can resort to spectral mapping. So, you transform generalized Vineroff equation to classical Wineroff equation, and then you can apply closed-form factorization if possible, or other eyes approximate technique like freedom factorization. Technique like freedom factorization to get the unknown in the spectral domain, then asymptotics to get far field. And this is a kind of a solution in terms of far field for some physical parameters described here. But what we want to do here is that we have multiple m. So multiple m does not allow to define a mapping to transform the generalized Vinarov equation to classical Vinarov equation. So we Of equations. So we resort to what we call direct freedom factorization as reported here. And we have the functional equation shown in the slide before for region one and region two. The first step is the duplication of equation. So we take region one, we rotate of an angle gamma, and then we take region one becomes like two primes. In this case, we have the very similar equations that is reported here. Questions that is reported here. It's described in terms of the formalism done for region 2', but we are connected to the parameters of region 1, so we have some rotation. We can perform the same thing for region 2, become region 1, and we duplicate the equation. Why we do that? We do that because we want to all the unknown for phase or phase be defined in this thing. Defined in this in this region and this region, all these kind of unknowns. We want them in eta plane, in the same complex plane. We want to do that, and they are related to quantities that are defined in like here. You can see that there are combinations of field components of region one that are defined both in eta and ni. And you have multiple n. This is the problem. To get a generalized To get a generalized Binerov equation, then we impose boundary conditions. In this simple case, we show here we apply perfect electric conducting boundary conditions, so we eliminate the tangent electric field components, and we get Plaskel-Vineroff equation. Then, the direct Vinov factorization is directly applied to this equation without mapping, because mapping is not possible here. And we resorted to the COSI decomposition formula that is defined in. Formula that is defined in M here in terms of eta. And so, from this kind of combination, after applying boundary condition, we get this kind of representation. You see that our combination of field components defined in eta. The unknown are defined in eta. The non-standard terms come from the sources of the problem, like plane wavelengths, and so are explicitly defined. And now you can see these are integral equations. Are integral equation representation of the unknowns, the field unknowns of the problem, but only defined in eta plane? So that's the important things that we have integral representation defined in eta plane. Then we perform the regularization technique, and that's why we call freedom factorization. And here we have one of the set of equations, we perform smile contour. Form smile contour on the left side of the question, right? Again, the smile contour on the right side of the question, and we got this kind of a representation. We see that we have this kind of terms here that can be computed in a correct way, in numerical form, or also in closed form. But what we want to show is that equating left-hand side here and right-hand. Left-hand side here and right-hand side here, you get a system of freedom integral equation in terms just of one known in eta plane, one complex plane. That's important. Here is some behavior from an M to eta plane because of validity of this kind of representation. Now, there is another important tool. By solving this kind of equation, you saw that we get a You saw that we get a representation of the field in particular directions, the phases of the wedge and the phase O of these regions. When we want to analyze the field spectral components along an arbitrary direction, we can resort to the original equations, split the angular regions, and then you get two kind of coupling equations and you can evaluate the spectra along an arbitrary The spectra along an arbitrary direction. Another solution to analyze the field along an arbitrary direction is to observe the field components how they are written. You can see that in analyzing this kind of representation, you have some quantities that is defined in terms of field component along one phase, and then you have some portion of particular solution that is defined along the phase. That is the final of the phases. Then, if you reverse the problem in 2', then you have the opposite representation. This is important because we can resort to some superposition and so analyze the radiation of equivalent currents on this phase, and this phase, and this phase, and this phase. Some are very explicit because they come from the amazing solution, the other are more complex because come from particular solutions. That's why. Come from particular solution. That's why we radiated just the homogeneous part and then we use symmetry of representation of an angular region. For validation, we use two kinds of validation of this theoretical package. One is the validation of freedom factorization directly applied to generalized Spinarov equation. And we do this for pack wedge. So we get some validation of this direct freedom factorization that is. Direct freedom factorization that is the first time we perform this kind of computation. So we want a closed-form analytical solution to check the validity. And then we perform another check that is the application of all theoretical packets to fix problems in non-anisotropic media. In this case, we use half-plane problems in method, in particular, anisotropies like gerotropic media or Geurotropic media or biaxial media. So let's start from the first validation that is the validation of direct freedom factorization without using the special mapping to the simple problem pack wedge in anisotropic media. We analyze just region one. We have some of the definition reported here. I recall these are the m, these are the gain vectors, these are the functional equation in. The functional equation in abstract form and the explicit representation is reported here. You can see here the functional equation. Then we pose this problem in a very simple case, the perfect electric conducting wedge. So we remove the tangential component on phase O and phase A, here and here. And we impose in normal incidence for simplicity. And we get very simple equation for EZ polarization based and Polarization base and a little bit more complex for HZ polarization. We will investigate the HZ because it's not trivial like the one of HZ. So you see here you have a generalized veneroff equation because the H field along this phase is defined on eta. Instead, the H field along this phase is defined in N, and M take the form reported here for isotropic media. Isotropic media. And then we can perform the classical solution that we can use to check the validity of this problem. This is the mapping that we used in our previous paper and previous work, and we can get closer form factorization of the problem. But here we want to use the new tools of direct freedom factorization. So we have this kind of equation. This is the This is the one reported here. We duplicated the question. So we have f plus, x plus that are defined in eta and m, both. Then we apply the Cauchy decomposition formula. So we represent the m unknown in terms of integral form. We consider here that only f plus is no standard. Then we perform the regularization on the left-hand side and the right-hand side. Left hand side and the right hand side has reported here. And finally, you get this kind of representation, summing up everything here. These are the implicit form, but with G reported here in explicit form, and E is the one reported in the previous slide that we can compute in closed form, has special asymptotic behavior. And this kind of representation, if you look at this, this is. Presentation: If you look at this, this is a freedom integral equation of second kind. This is a compact kernel. This has special behavior of convergence. It's another compact. See, so we can discretize the system of equations. These are the discretized forms. We can rebuild the solution. We can get this kind of solution. You have comparison between exact and asymptotic with different discretization parameters with simple old. You can see that there is only some. Only some loss of precision in this side of the solution. These are the optical solutions. So we have this kind of observation in W plane. And these points correspond to the branch cut of the spectral propagation constant. So we need to improve the solution there. And to do that, we reinforce the generalized Winerov equation. We get much better behavior here. You see the red line. Behavior here, you see the red line is the final solution, the black line here and here. You can get an improving of solution also in terms of GTD. And this is the absolute value, this is the phase, and this is the regulative error with and without reinforcing the freedom integral, the freedom, the generalized Greenlov equation, the spectral. So let me switch some on another validation for. Validation for the arbitrary linear media. Here you have a girotropic media, electric geotropic media. We are investigating in this case the R-plane problem. You have two propagation constants. Here is the physical propagation constant. These are the eigenvalue. And then you have eigenvector. If you perform the same procedure shown before, you get this kind of functional equation. These are plus unknown on. Unknown on the phase O. These are unknown on phase A. This kind of problem is the alpha plane problem, so the aperture angle is pi. And you can repeat this also for region two, so the bottom region. You can sum and subtract the question, and you can you get EZ and HZ decoupling in this case is a particular for Ez in this gelotropic media. You see that this. Media, you see that this is a classical half-plane problem in isotropic media where you have a special impedance, a special propagation constant according to the problem. And then here you have the kernel for HZ that is the same reported in this paper of 1963 with also the surface wave phenomena reported on above and solution final solution can be performed in classical ways. Solution can be performed in a classical way in this case. And another validation is for biaxial media. In this case, we have the relative permittivity and magnetic permittivity reported of diagonal form. If you perform the theory in this case for an arbitrary aperture angle, you get this kind of functional equation. Here is the one from region one, region two. You can decouple each polarization H. Hz polarization Hz polarization in this case, also in this case, if you analyze heat zipolarization, you have this kind of equation. And then if you perform a check, a numerical check for this kind of physical parameters for an aperture angle that is for an incident angle is at 0.2π, you get this solution in analytical form from our procedure, and this is the check. Procedure. And this is the check against the finite element method. You can see there is a complete overlap of the green line here, and that is the total field. The blue line is the geometrical optic, and the orange line is the UTD component. And this is the final slide. This presentation comes from progress on recent presentation at Newton Institutes. And we have reported all the mathematical package to. The mathematical package to develop a new solution in wedge problem here in this paper of applied science. And we have presented a relativ package to phase wedge scattering in arbitrary linear media, mathematical computation of fields in half-plane problems. We will develop a solution for wedge problems using direct freedom factorization method. That is one of the new tools. We will extend the analysis to arbitrary boundary conditions. Arbitrary boundary condition beyond perfect electric conducting, and we will apply the theory also in acoustic and elastic voice problems. Thank you.
