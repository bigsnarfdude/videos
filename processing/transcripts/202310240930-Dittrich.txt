So, I will speak from a quantum gravity perspective. So, if you have a question, please ask me because I might not know what you don't know. I will try to give an overview of diffeomorphic symmetry in the discrete. And so, first I will And so, first, I will kind of motivate why that is an important concept in quantum gravity. I will then just explain the firmorphin symmetry for discrete mechanical systems, so zero plus one dimensions, and then go to the concept of perfect discretizations. And then comment on discrete symmetries in higher-dimensional systems. We will see that this is a very open issue and I will continue with an alternative route, so-called cylindrically consistent dynamics, and make a comment on holography because that's kind of related to integrable systems. Systems. So most of the works are quite, well, they're not really recent. So I've done them quite some time ago. So there's a number of papers starting in 2008 and 2009, but there's a recent review from last year where I hope you can find a lot of references. So, diffeomorphisms are an important symmetry of general relativity. And in quantizing any theory, you want always to preserve the symmetry of this theory. So, in particular, for general relativity, we want to preserve diffimorphism symmetries. So, I'm doing non-perturbative quantization, and for that, one often uses discretization. One often uses discretizations, and sometimes discretizations are also postulated as a fundamental property of quantum gravity, or discreteness is postulated as a fundamental property of quantum gravity. But then you get into tension because if you use the discretization, as I will explain, the filmorphin symmetry is typically broken. And so that gives us. So that gives us a big issue. But we also see if you would have kind of diffimorphisms in the discrete formulation, it would solve many issues, for instance, ambiguities or uniqueness of our framework. Going away from From general relativity, which is quite a complicated theory, and even looking at simpler systems with diffeomorphisms. So you can actually consider any field theory and make and add kind of diffeomorphisms as a symmetry by a certain process. I will review for zero plus one-dimensional systems. We actually don't really know any discretization. Don't really know any discretizations which preserve diffimorphisms, or we almost don't know any discretizations which preserve diffimorphisms. Exceptions are actually so-called topological quantum field theories and zero plus one dimensional systems. And I will explain why that is in the course of this talk. So, just to start with a simple system, we work with an action, and all the discretization will be on the level of the action. So we will consider a variation principle and just a zero plus one-dimensional system, just for usual mechanical system. And given such a system, we can actually. And given such a system, we can actually always put it under a process which you can call reparameterization. So you actually add time as an independent variable. So this will be together with Q, the two independent variables you want to vary. And so you need a new time parameter which we. And so, you need a new time parameter, which we just call s. And so, given this Lagunction L in the first line, we can just formulate a new action by this formula with the same Lagrangian, but instead of Q dot, we put basically the derivative of Q with S divided by the derivative of T with S with D S and so on. And so on. So you might see already that having basically the same path q of t for both these actions will or for both these variational principles will give me the same action. So the action will kind of agree in the numerical values. Moreover, this new action is actually invariant under Invariant under so-called reparametrizations, or if you want under one-dimensional diffimorphisms. That is, if you kind of reparametrize your new time parameter by a function f and have a solution Qs of Ts, you find a new solution by just reparametrizing this auxiliary time parameter. This auxiliary time parameter. So you see that, well, as is typical for gauge symmetry, we have a multitude of solutions for fixed boundary values. Okay, so what happens if you discretize these two action principles? So we can just apply some more or less naive discretization for the first action principle. Here, what I'm going to do is choose kind of on the time axis my discrete points which I want to represent. And I can do that a bit arbitrarily. So T n the these discrete points do not need to be equally spaced. Do not need to be equally spaced. If I do that, I vote here some kind of naive discretization in which the graph q of t is basically replaced by a piecewise straight curve. Okay, now my so you can do apply the symbol. Apply the similar concept to the reparametrization invariant action. Here, something peculiar happens. Now, our new time parameter is not anymore t, that is a variable, but s. And we can choose any kind of subdivision for our s variable. But this subdivision, the choice of subdivision, does not matter. Does not matter. So we will find that any dependence even on the differences in the SN drops out, and we seem to have exactly the same Lagrangian as we had before. The only difference between basically these two variational principles is that in the first case, we would only vary with respect to the Qn, whereas in the second Qn, whereas in the second case we would vary Qn and Tn. And so you can ask, is there any kind of leftover, if you want, of this kind of symmetry, the 1D diffeomorphism symmetry? And here, the one property of this diffeomorphism symmetry was that it led to a multitude. Or is that it led to a multitude of solutions for fixed boundary conditions? So you can ask: do we find a multitude of solutions for fixed boundary data? And well, one can look at examples. And so the simplest example to look at is the free particle. So I wrote here this the action for the free particle in the same way as above. Same way as above. And here the answer is yes. And the reason for finding this multiplicative of solutions is that the free particle, well, the solution will be a straight line. What you basically chose is to discretize using piecewise straight lines. And so it does not matter if you move your subdivision point along this straight line. Along the straight line. So the position of each of these points, which might lie between two fixed points, does not matter. So basically, you will find that you can choose, for instance, the t values to be arbitrary, and this will fix q. And so t is a variable, and you have an arbitrary choice of. And you have an arbitrary choice of key. So, this we understand as a gauge symmetry. And this is basically the remnant of diffeomorphism symmetry in the discrete. So, here we have one example for a simple concept of diffimorphosin symmetry. But as soon as you basically add a potential and you go away from And you go away from straight lines as solutions, you will find actually unique solutions. So you will not find anymore this multitude of solutions and both Q and T will be fixed uniquely. So there's still some issues because if you look at basically the eigenvalues of the system of the Hessian, then there will be a very small eigenvalue and that is eigenvalue and that is just that you know numerically t the t values will be fixed in only in some in some weak sense and you will have numerical you might encounter numerical issues with the system but and you will find unique solutions and so here you also see that you make an approximation error by the discretization Error by the discretization. Here you get the piecewise straight curve, but typically, if you have some potential, this will be kind of a smooth curve and not kind of go piecewise straight. So in these cases, which basically are most of the cases, not the free particle, can we restore diffeomorphism symmetry? And the answer will be yes. Answer will be yes. And how it's restored is: well, for that, I need to use the Hamiltonian-CoBY function, that is the action evaluated on a solution. And so the action evaluated on a solution for this functional will just depend on the initial and final values of Q and T. And in fact, in And in fact, instead of putting here this Lagrangian I had before, this discretized Lagrangian together with the t-derences, I put a sum over each of the Hamiltoniac-Cobi functions for basically my discrete values. So actually, if we discretize, we should not really try to discretize Lagrangian or To discretize Lagrangian or the action, but actually the Hamiltonian, it's a Hamilton-Jacobi function. And so you will also see here why it's called a perfect discretization. Well, it reproduces or mirrors perfectly the continuum dynamics. So if you take this action, then the solutions you can produce by taking the continuum. Taking the continuum solution, and any subdivision of this continuum solution into segments gives a discrete solution. So, in this case, what I mean is that you can again move these subdivision points along the continuum curve, and any choice of this position of these points gives you a solution. So, again, we have So again, we have a notion of diffeomorphism symmetry in the sense that we can move these points or have in general a notion of gauge symmetry by allowing to move these points. Why is that the case? Well, basically, it follows from the fact that from this equation that basically says that if I use If I use the Hamelnier-Coby functional as a kind of discrete action, and I look only at these three points where the zero point and the point two are used as boundary values, and I vary with respect to Q1 and T1. And I extramize. I extermize the sum, I again get just the Hammet-Niacobi function. And that provides me this basically that explains why these continuum solutions and any kind of subdivisions give me a solution. So these perfect discretizations. Perfect discretizations, what are some of these properties? So they have these kind of interesting symmetry, which means I can move the points and I still preserve the solutions. So I just produce new solutions. And what one can do is basically move one point on top of another point. On top of another point, and effectively, I have actually kind of coarse-grained my discretization. So, it also happens that using a perfect discretization leads to what somewhat confusingly is called discretization invariance. So, changing the discretization, in this case, just changing the number of points, I basically. Points, I basically still find the same solution. So these discretizations, of course, have been kind of an issue for people doing numerics and. And in particular, if you take all a given system and discretize it, then what typically happens is energy is not anymore preserved. And energy, in fact, is very much related to this notion of diffeomorphism symmetry. An alternative name for this diffeomorphism symmetry in this mechanical system is time reparametrization invariants. So if you restore this time reparameterization So, if you restore this time reparametrization in invariance, you do gain some quantity which is preserved, in that case, is energy. And so, you can also ask, what are discretizations in which the energy is preserved? And so, it happens that you can show that it's basically only the perfect discretizations, so where you use the Hamiltonian-Coby function. Nier-Gobi function and only in these cases energy is preserved. Also, so this will be more of a side remark. So here we worked with an action principle. You can go to canonical formulation, phase-based formulation and do that either with Do that either with a disk evolution system or you can reintroduce continuous time. And the reason you can introduce continuous time is exactly because you have this gauge symmetry which allows you to move points. So that actually can be interpreted as a time evolution. So for any discrete systems, we know how to basically formulate it in phase. To basically formulate it in phase space, even in higher dimensions, and even if the number of degrees changes in time, and we can do that for arbitrary non-regular lattices. If you do have this diffimorphine symmetry, that leads to so-called constraints between the data associated to one time slice, that is, between the momenta and configuration variables. And in principle, you can kind of even use these constraints. of even use these constraints one of this will be the one of these constraints will be the hamiltonian constraints which will generate continuous time evolution and either doing continuous or discrete time evolution should give you the same the same result or the same kind of solutions okay so um then Well, how do you construct perfect discretizations? I mean, one way to construct that, in particular in these one-dimensional systems, would be to solve the corresponding continuum system and then use the Hamilton-Jacobi function, which basically does indeed encode all the dynamics and all the properties of your solution. But in view of also going to be a solution, In view of also going to higher-dimensional systems, or sometimes you cannot solve even your one-dimensional system, what could you do to at least improve your discretization? And so, what you could do is basically to a process which you can either call renormalization flow or cross-graining. So, starting with a finer discretization, for instance, here I have three points. Since here I have three points. You integrate out the middle point, and that gives you a new action, which would be a better discretization for this larger discretization step. So we had previously this equation that tells you that under this process, the Hamiltonian-Coby is actually, the Hamiltonian-Coby function is actually a fixed point. Hamilton-Cobi function is actually a fixed point under this process. So indeed, if you do start with a given discretization, which is not given by the Hamiltonian-Cobi, you will find a new action here on the left-hand side. And you can iterate this procedure and actually converge to the Hamilton-Jacobi function. So that's kind of a process which, in fact, really works. So it can be applied in practice and perturbation theory and quantum theory. And it helps basically in, for instance, resolving ambiguities for discretizations classically and for instance in the parse integral. So, what you do again is basically solving the theory in steps. So, instead of just integrating out from the continuum, you do that stepwise. And sometimes that is an easier way to proceed than attacking the continuum solutions from the beginning. In particular, In particular, in quantum gravity, what we usually have is not really the underlying continuum system, but a discrete formulation. And what we want to do is to kind of improve the discretization to be nearer to the continuum or less dependent on our choices of underlying lattices. And then this process might help to achieve that. Okay, any questions so far? Questions again. So, um go set up. Hello, Bianca. This is Frank Neil. I see it's very interesting actually what you expose, and I see a number of parallels with things that are being done in integral systems. So, for instance, the condition that is on your slide on the Hamilton-Jacobi function that also was came up in work by Srida and Suris, where And Suris, where it was used to define commuting flows or commuting maps, and that is kind of integral. I don't know if you have a comment on that at all or. Yeah, I comment a bit later, but let me just say that these commuting flows, in some sense, I saw basically. I saw basically a parallel here in the time evolution. And so, in fact, related to this discretization independence is the following, if you do want to kind of evolve the system canonically, you know, we say we have to choose a hypersurface. But if you have full discretization independence, you can push forward this hypersurface. Push forward this hypersurface in different ways. You know, you can push forward first like the left side more and then the right side more or the other way around. And so this entire condition that whatever way you choose, if you kind of evolve between two hypersurfaces in different ways, In different ways, you want to get the same result. Well, that condition leads to a so-called hypersurface constraint algebra. And so you can understand that this algebra, the realization of this algebra, so that would be in terms of Poisson brackets or commutators, as kind of the canonical version of diffeomorphism symmetry. And so in this case, it's kind of And so in this case, it's kind of a similar thing that in some sense the flow should commute. I mean, it commutes basically what we call on-shell. It's a more complicated algebra than just commuting. So we have this condition. And again, in the continuum, we have this condition in the continuum, but in the discrete, these conditions. The discrete these conditions, and at least in four-dimensional systems, is typically violated. And this violation turned out to be basically the main obstacle in canonical quantum gravity, and it's still the main obstacle in canonical quantum gravity. But it reminds me of this non-community of or community of flows. And we can also do that with in a disk. We can also do that with a discrete setup. So we can require that certain discrete evolution steps lead to commuting flows. And in fact, these lead to Pentagon equations and so on. So there's this relation to certain integrability conditions. Does that answer a bit the question? Yes, thank you very much. Yeah, I think that there are actually quite a bit of parallels between what you guys are doing and what this kind of theory is also about. So maybe we should discuss this issue. Well, you know, for 1D, for these zero plus one D dimensions, we have this basically closed. Closed story that I can tell you: okay, here's a kind of perfect discretization, and it's given by the Hamiltoniac-Coby function by using the Hamiltonia-Kobi function. And as we will see in this case, what we can preserve in this process of renormalization flow is the locality of the action in some sense. So the action can be still associated. The action can be still associated just to have the same number of boundary data than the initial action. And that is very special to these zero plus one dimensional systems. So what do we have for higher dimensional systems? So for higher dimensional systems, imagine that we have like, in this case, two dimensions. So t and x. And for instance, And for instance, we would have some kind of field, a scalar field, for instance, be defined on these blue dots. And we would look for solutions of the system or look again at Hennett Niacobi function that is the action evaluated on the solution given some boundary data. Like now, the differomorphine symmetry for this disk. The differomorphism symmetry for this discrete system would be very similar to what we previously had. So it would basically mean that we could somehow move around these points in the plane and we should find the kind of we should still find the solution and it should give us the same predictions. And if you're coming from kind of If you're coming from kind of lattice quantum field theory or any lattice theory, this is an extremely strong condition because going from, for instance, here from a somewhat regular lattice to an irregular lattice. So here I have a locally variable lattice constant, and I expect that this gives me the same condition, the same predictions as using this lattice. So that will be one issue. Again, you can imagine that you move these points on top of each other, so you also expect to get a notion of discretization invariance. And again, that would mean independence of, for instance, your Hamiltonian-Coby function. Under changes of your underlying discretization, and imagine that you have in three dimensions a triangulation. Then you can generate all changes of your triangulation with the following moves, the so-called for one move or one, four move, where you remove a vertex and the adjacent edge. A vertex and the adjacent edges from basically inside and out this bigger tetrahedron, and the so-called 3-2 or 2-3 move, where if you have two tetrahedra glued together, you insert an edge and obtain three tetrahedra which share this edge, or you look at the inverse. And again, you could And again, you could imagine a theory, for instance, where either the field sits on the vertices or the variables sit on the edges. And in fact, there is such a theory which is in my under these changes, and that's gravity in three dimensions. So, gravity in three dimensions is, or at least Is, or at least general relativity in three dimensions, is a topological theory, meaning that there's only a few solutions which depend on only topological parameters. In fact, in 3D, without a cosmological constants, solutions have to be locally flat. And a particular interesting discretization of gravity. Interesting discretization of gravity is so-called regicalculus, where the variables are given by the length of these edges. And also the local theory, if you write it down in the variables with these length variables, the equations look somewhat complicated. They involve trigonometric functions of these length variables, so it looks really messy. But in the end, you actually But in the end, you actually just in the end, you know that the solutions have all to be basically describing flat space. So if you look for what are the lengths of these inner edges, well, you could just kind of geometrically figure out what is the length of these inner edges on a flat tetrahedron. And in fact, you might see that, well, once you have the length, you can still move around the inner vertex and still get a flat tetrahedron. And so, in fact, you will have a three-dimensional symmetry, gauge symmetry. There will be a three-dimensional space of solutions for the inner edge lengths here. But you will also find these kinds of Also, find these kinds of invariances under changes of the discretization, for instance, of the Hamiltonian-Coby action. So, the Hamiltonier-Kobe action will be actually just given, will only depend on the specifics of this outer tetrahedron and not. And you can just remove these inner edge lengths. So these are properties of these special series which are topological. But then you can actually also use this invariance equation to derive the nice quantities like the pars integral measure. Parse integral measure, which indeed makes these topological properties explicit. Okay. So these are extremely strong properties. So it's no surprise that constructing perfect discretizations for higher Constructing perfect discretizations for higher-dimensional systems is a bit more of an issue. So if you do not have a topological system, then they will be non-local. So the only exception I know is a discretization for free scalar fields where you use a lattice where all edges are null, but this has. All edges are null, but this has kind of only restricted a more restricted notion of diffeomorphism symmetry. And indeed, if I use the same kind of strategy of using renormalization or coarse screening for higher dimensional system, it does produce these non-localities. And so I can, well, here I don't show you the formula just to show you that in principle, you can compute this perfect action. This perfect action, at least for free systems, but this has been done for regular lattices only, because what you need is a Fourier transform on the lattice, and then you can basically express it in kind of implicit ways where you still have infinite sums involved. In some complicated manner, and that gives you, in principle, the action. But this is basically a non-local action in the sense that a given point will be coupled to all the other points in this example. An exception like An exception, like the topological field series are again an exception because one can show that in these cases the action remains invariant and local under the renormalization flow. And yeah, in these cases, these complicated expressions collapse to just the same expression you started with. And so to explain And so to explain, to have a more straightforward explanation of why non-topological systems have to be non-local. So for this local, I mean that your action does factorize in the sense that I can evolve from a given time slice to the next. To the next time slice using, for instance, only canonical data and on this given time slice, or that the action will only couple variables on the time slice 0 to the variables on 1, but it will not couple 0 to 2. So that would be a local action, which only couples neighboring time slices. Time slices. If that's the case, I can basically time evolve at least the canonical data from T0 to T1 and then from T1 to T2. If I have this perfect discretization, then I know I can basically remove points by moving them on top of each other. But in this case, it also means. This case, it also means well, less data. And so, if you evolve from here to here, well, you lose some data. And then you have somehow to find a way to restore this data again. And that cannot be done by an action which is local, as I described just. As I described just a second ago. So you can only do that if the action is actually coupling over more than one time step. And in fact, that happens under this renormalization. The time evolution from one time step to the next would actually also require to know the data on a lot of previous time steps. And for topological systems, however, such an evolution is possible because topological field theory, we usually call them also like field theories without propagating degrees of freedom, their physical content does not depend on the number of kind of discretizations you put or of the number of data. Of the number of data just on some topological properties of these data. So the really physical content you propagate does not depend on the number of discretization points here. Okay, so these for interest for non-topological series like four-dimensional gravity. Gravity. If we want to compute these perfect actions, they would be very non-local, which is just quite unpractical for our purposes. An alternative route is actually something which I call cylindrical consistent dynamics. Here, what you need first is to have a system of Have a system of partially ordered boundary data if you want. And so the idea is that you can have very coarse boundary data, but you should find a description of how to understand these coarse boundary data in a finer set of boundary data. So that can involve to set some variables to be zero, or it can involve piecewise linear approximation, or you approximate. Linear approximation, or you approximate some functions with trigonometric functions, or all kinds of other choices. And so you would define a partially ordered set of these boundary data. And in principle, compute the Hermetniacobi function for this very fine boundary data. And then you can find the action for your cost building block. Action for your cost building block by restricting the Hamilton Jacobi function to these cost data using these embeddings. And the crucial point here is actually finding convenient embedding maps. So depending on your choice of how you exactly embed these data is crucial and how difficult this process is of finding better and better description. Of finding better and better discretizations. And this rough idea is connected to methods called tensor network renormalization flows, which are used, for instance, in condensed matter for computing coarse-graining flows or the properties of condensed matter systems, and which we have applied to some systems which are. Some systems which are similar to gravity to find kind of what is the continuum element of these systems. Just as a last remark, which is a bit outside this topic, but which connects to integrability. So I've shown you basically that 3D gravity, or I told you 3D gravity is a topological system. Um, so uh, there's this, for instance, the Regci formulation, um, which is just a classical formulation with edge lengths, but it's already surprising that you know it looks quite complicated, but actually just describes flat space. There's also the so-called Ponzano-Recie model, which was invented in the 60s and then turned out to be also describable as a so-called SU2BF theory, and BF theory. You to BF theory, and BF theory is a family of topological theories you can write down in any dimensions. And they happen to describe in three dimensions 3D gravity. It's also known as a double of John Simon. So basically, you have, for instance, John Simon's theory here as a topological. A topological quantum field theory. But in this version of the Ponzano-Recent model, it's actually the same as Loop-Quantum gravity. What we have is a nice and complete description of the Hilbert space of states and so of the choices you can make for boundary states. And in this case, In this case, where we have a topological field theory, it's easy to integrate out everything in the bulk of this cylinder, for instance, which we can identify to torus. And doing so, what we find is that what we basically get are models which Models which we can kind of tune to, in particular, integrable models by choosing carefully the boundary states of our system here. And here you have lots of choice. So you have 2D statistical models, six vertex models, spin chains, and so on. And that might be. You know, that might be. I do think that's an interesting connection, where here again, you also can kind of evolve this boundary and would have kind of similar commuting flow equations for kind of how the boundary can be changed and evolved as in 3D gravity, where you have these interesting discretization independence conditions. Okay, that brings me to the end of my talk. So, diffimorphon symmetry in the discrete, we have seen it leads to very strong requirements. So, and it's so strong because basically it's that we can, the differomorphism symmetry basically allows to change like the discretization and with it. Discretization and with it the lattice constant and can be made varying in space and time. And we have to know the theory on all possible lattices at once. So in principle, we can construct these perfect discretizations by using renormalization of cost-graining flow and And in fact, we need to do that to find a consistent quantum theory if we use discretizations for constructing our quantum theory. And that will help to address lots of issues which we face otherwise, for instance, quantization ambiguities. Topological theories and these simple zero plus one dimensional systems allow for realizations of discrete diffimorphisms. Diffemorphisms and these can be used to construct series on the boundaries, which seem to lead to a valence of integrable boundary field series. Thank you. That is actually the end of my talk.
