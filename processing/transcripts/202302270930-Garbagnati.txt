So, good morning, everyone. On behalf of the organizers, we're very happy to have you here to the first Friday Bank conference. So, it took quite a while for this conference to actually concretize, but finally it's taking place and we're really glad. So, today's first talker is Alice Garbagnappi will talk about odd structures of K3 types for bidouble cover of rational surface. types for bidouble cover of rational surfaces and thank you thank you very much and thank you for the organizers of course so the aim of stock we do constructs and surfaces mainly of general type and the surfaces has a certain hodge structures which is not a priori of genealotype but the point is that that's the hodge structures of the transition analytics of research splits in the direct sum of sub hodge structures and Of subage structures, and each of these subage structures are of TV type, and moreover, they are really geometrically associated to cape surfaces. And this is what we want to do. The reasons for which we want to do that is that essentially are creating, are constructing surfaces which are of general types, so which are not so many information a priori about the variation of the out structures and the properties of the second. Structures and the properties of the second cohort groups. But since we relate it with some logic structures of K surfaces, we are able to describe some properties of these variations of these structures. So in general, the point is that if you relate the hard structure of the services of genotype with the hard structure of catered surfaces, you can have many informations about this hydro structure. And in particular, I would like to mention just two results. I would like to mention just two results. That is just to say that you can prove many things, for example, these two results, which is that under some conditions, we can discuss the fact that these surfaces satisfies the Manford conjecture, the Manfort theta conjecture, and the fact that some of these surfaces also enjoys the infinitesimal turret properties. And the reason is the way in which we constructed this kind of Which we construct these kinds of surfaces is the second part of the title. So we would construct this surface as bidouble covers of rational surfaces, which means that we start from the rational surface and consider certain specific Galois covers of this rational surface. Okay, so I would like to start. Just to fix some notations and some definition, I would like to recall that a large structure of 20 type is a large structure of 0.2. It's not a structure of weight two, of course, is of quicker type. If it is the following object, so it is a large structure, so I'm giving the decomposition of the complexification of vector spaces into three spaces with all the properties that are needed in order to have a narrative structure. So, this one is the conjugate of this one, but the point is that of But the point is that of K3 type means that the dimension obviously is 20 is one, and so it's the dimension of that one. And these are, of course, the case structures which appear as Hodge structures of cative surfaces. And again, to fix the notation, I want to underline that I always work over C. I consider compact and connected surfaces. I always require that everything. I always require that agglutination is normal, and I more or less always require that things are smooth. So, when I'm writing often smooth, I mean that if I don't say anything, then the surface are smooth. Otherwise, when something which is a single appear, I try to underline it. Okay, so how can this say validable cover? So I said with the surface, let us say Y, which is a small surface, as I said, otherwise. And I considered. And I consider a map from x to y, both of them are small, this is a viable comer. It is a galoat comer. Is Z squared, so it's a client, and this means that the group G, which is a group of subgroup of the group of the automorphism of X, and Y is a quotient of X over G. So sometimes this bidouble color could be singular, it depends on the branch locus, but. Depends on the branch locus, but we will see that there are some conditions which make real when they sing or not, and we will restrict ourselves to the cases where X is equal. Okay, so now since we have this group of automorphisms, it is of course generated by two common evolutions that I would call it in circulation, sigma one and sigma two. Sigma one, sigma two, and of course we have the third volume, which is the composition of this joint. So I have sigma one, sigma two, and we have that mute, and I call sigma three their composition evolution. Okay, so the axon. The axon surface axon, as I said, here we have the full quotients, which is the quotients of x g. But so here I have the action of g and then the action of sigma i. And for example, I can consider the action of sigma 1 and I consider the portions of x by sigma 1 and I obtain a surface which we call the y1. Surface which we call the y1, and of course, I can do the same by considering the other evolutions. So, here I'm constructing three surfaces which we call the yp, which are two character portions of x by the action of the evolution. And so there is a map which is a double cover between y i and x, and they are a cover of our surface y, of course, by using. Course by using the action of the quotient group G over C. Okay, so these are our two double cover. And the point is that these surfaces will be called the intermediate double cover, and they could be similar, even if Y and X are small. Y and X are smooth, they could be zero. Okay, so we are in this situation, and the action of this G over X, of course, induces an action of G over the second cohort group of F. And the point is that this action splits our second cohort knowledge group in Yeah, the X. I'm sorry, this was not an inclusion, it's an action. That was the symbol that I would like to say. So this splits, this one, in subspaces, which depends on the action of each of these evolutions. Of each of these evolutions on the Hague spaces that I'm considering. So essentially, I'm considering the representation of the group of the vector spaces, which is the second characters of this representation. So I can split these ones easily. So here I have the space plus plus plus, which is the space where sigma one and sigma two acts as plus identity. And the third things that you find here is the That you find here is the action of sigma 3, which is, of course, determinized by the action of sigma 1 and sigma 2, since it's just a composition. So I have here the space where sigma 1 is the identity, but sigma 2 is minus the identity, then also sigma 3 is minus the identity. And then I can reverse the role of sigma one and sigma two. role of sigma one and sigma two and then i have a space where both sigma one and sigma two are minus the identity and in this case sigma three is plus the identity so just splitting these vector spaces on the direction of g and i would like to remark to recall that the vector spaces the second homology group of any coercion surface depends just on the part of the homology of the hover which is involved Of the cover, which is invalid for the action of the group that I'm using in order to make a direction. So, the second chromology of Y1 is the environment part of the second chromology group of X with respect to the action of the full group. So, this is exactly that space that we have here. And let us consider, for example, the case of Y1, Y2 and Y3, because this is this space. Space and so it is the direct sum of two of the spaces which appear here. Indeed, we have the part which already appeared the cohomology of y and we have another part which appeared just in the cohomology of sigma 1, of y1, which is the space where sigma 1 is plus identity, but sigma 2 is not. Okay, and another thing that is needed, which is clear, is that all of these Is that all this action respect to the registration of H2XQ, which means that all these decompositions is also a decomposition of each structure and not just of vector spaces, and in particular, that these three objects respect also the decompositions of the second cohort group of The second cohomology group in the algebraic part of the cohomology group and rational part of the chromology group. Okay, well, so now as a consequences, just figure consequences of these marks. I would like to prove this theorem just because many of our results that we use in the following, but I have to so difficult to prove. So in the previous situation, so now one of our previous situation from now on our setting will be only that one and the notation would be always that one so x is a y double cover of y and y one y two y three are d to be a double cover we are like the transcendental architecture and these are structures for instance you know i got this here before so let's have to why Let one be a rational source. Then rational out of the topology of X splits in the direct sum of three objects, which are three sub-age structures, since I said that here we're working with the horizontal subject. And these Objects are the transcendental structures, the hard structure of the transcendental letters of the intermediate stubborn coup. And the proof is immediate because, I mean, you put here, inside here, you put the x, you know that the fraction of sigma preserved is splitting in the transmitter part and the part. So here we have tx plus plus plus. plus plus and here you have dx plus minus minus and then you have dx minus plus minus and then the last one minus minus plus and so what is happening is that here this part has to be what is written here the tension interstuction of the quotient of the full quotient so it is the tension interstructure of y which is triggered because y is rational so this part Because y is rational, so this part disappears, and so the tension integral of y should be the sum of the tension in y and something else, but the tension of y is trivial. And so here, you have just the tension of y, okay? So this is the point, and of course, the same happens of all the orange reads, these double covers, so they are here. So we decompose this very We decompose this the second homology in this way, sorry, with functional terms lattice in this way, and also a decomposition of the full cohomology, which can be done, but with an extra assumption. So if the car number of two of these intermediate level covers, let us say 22 and 13, just to presentation, Rejusted this notation are equal and equal to the Laura group of Y, which is the full second coherent group of Y since the functional part is serial. And we have a decomposition of a full cohomology in the following way. So here you have H2 of Y1, which is the direct sum of algebraic part of Y1 and of the version in the. And the transition into part of y1, everything is stensorized q, plus the function in the part of y2 plus the transition into part of y3, and everything is stensarized in q. And essentially, this decomposition also comes very clear in the sense that what seems that it is missing is the algebraic part of y2 and y3, but the algebraic part of y2. Things, but the algebraic part of y2 and y3 are mapped to the algebraic part of y, which is contained in the algebraic part of y1, because the algebraic part of y is the algebraic part of y1, which is invariant under something. So why would you restrict? Can you say why do you restrict to certain certain stuff? No, no need to restrict to services at all. Just because at a certain point I would like to speak about it. A certain point, I would like to speak about H is what I wonder is actually why is TY1 taking the H2O X2 plus minus minus? Can you take that? I mean here inside I have T plus T1 Y1. Okay, so here what I'm saying is that this should be Tx plus plus intire sum to Tx plus minus, okay? Plus minus, okay, and this is if you can survive everything with glue, everything is T1, okay? So this part is T1 because it is the part which is going to prove everything, but Ty is trivial. So this part is trivial, and it is trivial because Y is rational. So that's not rational part, and so it remains just this part. And hence, here in this decomposition, this part is trivial. this decomposition this part is trivial and this becomes dy1 because this is the part which is involved from sigma 1 and the other one t y2 okay so and here and so what i'm saying is just that we are the complete speaking of a second home group i just want to mention that later we worked on a specific example and you put the results similar results for the child group of the zero cycle of degree zero of the search Of degree zero of the surfaces under the hypothesis that by his rational hypothesis, and okay, one can just generalize his remark to all the possible variable cover that we are considering. Okay, so what is the point? The point is that now we were looking for surfaces such that it's a second homology group and how it's actually part of the semiconductor group speeds. Part of semi-compology of speaks structure of k3 type, and so of course, from now on, we want to make a new assumption, which is the only one. So, from now on, why is moving rational? And the fact that it is rational allows us to have this decomposition and this decomposition. And we assume that at least one of the surfaces which appear here as a non-trivial structure. Structure, and in particular, we require that it is a K3 surface and Yi is either a K3 or a surface with Pg equal to zero. So the genomic genome sum of the surface is zero, which is the dimension of the space H to zero, which h to zero, which implies that the detachment of part of y1 is true. Okay, so here i is one. So from now on, this will be our assumption because under these assumptions, we have that star, so if star, then the fodge structure of x split x and equals like some of the fodge structures. Of body structures which are of ketic type because if something is not of ketic type, then it's frequency of patriot type, but I would like to be more precise. I would like to be more precise in the sense that these are not just subject structure of cater type, but they are really a logic structure of a catary surface. It's known that if you have a subject structure of cater type inside an algebra structure of a surface, then there exists a catary surfaces which has exactly that algebra structure, has structures or the cater surfaces, but a priori is not known how you can construct it. We can construct, but in this situation, you have a very clear relationship between this horizontal structure and the geometrically attached case. Okay, so there could be other cases where you have the splitting. Yeah, I mean, it's plenty of examples in which you have the splitting, even because I mean, a priori, a subject extraction of K3 type is given by also by the abbeyan surface. So you have a surface which has some quotients, some are k3 surface. Which has some quotients, some are catric surfaces, some other linear surfaces, you can obtain the same things. But moreover, in general, if you have a surface which has geometric genus equal to two and which is a double cover of a KV surface, then its mark is W is the w code of Z. A double cover of Z, Z is a case surface, and this is a two to one cover, then HQW of Q splits in two understature of giving type. This is the issue, of course, which is that Eg of W is equal to two zero. So, in this case, for example, you have splitting, one of these two comes from the pullback of the one of Z, the other is orthogonal. I have no idea of how to associate it to a case surface, it's just the orthogonal of the ones that you find inside. So, we are here, and I just want to mention that. Here. And I just want to mention that quickly that in this situation, essentially by the composition that is written here, one can put the following here. I don't want to go in the place. We are in the condition. It's not hard. So we have our data cost. Yes, I watch details call them. And we make all this assumption here if y X is of general type And also, the conditions of the pitar number that I mentioned before month of data conjecture and date conjecture. For X. So I don't want to use everything. But the idea is to use a. Excuse me, before you continue, there is a point I missed. In the diagram there, the Y3, is that it's a case three. How can we how can we have a double cover? I mean why is V is a simply connected? No, but it it's a branching double colour. No, but it's a branch double code. Oh, it's a branch. Sorry, infigular is branching. Yeah, sorry. And to be honest, it is not really KT surfaces, a similar model of KT surfaces. And we will see that the branch is given by the singular points and another curve which appears. So in this point, we have that Manforte and the conjecture also, and the proof is more or less based on these decompositions. On these decompositions. The point is that, if I don't want to talk really about motives now, is that this decomposition of the second cohort knowledge group of X, since it comes from a very geometric situation, can be translated in a decomposition of a motifs of surfaces, because essentially you can translate everything here in terms of correspondences. So this decomposition also at the level of the motives of the kidney. At the level of the motives of the surface of the surface X. And here we have a motives of something which is essentially the cohomology of X, the motives of Y, so of a rational surface, so it's a left check motive. And here we have three motives which are the fundamental part of the motives of petri surfaces or they are trivial. And by results of common in this situation, since each of the summons satisfies the Satisfies demand for take conjectures, even is able to prove that also the direct sum satisfies demand for take conjectures. So the motives of X satisfy the motivic versions of the mark for take conjecture, so the surface satisfying also the mass of the conjecture. If the mass of the conjecture holds and the approach conjecture holds, then the take conjecture holds, these are surfaces, so cultural injection falls, and so on. So is a positive motive between the collection of what I wrote plus these results of common which is a strong result because it's not really a pinoid that if you have something which is a direct sum of objects for which the one for tape conjecture was 10 the one for tape conjecture all the support and to be honest this is really needed if Let us go back to we are that Tx is essentially a direct sum of these three objects and under our condition we are that Pg of X is the sum of the Pg of Y one, Y2 and Y3 because it's written here essentially. Here, essentially, and so this number is less than or equal to three under these conditions because these objects are either trivial or of kettle type. So, we construct a surface with Pg less than or equal to three. And if Pg of X is equal to one, then you have a surface of general type of Pg equal to one, the month of the conjecture was already built by Mooney. So we should consider some other services for which one could be judged. And I would like to underline that commonly put this in results, but it does not give so many examples of services which satisfy these conditions and no example at all constructively in this way. So, okay. Yeah, the conditions are okay. Yeah, the conditions are exactly what I mean. I mean, that's the question: how restrictive is this? How restrictive is this? I mean, I need it because otherwise I have no explicit thing of the second combinology. And of course, everything here until here can be the empty set. The second part of the talk, I would construct examples as all this would not be empty. And in the end, I give now the second part or two in which I would like to say how we can construct this is the easier part because here we are considering a catary surface which has a cover, which is a cover of rational surfaces, you know, and we are requiring that the Picard number of this one is equal to the Picard number of this one, which means that the covering of Number of this one, which means that the covariable which we hear is the identity of the non-spirit group. So it's plenty of surfaces which are this type. They are classified by Nicole and they are only there or families of catary surfaces which admits non-simple. Okay, so constructions of viable cover alternative. Alternative property. This part is very much based on old results by Catanesa and Pardini. Pardini studied the ability covers. They cannot albinum covers in which the objects appear and here are smooth, but slight modification almost apply her results to our situation in which something is not smooth. And Catherine studied a lot. And Katanise studied a lot this bidouble cover of spatial rational surfaces P1 cross P1 in order to construct the surface original type with prescribed invariance. So by their results, and now I can say that it is a very classical result, we are that if Y is moved and there exists a bidouble cover. Of Y ranged on D1, union D two, union D three, where Di are curves inside Y, they are reduced, not necessarily reducible. So there exists a binable corpus if and only if. Of course, if and only if for every i, j, and k per notation of one, two, three, di plus dj is two times L K, where L K is a class inside the Picard group of Y. So I'm saying that if you take two of these curves and you consider the These curves, and you consider the sum of them, then it is too divisible. So, if you divide by two, you find something which is still inside the car. So, this is a very classical conditions. You need to recognize the conditions about the existence I invite it as well. With the condition which says that you can construct a double open of y panches over sorry, I'm just rewriting here what we are saying. Yeah, what we're seeing, which says that you can construct a double colour of y of y. Let us make here the picture twice any surface. Is there any surface? That's that's exactly the condition to have a that will cover any item. That will cover any item. So, here you have this three divisor: D1, D2, and D3, which are curves, and you know that there exists a double cover ranged on a divisor. If this object as a divisor is to be visible inside the Piccadill group, so I consider the cover range of number D1 and D2, and these allows me to construct a surface-wide thing. stuff is surface white thing now i desire to give a name to this map this p3 so this surface could be similar if it is similar it is similar because it is similar dimensional whose since the basis is smooth and in particular it could be similar because d1 is similar because d2 is similar in that case i'm not interested in that similar point but it is surely similar also on this set of points which are either s which are the inverse image of Which are the inverse image of the intersection between the one and d2. Okay, so now I would like to construct another double cover, and one has to prove that it is possible is exactly what Cartaness and Bartini did, which is a 2-1 cover granted on S, so on these sides of similar points, and on the pullback of the third divisor which appears here. Third divisor which appears here. Okay, so this is the reason for which this bidouble cover is this double cover is related to the structure of the bidouble cover because to construct this one, we use all these free divisors and of course you can just permute the indices and obtain these other groups. So this is a construction of a biological cover and the point is that here the cover over dissimilar points could resolve the similarity. Similar points could resolve the similarities, and indeed we have the results by Capanese, which is that if di are smooth and the union of d1, d2, and d3 is similar and crossing, then x is much so the first condition implies that all The first condition implies that all the singularities of these surfaces are due to the fact that some of these divisors intersect. And the second condition says that these singularities are of type A1, and hence when you construct the double colour branch of that singularities, you find something which is more. So this is the situation. And of course, since you have all the data of our dynamic over in terms. By the block over in terms of d1 d23 or this LK, which appears here, you are able to compute all the variants of the surface that you are constructing. It's not really important what are the conditions, but the point is that we are able to compute the self-intersection of the canonical bundle of X by using ones of Y and the data of the pineapple cover, which are this V1, D2, and D3, and also the other context of Y. Euler context of y of x, I hope it will derive y, but in any case, the point is that there are some. Okay, so the eyes seem to be without common components, yeah. Sorry, yeah, I mean this simple normal crossing is actually useful. So, okay, so. Okay, so what is the point? The point is that now our condition star, which I would like to rewrite here, can be rewritten as this one. So that's diagonal on the upper whiteboard. So initial start was: okay, I would like y to be smooth and rational. Okay, I start with a smooth direction surface. Then I would like that y is a k3, which means that this double curve is branched in such a way that this surface, or at least its resolution, has a trivial canonical boundaries. So for example, if y is p2, we want that the one union d2 is a sexy. So d1 plus d2 plus 2ky has to be trivial. And the condition Y3 with PG equal to zero is equivalent to the fact that D1 plus sorry DI plus D3 over here plus K1. The linear system of this space is a dimension less than or equal to zero, where I put the dimension of an empty space equal to minus one. So it's either empty or contained or okay. So this is the we are able to translate all our star conditions in the convex curves which should appear on the surface. Okay, so we are looking just Okay, so we are looking just on certain rational surfaces which admit some conditions. Okay, and this is exactly what can be used in order to classify all the bi-double cover of new functional surfaces which satisfies this condition. And hence, this is the way in which one proves that certain conditions are non-lamps. I just want to mention another theorem. So this was all We are always in the same positions, and moreover, D1, D2, and D3 as classes inside the Picard group are proportional in the Picard group inside the cube. D2 and D3 are rational. And all minus ky minus dr minus li has no global section, then infinity is matters. Okay, so essentially things. So, essentially, in fact, this method of any properties is the injectivity of a certain map. And Paldini suggests to studies this map, just considering it as a direct sum of maps which are related with the action, with the homological action of our group. So, since we are able to describe very well the chromological action of our group, we are able to describe that maps. And at a certain point, you have some short or long exit sequence, and in order to conclude, Sequence, and in order to conclude, you need that some maps are zero and something like that. And these are conditions which assure that the maps that you need are injective of such. So this was proved in a very special case for just one of these bioperman design. And we go back to the approval trying to understand what are the conditions that they are really using. That they are really using, and so we generalize it for all the binary covers which satisfy this condition. So, this is non-empty because we started with an example of each false. And as you see, these are many conditions. So, it's more complicated, it's quite difficult that we find a broker satisfies all these conditions, but still not example. So, I would like more of my diagnoses and then I want you. Lunch, and then I want you to show you how you can classify these surfaces. So I start with an example which is not really specific. So I would like that it is a smooth fractional surface. And since I would like to restrict a little bit my classifications, because otherwise we have too much cases, one of the possibilities is to require that the surface is minimal. Required a surface mean. So in these cases, y can be p2, of course, or it can be p1 cross p1, or it can be a hilarious surfaces. And in this case, we can choose and to be too free or flow. The reason is that, okay, f is. The reason is that okay, f0 is just p1 plus p1, so I'll make four. f1 is non-minimal because it contains a minus one curve. So this is the reason for which I won't take zero and one. And if n is bigger than four, there are no double covers of fn which are catering surfaces. And since here we want a cater surface, at least there should be double cover of y which is a catal surface. And the reason is that here. Serves and the reason is that here it would appear a curves of self-intersection minus n and if it is n and look at the variable cover, what happens is that the self-intersection of the curve remains the same or it will be divided by two, but not more. But if here I have something which has self-intersection bigger than less than minus four, then I would find here negative curves with a self-intersection which is not minus two. Which is not minus two. And so this cannot be a case results. So this is the first point. And I want to keep the classification here just for the easiest cases. But we perform all the classifications also for P1 plus P1 and for the surfaces. But here I just wanted to show how you can do everything in the cases of two. But the distribution is exactly the same. It's just just okay so i start with one which is p2 and i would like to recall that di plus dj has to be equal to l k which means that okay vi is a curve in v2 so it is associated to each degree and this condition is the conditions of degrees of my curves i would like that this is equivalent Would like that this is equivalent to zero mod two. So this means that di is d one is equivalent to d2 equivalent to d3 mod. Then I want that d one plus d2 plus 2ky is trivial, which means that y is a k3, y3 is a k3. This is true if and only if d1 plus d2 is 6 and the conditions on the yi And the conditions on the yi is equivalent to di plus d3 is less than or equal to six. Okay, and so come on, now everything is very clear because the classification depends only on the choices of this degree. So I have I can d1 plus d2 is six, so the one cannot be more than six. If it were six grain also. Than six. If it were six, then also D2 has to be zero, d2 has to be zero, but then also d3 has to be c. So two of the divisor will be n. But here, these surfaces is ranging exactly on d1, u and d2. So if both of them are empty, then this would be a cover of p2, an entire cover of p2. So it will not be connected. So the one. So d1 cannot be six. Okay, so let's start with five. If it is five, this condition implies that d2 is one, and this condition implies that also d3 is one. If it would be two, then this condition implies that v2 is two, and this condition implies that d0 can be zero or two. I have to recall that all of them are equivalent, not two. And then here I can put three, three, one, three, three. And then I stop it because if I go on, I obtain that d1 would be two, but then I go back to this case, just reversing the goal of d1 and true. So what are the surfaces which appear in the middle of our construction? This is a rational surface because it is a co-growth pituper along two lines. This is a catary surface, and these are another creative surfaces. Both of them are the urine. Is more of them are the UNI, the double cover of the two-branched double-quintic and the line, not always the same line, still alive. So these are cater surfaces. And then I can go on exactly the same way. I always obtain a cater surface here because this was my original condition. So it's not a catering surface if I make a mistake. These are rational, rational, rational. And in the last case, we have another cat surface. And this is a rational surface. And this is a rational in this case, rational in this case in this case, and rational in this case, and the catalyst surface in this case. So, and this implies that we are able to compute pg of x. So, this is 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, because it is a sum of geometric genes of all the surfaces. Then one can compute also the settings. Then one can compute also the set intersection of the canonical boundary by one formula which exists. In this case, it's one, zero, sorry, in this case is four, one, nine. And then we have the information on X. Okay, X is moved. It's a smooth surface. I don't know if it's not, but it is a smooth surface. If the self-intersection of a canonical bundle is positive, then also the self-intersection of a canonical bundle. Of the self-intersection of a canonical bundle of its minimum of its positive. So, X is a surface in these cases with such that the self-intersection of a canonical bundle is positive, it cannot be rational because it is a cover of the surface, and so it is a surface of general power. Okay, and now we can talk about the Manford data conjecture. The Manford data conjecture all We move for that conjunction all except for this surface and for this surface and for this surface by the theorem that I said before. And I will try to in order to say that at least in one cases the conditions of the theorem are satisfied. It also in these cases, but it also by the bonus answer, because in this case we have that pg is equal to one and so as I said this was already done. And so, as I said, this was already done by modeling. And then I would like to talk about the parallel properties this holds in the first cases, which is exactly the cases studied by Perlman and Zang. It also, in this case, is by our theorem. We don't know if it also or not in this case. I mean, in this case, our theorem, the hypothesis of our theorem are not satisfied because all the curves here are genus line. Here are the stigma swine, so they are not natural. I don't know if the trendy works or not. In this case, it does not hold for sure. This is a surface which was already constructed by Platov exactly as a sample of a surface which has the same multi-structural surface, but for which the infinity does not hold. So it's normal. The last case that needs to study is the one where self-intersection. The one where the intersection of the chemical band is zero. So P2, we have P2, then D1 is a vertical because of the first one. And D2 is a count. And D3 is empty. So when I perform my first table cover, I obtain this surface, which is a singular in P3 minus 1 of intersection of 1, 2, which are 8. Two, which are eight points. Okay, and it is a singular model of a cable surfaces because, of course, it is branched over sex. Okay, so if I resolve these singularities, I obtain eight disjoint minus two curves, these joint rational curves. Now I'm constructing here the double cover of y one ranged on these eight points, which means that when I draw up and then I construct my double cover, I'm constructing a double cover of a casing surface ranged on eight. Serves branched on A disjoint rational curves. So, this is very well known to be a cat cells. Okay, so hex is a model, it's birational to a gate results. Because, as I said, I have the blow-up, then I consider the corporate and obtain something which is a blow-up. So, X, as I said, is a model of the catalyst surface, and it is a minimal model because the minimal model because the self because x is smooth and the self-intersection of the canonical boundary is zero so there are no spaces to conjure something so this is really x is really a k3 surface mean by kern surface and so here we have k3 and of course the map of t injection k3 is mantra and also for these objects exactly because the starting point is that we would like to study these properties on X because we know that they always We know that we always are satisfied by KD services. Okay, so what we said is that under our conditions, we can obtain a KD service, a service of general type or surface of general type as double cover. And moreover, one can know that in the case, X is minimal. And this is another motivation to choose Y to be minimal, in the sense that since we are able to compute case X square, Compute case x square, and we have surfaces of general type. If the surface is minimal, we are really classifying these surfaces of general type in the sense that we are really giving some invariants which have a meaning. Otherwise, the self-intersection of the canonical boundary is not so important because it's used to say that the surface is of gene type, but does not identify the family of surfaces that we are considering if we don't know how to construct a minimal model analysis. So the self-defense. So the second reason for which we distinguish with the minimal fashion surfaces here is that a posteriori, we are able to prove that then also the surface X is minimal. So just to mention the results, if we are loss, if we consider the other two cases, so cases where y is p1 plus p1 or f2, then we Two, then in the same way we obtain six surfaces one abedian surface. So there are choices for the branch data in such a way that we obtain K2 surfaces. There are six different choices. There is one choice for which we obtain an abelian surface. We obtain also trying to properly. Also, trying to properly surfaces, and we obtain 14 surfaces of genetic. For all of them, but true, the Manfortex conjecture false. And thus, for three of them, we are able to show that also they see this matter any false. This is because the confusion. So, the very last remark that I would like you to know just because this is what I think. Just because this is a talk on creative surfaces, conferences on catalytic surfaces, I would like to underline that the surfaces which appear at this level are very special. So these gaming surfaces has two very nice properties, two-to-one cover of fresh surfaces. So they emit no simple. So there needs a non-symblatic evolution and genericum can observe that this non-symblike evolution is traded around the non-specific group. And so these allows to compute not just to say that these are these are catered surface, but to compute the non-special group penetration lattice of this catalyst surface. And so one knows all the cater surfaces which appear in this construction. But the point is that they have another conditions which is less Another condition which is less study but still interesting, which is the midsummer. And also, this condition can be written in terms of the Noren's Very group of the surface because this means that there are some curves which appear in the branch locus, and each of these curves give a classes inside the Glassdoor group. The classes inside the Mausoleum group, and the sum of all this curved divided by two is still contained in the Mass V. So, one is really able to rewrite also the condition of G is known, there is no double cover of the case surface in terms of electric theoretic conditions. So, the fact that the case surface appears here means that these two conditions match and produces the same consequence. So, the surface which appears here are very special because they satisfies both these choices. This guy is both distributions. Okay, sorry, I could take, for example, one of your cases where you have a general type. And then you could deform that surface abstract. Yeah. Assumably your optimal physics. Can you say anything about the default zones in that game, and I think also in other places automation too is known that in this way you obtain all the deformations which still have the automorphism loop. But when you deform without requiring that the G remains a group of automorphism, you find something else. You find something else, so the family is bigger than the ones that we construct. And yeah, I mean, this one is known to be double cover, so it always remains one. This is of a weighty projective spaces. And I think that you can put it inside a weighted projective space at a surface of degree 10. So, I mean, this surfaces is known essentially because of the purposes of. Because of the properties of the environment. So you recognize that it is in the components of a space of a surface of genotype systems. But this surface is less known. The other ones which need not true. So I do not have any information about the geometry of the deformations of the surfaces. I still do know what evolution remains or not. What? What of course take for the definition? Yeah, I've been out of data also. It still knows. This is also for the deformations of expertise. And the problem is that, to be honest, when I perform these other two simulations, I'll be only can obtain deformations, different descriptions of surfaces which are in the same deformation type, at least if I don't. Sometimes I find some different invariants. I find some different invariants, but sometimes not. And in all the cases in which they could be the same, they have the same property with respect to the mass for data and to try. I cannot use the next two instruments. They have the same kind of thing. The other questions? You can also presume you get it by starting from any rational elliptic surface and just taking a backward valid base change. Is that one of your examples somewhere? I think you find something like that. It's one of the examples that you constructed of that type. I mean, it wants to be one of the ones that you find something which is probably elliptic, for example. In that case, it's yeah. We have that example already. Yeah, I have some of these examples in particular. I have it in the case of P1 plus Piloana. add it in the case of p1 plus p1 i consider base change here which gives me one c that the g3 surface which appear here are endowed with an elliptic foundation and then essentially here I'm performing another exchange so after you can start here for example minimal model of a national magnetic surface there a question yeah In your case, when you have the printed and the line, you have two covers, one print and line at printing and line, and it's geometrically, so the positions are the same of the line, so they cut in the same way, or you know how. I mean, the point is that generically, I have no conditions at all. So generally, I have a predict, a line, and another. And of course, I can make the situation more special by requiring that one of them specialize, for example, I mean, it comes now. In this case, okay, here we have two K3 surfaces. A priori, they live in the same family, which is the families of K3 surfaces in the corner of K2 with these branch logs. If I modify the position of one of them, I can change one trunction at the legislature of one or of both of them. But I mean, what is really what happens when I can deform this is that either I deform. Is that either I deform that you went at one of these two surfaces changes, or I can deform by considering the situation in which the branch normal is not simple normal tossing. So for example, I can see that these three, these two ones intersect on the wing point. In that case, this surface would not be smooth, but Katanese computed what is the minimum border of the smooth surface, and he computed the economic. And you computed the self-intersection of the canonical boundary. Self-intersection of the canonical boundary changes. And this is quite nice because this in the situation that I described, this is that one. In this situation, the two case reserves which appear here are not special because there are no peculiarity of the lines with respect to the printing. Of the lines with respect to the printing. So the harsh structure of X is always the same. The harsh structure has nothing to do with the similarization, which is the algebraic tape. But the surface that you produce is different because its minimum model has a different self-intersection of the chemical model. So modifications of these data or the branch data could be induces some modifications of y two and y three of their hodge structure. Of their Hodge structure, or identification of the self-intersection of a common bundle of X without changing the SOH structure.
