Experiments approached that we took recently to try and think about how electric fields can impact and guide cell vicinity. So I don't know if everyone who's in the audience and they don't have so much of a chance to chat with everyone as usual. So maybe just a quick overview of what we do in my group. So we're very interested in understanding the mechanisms that drive connective cell motility and then how they combine with other processes like cell cell adhesion or Processes like cell cell adhesion or cell substrate adhesion, proliferation and death to give rise to very complicated processes. And a lot of the work we do focuses on aspects of embryo development, really thinking about using the embryo as a means to understand sort of the generation of tissue synovo and then extrapolating that understanding to what happens when sort of growth breast tissues go wrong in diseases such as cancer, or thinking about sort of Thinking about sort of brain-tuning or tissue engineering in regenerative medicine. And increasingly, I would say that over since I sort of did my PhD, the real change really like in developmental biology has come from the fact that the data is no longer sort of very qualitative and descriptive, but much more quantitative. And I think our goal in the group has really been to think about how to kind of maximise insights we can get about the biological system and thinking about by really talking. System, we're thinking about by really tying the model and the data quite closely together. And what I'm going to try and do today is show you an example when we've done that. So, increasingly, you know, kind of preaching to the converted, we used to spend life very much up here in terms of developing the models and analysing them, simulating them, collaborating with experimental groups. And I would say that the kind of real change over the past sort of five oxides has been to kind of get much more involved in the sort of data analysis and model testing side of things. The model testing side of things. Again, what I want to talk about today. So, I'm going to think about a context of direct-to-cell migration. We've just heard about various aspects of directed cell migration, but I wanted to point out here that there are lots of different ways essentially in which cells correspond to cues for their environments and migrate in a directed fashion. So, probably hemotaxis being one of the most well-known, and that's the example you can see in the movie on the right. See in the movie on the right. But we also know about, we're going to hear about other mechanisms such as haptotaxis, so essentially motion up gradients of either substrate bound chemicals or adhesion sites, and geurotaxis, so thinking about gradients in sort of matrix stiffness or the rigidity within the environment. What I want to talk about today though is a type of directed motion that's probably a bit less well explored and a bit less well modelled, and that's electrotaxis. Modelled, and that's electrotaxis, sometimes called Gervanotaxis. And so, essentially, this is the directed movement of cells in response to an applied DC electric field. So, on the left, you can see this population of cells that are essentially experiencing a field from left to right and then up to down. And you can see that they move in a hugely directed fashion that's a collective, initially left to right, and then they can switch to moving upwards. And then on the left-hand side, you can see a similar kind of The left hand side, you can see a similar kind of MIVI where essentially the field is initially switched off and then it's switched on in the up-down direction. And you see, as the field direction is changing, you see these very quick response of the cells. So we know that a wide variety of different types of cells can sense and can follow these applied electric fields, and we know that these kinds of fields arise naturally in biological tissues during, for example, development and during brain healing. Development and during brain teaming, but we don't know a lot about kind of how they really are influencing cell migration, and that's what I want to focus on today. And I think one of the reasons I'd like to do that is because I think sort of this huge controllability that comes from using an electric field to guide cell migration. And I think sort of way down the line, there's a lot of potential to use sort of electric fields to develop new therapeutic options. And this is what this next slide is for. And this is what this next slide is all about. So, there's already this concept out there in the literature of these kind of bioelectric plasters. The idea being that if you can essentially use a plaster to deliver an electric field across the wound, then maybe you can accelerate wound healing. I'm not totally convinced by the results in this paper, but what I do think is that we have the potential to use modelling to better understand how electric fields guide cell motility and then to make progress in these sort of therapeutic actions. Options. So, my real kind of big goal is: can we develop electrotaxis using a combination of essentially models and experiments into some kind of bioengineering tool that would have eventual uses down the line in tissue engineering and brain teaming, for example? But we're kind of right at the start of that process. So we know there's been a huge history of developing models for single cell motility in the absence of electric fields. In the absence of electric fields, and there's been lots and lots also of models of cellular collectors in the absence of electric fields. And we know quite a lot as well about how to scale between those two different modelling frameworks so that we can represent the behaviour of individuals in a population-level model. So, there aren't very many models of the impact or the motility of cells, either single cells or collectives, in the presence of an electric field. So, the kind of way in which we're trying to progress things. We're trying to progress things is to think about how to go from models of single cell motility in the absence of a field to models of single cell motility when the field is applied, and then eventually scale all that up to think about the motion of collectives under electric field stimulation. But we're right here at the top at the moment, really. Okay, so first of all, I just want to kick off by showing you the data that we're going to work with today. You, the data that we're going to work with today. And so, essentially, we're looking at populations of human corneal epithelial cells. So, they're relatively low density, so we're essentially going to assume that they don't interact with one another. And we've got essentially movies taken over a period of five hours, so we've got images essentially every five minutes. And we've got two control data sets where we essentially don't apply any kind of electric field, and the data in terms of known. And the data in terms of numbers that we extract from these experiments is to track the positions of about thirty cells over the time course of the experiment. So that's our control data set. That's going to be used to parameterize a model of single cell motility without a field. And then we've got a data set that includes the application of electric fields. So same cell type, same imaging windows for over five hours, imaged at five minute time intervals. And what you should Five-minute time intervals, and what you should be able to see is that when it really starts again, that for essentially the first hour of this experiment, so starting at now, there's no field, and then the field is from left to right, it's essentially getting all the cells to move from left to right, and that's for hours two to three. And then for the final two hours of the experiment, the field direction is reversed, so about now you can see all the cells reorientate and move in the other direction. And again, from these experiments, we're tracking about 30 or 10. We're tracking about 30 or so cells from each of these experiments over the entire period of the assay. Okay, so what did I want to say? So the first thing I wanted to talk about is essentially what we would call an autonomous model, and that is a model of cell motility in the absence of an applied electrical, so that control data set. So we're going to have a really, really quite simple model. So essentially, position up just So essentially, position up just updates because the cell has some velocity, and then we assume that the velocity of the cell is essentially driven by its polarity, and that's what actually goes model. So, we've got a parameter B in here, which we might describe as the modal cell speed, and then we're going to write down an SDE for how the cell polarity evolves over time. So, essentially, we've got a drift diffusion equation where we've got this potential. This potential W that we need to specify. So, in order to kind of think that this is a sensible model to write down, what we did was we essentially eyeballed, if you like, the control data set. So, in the top, what you can see is from each of those data sets, we've got each line being, or each news curve being one cell, and this is the distribution of displacement distances of each of those cells over the five-hour imaging experiment. Experiment. And so, what you can see is really that these are sort of consistent with a model where cells are going to spontaneously polarize, and in which case they're going to travel with a positive speed, but they can also transiently depolarize. So that's going to tell us something about the potential function w. And then the other thing is that if we look at the autocorrelation between the angle movements over those five-minute intervals, you can see that that really decays over time. Decays over time, and that's consistent with the assumption that essentially the velocity direction, or in our case we're going to call it clarity, evolves according to a random walk. So we have to make some kind of modelling decisions for what W is going to look like. And so we know in the absence of an electric field that cells spontaneously polarise, but their direction of motion is unbiased. So we can just think of W instead of being a function of vector P, being a function of scalar P. Vector P being a function of scalar P, which is just the modulus or the magnitude of P, and then we're going to make this specific choice for the former W. So essentially, this represents the fact that cells are going to spontaneously polarise, and then the magnitude of their polarity is going to sit around about one, and it's going to be undirected. So, this is our autonomous model all set together. And essentially, we've got three parameters in the model, right? We've got the parameter B up here. The parameter B up here, which relates to the mode or cell speed, and then out of the SDE for the cell polarity, we've got a time scale ramp to D. And we've also got the parameter beta. And more typically, we're going to think about this as the parameter delta W, which is just a scaling of that parameter beta and represents the potential energy arrow. Okay, so there are the three parameters that we've got in our model, and one of the key goals really was to estimate those parameters from the data that they're just. From the data that I just showed you in those movies. So, to estimate those parameters, we want us to take a Bayesian approach where we're essentially aiming to estimate the posterior distribution of the model parameters theta given the data that's collected in the absence of the electric field. And using Bayes' rule, we can write that as proportional to the product of the likelihood of the data from the parameters and the prior distribution pi, which essentially just encodes any sort of previous knowledge we might have about the parameters. Previous knowledge we might have about the parameters. So, in general, pretty much all we can tell you in the system is that they're non-negative. And we're going to factor that because we can think about each of our cells or assume that each cell that we're collecting data for is really independently of the others. So, this is essentially when I put an index I on here, this just corresponds to the fact that this is cell I out of about the 30-year tract. Okay, and just to remind you, we're estimating the parameters V, D, and delta. The parameters V, D, and delta W. So, the thing that you realise quite quickly is that the likelihood in this problem, given the model we've chosen, is intractable. And so, we decided to go down the route of using synthetic bays to approximate the posterior distribution. So, the idea with synthetic bays is that what you want to do is to find some summary statistics of those trajectories. So, typically, you might think about essentially the displacement at the end of, from kind of start to finish. At the end of from kind of start to finish position over the entire course of the experiment, or you might just look at the X displacement, or you might look at sort of almost the length of the trajectory as measured over the course of the experiment. So we want some summary statistics that essentially describe those trajectories. And then what we're going to do is approximate that likelihood with what we call a synthetic likelihood of the data. And essentially, it's the likelihood of that summarised data. Summarise data under the assumption that then it's Gaussian distributed. Okay, and the nice thing about doing that is that then all of a sudden the likelihoods become much easier to work with. Okay, so I don't want to kind of go too much more into the details, but the kind of take-home point really is that we can get a relatively good handle on all of the parameters, those three parameters in the model, given the data. So on the diagonal, what you're seeing is the marginal posterior distribution. The marginal posterior distribution. So, for each of those parameters, V, delta, W, and D, we've got fairly tight estimates of the parameter values. And what you're seeing on the off-diagonals are the bivomic posterior distributions. And the sort of take-home message is that if you look at the ones below the diagonal, what you're seeing is where the posterior mass sits over the whole prior distribution. So, because we had relatively little idea, especially for D and delta W, what sensible values were. W what sensible values were. We took a very wide prior distribution on those parameters, and you can see that we've really sort of focused in and the posterior mass lies in a very small region of that prior space. And then, if you look above the diagonal, you basically can see zoomed in versions of those bivariate posterior distributions. But the take-home message is that essentially we can identify each of the parameters in the model given the data we've got. So, then, more sensible thing that you might like to do is to essentially do a posterior predictive check. So, at the top, I'm just showing you essentially what the posteriors look like, the marginal posteriors look like for each one of those parameter values. And I'm showing you both kind of assay, the two replicates of the assay separately and also the combined posterior. And then, to do our posterior predictive check, essentially, what we're going to do is sample repeatedly from. Is sample repeatedly from those posterior distributions, simulate the model, and look at the distribution of outputs we get and compare back the data. And because we've used synthetic base and we've used summary statistics of the data, we're going to do that comparison in that summary statistics base. So you can see that actually the summary statistics we used to generate those posteriors were horizontal displacement, overall displacement, path length, and interval variability. And I think the take-home message. And I think the take-home message really here is that the model seems to be doing a relatively good job of predicting the dynamics, which is good news. Then, the other thing I guess you can do with your model is you can make some predictions about various aspects of the dynamics that you can't necessarily get a handle on from the experiments. So, we can, of course, simulate positions of the cells over time. So, this is what the data would look like if all the cells were kind of placed at the origin and we just drew their trajectories. Drew their trajectories, and at the bottom you can see what the simulated trajectories would look like as well. And not maybe 100% visible, but doing something approaching like a good job. But the thing that you can get out of it, as I said, is other types of measurements. So we can estimate using the model the distribution of times for the cells to polarise. So this is kind of spontaneous polarization within the experiment, times to depolarize, and the probability essentially. Polarised and the probability essentially that a cell is polarised at any time. So these are predictions that come out of the model for statistics that can't easily be got from the data. Okay, so it's all looking reasonably good and now what we really want to do is tackle a problem we set out to look at which is what happens when you apply an electric field to a cell population. And then our question is what aspect of the cell motility is the electric field influencing in order to essentially cause Order to essentially cause this directed motility. So the field that we were working with is 200 millivolts per millimeter in the positive x direction. So just to remind you that for the first hour of the experiment there was no field and then we switched it on, left, right for two hours and then we reversed it the final two hours of the experiment. So this is going to be our characterization of the field. And the question, how does this field impact self ability? And just to remind you, And just to remind you, this is what the model looked like. So, the idea we had really was to try and think about all the different ways in which, in this modelling framework, the applied electric field could influence the cell motility and then evaluate the plausibility of each of those different sort of hypothetical effects. So, here's the kind of list of four. So, the first assumption we made is that potentially what could happen is. Is that potentially what could happen? Is that the electric field could impart, if you like, an additional force on the cell population in the direction of the applied electric field with a strength gamma 1 relative to essentially the baseline velocity. Then the second hypothesized mechanism would be that essentially what the electric field does is it just increases the speed of the cell. So it doesn't essentially matter. So, it doesn't essentially matter what the polarity of the cell is relative to the electric field. It's just essentially the fact that the presence of the electric field causes the cell to increase its speed by a factor gamma t. The next hypothesis was that essentially the change in speed that you see with the cell relates to how aligned its polarity is to that field. So, it's a speed alignment mechanism. So it's a speed alignment mechanism where essentially if the polarity and the electric field are directly aligned then the speed increases by a factor gamma three. If they're totally in the opposite directions then it decreases by gamma three and you've got the whole spectrum in between depending on that angle between the field and the polarity. Then the last one is slightly different so all of these mechanisms kind of act at the level of directly changing the cell velocity V and the last one And the last one is a polarity bias mechanism that essentially says that the cell wants to try to align its polarity with the electric field. And essentially, the strength of that effect is quantified by the parameter gamma4. So that sits in the polarity equation rather than at the level of the velocity. And so for the top three of those, you can kind of visualize what this means in terms of the What this means in terms of the velocity distribution just by sort of sketching that the velocity profile, if you like, or the velocity distribution at steady state. So, under the autonomous model, essentially what you can see is that a cell wants to sit with a speed v and that its polarity is kind of unbiased, so it will basically move in any direction on zero to pi. Pi. And if you look at what happens under the influence of these electrotactic mechanisms, you can see that this additional force essentially shifts that distribution to the right by a distance gamma 1v. You can see that the impact of this speed increase parameter is just to increase the radius of the distribution, if you like, where all the masses by a factor gamma 2. And you can see that essentially the parameter gamma 3 shifts the distribution so that it's nowhere on the The distribution so it's no longer symmetric on 0 to tπ, but there's essentially extra mass in the direction of the field. Okay. So then you kind of get to thinking about how to calibrate the model to data. So it's not quite as simple as it was in many respects because it's now a seven-dimensional parameter space that you're kind of interested in fitting. So you've got the three original parameters of the model and these extra. Of the model and these extra four parameters, potentially. So, the idea here really is that we've got these four different potential electrotactic effects, and what we want to do is to see which combination of those effects can best essentially give rise to the or best replicate the data that we have from the experiments. So, we're potentially looking at a seven-dimensional parameter space. We're going to do parameter inference again using this Bayesian approach. To inference again using this Bayesian approach and again using the synthetic Bayes approach. And just to kind of confirm, we're looking for the posterior distribution of model climatis theta and we're going to include both the data that was the control data without the electric field and the data with the electric field in there. But importantly, we're going to keep back a portion of that data. So the data that has or the assays that had the electric Than the assays that have the electric field applied, what we're going to do is just look at the first three hours of those movies in order to calibrate the model to the data. So, this is kind of the first hour with no field and the next two hours with the field from left to right. And then we're going to save the portion of the movie where the field direction is switched to test essentially the predictive capability of the model. Okay. So, and then again, just to remind you, those are what they're Again, just to remind you, those are what the sort of data look like. Okay, so in terms of now the kind of model space, if you like, we've got a collection of 16 different possible models. So this is all combinations of these different potential electrotactic effects, 1, 2, 3, and 4. And then we're going to evaluate their plausibility in terms of this objective function j, which is the log of essentially the probability under model x. The probability under one x of seeing the data both without the field and with the field. And so, what you want to do is you want to go away and evaluate this objective function for each one of those 16 different possible models and find that essentially or establish which one of those is the most plausible by comparing essentially the value of the objective function. And the really interesting thing that came out of it was that it was actually electrotactic effect number four on its own that was. Effect number four on its own that gave rise to essentially most probable in terms of giving rise to the data, if you like. What does that mean? It means that there's pretty strong support for a hypothesis that essentially this observed bias we're seeing in cell motility is coming solely through the fact that cells want to preferentially polarise in the direction of the field and that we don't really see strong support for any of the other any of the other hypothesized mechanisms. Hypothesized mechanisms. So, in other words, we'd be sort of the model we'd write down as being consistent or most consistent with our data is a model purely where the influence of the field comes in through this additional term with gamma4 in the clarity queue. So, I can show you in exactly the same way as I showed you before what the posterior distribution looks like in that context. And again, you can see that we can get a really, pretty good handle on each of the Each of the parameters, I would call all of those parameters identifiable by looking at their marginal posterior distributions. You can see again by looking down at the bottom that we're actually taking a very wide prior distribution and most of the mass is focused on an incredibly small region really of that prior distribution. And you can see kind of the posteriors in a bit more, the bilateral posteriors in a bit more detail at the top. But as everyone, we should go back and But as ever, we should go back and we should do a posterior predictive check and check essentially that the predictions of the model calibrated to these data are sensible. And so, again, what I'm showing you here in blue is the distribution of model outputs when sampling from those posterior distributions and then the black the data you see. And I think it looks reasonably good. And then what you can also do is you can also compare essentially the trajectories that you see in the experiment. That you see in the experiment. So, this is without the electric field, and this is with the electric field with those that would come out of essentially sampling from the posterior distribution of the model. And again, I think things are looking reasonably good at this point. So, then the next test of the model is to go away and is to kind of look at that portion of the data that we didn't yet consider. So, the final two hours of that electrotaxis experiment where Electrotaxis experiments, where the direction of the electric field was switched, and see to what extent our model can essentially recapitulate the observations made within those experiments. Okay, and so here's a kind of quick summary of the results. So at first glance, I think in terms of comparisons between the model predictions and the data in terms of the summary statistic, I think we're doing a reasonably good job. I think most of the observations Of the observations fall within the kind of main mass, if you like, of this predicted these predicted distributions, which is good. And then you can also compare what you see in terms of the observed trajectories of cells in those final two hours of that experiment. Again, all sort of translated start at the origin with what you would see in the data. And I don't think it's bad, but there is, you know, and I think we're doing a recent book. There is, you know, and I think we're doing a reasonably good job, but there is probably something we need to dig into here because I don't think that we've got quite as faithful a match between the observed trajectories and the predicted trajectories as you might hope. So I think we're doing pretty well, but it's not perfect. And probably to kind of give you a couple of reasons as to why that potentially is, number one, I think it could be because we're using essentially the summary statistics of the data to sort of calibrate. To sort of calibrate the models to the data, and I think there's quite possibly something that we're losing in terms of the very detailed sort of reorientation process in the process of using those summary statistics. And that's possibly one reason why we're not quite capturing the kind of shape of the trajectories as we might quite hope to. But the other reason is quite possibly that you could see from those movies that the cells are essentially at relatively low density. Essentially, at relatively low density, but they're definitely essentially contacting each other. And it's quite possible as the field direction is reversed, that those collisions between cells are actually kind of essentially influencing their motility more than they might otherwise be. So, there's a couple of reasons that we can, you know, that essentially plausibly explain the differences between the observed and the predicted trajectories, and I guess we need to go away and dig into this a bit more going forward. So, I'm pretty much there. So I'm pretty much there, but so just wanted to summarize now and say that essentially that by combining what's a relatively simple model with data, we can predict that the bias we see in cell motility as a result of this applied electric field is really coming through cells preferentially wanting to polarise in the direction of the field. What I really like about this framework is it's really easy to apply to other experimental scenarios and to cell type, different cell types. Scenarios and to cell type, different cell types. So, one thing I'd love to do is to get a suite of experiments where we looked at essentially the same experiment, but just over a range of different field strengths and tried to understand how those gamma parameters essentially depend on the strength of the field and whether there are different kind of different ones of the different electrotaxis effects come in at different field strengths. So, that's one thing I'd love to do, and I'd also love to see sort of, or I'd love to apply this framework to different cell types. Apply this framework to different cell types. So it's well known that you can take some cell types and they migrate in one direction in the field, and some cell types migrate in a totally different direction. And it'll be great to understand kind of what the similarities and differences are mechanistically in terms of that motivity. And then for the future, we're kind of gearing up at the moment in terms of extending the model to populations of cells, so really being able to think about designing the collectives and what happens in terms of the cell biomechanics and the cell polarity. And cell polarity as you turn on an electric field. And we want to eventually essentially use our model to develop an optimal stimulation protocol. So the idea is that if you wanted to steer a population or some single cells from A to B along a particular trajectory, we'd be able to use the model to predict what the stimulation protocol would need to be to achieve that. And then something that sort of hid under the hood really was that to be able to apply synthetic That to be able to apply synthetic base in this context, we know quite a lot of data and quite a large parameter space at the end. We needed to sort of develop an approach that we kind of call sequential Monte Carlo synthetic likelihoods. And the idea is that we need a sequence of intermediate, if you like, sort of posterior distributions where we, at each intermediate distribution, we target some distribution. So we evolve the temperature from zero to one. So we essentially gradually. 081, so we're essentially gradually moving from the prior distribution to the posterior distribution. And I think that was particularly important because our prior distribution was so huge, we really needed to do that. And we can use the effective sample size to adaptively essentially increment that temperature from one generation to the next. So, to summarise for some amount of time, more or less, just wanted to thank people really. So, this work was really all done by Tom Prescott when he was a postdoctoral. Done by Tom Prescott when he was a postdoctor in my group, and he's since just moved to the Turing Institute and was done in collaboration with Shaw's group at EUC Davis. And in particular, CANSU did all the experiments. So thanks for listening, and I'm happy to take any questions. So are our questions from the online participants? Nice talk, thank you. Does quantity of the cells change when you apply the electric field? I mean, would that be consistent with what you find in the model, that they're more polarized? Um yeah, so essentially I guess if you look at um Guess if you look at so so, yes, so essentially they're very quick to change their reorientation. Like when you change the electric field, you can see them reorient very, very quickly. So I think that certainly they adapt in response to the field relatively quickly. They certainly like turn a bit of a corner, but are they more or less polarised? Yeah, I guess they're going to. Yeah, I I guess they're going to they're going to maintain that polarity much more strongly, I think. So yeah. Okay. Thank you. I had a question. So you said you need quite a bit of data to do this. How much data do you need? So we had, I think we tracked, I think it was like 27 or 28 cells from each of the experiments. So we had that many tracks times four. So actually I guess we didn't have So, actually, I guess we didn't have a huge amount in terms of individual cell tracks, but they were every five minutes over five hours. So, that's a lot of fun the actual data space. Okay, any other online questions? Let's go to the in-person questions. All right, thanks for this nice talk. I have, I guess, two questions. I guess two questions. One is a methods question, one is more of a math question. The methods question, or the math question, or the experimental question rather, is, so if I recall, Terrio and McGilner looked at this a number of years ago and they found that membrane molecules actually effectively polarize under an electric field, much like in hemotoxis. And I wonder if this is telling anything different. And then the second question is more related to the methods, which is, so you have an SD. Is so you have an SDE formalism of basically your polarity, your velocity model. And I wonder if there's a way to recast that in a Fokker-Planck type formalism to essentially just solve PE to get the real likelihood. Yeah, good questions. So the first part was about redistribution of some memory components. So no, I guess we don't have any data on the level of kind of what's actually happening in terms of physics. You know, physically to the cell, how redistribution, for example, of membrane components is leading to this directed motion. So, because our data was really at the level of cell tracks, and you can see it, it seems sensible to start with, a model which is essentially didn't go any lower than that, and think about what happens as you sort of move up through the scale. So, we're now sort of going upwards and targeting tissues. But I do think there's, there could be a really, really great project trying to essentially go from To essentially go from models that look at precisely what's happening on the level of the cell and trying to scale it up to kind of something like the model we have now. Because obviously, if you do want to do anything like kind of model predictive control or optimal control, you're going to need quite a simple model to do that with. So, I think the more that we can move between scales kind of by formally cross-grading, the better. That was one question, and the next one was whether we could develop. Whether we could derive the Fokker-Planck equation. We did think about it, and I think we came to the conclusion that wasn't possible except in some simplified circumstances. So we didn't really pursue it any further. But yeah, I mean, certainly the ideal would be to be able to do that. That's definitely a good point. Thanks. Hi, thanks for the great talk. Do you have any idea what is the mechanism What is the mechanism that causes cells to polarize to the field? Are there proteins that become somehow reoriented in the cell or what's doing it? So we don't really know and I think there is some suggestion as a redistribution of various membrane components, but because we didn't there were various theories out there and because we just didn't have data. We just didn't have data at that level. We sort of tried to avoid thinking about it. I think, I certainly think, and we've certainly talked with kind of collaborators about building models at that level. And one thing I'd really love to try and get a handle on is like through models at that level, looking at various properties of the membrane, why some cells move in one direction in a field, and why other cell types move in a completely different direction. And I think that's the kind of Different direction, and I think that's the kind of level of modelling that I'd unlock it. But we haven't really thought about it in huge amounts of detail, to be honest, because our data was not there, which is maybe not the best answer, but certainly that's the real life one, I feel. Thank you. Are there any other questions? I don't think so. Okay, if not, let's thank all the speakers again. If not, let's thank all the speakers again. And I guess it's time for a coffee break. So Kario and the developer actually found that a lot of the human type machinery, basically anything that would be like charged, like all the way out of response to a microcomputer. So that's what I couldn't tell you the specific models, but yeah. Specific molecules, but yeah. Yeah, but they found this is had an eight years ago.
