Yadichi from the University of Western Australia. He's also very well known for his work on finite permutation groups and finite geometries. And he's going to talk about automorphism groups of diagraphs. Thank you, John. Michael, thank you, Michael. Thanks, George. Yeah, I'd like to begin by thanking the organizers for the opportunity to speak. Thanking the organizers for the opportunity to speak. Unfortunately, we're not in Banff today. I'm doing my best to, if you see what happens, to be in Banff. But yes, I don't get to climb up Sulphur Mountain, which is always a good experience, always a good way to get over the jet lag from the trip all the way to Canada. So I want to speak today about two closed groups and automorphism groups of digraphs. And this is joint work with Luke Morgan, who's now at the University of Promoshka in Slovenia. In Slovenia, and Jinjin Zhou, who's in Beijing Jiao Tong. So, what about if I get my thing going? All right, so what do I mean by the K closure of a permutation group? So, this is a concept which was introduced by Helmut Bielard. It is a set of Ohio State University lecture notes from 1969. And the setup is essentially as follows: I have a set omega, I have a set Omega. I have a subgroup G of sim omega, so that's acting on omega. Now, not only does G act on omega, but for every integer k at least one, we also have that g acts on the set omega k. So on all the set of k tuples with elements coming from omega. And this is just a natural action. The element g is just acting coordinate-wise. So I take some k tuple omega 1, omega 2 up to omega k to act upon it by g, well, I just find the image of omega 1 under g, omega 2. Image of omega 1 under g, omega 2 under g, and so on. And I get myself another k tuple, and this gives me an action of g on a set of k tuples. Now, I can then look at the orbits that group has in this action, and the k closure of g is the largest subgroup of the symmetric group on omega, which has the same set of orbits on omega k that g does. And we denote it by this g to be. To be superscript k with brackets around it, okay. So you should not confuse this with the k-derived subgroup, it's uh unrelated. Okay, so this is the k closure of the permutation group, right? So I look at my group G, I act on k tuples, that's got a set of orbits, okay. I then take the largest subgroup of sim omega, which has the same set of orbits on k tuples. I suppose that's the stabilizer in so sim omega of the set of all the g orbits on k-tuples. On k touch. Now, I suppose k if k equals one, I'm just taking the largest subgroup of sum omega, which has the same set of orbits on omega as g. And so this is then just, if I have a finite number of orbits on omega, so that's called omega 1, omega 2 up to omega t, then the one enclosure is just the direct product of the symmetric groups on Hitchhiker sets. Okay, so because this here is a subgroup of sigma omega, it has the same orbits. Of sim omega, it has the same orbits on omega that g does. It's the largest group which has the same orbits as g on omega, so that's the one closure. Okay, so for one closure, it looks like that. What about the two closure? Well, now I can look at the orbits of G on ordered pairs. These have a special name. They're called the orbitals of your group G. Now, for each of these orbitals, these are ordered pairs, I can construct what's called the orbital digraph of my group G. Okay, and these are the digraphs. Okay, and these are digraphs with vertex set omega and arc set being one of these orbitals. Okay, so for each i from one up to t, I'll get myself some digraph. Okay, so I have a arc between the vertex v w if the pair v w lies in delta i. Now my group G, it's a subgroup of the automorphism group of each of these digraphs. Okay, so each of these diagraphs, I can construct their automorphism group. I can construct their automorphism group. So that's all the permutations of the vertex set which map arcs to arcs. So G clearly maps arcs to arcs because it sends elements of delta I to elements of delta I. And so G is a subgroup of the automorphism group of gamma i. Now, in some sense, ought gamma i, that's the stabilizer of delta i in Sim omega. Okay, but the two closure should be the stabilizer of aught. Be the stabilizer of all the delta i's. Now, ah, before I go on and emphasize that, I was going to talk about when do I get a graph from these. Okay, so my delta i's are ordered pairs, so these are really only arcs. Now, my orbital digraph will actually be a graph, okay, if the delta i's are what are they called self-paired, okay, which means that if I have a pair in delta i, then its reverse arc is also in delta i. Okay, so graphs are essentially just digraphs that whenever you have an arc, you also have the reverse arc. Digress that whenever you have an arc, you also have the reverse arc in there. And then what I wanted to say was that the two closure of your group, that's just the intersection of all the automorphism groups of the orbital diagrams. So aught gamma i is the stabilizer of delta i, but the two closure should be the stabilizer of all the delta i's. So that's the intersection of all the orbital diagrams. So that's the two closure of a group G. Okay, now another thing also. Now, another thing also we can note is that your group is too transitive on omega. Okay, so the group is too transitive if I come up any ordered pair of distinct elements to any other ordered pair of distinct elements. In which case, it's only got two orbits on ordered pairs. It's got the distinct ordered pairs and it has the equal ordered pairs. And so C omega has the same orbitals. And so if I have a two-transitive group, then my two-closure is the full. Then my two closure is the full symmetric group. So that's an example of an easy way of seeing what the two closure of a group is. Now, I can then talk about K-closed permutation groups. So if I start with a group G, I've got this, I suppose, chain of subgroups. I've got the symmetric group C omega. Inside that will contain the one closure G. Inside that, you can show you've got two closure. Inside that, you have the three closure, and you have this chain going down. Going down, at some point, if you have a finite group, you'll eventually get you'll eventually get G. But we have this chain of inclusions of the K closures. And we say that our group is K closed if it's equal to its K closure. So if there's some K for which G is the largest subgroup of sim omega, which has the same orbits on ordered K tuples as G does, then that's G is called K closed. Okay, so that's what a K-closed group is. Now, Closed group is. Now, an easy way of finding two closed groups, okay, so maybe I want to just talk about two closures from now on. Okay, well, if I take a graph or a digraph and I look at the automorphism group of that graph or digraph, now that has to be too closed, because if I have some permutation which maps, which fixes every orbit of alt gamma on ordered pairs, then it will map adjacent vertices. Then it will map adjacent vertices to adjacent vertices, and it will map non-adjacent vertices to non-adjacent vertices. And so it has to have been an automorphism group of the graph or digraph to begin with. Okay, so one easy way of finding two closed groups is you just construct a graph or a digraph and you take the automorphism group of that graph or digraph, and that will be two closed. So that's a nice natural family. That's a nice natural family, which leads to the obvious question: well, which two closed groups are not the automorphism group of a graph or digraph? So, because remember the two closure, right, if I take a group T, I can construct its two closure. The two closure of a group will always be two closed. And the two closure is the intersection of all the automorphism groups of graphs which are invariant under G. And so sometimes you want to know when is the two closed groups. Want to know when is the two-closed group not the automorphism group of one of those graphs or digraphs? Now, there's one, I suppose, obvious way of constructing these. So, but I want to do a slight diversion to BACE. So, if you're at one of the earlier talks today, I wasn't, that was too early my time. But by Maria Pierre, she looked at bases. But there's this nice lever of Vilant, which says that if K is at least two. K is these two, and I have some k minus one elements in my set. So that the stabilizer, the point-wise stabilizer of these k minus one elements is trivial, then my group G is k closed. So I said bases here because these k minus one points forms a base for my group G. So if g has a base of size k minus one, then it itself is k closed. So essentially, I suppose I suppose a group is, a permutation in a group is uniquely determined by its action on a base. And so it's uniquely determined by what elements of G uniquely determined by what they do on alpha 1, alpha 2 up to alpha, k minus 1. And that enables you to prove that your group is k closed. And so, oh, yes, I had a thing. So, right. So, one thing that this gives us, sorry, is that if the size of our set gives us, sorry, is that if the size of our set is n, then any n minus one points gives you a base, and so your group is n closed. Okay, so any permutation group of degree n is always n closed. And equally, any semi-regular permutation group is going to be too closed. So a semi-regular permutation group is just a group for which the stabilizer of any point is trivial. So therefore, any point is a base. We only need to have one base of size one, but for semi-regular groups, any Semi-regular groups, any set of size one is a base. Okay, so I've got a base of size one, and so therefore my group is two-closed. And so that's semi-regular. Now, since this is meant to be a conference, not just with finite permutation groups, but also many infinite group people, I may probably would use the word packs freely for that instead of semi-regular. Okay, so one obvious way of finding two closed groups is to take semi-regular pigmentation groups. Now, Well, usually we want to just consider transitive permutation groups. So if I have a transitive semi-regular permutation group, that's what's referred to as a regular group. Now, regular groups. If you think about regular groups acting on graphs, then you should think about Cayley graphs or digraphs. So let's take a gamma. It's going to be a Cayley graph or a Cayley digraph for some group G. Then your group G acts regularly on itself by right multiplication as a group of automorphisms of your Kaylee digraph. K V diagraph. Now, there is much study of GRRs and DRRs. So if I have a Kayleigh graph for a group G, G is a group of automorphisms for the Kaligraph. Sometimes there are many more automorphisms, and sometimes there are no more automorphisms. G is all you have. And if G is all you have, then in the case of a graph, your Calendly graph is called a GRR, standing for a graphical regular representation of your group. Regular representation of your group. And if you have a digraph, then it's a DRR or a diagraphical regular representation for your group. Okay, so GRRs and DRRs, these are just regular groups. Okay, well, they're group. So GRRs and DRRs, these are Cayley graphs for a group for which the only automorphisms of that graph are the original group itself that you constructed the graph or digraph from. Now, regular groups. Now, regular groups in these cases, G is a regular group, so G itself is two-closed. And it's a two-closed group, which is also regular, but it's also regular because it's the automorphism group of a graph or diagraph. Now, there was much work in the 70s and 80s. There was a conjecture by Mark Watkins, which was eventually proved. And so, they wanted to know which groups you can construct a GRR for. And the only groups without a GRR are the following in this list. Are the following in this list? So I can take an abelian group with exponent greater than two, generalized acyclic groups, a small list of some small groups there, and four others which I haven't listed because I don't want to write down presentations. They're a little bit messy, but they're smaller, they're small finite groups. So for any other group, if I take the group acting regularly on itself, I can always find a graph for which it's a GRR for that group. For that group. So those regular groups can sometimes be the full automorphism group of a graph or digraph. But these regular groups in this list here, these are never a full automorphism group of a graph. And so these are two closed groups that are not the automorphism group of some graph. Because they're regular, they're too closed, but they don't have the GRR, so they're not the automorphism group of a graph. They're contained in the automorphism group of the graph, but they're not the full automorphism group of the graph. Full automorphism group on the graph. All right, it's GRRs, so that's the graphs. The DRRs, Babai equally showed that there was only five groups which do not have a diagraphical regular representation. Okay, and so again, then these are the two closed groups, okay, because these are regular groups acting on themselves, they act regularly, okay, but you can't find a graph for which they have your automorphism group. Which they have the automorphism group of the digraph. Okay, so the GRR problem, which attracted a lot of attention, was essentially finding which regular two closed groups can be or cannot be the full automorphism group of a graph or digraph. Which then leads us to the natural question: are there any two closed groups that are not regular and which are not the automorphism group of the graph or digraph? Of the graph or digraph. So the GRR problem that gives me two closed groups which are regular and are not the automorphism group of the graph or digraph. I want to know are there any non-regular permutation groups that are not the automorphism group of a graph or digraph and which are two closed? And I suppose, I know I did a lot of work on two closed groups and you give the definition of two closed group. You say that automorphism groups of graphs and digraphs are examples. Graphs and digraphs are examples. Usually, I'll give C2 squared as an example of a two-closed group, which is not the automorphism group of a digraph or a graph. And then I'll stop at that point and then move on to discuss whatever I wanted to do about two-closed groups. But we didn't seem to know any, well, in the literature, there's no examples of such groups for this question, right? There was no known two-closed groups that are not regular and not the automorphism group of the graph. And not the automorphism group of the graph or diagram. Well, so that's the question I want to look at today. So, what we could do is we could look at small rank. Okay, so the rank of a permutation group is just the number of orbits that it has on ordered pairs. Okay, so this is the number of orbitals that it has. And by a standard construction, this is also just the number of orbits that a point stabilizer has on the original set. Okay, so for each orbit on the point stabilizer, So, for each orbit on the point stabilizing G omega on omega, you can construct some orbit on ordered pairs, and you get a one-to-one correspondence between the two. So that's small rank. Now, if I look at the rank of a group G, okay, we might as well assume that it's transitive to begin with. Now, since it has rank, it always must have rank at least two, okay, because this set delta naught, often called a diagonal. Delta naught, often called a diagonal orbital. Okay, so I take all the equal orbited pairs, that's always g-invariant. As long as my set has size at least two, there's going to be other ordered pairs in omega squared. And so g can never be transitive on omega squared. So I'm always going to have at least two orbits. Okay, I'm always going to have at least two orbitals, right? At least two orbits on orbit pairs. So this is my, you always have this as a union of orbits. So it always has rank at least two. And it'll have rank two. Okay, and it'll have rank two precisely when there's only two orbits on ordered pairs. So this will be one orbit, and the other orbit will be all the ordered pairs of distinct elements. And so they're my two orbits, which means that my group is two transit. Okay, so my rank two groups are just the two transit groups. Well, the only two closed group of rank two on end points is just the full symmetric group. Is just the full symmetric group, okay? Because remember, I said that if I had a two-transitive group, its two-closure is the full symmetric group. So the only two-closed one is the full symmetric group. And Sn, we know, is the automorphism group of a complete graph on n vertices, right? So that's the graph which has n vertices, and every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex. So therefore, every two-closed rank two group is the automorphism group of some graph. Group of some graph. So we're not going to find examples for rank two. Well, let's keep moving up through the ranks. Okay, next one is rank three. Okay, I've now got three orbits on ordered pairs. Let's suppose my group is too close. I'm going to have three orbitals, delta zero, which is that standard one, which is the constant pairs, delta one and delta two. Now, if I look at gamma one, the graph or the diameter. Gamma one, the graph or the digraph gamma one, which comes with arcs coming from delta one, then the automorphism group of gamma one needs to fix a set of arcs of gamma one, so it fixes delta one set wise. It's going to fix delta naught because they're like the constant pairs, and it also has to fix the set of non-arcs set wise. So that's also going to fix delta two. So my automorphism group of gamma one has to have the same. One has to have the same orbitals as g does. Oort of gamma one is still going to fix delta one, it's going to fix delta two, and it'll fix delta naught. So it's got the same orbitals as g. But g is meant to be two closed, which means g is all of the automorphism group of gamma one. So if I have a two-closed Planck-free group, it is the automorphism group of one of its orbital graphs or orbital diagraphs. So again, we're not going to find any example. Again, we're not going to find any examples of rank three groups. Any rank three two-closed group is the automorphism group of some graph or digraph. Whether or not it's a graph or a digraph just depends on whether or not delta one or delta two is a self-pet. So that's what happens for rank three. Okay, so for rank two and for rank three, every two closed group is the automorphism group of the graph or diagram. Well, let's go to rank. Well, let's go to rank four. And with Luke and Jinjin, we're actually able to show there were examples. Okay, so if I take a finite, two-closed, primitive permutation group of rank four, that is not the automorphism group of a graph or digraph, then there are two infinite families of such groups. I get seven groups of some relatively small degrees, or my Degrees, or my group G is a subgroup of A gamma L1 P to the D. Okay, so these are the semi-linear, the affine semilinear transformations of a one-dimensional vector space of a GFP to the D. Okay, so these are sort of like, I don't know, we usually think of these as a smallish soluble groups. Now, we do have one infinite family of two closed groups of rank four, which are not. Two closed groups of rank four, which are not the automorphism group of the graph or digraph, which lies in this case. We also have a few other little small groups of a small degree, which lie in this case, but we're still, I suppose, finalizing the detail to say that we have all of them at that point. Okay, so really, we like this, I suppose, to change to say three infinite families here and increase this finite list. I think it comes to about 11, I think. But at this stage, we haven't completely finished our arguments for enumerating all the possibilities here. Okay, so as far as we're aware, these are the first known two closed groups, which are not regular and which are not the automorphism group of the graph or digraph. Okay, so I want to say a little bit about what the What are these two infinite families are, and also how we go about trying to prove such a theorem. So, our first infinite family is, oh, before I do that, I have to have another example. Sorry, before I launch into my infinite family. So, we should remember what a Hamming graph is. Okay, so a Hamming graph H to M is going to be a graph with vertex set delta squared for some set delta of size n. For some set delta of size n. Okay, so the vertices are the ordered pairs, and two vertices are adjacent if they differ in precisely one coordinate. Okay, so they will be equal in one coordinate and they differ in a second coordinate. So I suppose we could define these graphs for k-tuples, but we just want to define them for ordered pairs. And the automorphism group of a Hamming graph is just Sn reef S2. Uh, SN reef s2. So I can, on my ordered pairs, I can do SN independently on each of the ordered pairs, or I can flip the two elements in my ordered pair around. And that's the automorphism group for them. Okay, so they're my Hamming graphs. Now they're a well-known family of graphs. And we have this nice level which turns out to be very useful. If I take a subgroup of my general linear group on a vector space V, and let's Vector space V and let's suppose that it preserves a decomposition of V into two subspaces of the same dimension. And if I take all the vectors which are in B1 or in V2 other than zero, and let's suppose that this set of vectors is an orbit of G0. But if I take the affine permutation group, which is essentially just I take all the translations in V extended by In V extended by the linear maps coming from my nice subgroup G0. This gives me a group acting on B. And if I take the orbital graph coming from this orbit of G0, so this is an orbit of the point stabilizer in this group. Orbits of point stabilizers, remember, give me orbitals. And if I take the orbital graph coming from such an orbital, I get my Hamming graph back. So this is one way that you can recognize Hamming graphs from orbital digraphs. Orbital diagraphs. And I suppose the easy way to see this: well, because my vector space can be written as this decomposition, really I can just identify the elements of V with ordered pairs V1, V2, where V1's in V1 and V2 is in V2. And these two sets, V1 and V2, they have the same size. You might as well think of them as being the same set. So you could identify V1 with delta. That's a set of size of V1. Of size v size of v1. Then if I look at what are the neighbors of the zero vector, well, the neighbors of zero vector are coming from this set B. That's what the orbital graph does. And so, well, the elements in D1, they're the vectors of this form, which are D1, 0. So they're differing from the 0 vector in one coordinate. And the elements of V2, they're differing, they're of a form 0, V2. So the neighbors of 0, the 0 vector are indeed. The zero vector are indeed those which differ in precisely one coordinate, so those which are non-zero in precisely one coordinate. And so we do actually get a Hamming graph. So these Hamming graphs often you can appear as things. So I want to use this lemma a lot because I'm going to construct a group. I'll show that it preserves the decomposition of my vector space. And then I'll claim that one of the orbital graphs is a Haming graph. Okay, so now I can give you my infinite families. So my first family. So my first family, I take a vector space V, I'm going to write it as a tensor product of two vector spaces over GF3. First will have dimension 2 and the second will have dimension m. m can be any integer at least 2. Inside x, I could write x as the decomposition x1 plus x2. d8 is then the stabilizer in gl2,3 of this decomposition. And then I can take a central product of d8. Then I can take a central product of D8 with GLM3. So the D8 is acting on X, the GLN3 is acting on Y, this central product then acts on all of B. And then I take my affine group, which is all trans constructed by V. So I take all translations in V plus my general linear part. So that's going to be my group G. Well, since D8 preserves this decomposition of X, Decomposition of X, G naught, so this group D8 circle GI3 preserves this decomposition of V, where I take X1 tensive with Y and X2 tensored with Y. So G is preserving such a decomposition. At the same time, it also preserves a different decomposition. So I can have, it also preserves the decomposition W1 plus W2. And W1 is given by this tensor product, and W2 is given by. Tensor product and W2 is given by this tensor product. And well, since X is a two-dimensional vector space over GO3, it only has four one-dimensional subspaces. It has X1, the space span by X1, the space spanned by X2, the space spanned by their sum, and the space band by their difference. Now, if I look now at the orbits of G0 on vectors, I get the zero vector, I get the non-zero vectors in B. The non-zero vectors in B1 or B2. I also get the non-zero vectors in W1 or W2. Okay, because remember, acting on X, we're only inducing a D8, so we're just interchanging X1 and X2. So also I can fix this subspace or map it to this one. These two sets here are all the simple tensors, and then I'll get all the non-simple tensors, and those also turn out to form a G0 point. And so then for each of these. And so then for each of these four orbits of G0, I can construct the corresponding graph. They all turn out to be graphs. And in the first two cases, well, by a lemma, they're Hamming graphs. And so the automorphism group of a Hamming graph is much bigger than my original group G. And this set of non-simple tensors, well, that's preserved by the set, by the full stabilizer of this tense product decomposition. Up this tense product decomposition, which is the central product of GO23 with GLN2, and so that will also be in the automorphism group of my graph for gamma3. And sorry, B1 should have been this set and B2 should have been that set. And this is everything in V other than in these three sets. And so gamma one is the graph coming from this set, gamma two is the graph coming from that set, gamma three is the graph coming from this set. And so Set and so the graph coming from this set will be preserved by all of the translations in D and everything in here which is bigger than G. So G itself is not the automorphism group of any of its digraphs or any of its graphs, okay, because they always grow. And you can show that G itself is too closed, so we get one example. So that was one nice family. Our second family Our second family, again, we use a nice tensor product decomposition structure. Now we take over a field of size four. I still take x is two-dimensional, y is m-dimensional. I still decompose x into a sum of two one-dimensional spaces. Now the stabilizer in this vector space instead of being d8, it's c3 reef s2. So I can have this is a one-dimensional space over g of 4. Dimensional space over GF4. So I've got scalars of, I've got three non-zero scalars here, I've got three here. That gives me C3 cross C3 acting independently and an S2 switching them. So that's the stabilizer about decomposition. I then take G0 to be the central product of my group here on X, G L M4 on Y, and I take a diagonal, I take an automorphism, a field automorphism, so I get some semi-linear transformation. So, I get some semi-linear transformation across the two spaces acting the same. Again, my group G preserves the decomposition into V1, semi-sorry, V1 summed with V2, where V1 and V2 is these, again, these are both M-dimensional vector spaces over GF4. And now the orbits of G0, I get B1, which is B1, which is, I suppose, the vectors coming from this decomposition. I get B2, which is all the other simple tensors. Okay, so all the vectors in B1 and B2 are simple tensors. The other simple tensors lie in one of these three sets. And then I get all the non-simple tensors is going to be my other orbit of G0. Okay, so these are my, of course, we also get zero itself as one of the orbits, but these are my. Zero itself is one of the orbits, but these are my three non-trivial orbits. Well, what graphs do they lead to? Well, gamma one again by a lemma. This is a Hammond graph. For the third one here, this is a set of non-simple tensors for this tensor product decomposition. So the stabilizer of that tensor product decomposition is going to preserve this suborbit, and so it will be inside the automorphism group of our graph. Of our graph. What about B2? Well, unlike last time where we had this extra decomposition preserved by the group, we don't have that here. But instead, it turns out that my subspace Y, well, that's also 2m dimensional over G of 2. And I can actually construct V as a tensor product of a two-dimensional space over G of 2 tensored with Y. Okay, and so I. Okay, and so I can think of V as both a being as vector space over G of 4, but also a vector space over G of 2. And if I think of it as a vector space over G of 2, I can also write it as this tensor product decomposition. And then it turns out with this tensor product decomposition, the simple tensors with respect to this tensor decomposition, these are all the elements of my set B2. And so in aught, gamma 2, the And so, in aut gamma2, the stabilizer of that tensor product decomposition is my stabilizer of that tensor product decomposition, which is a larger group than we had before. So that's again, so now my group G is not the automorphism group of any of its orbital graphs, and it's also two closed. So, there are two nice families that we get. Okay, so we have the two infinite families. How do we go about actually trying to prove? How do we go about actually trying to prove that these are all the examples that you can get? Well, how does the setup go? Well, I've got a two-closed group, it's rank four, it's going to be primitive, it has four orbitals, okay, delta naught being the diagonal one, delta one, delta two, delta three. For each of the uh, these non-trivial orbitals, you can construct the graph gamma i, which has arc set delta i for i equals one, two, and three. So I get three different. Two and three. So I get three different orbital graphs or digraphs. And we also assume that n is at least 4095. Okay, for n less than that, all the primitive groups have been classified. They're in the magma database. So we can run through all those primitive groups. We can look to see which ones are ranked four. We can see which ones are two closed. And for each of the two closed ones, we can look to see if they're the full automorphism group of some graph or digraph. And if they are, we add them. So if they're not full automorphism. So, if they're not full automorphism group, we can add them to our list, and that's why I had those small groups to begin with. That's where they arise. Okay, and but we also even approves we like to assume m to be at least 4095 because it makes some of the number theory we have to do a bit easier if we can assume that m is large. So that's our setup. Now, if I take one of these gamma i's and I take this automorphism group, okay, the automorphism group of gamma i, well, let's look at delta one first. So the automorphism group of delta is one. First, so the automorphism group of gamma one fixes delta one, but it must be larger, right? We're going to assume that g is not the full automorphism group of any of its orbital graphs, so all gamma i must be larger, so therefore it must be merging delta two and delta three, okay, which means that all gamma one is going to have three orbitals, so it has rank three. Okay, so the setup is I've got this rank four group, okay, but if I take the stabilizer of any of its orbitals, I get a rank three. Of any of its orbitals, I get a rank three group. Okay, so I'm going to get three different rank three groups, okay? One for each of these orbitals, and inside each of those ranked three groups, I'm going to find my two-closed group gene. Now, the rank four primitive groups are essentially characterized by Kuipers and the 80s. I think this is PhD thesis. So, a primitive rank four group is of one of the types. So, we have affine groups, we have almost simple groups. It's either product. Product action on delta squared, but here delta has size 28, and it's a special group. Or it's in product action on delta cubed, where you take a two-transitive group and refit up. Or we have this one diagonal group example with A5 coming from A5. And these are any ratefall primitive group looks like one of these. So our possibilities for G look like one of these. The last three cases. The last three cases, three, four, and five. So, these ones here can easily be eliminated. We just showed they're either not too closed or they are the automorphism of some graph or diagraph, which leaves us with our fun case and the almost simple case. Now, to eliminate the almost simple case, we use a few different results. Because one thing we should note, right, if I look at back here, if I look at, say, gamma i, or gamma i has gamma i, alt gamma i has delta i as an orbital, but g also has delta i as an orbital. So g and alt gamma i have a common orbital. Now the primitive groups with a common orbital and distinct soccles, they were determined by Liebeck, Prager and Saxon, so we can look at their list. And also at some point we come up with a group where a case where all three orbitals all have the same size, in which case that's called three half transitors. Three half transitors, and so then we can use our classification of the almost simple three-half transitive groups, and that eliminates G being an almost simple group. So we're down to the case where we have an affine rank four group. Each of its automorphism groups are going to be rank three primitive groups. These rank three primitive groups, they could still be affine, but they could be some other Onan-Scott type. But they have a colon orbital. Okay, but they have a common orbital, and we have two cases. Either if I take the automorphism group of each of these graphs, either the sock will is the same as the soccer of g for every i from one up to three, or there's some i for which the soccer of my other group is different. Now, in the first case, where the soccer's all the same, we can show that g's in our one-dimensional semi-linear group case. Um, if there's some i for which they're different, okay, then Okay, then again, using our Liebert-Krager-Saxle result, we can eliminate the full automorphism group being almost simple. And since it has a different soccer, it's got to then be a product type, which then means that our G0 must preserve this subspace decomposition of V. And by our nice lemma, our gamma i is a Hamming graph. Okay, so that tells us what one of the gamma i's is, the one which is distinct. Okay. Distinct. Okay, we then do a lot of comparing. So I've got these alt gamma i's, these are rank three primitive groups. You can show that one of them is affine. The rank three primitive affine groups, they were determined by Liebeck along with all their subdegrees. Okay, so I've got to have a rank four group whose sub such for one of its sub degrees is also the sub-degree of a primitive rank three group. And we do a lot of comparing of the possible sub-degrees that can happen. And then we end up with. happen and then we end up with just our um sorry then we end up with just our two examples in our two infinite families and that's it okay so um because yeah so you get this one and then some of the rank three affine groups they have to you know preserve the tensor product decomposition so that's why we're seeing those examples um other um rank three affine groups are like preserving an extension field structure so that's where we see that sort of thing happen so there's a bit of work that's also why we like Okay, so there's a bit of work. That's also why we like to assume NSD is 4096. It makes comparing a degree user much easier. Okay, so I have a little bit of time left. And so I did had, well, I have two slides with just giving you the small examples so we can tell you what primitive group they are. They usually seem to all just happen due to some numerical coincidences, but for small degrees, there's some small rank three groups which don't lie in rank three affine groups. Don't lie in rank three affine groups, which don't lie in any infinite family. Or if they do lie in an infinite family, it turns out they just numerically for small numbers, they match up nicely with some of the other rank three groups. So often you're still getting Hammingraphs as one of the orbital digraphs new centers that might then move on to a sustainable footprint might go on for a period of time. I mean, this is my one design. So, these are the small examples that we have. Okay, so these are our other small examples that we have. And these are small examples which are not one-dimensional semi-linear. We have a couple of other small one-dimensional semi-linear things where we have some nice numerics. Okay. But we also have one infinite family. Okay. Thank you. That's all I have to say. Thank you very much. All right, sorry, thanks, Michael. Yeah, I gather George has been called into a meeting. So any questions? I've got a question. So with the With the family one examples, I suppose this is a broader question on higher rank as well, but you had everything in GF3 there. If you change that to a Q, can you still get nice groups but with higher rank? As in not being rank three. Well, when there's more orbital graphs you have to check that it's potentially the full automorphism group of. A full automorphism group of. One advantage of doing rank four is there's only three orbital graphs for which it's arc transitive on to check. Any other graph that is geo invariant is just a union of those. As the rank starts growing, then there's more things you need to check to make sure that potentially it's the full automorphism group of one. But can you use a construction like this to say that beyond To say that beyond rank four, it'll be crazy to classify something like that, a result like that? Uh, I'm not sure if it'd be it's probably crazy to classify because beyond rank four, we don't even have classified the primitive ranks. I mean, you have infinite, not that it's crazy to do as a day job, but that it's that you have so many examples you can't control them. Well, it would be nice if we could actually, um, well, I don't know, you mean that there's for large rank, there's going to be too many, too clues. There's going to be too many too closed things groups which are not water. Yeah, or potentially. We haven't really looked at larger rank, but I'd suspect that as the rank grows, we'll probably would have more. Which is kind of my second question, even though you haven't looked at larger rank, though. Could you have any, like, have you got any statistics on the database up to degree 4095? So the groups that Five, so the groups that are too close, but not the automorphism group of the graph, not regular. Um, but uh, no, we to save our search to go through that database and to construct all the digress, we were just pulling out the rank four ones. Cool. Yeah, so we don't have any data for larger rank. Any other questions? Nope, doesn't look like it. Okay, let's thank Michael again. So that was the last talk of Monday.
