I would have liked very much being in Mexico with you, but by that time I have scheduled to participate in this research in PERS program in November. So that is the reason why I'm giving the talk from here instead of being there with you. But I hope there is a next, in the close future, there is another opportunity. Okay, so that's. Okay, so the talk is entitled The New Criteria to Abstract Positivity, and it is about a new criteria based on quantophomology to study if a link is positive or not. It might help us to determine the positivity status of a link or of a note. So this is joint work with Markel, Nagas Manikandan, and Leon Munso from the Humboldt University in Berlin. Okay, so the structure of the talk is this one. I will start with some. One, I will start with some preliminaries first on positivity and then in common ophthalmology. It's going to be really brief, so just the little things that we know to follow, we need to know to follow the talk. Then in section two, I'm going to present our main results about common homology of positive links, and we will discuss how good are these results, if they are really helpful or not. And then in the last section, we will see if it is possible to extend our results to bigger families. Results to bigger families of links. Okay, so let's start with positivity. So, this is the presentation of break groups on n strands given by Emil Artin in 1925. You see here you have the generators from sigma 1 to sigma n minus 1. And as all of you know, the generators, well, sigma i is just, you can think of it as taking the strand in position i, i plus 1, and you. position i, i plus one, and you cross the strand position i plus one in front of stranding position i. So this is sigma i as in this picture. Here you have sigma i minus one and then you have this relation. So the first one is telling us just that if two generators are far away, they commute. And the second one is a kind of radio maester three move. So it's called the break relation and it's just that you can push this crossing here under this part so it appears here. So this all of Appears here. So this, all of you know this. So this is the RT impresation for the breakgroup on n-strand. So if we have a word on positive, which can be written just with letters using positive exponent, we say that this is a positive word and a break which can be represented by a positive word on arting generators. It's called an artin-positive break. So for the moment, that is what we have, this presentation, but there is also other presentations. Presentation, but there is also other presentation of the breakgroup on N-strands, which also have Garcia structure. And this presentation here, given by Virman Kohan Li in 1998, they proved that this, as I say, that this presentation has also a Garzai structure. You have the Garcia element and everything. So the generators you have here are this one, sigma R S, and you can think of them just you take strand in position R, strand in position S. Position R, strand in position S, and you cross them in front of the other strands. If you have sigma R S, S goes in front of R, and if you have the inverse, then R goes in front of S, as in the picture. Okay? So the relations here are these ones. The first one is telling you that if two crossings are nested, then they commute. One can slice under the other. And if they are far away, they also commute, as expected. And the second relation is this one. And the second relation is this one. It's just telling that, well, you can, if you have this, then you can slice this crossing, you can slice it to the top so it appears here and this one becomes a small crossing here. So yeah, this is the presentation. This is what the geometric meaning of the relations. So the same as before, if we have a word written with letters with just positive exponents, we say that this word is BKL positive. Is BKL positive, and if the braid, if you have a break which can be represented by a positive word in BKL generators, then we say that this braid is a BKL positive break. So I'm keeping this BKL when I speak about this presentation. When I speak about Ring generators, then sometimes I will omit RT. Okay, so for the moment, we have RT positive braids, BKL positive braids. So if we take So, if we take an RTM positive break and we close it, we get something like this: a link, and we say that a link is break-positive if it can be represented by a closed RTM-positive break. And the same for BKL-positive breaks. You can close them, and what you get is a strongly quasi-positive link. And these links were introduced by Lily Rudolph in 1998 as the boundary of certain surfaces he was working with. But yeah, they can be seen just in terms of this. They can be seen just in terms of these BKL generators. So it's clear that break-positive links are strongly quasi-positive links because artin-positive braids are BKL-positive braids. And we also have positive diagrams, which are those diagrams where all crossings look like this one, okay? That if you go through the over strand and look down, the under strand goes to the left. So this is a positive diagram. So, this is a positive diagram. We all know this very well. And if you have a link which can be represented by a positive diagram, then we say that this link is positive. And in this scan, positive links will be like that. So, it's trivial that break positive links are positive because you just orient the strand going down and you see that these processings are all positive. Rudolph proved that positive links are strongly positive. Positive links are strongly quasi-positive, but the converse is not true, okay? Because, for example, here you can see that all these crossings are negative, and when you want to make them disappear, it's not always possible. So there are strongly quasi-positive links are not positive. These are strict inclusions in these families. For example, here you have the NOT A20, here you have the NOT SORI52. So, yeah. Now we move to command of. Now we move to cobanophomology. And here I'm going to say just very brief words about that. I'm not going to give the definition. I'm just going to say what we will need to understand the results I'm going to explain you in section two. So Kovanov homology is a link invariant introduced by Mika Yukovanov in 2000. It is a big graded homology, meaning that you have two gradings. The first grading, high grading, First grading, I grading, it's called homological grading. And it's this green one. And the other one, the J grading, is called quantum rating. Okay, so this is a typical covanoology table. If we want to know, for example, cobanohology of the trephoid link, we get something like this. How do you read this table? You say homological, sorry, covanof homology in homological grading zero and quantum grading three of the trefoil is Z. Trefoil is Z, and the same here. This Z2 is has homological rating three, quantum grading seven. Okay, so this is how you read a quantum homology table for a link. And quantum homology categorifies Jones polynomial. What does this mean? This means that from covanohommology table, you can obtain Jones polynomial of a link. Okay, so the only thing you have to do is to take Euler characteristic. What does this mean? Okay, so we forget about torsion part. We forget about the torsion part, sorry. And then we just use the formula for the Euler-Herr statistic. You just say this Z is minus one to the zero power, meaning positive sign, times Q to the first power. So we get this Q. For example, this Z here is giving minus one to the third power, meaning negative sign. And here we have Q to the minth power, giving us this minus Q to the minth power. Okay? So the definition of covalent hospitology. So, the definition of coban homology is conceptually quite simple, but computing it is MP hard. So, it's very combinatorial, the definition, but when it comes to computation, things are exponential. And the reason is that the generators of the homology are based on Kaufmann states, meaning that for each crossing, you have two ways of smoothing that crossing. So, you have two to the number of crossings power of state. Crossings power of states, and then you have to put a label on them and consider all possibilities, and these are going to be the generators of your complex. So, the thing I want you to get is just that, well, conceptually, it's very simple, but when it comes to computation, it's empty-hard. Okay, so these were preliminaries. And now I move to the section where I will present the results that we got for positive links. So, I will start with something that. So, I will start with something that is very well known with Safer algorithm. So, we have a diagram. Imagine we have this diagram of not 165 in ROM 7's table. Now, we are going to consider safer smoothing, meaning that each time we have a crossing, we are smooth it in the only way-preserving orientation, as shown in the picture. So, if you do this, what you will get is a set of topological circles in the plane, maybe nested, maybe not, and some cord. And some cords in the places where there was a crossing, something like this. Okay? So this is the safer smoothing of the diagram. And now we are going to consider a safer graph. And to do that, the only thing you have to do is to collapse its circle to a vertex. So we draw a vertex for each circle. And now we connect two vertices with an edge. If there are, I mean, for each port connecting two circles in the cipher smoothing, you draw one edge. In the cipher smoothing, you draw one edge connecting the corresponding vertices in the graph. So, in this case, you see that yellow and green are connected by four cores. So, here you put four edges, okay? And well, if you do this, you get this graph. So, this is the cipher graph associated to this diagram. This graph depends on the diagram you are taking. It's not a linking variant, of course. And the next thing we are going to do is we are going to consider the reduced cipher graph, meaning that whenever you have multiple edges, you just collapse them to get. Colledges, you just collapse them to get one edge. Okay, so if I start with diagram D, when I write G D red, I mean this reduced safer graph that I construct following this method. Okay? And now we need another concept that is going to appear, which is the cyclomatic number of a diagram is just the minimal number of edges that we must delete in this graph to remove all cycles. So in this case, if you remove one edge, So, in this case, if you remove one edge, then you break all cycles. So, the cyclomatic number of this diagram is one. If, for example, you had a graph like this, cyclomatic number is four, because you need to remove four edges to break all cycles. Okay? Okay, so this is the notation we needed. And this is the result, the main result I wanted to present you, which is if we have a positive link, then it's govano formology. Then its govanophomology in homological grading 1 is trivial in all but one cell. This cell is at quantum grading 2 minus the Euler characteristic of the link. And this cell, we know what is its value. Its value is Z to the P1 power, I mean P1 copies of Z in this cell. And you can say, okay, but here you wrote L, and here you are expressing. L. And here you are explaining what is P1 for a diagram. Well, it turns out that if you have a positive link, then you can take any positive diagram of this link, and this number is going to be an invariant of positive links, okay, for positive diagrams. Okay, so this is our main result. Well, this is what we got, the first thing, and I'm going to show you now a sketch of the proof. You now a sketch of the proof because, in the proof, we got some results that I find they are interesting by themselves. And the first one is this one. This one means that this is the first step of the proof. So, imagine you have a reduced positive diagram D and consider other positive diagram D prime such that its safer graph equals the reduced safer graph of D. Okay? Then both links have the same common of models. Both links have the same common homology at quantum, sorry, at homological grading one, meaning that this column indexed by a one is the same for both links, for the link represented by D and D prime, with some shifting in quantum grading, okay? But we will go back to this shifting later, but the columns are the same, just with this little shifting. So let's see an example. Imagine we have this diagram D, then, okay, we do it safer smoothing, we get. Okay, we do it safer smoothing, we get this, we compute the safer graph, just trust me that you get this, okay? And then you consider the reduced safer graph associated to D, and you get something like that. And now we consider D prime, which is this. Consider its safer smoothing, you get something like that, and you can consider the safer graph associated to the prime, and as you see, it's the same. Okay? So you So you see that both graphs are the same. So I can apply the theorem. And well, if you go to this is really the node 12 non-alternating node 110, this is a link of two components. Well, this is the name of the links represented by these diagrams. But if you go to Node Atalas and you see their command of homology tables, you will see that at first homological grading, both Homological grading, both have are trivial, but one copy of Z. And this copy of Z is in grading in quantum grading seven for the link represented by D and two for the link represented by D prime. So as you see, you have the same result just with one shifting in the height, meaning in the quantum grading. And this shifting is, if you see here, you see that in order to go from this graph to this. But in order to go from this graph to this one, you just have to delete five edges. So, this five is giving you the number of edges you remove is the number telling you what is the shifting that you have to do. Okay, so I think that this result is interesting by itself. And well, the second ingredient of our proof is proving that this diagram, D prime, can be obtained in such a way that it is alternating and the signature of And the signature of this link of the link L' equals the cyclomatic number of L. And well, to do this, we use a result by Pavel Tracic saying how the signature is modified when you have an alternating diagram and you smooth a crossing following a safer smoothing. So, yeah, we use this in order to prove number two. And now, this was the result we wanted to prove. Result we wanted to prove, okay? So we start with coval from the first covanophomology, meaning the first column, the sorry, not the first column, the column index by one of this link, which is positive. Now using theorem one, we get that, well, we can substitute L by this L prime represented by this link. And using two, we know that this L prime can be taken so that it is alternating. So now using our result. So now, using a result by Li, we know that since the link is alternating, it's non-trivial, I mean, the link is homologically thin, meaning that all non-trivial covano homology of the link is supported in two adjacent diagonals. And these diagonals are around the signature. But since we know that the signature is P1, we know that these are the only two groups that may be known. Groups that may be non-trivial in the common homology of this link. And now we just to prove this, we get some, I mean, we base this, to get this, we base on some previous results by Shiitiski and Sabanovic and some joint work with Chitiski, but these were about semi-adequate links, so we adapt this to our case. And then the third ingredient was just using a scale. third ingredient was just using a scale in sequence to prove that this is zero and this is how we got the proof of the result okay so this was one result i wanted to mention okay and then uh we also got this result the first theorem allows us to prove this second theorem saying that if we have a positive link then l is fiber if and only if If and only if its first covano homology vanishes, meaning that there are no non-trivial groups if you go to the column index by i equals one. Okay, so this okay to prove this, well, we just have to take into account that this g prime from this theorem can be chosen such that it represents the unnaught. So since the Not so, since the common homology of the L node in homological gradient one is trivial, we just use that and we get the result, okay? But now, uh, okay, so the situation, this could be read as a theorem to detect positivity, not just fiber net, but positivity. Why? Because the situation is that for the moment, the algorithms that are known to detect positivity doesn't work very well always, but the ones used to But the ones used to detect fivernes are quite good, usually. So, this makes that this criteria can be sometimes very useful to detect positivity among links. So, let's see an example. We have this not, which is, well, the labeling is taken from the census node list. This link, this not, sorry, is not fiber. In principle, it was not known if it was positive. Known, it was positive. This was not, it doesn't appear this data in any place. So we just compute its coven of homology table and we got that this first column is trivial. So since the link is not fiber, we got that it cannot be positive because if it were positive, this would contradict our theorem. So this is how our results can be used to detect positivity. Okay, so what is technology? So, what is the context of this result? What other things were known for positive links and covanoffology? So, Stosic proved that for break-positive links, covanophomology in homological grading one was trivial. We prove that if a link is positive on a fiber, then its covanohomology is trivial. So we are proving it for this blue class of links, meaning we are really extending the result of stosic because there are fiber positive links that are not very positive. Positive links that are not gray positive. Okay, so this is really a generalization of this result. In fact, there are infinite families of links which are fiber positive and not gray positive. So yeah, we are generalizing this result. And also, well, this is what we proved, that if we have a positive link, then in the column indexed by one, we have just one non-trivial covano homology groups. This was known before by Covano from the time when he defined his homology, and it's And it's also, I mean, plaguing a bit with semi-adequate conditions. This great part can also be deduced from other works, from previous works. So this is what we know about the common horsemology of positive links. Here, we don't know anything in general. Okay, so we can ask, okay, how good are these results? Are they really useful or not? Okay, so from if we go to the to not atlas and we take. Two node Adelas, and we take the 2977 prime nodes up to 12 browsings, then 246 of them are either positive or negative, and 2731 are neither positive nor negative. Okay, so if we pass our commandophomology results, the table I have just shown you, if you pass this criteria to all those links, all of them are of this one. All of them out of these ones, the 2731 are all obstructed by that condition. Okay, now if we move to the census nodes list, we have some notes here having diagrams with more than 100 crossings. So if we move to that, then we compute common opinion of 672 of them. 334 were positive or negative. And with the other ones, our conditions abstracted. Our conditions obstruct 329 links from being positive or negative. So it is not perfect, but I will say that it's quite good. I mean, this abstraction does quite good job in abstracting possibility of links. Okay. Okay, and now I move to the last section where we try to extend our results. Okay, so this is our result. And here we know what. And here we know what we that this is true, that one of homology in the first column of these links is zero. First column, I mean in the one indexed by one is zero. So now it seems natural to say, okay, and what happens if I go out of this, if I go to strongly quasi-positive links? And well, I'm going to go a bit quick here, but the point is that we have these links are strongly quasi-positive. They are not fiber, sorry, they are fiber, but they are not positive. Sorry, they are fiber, but they are not positive. And for them, if you compute cobanophomology groups in the homological grading one, you have this. So the result cannot be extended to the family of strongly quasi-positive links. Okay, here the result is false, so we cannot extend this to strongly quasi-positive links. And in fact, well, we got this for G from 1 till 200. Our computation suggests that this is true. computation suggests that this is true for any natural G, but we couldn't compute it because of the complexity of computing covanohomology. It took so much time that we couldn't do that in our computers. And the point is that in general, there are no methods to compute covario homology of cables. Okay, so the next question we did was okay, let's think of cables. So I know there have been previous talks about cables, just to fix some notation, we have a diagram. We have a diagram, then we consider a diagram of a PQ cable by taking P parallel copies and n negative twists, where n is given by P times the right of the diagram minus Q. Okay, and this diagram we call it DPQ. Okay, so imagine we have this diagram of the trefoil, which has right three, this is a positive diagram, then D39 will be just compute n, n equals zero. Compute n, n equals zero. So you don't have to do any negative twists. This is d39. And if you want to compute what is d35, okay, take the three copies. And now let's see how many tweets we have to add. Three times three minus five is four. So you add four negative tweets here. Okay, so this is what we mean when we say a KPQ link, a link given by a DPQ diagram constructed that way. And the important thing that I want you to get is that. thing that I want you to get is that if K is positive in general its PQ cable is not positive even if Q is greater than P in general these links are not positive okay so okay this was our previous theorem and we also proved that if we have a positive not and we consider it's PQ cable with Q greater or equal With q greater or equal than p, then the result is also true. Okay, so we can extend this to the family of cables of positive notes provided q is greater than p. These notes are in general, these links are not positive. So this is really extending the result. And this was what we knew about command homology of positive links. Now, if we go to PQ cables of positive links, we get that covalent homology has to be like that. And we can To be like that. And we can also extend the result about fiber positive links. If we consider PQ cables of positive knots when Q is greater or equal P, then the result is also true. This group here is zero if and only if K is fiber. Okay? Okay, so just to finish, let me say a few words about L space not. We, well, what the last sension we wanted to Extension: We wanted to study if our result will be extended to the family of L-space knots, because L-space knots are fiber and they are strongly quasi-positive. So, if we want to draw them in this picture, they will be something like that. Okay, so we know that many L-space nodes are grade positive, but some of them are not. In fact, some of them are not positive and Positive and well, till this, this is what we knew for positive and fiber knots. So, as I was telling you, many L-space knots are positive, but currently the only ones that are not known to be positive are an infinite family of hyperbolic L-space nodes and L-space nodes, which are cables of L-space nodes. L-space nodes. I'm not saying there are not other kinds, I'm saying that up to now, these are the only ones that are in this little part here, meaning that they are L-space nodes, but not positive. So we prove as a corollary of our previous result on covalent homology of cables that if we have an L-space node and this node is a cable of a positive nod, then the node satisfies this condition that we had. That we had before. Okay, so this is not proving for all cables of space nodes, but it's proving the result for space nodes, which are cables of positive nodes. There are some of them that other cables that may be here, and we don't know how to deal with them. And for the other infinite family of hyperbolical space nodes, we have also proved that the covanophomology satisfies this condition. Satisfies this condition. And in order to look for a counter, well, I will tell you, we have this question whether this could be extended, this property of cobanophomology could be extended to the setting of L-space nodes. We have this as a question. And then we prove this result. We prove this also for this other family of hyperbolic L-space nodes. And we say, okay, maybe in order to look for a counterexample, we can take an L-space node, take a cable, and then take a cable of this cable, and then a cable. A cable of this cable and then a cable of this cable of the and taking iterated cables in order to look for a counterexample. So we tried some examples, for example, with the trefoil node it's 2-3 cable and then the 2q cable of the 2-3 cable of the trefoil node and the result holds true. So we decided that this question could be stated as conjecture. And this was the last thing I wanted to. The last thing I wanted to tell you, this conjecture, which at this moment is open, but we think it might be true. So that was all. Thank you. Thank you very much for the great talk. Any questions from the audience or from the Zoom? So maybe since we're A little bit behind on time. Maybe one question. Any question? Oh. Oh, Shelly has a question. Okay. You can just unmute yourself. Sorry, I didn't have a question. I was just trying to figure out how to do the clapping thing. But thank you for the talk. All right. In reaction. So. Okay. All right. So if not, that's. Okay, all right, so if not, let's thank the speaker again. Okay, so the next talk starts just right now, but so let me set up
