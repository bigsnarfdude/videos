Okay, thank you. That's good. That's good. Okay, so now we have Olaja will tell us about Dimitri's Oden again. Okay. Yeah, hi everyone. So thanks for being here. Thanks for inviting me. It's very nice to be in Ban for the first time. To be in Bank for the first time and to be back in Canada. So, since this is a place with lots of snow, I thought I'd choose a picture I took in London a few years ago of one rare day when there was snow as well. So this is Northampton Square, which is where I work, essentially. So my office is sort of here outside the picture. So it also looks nice when it's white. So as Sara just said, I'm going to talk about symmetry resolution. So I have to apologize because, first of all, there's going to be a bit I apologize because, first of all, there's going to be a bit of overlap with what Filiberto and Faye told us last evening. So I wasn't sure where my talk would be placed in this conference and what will come first and after. So there's going to be a bit of repetition of some definitions. So anyway, my perspective is more quantum field theory oriented because that's what I know. So that will be a little bit different. And this talk really is a putting together of main definitions, main results. Main definitions, main results about the field theory side of this, and a little review of some of the things I have done. Actually, although there was a paper related to this that just came out today, it turns out, in general, for the past couple of years, I have actually been working on a lot of things, kind of irrelevance. And so I didn't have a lot of new results on this subject, but when I saw the title of the conference, I thought Entanglement Problem was what fitted best. Probably was what fitted best. So, anyway, I hope there will be something in here that is new and interesting, at least for some of you. So, this first page is just a set of papers, all of which have something to do with symmetry resolution, just to prove I've done something in this area. So, I started working on this problem in 2000, oh, sorry, in 2021, and this was with David Horbert and Caspanic Abres. So, they have started much before me. Have started much before me, and it is from them that I learned about this new area, which is very interesting. And then, after that, I worked with both of them and with many other people on different related problems, always from a perspective of interval quantum field theory. Perhaps if I have to highlight something, and if you're interested in anything I say next, actually, with my collaborator MsIA, we wrote a review last year about this, which is also very much focused on... Which is also very much focused around the area I'm familiar with, so quantum field theory. So, if you want to see an expanded version of this talk, let's say, and a bit more, I think this short review is quite nice. And then, just by chance, completely, there is a paper about also symmetry resolution out of equilibrium that just came up today. So, this is very nice when your collaborators submit while you are at a conference, kind of feel you are being very productive, although you are doing nothing. So, this is something we worked on for quite a while. We worked on it for quite a while. And I just want to say thanks to all the people I've worked on on this with, I've worked with on this subject. So I already mentioned Pasquale and David, with whom I started all these projects. And everybody else in this picture are either former students, current students, or students of other people that came and spent a couple of months at CITI and then we did a project together. So all of these nice people I've been working with over the past few years. Okay, so. Okay, so a lot of talk, quite simple, so introduction, why people are interested in this, so that has a bit of overlap with things like you already heard, how it can be computed, especially in quantum field theory, and then maybe some of my contributions. Especially at the end, I'm going to talk about special kind of states, a special kind of excited states, where a lot can be done. These are a couple of pictures I will explain later, so they are not important for now. So let's start from the beginning. So let's start from the beginning. So as you heard in this conference and have been seeing over the past few years, there seems to have well there has been a lot of interest in the past years, 10 years or so, in entanglement, first of all, that was already kind of an old area, but also the kind of interplay between entanglement measures and symmetry. And actually, this has come somehow recently in two forms. On the one hand, we can ask what happens when a system has an internal symmetry, what happens to the structure. An internal symmetry, what happens to the structure of entanglement? And that is connected to what I'm going to talk about, so symmetry-resolve measures. But then, as Sara and Filiberto and Pasquale and others have demonstrated, there is also an interest in seeing how entanglement and symmetry breaking are connected. And this is what is now called entanglement symmetry. So, yeah, what happens when and how symmetry is broken, what happens to the entanglement. So, I'm going to talk about So, I'm going to talk about symmetry resolution, which is some slightly older problem. And so, people started thinking about symmetry resolve measures or more precisely the relationship between what happens to intendant in systems that have symmetry. People started thinking about this a while ago, kind of before we were even talking about symmetry-resolved measures. So, these are some papers. But I think, to my knowledge at least, that these measures became. Is that these measures became particularly popular after these two papers that came out almost at the same time? So, Goste and Seller was a bit before, I think, in 2018. And in particular, the paper of Gostrey and Seller is most interesting for me because, first of all, it's a paper that presents a quantum theoretical perspective on the problem from the start. And they also introduce the terminology symmetry transformations, I think, in that paper. So, for entropies, positional functions, all the things. Social functions, all the things Wiliberto was mentioning yesterday. However, more or less at the same time, there was another paper by Shavira, Caratha and Sierra, where they were talking about the same story, really, in the context of this XXXP chain. So it was a discrete model. But they actually came to similar conclusions, the same conclusions. And in fact, I always like to quote the abstract of that paper, because the abstract of that paper pretty much describes all the properties that are interesting about Are interesting about symmetry resolve measures, or at least were interesting at that point. And this is a kind of a bridge version of that abstract, which is interesting to read. So what they tell us is that the entanglement in a system that possesses an internal symmetry, characterized by the magnetization or U1 charge, so they are talking like sub Z in here, is distributed among different sectors. Okay, so this is what symmetry resolution kind of does, evaluate the contribution from symmetry sectors. The contribution from symmetry sectors. And then they say, we find surprisingly that the entropy is equally distributed among these magnetization sectors. So this is a property that now is known as equipartition of entanglement. So the fact that each sector, different charges, still contributes more or less the same. I should say this is an approximate property. So it is it's valid in a certain limit. But if you go beyond that limit, there are actually corrections to this, and then there is no longer competition. There is no longer a good partition. And you can actually see that quite clearly if you use methods of quantum field theory, like four factors, which is what I do. And then they tell us also that these contributions from the various sectors, their value is given by the standard ALO violating logarithmic term. So they are looking at a 1D critical system. So they are telling us that this thing still behaves like the standard entropy, still grows like a logarithm of system size with a coefficient. With a coefficient which depends on central charge. So, this is also like the standard entropy. In fact, it's kind of the exact same behavior. But there is also minus or double law correction related to the zero temperature susceptibility. So, this is the language of the XXZ chain, but this is also true in QFT. It just means that there is an additional term in there that is actually related to the conformal dimension of the symmetry field connected to this internal symmetry, that is the symmetry of the symmetry resolution. The symmetry of the symmetry resolution. And for that reason, sorry. For the XXE chain, does it mean, I mean, if you have the reduced density matrix, there is one block which is only one by one, which is called the emptiness formation probability. Right. Does that present already the symmetry result entanglement? So I don't know. I mean, I'm not, I guess so. I mean, if this equipartition, I mean, in the limit in which this equipartition. I think the second partition has been doesn't hold anymore if you look at the large deviations only for I think everyone has looked only at deviations of the number of particles that is of order one. If the number of particles changes by or same order as the as the size of the interval, then I think nothing is no. Yeah, so this is the this is this is truly some very particular limits. I think in in their case it's kind of large magnetization or something like this factor. And that could be the extreme case. Yeah, but yeah, the extreme case it is very well known that we can say a lot of the tests. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we can write it exactly and And exactly at finite temperature, you can say exactly how it depends on the density, and whatever you like, you can use that. On this probably, it's not relevant for this. But I think it's relevant to just the fit stuff. Yeah, so no. That's very little disturbing. No, no, that's okay. No, that's a good question. Okay, no, that's a good question. So, I mean, this is true in a certain limit. So, they, I mean, their final sentence here, they say this result gives a new method to estimate simultaneously central charge and critical exponents, because the central charge is kind of involved in the logarithmic scaling of the leading term, and the critical exponent of the symmetry field is is essentially this susceptibility they talk about. So it's in the double log term that they that they also find. That they also find. So, all of these properties they highlight in here are properties that they found interesting, many people found interesting, and then from these papers onwards, lots of other papers for other models have been written, both discrete models and also continuous models. And all of these things are also found by QFT methods, actually, just by looking at the simplest contribution you can get in QFT. So, I'll get to that. I should say, and this was mentioned yesterday too, that people Mentioned yesterday, too, that people also have become interested in this because there is at least a part of the silicon resolve entanglement that can be measured experimentally. So, let me give some definitions and then I go back to that. So, we have already seen bipartitions many times. So, system, its complement, we have seen the symmetry with the reduced density metrics many times too. Again, I'm talking about pure state, zero temperature, simplest case, the QFT. And for now, this state. And for now, this state, well, it could be the ground state, could be an excited state. I will look at both cases in my talk, but it's pure. And as you know, there are a lot of standard measures of entanglement, which we have seen already in this conference, I think. There is a family of measures which are called Ready entropies, which are labeled by this index, Ready index. And if you take that index to one, you get the better known Four Neumann entropy. Now Yes. Is there a log missing? Oh, there is a log missing. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, thank you. I've given this talk so many times, and I have never noticed. Thank you. Yeah, there's a lot missing that. So this phonomic entropy or entanglement entropy is, I guess, basically speaking, the one that has the clearest interpretation, so it's kind of the quantum version of Shannon entropy and so on. But it turns out that if you use, if you're That if you use, if you are working with field theory, so conformal field theory or interval field theory, turns out that it's often more natural to compute these Reni entropies. And that's because this trace rule to the n has a physical interpretation in field theory that is much more clear than this raw log rule. So if you work uh with field theory, very often you will concentrate on computing this by some method. And then if you can, you will take limit n to one if if if you are able to. If you're able to, it's not always that simple. So, and what is the sort of main methods that people use in quantum field theory? So, these are things that Carby and Calabresse have discussed, that we have discussed in our work, that also Goldstein and Sela talk about, right? Like, a trick, twist fields, those sorts of ideas. So I summarize all of that in that slide. So interpretations, fields and geometry. And that's a kind of crash course through all of this. But Course through all of this, but the idea that was realized long ago, actually already by Callan and Wilcek, is that this trace over to the n, you can think of it as a partition function, a normalized partition function, so it's one at n equals one. And this is a partition function on a certain geometry on a Riemann surface that looks a little bit like this. So it's a Riemann surface consisting of many copies of the complex plane. Copies of the convex plane, n copies, so n sheeted remote surface. Here is one sample with three, and these copies are cyclically connected along a branch cut. So in this case, we have finite branch cuts because we're going to be interested in looking at entanglement of a finite region within an infinite system. So this branch cut, in the end, its length is going to be the length of the subsystem in this picture. So this Riemann surface is exactly the Riemann surface of the A one-oh-n route with two branch points, okay, if you wish, if you do, if you if you were to think of this in a course of complex analysis. Now, this Riemann surface in turn represents, you can see it as the space-time manifold associated to something that we will call a replica theory. So you can think, you can now imagine that instead of studying whatever model you were interested in, let's say Eisenfield theory, Let's say Ising field theory, you're going to now study a replica version of this model. So, n copies of the original theory and non-interactive copies of the original theory. So, in a sense, it's still as simple as before because these copies, they don't talk to each other. But in another sense, from a field theory point of view, this is a theory that now has a lots of new lots of symmetry and lots of new symmetries. In fact, it has symmetry under all elements of the permutation group. All elements of the permutation group, any permutation of all these copies, is a symmetry of this model. And in field theory, if there is a symmetry, normally there is a field associated to that symmetry. Now, it turns out that in the context of entanglement entropy, the symmetry that is most interesting is the one connected to this geometry here, which is the symmetry and the cyclic permutation of the copies. Okay, so there's going to be a field among all these members of the permutation group, there will be a field. Of the permutation group, there will be a field that implements that symmetry. And that field is what we called in our paper in 2008, we called that this branch point twice field. We call that field T and its conjugate, we call it T tilde. And in the end, what you realize is that this partition function at the top is nothing but the two-point function of these fields in this replica theory. Now, this realization is important for many reasons, but it is interesting. Many reasons, but it is interesting because if you have an expertise coming from QFT, in QFT we spend a lot of time learning how to compute correlation functions. So once we have entanglement measures in terms of correlation functions, we can use methods from QFT and from integral QFT or from CFT to compute these correlation functions. Now in this case we have a two-point function just because we are looking at a region with a connected With a connected region with two points at the boundary. And so, for each, essentially, for each branch point, you have one field insertion, so you're going to have two fields. But if you have a more complicated geometry, like multiple connected regions, things like that, or you're computing negativity, where you have usually multiple connected regions, then you have higher point functions than that. And it just gets harder. But in essence, you have a kind of correlation function picture for pretty much. Correlation function picture for pretty much any integer modes you could think of. Do you have an idea with the lattice realization of this T? Yeah, there is an idea. So actually we did write some papers about that. So I can tell you more about that later. But yeah, there is a way to do that in the lattice that is actually quite natural. So you can do the replica of the lattice and you can construct local operators whose product essentially generates the action of these three spheres. Generates the action of this twist field in the QFT. Yeah. So this twist field is very much like an order field, I mean like magnetization essentially, so it's a non-local field. Is it like something like E to the magnetization? What we could call a private field of the method? I mean something like that. So it's the it's a field that sits at the origin of a branch cut in QFT. It's a non-local field. In QFT, so non-local field, like the magnetization is in terms of the formulas. So it's similar to it in that way, but it's a bit more complicated. Yeah, um usually this would be of some higher genus sort of it can be. Yeah, I mean, so this this one this one it's it's it's not sorry. Sorry? For single cut, not so for single cut you can map this back to the complex plane with two punctures essentially. Yeah, so in this case it's still fine, but you can have more complicated geometries where that happens. Yeah, but for the single interval it's still pretty simple. Yeah? Okay, so this is well in a nutshell this QFT picture. So a lot of work has been So a lot of work has been done connected to calculating these things and sort of deducing properties of entanglement from this. And this is interesting because this is true at criticality, but it's also true beyond criticality. So this is an approach that now allows us to look at massive theories, for example, gapped theories, and look at corrections beyond saturation, which is what happens when you have a gap. So what happens now if you put symmetries on top of this picture? Now, if you put symmetries on top of this picture, so you have something similar, except that now if you have a symmetry, you have a symmetry charge. We're going to imagine that this charge is local, so we can sort of think of it as having a contribution that sits on one region A and a contribution that sits on the complement, and they separate quite neatly. And you can think that the reduced density metrics for a particular region will also commute with the part of the charge kind of sitting on that region. Sitting on that region. If you have those properties, then as Filiberto I think showed yesterday, you're going to have a certain structure of the reduced lens style metrics and its powers, which is a block structure. So you're going to have symmetry blocks. And that is a sort of simplification, I guess. It tells you something about what the density matrix looks like. And then you can ask: is there a way to apportion contribution to each of these blocks? To each of these blocks. That is essentially what you ask when you define these symmetry resolve measures. And the answer is: yes, you can attribute an intendant to each of these blocks. And to do that, you have to define generalizations of all these functions I talked about. Yeah? You were asking? No. So you were raising your hand. So, for example, Goldstein and Saylor, they introduced something they call a symmetry resolve partition function, which is like the standard partition function. Which is like the standard partition function, but now there is this projector that projects over a sector of a certain charge, sample sector of charge Q. So this is the symmetry result partition function. If you take n equals 1 in particular, this becomes the probability of making a measurement of the charge and getting a certain value q. Okay, so this is p of q. That function is important because now you can define generalized and tenable measures. So you have symmetry resolved. Measures. So you have symmetry resolved for any entropies, symmetry resolved from normal entropy, just as before. And now you can say, well, what is the total entropy in terms of this symmetry resolved entropy? So we are saying these are kind of the contributions for each sector, but not all of the sectors contribute exactly the same, I mean, except in certain units. So the relationship between the total entropy and these measures is not entirely trivial. In fact, it's given by two contributions. It looks like this. So it looks like this. So the total entropy has one part, which is the sum of the probability of a certain charge times the corresponding symmetrical resolve and tennis entropy. And then there is another contribution here, which is just essentially the Shannon entropy of this distribution of the charges. These two contributions have names in the literature. So one is called number entropy, the other is called the fluctuation entropy, fluctuation entropy. And I believe when people say they measure this thing, I believe when people say they measure these things in experiments, I think, although I'm not an expert, but I think what they measure mostly is this contribution here, the fluctuations. Right? So everything looks pretty similar to what we had before. So all the functions look the same except that now depend on the charge. Now, okay, so how do we compute these things? So can we use a field theory approach with correlational functions? So Goste and Sela said, yes, there is a way to do this. You can do correlators. A way to do this, you can do correlators of twist fields still, but it's not going to be the same twist field as for the total entropy, it's going to be sort of a generalization of that. And there is one additional twist, if I can say, which is that the correlation function is not even the main thing anymore. The correlation function now is going to be the moment of this entenum entropy. So the entenoment entropy itself is going to be a Fourier transform of this symmetry result. Of these symmetry resolve moments, which are the correlation functions. So, this is what's on my next slide. I think. So, there's a systematic approach which uses what I call composite these fields. And the idea is that you first have to compute these charge moments, these C's. These charge moments are going to be correlation functions of some fields, so it's going to be similar to what I described before. But the partition function, unfortunately, is going to be a Fourier transform of these things. Be a Fourier transform of these things. So now you can use field theory methods, but you have an additional step which is Fourier transforming on this parameter alpha. And in this example, actually, I'm considering you one symmetry, but you can write this for other symmetries and also for discrete symmetries. In that case, you have a discrete Fourier transform. You have a sum. So for example, in, I don't know, complex fermions you have or in Isin, you have C two symmetry. You can define symmetry resolution with respect to that. Resolution with respect to that. So, the symmetry result in time and entropy follows from the Fourier transform, as I just said. Okay, so we have two things to do. We have to compute these moments, and then we have to fully transform and come to some conclusions. Okay, so how do we compute those moments? So, as I said, this is going to be correlation functions of some fields. So, what kind of fields are those going to be? So, I'm going to do a little review of my two. Review of my twist fields, just one slide here. So, how do we sort of describe the cyclic permutational symmetry in the replica theory with twist fields? The way we did it in our original paper was to say, well, in this replica theory, there will be many local fields. Because we have n copies, every local field phi that is there is going to be replicated, so it will have an index that runs over all these copies up to n. So that would be a standard field in my theory. Will be a standard field in my theory. This is the twist field. The twist field sits at the origin of a branch cut, and if I go on a trip around the twist field, if I cross the branch cut, the field is going to move to the copy above. It's going to change its copy number. And if I don't cross the branch cut, nothing will happen. They just commute. So this is the kind of exchange, equal time exchange relations that you can write. And these are useful because from these, you can then see how the form factor program for the metrics element. The form factor program for the metrics elements of this twist field changes with respect to the standard one. So there's going to be a slight change because this symmetry, this non-locality somehow is of a type that's a bit more complicated than, let's say, U1 symmetry or something like that. So that's a picture of that kind of exchange relation. So something like this happens. Now, when you have a symmetry, like mu1 symmetry or any other, you're going to have You're going to have, you still have replicas, so you still need a field that implements this cyclic promotional symmetry, but you also have the internal symmetry. And in the end, the sort of field you're going to need is one that combines both. So there's going to be a new kind of field that's been studied in many papers. In the case of U1 symmetry, I'm going to write it like this. So it's going to have this additional index alpha, which is connected to the Index alpha, which is connected to the symmetry, to the U1 symmetry. These are the moments I was talking about. So again, if I'm looking at a region of length L, this two-point function, and this field is going to have this kind of exchange relation. So it still creates a change in the copy, but now if the symmetry was u1, there's also going to be a U1 phase that is picked up. And if you want to represent that in a geometric picture, I guess one way to think of this is that I guess one way to think of this is that you still have your kind of complicated Riemann surface. You still have the fact that if you go around the branch points, you come to the sheet above. But in addition, when you go around, there is this additional symmetry field that is sitting in there. So there is the action of that field, whatever it's doing. So if you see one symmetry, it will have a phase. If you see two symmetry, you might pick up a sign, etc. Okay? So that's essentially what happens. Essentially, what happens now, you can define these fields in this way and develop a form factor program from here, which actually Pasquale and David did. But you can also define them a little bit more precisely if you think of them in the context of conformal field theory. And that's why I call them composites here. So we actually thought about these fields in a quite different context a few years ago. So before people were talking about symmetry resolution, yes. Solution. Yes. So, in your formalism, do you allow for Grassman fields, like fermionic field theories? Yeah, I don't know. I mean, fermionic. I mean, I don't know. Yeah, for example, one of the main theories we studied is actually free ferment and Eisenfield theory. So, yes, you can have those theories. But, yeah, these are a little tricky. So, in fact, In fact, the icing was dual, but it's non-local dual, so it's free marijuana and the icing. Yes, so the icing, I mean, so this description I gave here, it's okay, you can do it for the icing field theory, and we did a lot of things for that model. There is a subtlety, though, which is that in the icing field theory, I mean, so there's this non-locality issue with the firming, so it's this idea that the local So it's this idea that the local degrees of freedom in the chain are the spins, but the fundamental field in the QFT is the fermion. So essentially you have to decide which field you define this twist field with respect to. So in my construction, this branch point twist field and this action that it does to change coffee and so on is with respect to the fermions here. Fermium field in the isom field here. Not the spin. So there is uncertainty connected to that. Do people study permeatic QFTs, but with the symmetry is fermion parity? Is that something that resolved measures for? I don't know. But the natural symmetry, right? It's always there. Yeah. So I don't know exactly what you call formulant party. You you mean situation symmetry or? You may see to symmetry or because I don't know. Yeah, even number of fermions. Yeah. I mean, I think in the isofield theory, this is what you would call C2. Generic fermion filter. Yeah. I mean, well, I'm familiar with one dimension, so I think in one dimension people definitely have studied symmetry resolution with respect to that symmetry, I guess. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So I wanted to tell you something about where this notion of composite twist field comes from in a slightly more formal way. So I call them composites because if you look at them in a critical theory, in a conformal field theory, this is really what they are. So the way they are formally constructed is that, oh, you can define them. You can think of this field as the leading field in the OPE between the standard branch pointing field and the symmetry field. Field and the symmetry field that you are considering. Okay, so that if you look at that OPE, that's what it would look like, more or less. You have my twist field, we have some, here I write it as a vertex operator, so some U1 field, and copies of it because we are in replica theory. You look at this OPE expansion, and you have a power in here, which will be related to the conformal dimension of this composite. And that is actually how you can compute the dimension, yes? You can compute the dimension, yes? So here I call V the, you can think of this as the symmetry field, let's say the U1 field, if there is U1 symmetry. So here is criticality. So I'm talking about OPEs. So you can, let's think about, I don't know, criticality, complex ferment of critical points, and you have a new ones in example. So I'm going to criticality here simply because it's only here it makes sense to talk about composition, even though Sense to talk about composition, even though then you, as usual, in integrability, you can say, okay, now we go to an integral model and we think that these fields are still in there in the mass equipment here. But in the CFT, you can sort of use CFT techniques to, in particular, compute the dimension of this composite field if you know the dimensions of the other two. And in fact, in that way, you get this formula that also Golstein and Stella have in their paper, that the dimension of this composite is the dimension of Trisfield plus the dimension. Is the dimension of truth field plus the dimension of symmetry field divided by n. Okay, so there's a 1 of n that comes from the conical singularity. So we started, so this composition, this kind of composition, we actually studied it a few years ago because interestingly, this kind of composite fields also come out, or come up, or become interesting if you ask yourself how to compute measures of entanglement in theories that are non-unitary. And that is a problem that we were interested in a few years ago. That we were interested in a few years ago. And in general, when you think about entanglement measures, the general kind of construction says that you're going to need a range of point to this field. This field is not necessarily unique with that property, but you want to choose the one that has the smallest conformal dimension of all possible symmetry fields. And that field with the smallest conformal dimension is the one I defined here, normally. But if your theory is non-unitive, But if your theory is non-unitary, sometimes you're going to have a field with even smaller dimensions because the dimension of this symmetry field here or other field might be negative. For example, this happens in Li-Yang theory, that you have a field of negative dimension. And it turns out that in Li-Yang, for example, you can define good measures of entanglement where you use a composite field of the standard twist field and this primary field of negative dimension. So when we were studying. Dimension. So, when we were studying those things, we developed these ideas and we found the dimension. In fact, this dimension you can also find on very much older papers on orbiforms when people were studying orbifold CFT. So we cannot even say who were the first. But essentially, you can do this kind of composition, not just with symmetry fields, but with any local field. So, once you understand this and have those exchange relations, you can also do You can also do compute metrics elements if you are geometrical, massive theory. You can write equations for those metrics elements, and this was done actually again by David and Pasquale. Can you tell me about the time? How I'm doing, anyone? Oh, Jesus. Okay. So I don't think it's going to be fine to say stuff. I'm sorry. So, well, okay. I hope at least I gave you an introduction. So there's been a large number of samples. So there's been a large number of samples that have been studied. So let me just, well, give you a summary of the ideas. So four factors. So if you want to go beyond criticality, compute correlation functions, in integrable models, there is this four-factor program many people here are familiar with. So we have it for spin chains, as Frank told us about, but we have it also in QFT. We can try and use it to compute two-point functions. And if we do that, for example, and we are looking at, let's say, For example, if we are looking at, let's say, the ground state, we are looking at this composite field, it is normally possible to write an expansion that looks something like this. So, you have some functions here, which depend on many variables. These are called rapidities. These are properties of the various particle states that you can have. And these form factors are matrix elements of one of these fields between vacuum and a state of key particles with these rapidities. So, you have a series expansion, and this is an expansion. function and this is an expunction that converges well for some value, some parameter. So Frank also talked about that in the day. In QFT, typically in the ground state, the parameter that makes this converge well is the distance between the fields. So the larger the distance, the quicker and better the convergence. So this is an infrared expansion. So now you can ask, okay, how you compute these metrics elements and so on. That's the form factor program, and it's a quite technical thing. It's complicated. Quite a technical thing. It's complicated to do it for every theory and so on. So we have done quite a lot of that. But what's interesting, and then you would still have to fully transform because these are just the moments, these are not the entropies yet. But the interesting thing is that all of these things that were written in this abstract of Savior Kerf and Sierra, that I mentioned earlier, the compartition, the scaling, logarithmic scaling, all of these nice properties. All of these nice properties, you can actually deduce them just from the trivial contribution to that expansion, which is interesting. And what I mean by the trivial contribution is the disconnected part of the correlator. So if you take the distance between fields to infinity, this correlator becomes just a vacuum expectation squared. So that's the trivial contribution to the correlation function. And we know from dimensionality arguments that in quantum field theory this spectrum Theory: this expectation value has to scale with a fundamental mass scale, so inverse correlation length, to a power which is the dimension, the conformal dimension, a critical point of the field. So we know how this behaves in general. There will be some function there that's field dependent, but the power law in the mass is something that we know. And if we know what this dimension is, which we know for U1 fields, in many theories, and so on, we can take this function and we can do the free. Take this function, and we can do the free transform, and we can do everything. And if we do that, we actually find a log term with the mass, the central charge, and we find the double log term, and we see that none of these terms actually depends on the Q, on the charge, so there is this equipartition. So that is this equ I mean in QFT we recover this notion of equipartition when we have a very large region, when we take distance very large, okay? Take this very large, okay? We get that. If we develop this expansion further, we get lens-dependent corrections to this, usually exponentially detailed corrections to this. And David in particular, my collaborator has studied this a lot. So that's what you can do for ground state. I will show you just flash a couple of formulas for my papers. So for example, this is something, this is something we got for the This is something we got for the sign-Gorgon model, which was the first thing we studied. So, if you do the calculation in this way with some factors for sign-gorgon, you indeed get the log term. You have log of mass, inverse correlation length, instead of length, because you are in a gap theory. You have some constant, doesn't matter, function of n. You have the log-log term, which has the dimension of this U1 field, and then you have corrections on the distance between fields. Okay, that's the next thing. Okay, that's the next thing. If you do a POTS model, which has a discrete Z3 symmetry, you have something similar. So actually, the first few terms is just the total entropy, so the log term as before. And then you have things that start depending on charge. In this case, the free transform is a sum, it's discrete, so it's a bit simpler. But you see that this term still depends on the correlators of these different symmetry fields that you have in points. So, I mean, it's quite messy, and I mean, somehow. And I mean, somehow you can do it, but these large distance corrections are pretty ugly. So, I mean, you cannot extract a lot of lessons from that. It's just a calculation that you can do. So, because this is complicated in the ground state and rather messy, that was the motivation to look at the excited states. But I know that somehow there's not much time for that. But the next part was the excited states, and it was just to say that there are certain. It was just to say that there are certain kinds of excited states in certain scaling limits where you can compute a lot of these things exactly to an extent that you could never do in the ground state. And the reason why you can do that, I just described what those excited states are in the end. So you will think, okay, I mean, if I look at an excited state in one-dimensional massive theory, what does it look like? Well, it looks like a Look like? Well, it looks like it depends on a finite number of rapidities, and then we replicate that spectrum. Now, I'm saying computing things in ground state is complicated. Computing things on an excited state is even more complicated. So, it doesn't look like this will help very much to look at this. And that is kind of true. But what simplifies matters for us is that we looked at the entanglement of these states in a scaling limit that is different from what I was doing earlier. From what I was doing earlier. So let me just show you a picture of that, which I think is clearer. So, what do we do with these excited states? So, what we do is we look at them at finite volume. So, we look at a system of a certain finite length, capital L, and we look at a subsystem of smaller length, little L, and we take a limit where these two lengths go to infinity, but simultaneously, so that their ratio stays finite between zero and one. Between 0 and 1. Now, if you do that, what you have is a system that's very large, a subsystem that's very large, and in there you have a finite number of excitations. So this is called a zero density excited state. So this is an excited state where you have few excitations and it's in a space that's so large that they pretty much don't see each other. So that whatever your theory is, whether it's interacting or not, it has very little effect on the living behavior of this quantity. This quantity. And in fact, it has so little effect that you can calculate everything from semi-classical arguments, in fact. And you get some very nice combinatorial formulas for everything. That's the main idea. This is different from what I described earlier, in the sense that when you do standard form factor program for grammar state, you typically start at infinite volume from the very beginning, so this L is infinite from the start, and then within that infinite volume, you are looking at a finite region of answer L. A finite region of that L. So it's a totally different scale in limb. That's why it's complicated, the ground state. So I think, so for this special excise state, you can compute the total entanglement, and we wrote a few papers on that. But equally, the symmetry resolve measures also admit some very nice exact formula. So unfortunately, I don't have time to discuss them, but I'll maybe just Do we find equipartition also here? Let me think about this for a second. I think I'm not sure actually. So it's a bit difficult to, yeah, I don't know, because if you have had a t-story principle. Yeah. Yeah. Um so I mean it's easier to think of that for the total entropies and how, but for the symmetry resolve case the relationship between ground state and contribution, excited state contribution is a little bit more complicated. So I mean my intuition would be that there is because so Because somehow the contribution of the ground state is still there, and the ground state exhibits a competition at least in the correct limit. So it would be just as before, but then there is an extra contribution from the excitations. And I think that contribution from the excited states charge depend dependent. I think it's okay. Sorry to be slow on that. But actually, no, I think the contribution from the excited space is explicitly dependent on the charge. Yeah. So it's not a good conclusion. So actually it's broken in that. Okay. So sorry to pass this fast, but I think it's better that we all have coffee. If you have questions, you can ask me. What you find for these excited states is that there is a simplification in the sense that the In the sense that the charge moments themselves are not necessarily simple, but the ratio of charge moments of the excited state versus the ground state are extremely simple functions, which you can get combinatorially and so on. So, for example, here is this ratio for a state of two excitations with the same charge but different momenta, so that these are distinct excitations. And this ratio takes this very simple form for you once. This very simple form for U1 symmetry. So you have the U1 phase, you have the ratio of subsystem to system size, and yeah, that is a very simple function. You can plot real and imaginary parts and compare them to max, which is what we need then. So let me just go to the conclusion here. No example. Yeah, let me just end. So the aim of this talk was just to review the definition and some properties. Review the definition and some properties of symmetry-resolved entropies. And I also, in particular, try to emphasize how this can be computed in integral quantum field theory and how an approach based on quantum fields can be useful in this context. In general, it's technically quite difficult to get analytic results that go beyond kind of the trivial contribution. But there are some states like these excite states I described where you can do quite a lot of things analytically. So that's why. Things analytically, so that's why they're quite nice. They're a bit like a toy model for this. So, I mean, obviously, here I just look at entropy of a region. You can generalize all of these to multiple regions, all the measures, negativity. We could also wrote some papers on that. I guess more generally, it would be interesting to understand the structure of these high-order corrections in integral QFT, and in particular, to understand if there is some physical. If there is some physical information that you can get out of there beyond just doing a very messy and long calculation, which is what it looks like at the moment. So, I mean, kind of the leading term is giving us this equipartition. Can we say something a bit more precise about how that is broken, how that depends on the theory, the state, things like that. So, there's quite a lot to understand at that technical level still. But I will leave it here. So, anyway, thank you. Questions? Yeah, with the rating relations, the twist operator has to satisfy for a you want the symmetry resolved twist operator has to satisfy for you an alien symmetry. So I haven't looked at those cases myself. I think the group of Pasquale, I don't know, I think there are papers, maybe by some people even here, I'm not sure. But I think there are studies of long ability. No, it was specifically what happened. Yeah, we haven't, yeah, I think probably everything I did was at either U1 or C2 so far. So, yeah, it would be nice to do. So, yeah, it would be nice to call them. And as you twist operator has to transform her representation at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. But which one? Yeah, that's the question. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Sorry. But yeah, I mean, that's another thing to look at, which hasn't been done. Yeah? Sorry. So the badest twist operator, the twist operator was. Twist operator, does this twist operator come from the fact that you're doing a symmetry resolution? Does it correspond to like you actually compare with our result version? Now you have a symmetry defect like spanning across your subsystem. But this operator is a lightest operator that can live at the end of this symmetry. Because in that case it is not clear to use the same principle and then to pin down the corresponding to the principle. Yeah, so when I was talking about lightest operator, I wasn't referring in particular to symmetry resolution. So if you are dealing with the kind of fields you need for symmetry resolution, usually it's fairly clear what operators you need. It's true that, so you compose two fields. One is the symmetry field, so normally you would know what field that is, with what dimension. The other is the standard range pointers field. Point to this field, and typically you also know what the dimension of the correct field is in there. What I was saying, however, is that there can be some such of this, for example, if you work with non-unitary theories. So, you have a theory that is non-unitary, for example, it can happen that the branch point which is filled with the smallest dimension is not that the that we is not the one we use more widely somehow. So, I mean, it's a bit technical, we we can discuss that. Bit technical, we can discuss that also now in the break if you want. But yeah, there are chances that this especially if the theory is non-unitary. Yeah, thank you. So, everyone, there's been a slight change in the schedule. Israel Push is unable to give his talk online. So, we'll have an excuse. So we'll have an extended coffee break and I guess we'll come back at 320. And then we would move the last two talks up then, right? So sort of 320 restarts. Another problem is that we shouldn't have to be. I mean, which is not giving us very committed push. Because this is exactly what we're discussing with the yeah, maybe we can discuss yeah but I know how to do it but for preparation for our data where you use the design reporting disable the Yeah, so it comes to the net. And if you don't, you will record that. I believe in which the capital is in the panels. Come on.  So it's also arbitrary and then because there are pairs, then he gets two columns. Yes, and you think the same, you think the same guess trap and most likely because you have one instead of components. Well, I think that I tried, but then I worked on this more or less all the way to context things. You only found something for you was the for you were the But for you, it's kind of like basically giving a lot of email basics, but one would be a good set of all the things. But arguably, of course, you could think: well, why shouldn't I define when it's like zero one and it's a zero so that I can Unless you assume that I'm not sure, but still is there any user thing that we assume that the end points are still too large. So you can control the second practice, for example. You don't have to care. Yeah, okay. They don't have care. Yeah, so the H2Q was where I was. Well, I mean, what I can tell you for sure is that you also consider the pairs. So theta one minus theta one and theta one and minus two. So I think that the approximation tries to neglect that particles, but again the for the one shift. I mean we have also particles sleep and shift both particles unless Yes, but the two states of their state. That's why we think the same colours. That's the point. Yeah, so.  Zero in the interval, and then there's only one state flat. So that's two pairs here and two pairs. That you would also special choose to cover. At the beginning, let's say one reason, one argument why you would say But here, then I also have only one argument that we make here. The pragmatic argument should much larger one argument basically more. So the argument would be that I don't side MPSI, and therefore I would say that it's not a problem.  Yes, that's right. I mean you were saying you were saying that pieces are inside you you were saying design is a big case. It's not nice. Yeah, yes, anybody wants to do that. So for the editing for the property, you see the process. You could use the app, so it's a what I want to tell you before. Capital would have been the portion of the first one or capital and payment capital. Yeah, so they think the consumer is from the consumer. Customer and the basic plan. So we were able to
