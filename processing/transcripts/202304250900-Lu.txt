Let me welcome you back to our first session of today. And we're happy to have Professor Zeekin Liu of University of California at Irvine, who's going to tell us about the spectrum of Lovelace and forms over open manifolds. Thanks, the organizers, for the invitation. So, the title I need to change a little bit. It should be LP Spectrum of Light Passing Over. LP spectrum of La Passing over open manifolds, that's the main topic, is to study the LP spectrum of the Laplacine, not just L2 spectrum of the La Passing. And for good reason, I will explain. Okay, so the Laplace throughout this talk will be the Hodge La Passing on cave forms. So it is well known that the Laplace operator. Well, known that the Laplace operator is a self-adjoint non-negative definite operator on the L2 space of k-forms. And so this is the definition from functional analysis. So how to define the spectrum, the spectrum, first we define those complex numbers which are not in the spectrum. So those are the complex numbers such that this Laplace minus lambda i is invertible in L2, then lambda is not in L2. Then lambda is not in the spectrum, but then the complement of those complex numbers are called the spectrum. And so I just want to point out that such a definition can be extended to L P space. Starting from L2, you can go to LP space. There are different ways to do so. So roughly speaking, the Laplace operator is not only densely defined in L2 space, but also obviously densely defined. Densely defined in LP space. A formal definition is: well, we can define the operator semigroup e to the negative T delta, which is not only an operator semigroup bounded in L2 space, but on L P space. And once it is an operator semi-group in L P space, then its infinitesimal generator gives you the definition of the lapal. I want to ask one question. I want to ask a question about the first formula there. Yeah. So, what is the WK? Oh, yes. So, WK is the Weinzenberg tensor, which is, so this is called the Weinzenberg formula. So, one way to define the Hodge Laplace is the E star. So, this is basically the trace of the Hessian, which we would call the connection Laplace. And the surprising fact, which is the first formula is purely topic. So the the first formula is purely topological and then the second formula is um Riemannian is our it's not completely topological because this star depends on the Riemannian metric as well. And the surprise this is the Weinzenberg formula which the surprising part is that these two second order differential operator their difference is the zeros differential operator called the Wenzenberg tensor. That's no first order. They're supposed to have the first order. That's not. Okay, so this this this slide makes This slide may scare you, but allow me to answer the question: why do we do that? Why that's interesting at all? So give me a few minutes to explain. So this is one of the results, main results of my talk, which is a joint work with Nadia Chara-Lambas. So basically, we are able to figure out the picture of the spectrum of La Passing on Of LaPassing on n plus one-dimensional hyperbolic space, simply connected, curvature negative one. So we want to study the LP spectrum of K-form. So that's the complete answer of all the spectrum, all the LB spaces. And so it's well known that if you're talking about L2 spectrum, then it's containing the positive part of the real line. But for LP spectrum, Real line, but for LP spectrum, you have to include some complex numbers. And for this particular problem, so the LP spectrum is basically looks like this. So this is the complex plan, and we have a parabra. So I don't have time to compute, but the locus of this complicated expression when S is running through all the real lines, so it gives you the problem. And so the spectrum. And so the spectrum points will be the right-hand side of this. So all these complex numbers are contained in the LP spectrum of k-forms. So this is a little bit complicated because we contain both p and k. So we can do an exercise if we let p equals to 2. So then this parabra actually is degenerated to a real line starting from a quarter of n. Starting from a quarter of n squared, all the way goes to infinity. So this is a degenerated parabra. And this is well known because we know that the button spectrum, L2 spectrum of hyperbolic space is a quarter of n squared. And so we also assume k is between zero to the half dimension because the other half we can use Pangale duality. We assume P is from zero to two because L P L P duality. LP duality. And the one feature which is new is that when n is of odd dimension and k happens to be in the middle form, so then this is not only, the spectrum is not only contains this parabola, and it also contains a point, zero. So zero point. So that's strange. In the middle dimension, you have infinite dimensional harmonic area. Harmonic LP harmonic forms, k forms, when k is n plus 1 over 2, if n is an odd number. And I wrote here you have duality for this to extend to all the k and the p's. All right, so this is the result, and so now let me explain why it's interesting. So actually, k equals 0 was known, so this picture. Known. So this picture is not completely original in the sense that the similar picture happens in k equals to zero. That means for the function case. So if we're talking about the Laplacian on hyperbolic space of LP spectrum, you have this rubber picture, and this was discovered before. And so our contribution is that in the middle dimension, there's In the middle dimension, there's an extra anonymy. And so the proof is different in the middle dimension, special care, special effort has to be put on. This is number one. Number two, so now this is the time for me to show the motivation. One of the motivation is at the beginning we know this was known for k equals zero. So at the beginning it was supposed to be an easy one. To be an easy one-week project, why not just write down everything for arbitrary case? So maybe we can finish in one week. But we try very hard. The computation is so complicated, and so the estimate can never be made exact. So we spend a lot of time and for good reason, because at the beginning we didn't realize that, so in the middle dimension, In the middle dimension, so there's an extra point. And so that means you can never get a general formula go through, so no matter how you try. And so we have to use some special techniques to overcome once we find that. So this is the technical part. So maybe one can say if somebody is technically strong, can take care of complicated computation, one can still do it. Still do it. But another motivation is we actually want to estimate to do the L1 operating norm of the resolvent like this. Okay, so estimating the resolvent is always interesting. And so for us, we are more interested in such a resolvent when Z is a complex number. And for the L1 operator norm estimate. Estimate. So we are talking about the LP spectrum, but in fact, the only interesting case is for p equals 1, because p equals to 2 is well known. And once we establish p equals to 1, then the interpolation can tell us everything, the rest. And so we realize the importance of the L1 operator estimate. Uh so so so so so uh so Moteano, one and some they they they have done this similar things, yes. Have you looked at the spectrum in a weighted space or when a weighted element? Not yet, but we are talking we so so actually I'm going to talk about those not spectrum but those resolvent estimates for manifold with rich curvature at the lower bound. No other assumption. How about macro rich curvature? Assam shit. How about back reamory region curvature as a lower bound? What about the back reamory region curvature? I haven't thought about it. Because often, when you get this kind of essential spectrum, you can actually move it around by changing the weights. Yes, I think so. I think so. Thank you. Yes, that's a good point. Yes, yes. So they estimated the Green's function, the L1 norm of the Green's function, when z is equal to zero, which is more subtle, I would say. Which is more subtle, I would say. For GZ is complex. I'm not saying it's less interesting, it's different. We have to use wave kernel to eventually solve the problem. So, and sorry, yeah, and so so, in order to estimate this weight. So, in order to estimate this, we have to use, we develop a method which uses both heat kernel and wave kernel estimates. So, the heat kernel, wave kernel are important, but they are orthogonal. So, you will see that heat kernel will give us estimate, but not exact estimate. Heat kernel is good because we have all the kinds of estimate. Wave kernel, there's a problem because we don't have a good estimate, even we give good curvature. Even we give good curvature assumptions, we don't have that. The only thing we can make use of is that the finite speed propagation of wave kernel, but we can put them together. Yes. Oh, sorry. Is anyone wondering the chat? Or I I don't see any slides. I don't know when that appears. I don't know when that appear. Yeah, it's a message to me actually. Yeah, so let me mention a famous result of Alexandria Gregori, which is related Y L1. Okay, so it's not just that we want to generize from L2 to LP or to L1. So YL1 is special. Special. So, this is at least my motivation. So, to do that, so Gregorian proved that on any manifold, complete manifold without any curvature condition, if we assume this is a simplified version of his theorem, so let's x h x y t is be a heat kernel, and assuming that for two points, hxx t is less than that, h y t is less than that for any t. And then he can prove that. And then he can prove that HXYT has a Gaussian upper bound. So you can imagine if T is small and the D is big, this is extremely small. It's a good estimate. We call the Gaussian estimate. Yes, the C in the Gaussian only depends on the C in the Gaussian. Yeah, so these two C may be different, but it just depends on maybe the dimension of something. But I'm mostly worried about the C and the exponent. Oh, they're different. They're different. But the C and the exponent only depends on the constants in the previous one. It only depends on the constants of the previous one? Yes, yes. I forgot. I think this C only depends on dimension, and this C depends on these two C's. Okay, the one that only depends on dimension, that's the only working one. Yes, yes, thanks. So this is interesting because if we use that to estimate the Green's function of this kernel, so this is the resolvent, well, resolvent power n. So assuming. So, assuming alpha is a big positive number. So, if you estimate the resolvent, then we call this the Green's function. This Green function has singularity. But if you power it to the power M, you can prove that. So, this is a globally smooth, the kernel is globally smooth kernel. And we can actually estimate using a heat kernel estimator because the Green's function is the integration of the heat kernel. And the heat kernel is Kernel has a Gaussian upper bound. And once you have the Gaussian upper bound, you see that alpha is very big, so you have this arithmetic and geometric alpha t e to the negative d square ct. It's always less than Less than this. So, this is the basic arithmetic geometric inequality, which tells us that once you have heat kernel Gaussian, you always have exponential decay of the corresponding Green's function. So I call this Green's function, even this is the equation, this is the kernel for the resolvent. And so a natural question is Is so I think this is true, but we haven't finished proving that. So let's say I have a Green's function which corresponding to Gregorian's results. So Gxx Gyy is less than that for any alpha. So this Green's function depends on positive alpha. Uh suppose that can we prove that the Gxy is actually uh has this exponential decay? This expansion decay, so without any condition, and just for these two points. I think we should have similar results. And so if this is true, so if gxy is like this, it's exponentially decay, so then obviously an integral version of the estimate of the kind is to, if you integrate this Green's function, then it's in L1. Okay, so yes, so there are two. So, yes, so there are two things. I didn't really understand the condition on M. Is M just supposed to be a positive mixture or supposed to be large or what? M is bigger than as low as half of n over 2. Basically, so each m you create a tm minus 1 here. So, if the kernel has a singularity, you just don't want the n to be bigger than that, so it won't have singularity at zero. So then the kernel will be split. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So in general, this Green's function stuff, resolvent stuff, can be generalized to any pseudo-differential operator f. So suppose f is a function, continuous function. So we can talk about it in the sense of spectrum theory. We can talk about f delta, which is a pseudo-differential operator. And it's well known that if this f is a bounded condition, This f is a bounded continuous function, then f delta is in L2. However, in general, f delta wouldn't be in L1, but we needed to estimate, do the L1 estimate. So how can we do that? So essentially, if we assume that f has inverse Laplace transform, so that's the assumption. So there's a function called f hat whose Laplace transform is equal to f, then we are able to Then we are able to estimate, get this exponential decay estimated exactly the same way as we have done before. So this is what we want to study. And we also want to study, so suppose gxy is the Green's function for F delta, and then we want to study this integral, integral L1 norm of that. So L1 norm is an integral. So L1 norm is an integral estimate of the result of the kernel of the pseudo-differential operator. And the exponential decay is what we expected to be the pointwise estimate. So that's our motivation. And yes. Okay, so now let's go to the technical part. So these are all the motivations. Now let's go to the technical part. Now, let's go to the technical part. So, this is the first warming up lemma. It's well known for heat kernel estimate. Essentially, so if C is a large positive number, so delta is already positive, so you add a square of large positive number, it becomes more positive in some sense. And then you're talking about its negative n power, so it is supposed to be quite small. And this is indeed the case. In this situation, you see. The case. In this situation, with the help of heat kernel estimate, so here the so what we can guarantee for the heat kernel estimate is the rich curvature lower bound. And in the case of k form, we assume the Weinzenberg tensor has a lower bound as well. So we have comparison of heat kernel for k-forms and with that of functions. So anyway, we can have this estimate. We just write them down explicitly. So one of the features is that it So, one of the features is that it depends on phix, phiy, where phix, phiy depending on the local volume. So, if you have local volume collapsing, so your estimate is bad because this is one of that it becomes big, but it's in a controllable way. And so in the L1 estimate, in the LP estimate, those will be cancelled out because if your starting volume is small, you make this big, but the integration is still. Big, but the integration is still small because your volume is small, so they will be cancelled out. Yeah, so this is just the teaching of that. If you have the inverse Laplace transform, you have the Green's function exponentially decay. If your inverse Laplace transform itself is exponentially decay, so what we proved actually in some cases, even we assume. In some cases, even we assume this is explanation growth, a similar result would be true. So that's our main technical part. Yeah, so okay, so this is the first observation we can use LaPas transform. So if f hat is exponentially decayed, you can do it directly, just like I have done here. But f hat is exponentially gross. Hat is exponentially gross, we are able to do it if we assume the function f has certain property. And so, this is the second preparation of this method is so that the finite propagation of the wave kernel, which is well known, but we write down in the general case for manifold, for any manifold, any manifold and the And the undifferential k-forms. So the corresponding wave kernel, which we can write as cosine of t square root h, h is Laplacine minus any number which still keeps this positive. Laplacing may have positive spectrum lower bounds. So you can minus any one is still positive, and you can take square root of cosine t. That's the wave kernel. So that wave kernel, in this fairly general assumption, In this fairly general assumption, we have finite propagation, and the speed of propagation is always equal to one, no matter what the manifold is. So that's what we want to use. And so number three is we introduce a new concept. I think this is well known, but let me explain. So we define something called the exponential rate of volume growth. So intuitively, so if you have Euclidean. So, if you have Euclidean space, well, let's say you have a hyperbolic space, hyperbolic plane, then the volume grows exponentially. But here, our definition is that we want something uniform. So usually when we define something, volume is exponentially growth, it has to be with respect to one point, fixed point. Okay, so, but this time we want it uniform in the sense that for any point x, we compare for a radius r at x with. Ball of radius R at X with ball of radius one at X. And so if we make such a stronger definition, so that there's some interesting, so I cross out this, this is the definition for what we mean by gamma equals to infinity, which is technical, so we can ignore that. But so it's surprising that if you have a manifold with finite volume, so by our definition, gamma may not be equal to zero. And the reason is that, so for And the reason is that, so for example, if I have a manifold with constant curvature negative one, but with finite volume, with non-compact complete, with finite volume, so then gamma actually is equal to as big as the corresponding hyperbolic space. And the reason is that even the left-hand side is finite. The right-hand side, because it has to be uniform for x. It has to be uniform for x. So we let x go to infinity, so this wall of radius x is exponentially decayed. And so, so, in order for this inequality to be true, you have to have a positive exponential term to make up. So, that will make the gamma to be positive, even for manifold with finite volume. So, this is a strange definition, but you can easily see its relation to the volume entropy. So, in two cases, Volume entropy. So, in two cases, if the volume is infinite, then gamma is bigger than the volume entropy. If the volume is finite, you can still manage to define the volume entropy that way. So, you have two inequalities. So, but that's our definition. This should be an invariant for the manifold. You always have gamma. So, if you have on a Euclidean space, gamma is equal to zero. All right, so this is our main. So, this is our main technical lemma, which is a refinement and the generalization of Michael Taylor's result. So, this can be used in various situations. So, we define gmcxy to be the kernel for this operator. And we have actually a pointwise estimate for this before we mention that. So, now let's define. So now let's define a kernel or let's define a function of two variables to be like absolute value cosine this guy acting on that. Absoluted value then integrate from zero to infinity. So we define such a quantity which will appear if we use Fourier transform. So basically Laplace transform, you start with another Transform, you start with an operator, you do the Laplace transform of Laplace inverse transform, the other end is the heat kernel. And if you use Fourier transform, the other end is the weight kernel. And this exponential decay will happen if you assume, you give certain assumptions on the function of f. So, like, if you have a real analytic function and its Fourier coefficients actually should be exponentially decayed. Right, so anyway, so we define this and we prove that essentially this essay is uniformly in L1. So that's our technical result. And how to prove that? So let me say some ideas. So look at this G M K C. So I mentioned the previous lemma is because so G C when C is big, When Cassi is big, it's decaying exponentially. The bigger the Cassi, then it's more exponentially decay. So you can imagine when Cassi is infinity. So this actually looks like a delta function because it's starting with one point which is positive and suddenly it decays to zero. So it looks like a delta function. So cosine acting on delta function is essentially the kernel, the wave kernel by definition, some operator acting. Some operator acting on delta function, the wave kernel. And so, so this is essentially the wave kernel estimate. But then, so when t is small, we don't want to estimate that using parametrics of wave kernel. Because if we do that, we essentially need to assume that the manifold has bounded geometry so that you have a tiny Euclidean neighborhood that you can compare your current wave kernel to the Euclidean wave kernel and do the estimate. And do the estimate. We don't want to do that. So therefore, we basically approximate the delta function by such a function, which in our mind we know that it's a delta function approximation, and it actually worked. So the estimate is like this. So this delta function, well, it's not truly a delta function, it exponentially decays, but it still has some remainder, which is... Decay, but it still has some remainder which will never be zero. So, so we basically split this into two parts. So, this delta function, we draw a ball radius r prime. So, the first part we call the g1 contains everything for inside r prime, outside r prime, the rest of them. So, then by triangular inequality, so obviously s is less than both of them, and we want to estimate both of them one by one. want to estimate both of them one by one. So the main part is the first part. And so if cosine i equals j equals one, then we want to estimate that. So here is a little bit subtle. So basically we estimate, we start with the L2 estimate of S1 on each annulus. And on each annulus, so you expand this analyst like this, and then you have Mikovsky. This and then you have Minkowski inequality. Basically, it's the summation, then you take L2 norm, which will be less than the L2 norm, then you do the summation. So, convexity. So, you get that on the analysis. This is very important. And so for each analyst, so you know that g x, g c is zero outside the ball radius r prime. But analyst is on r and r R and R plus one, so their difference, their distance is R minus R prime. So actually, so that means T has to be big, otherwise, the finite propagation property tells you that before, if T is less than that, this is identically equal to zero. This is the wave kernel, finite propagation speed. So from here, we change T to be bigger than RR prime. And then after that, we allow this AI. we allow this Ai to be AI to be whole F, which should be less than or equal to. But then cosine is less than one, so this is L2 bounded, so this is less than that. And this one we have pointwise estimate, so we, of course, we have L2 estimate. We can write down the L2 estimate. So this integration is bounded by the next slide. But the good part is T is bigger than RR prime and this. is bigger than RR prime and this is an exponentially decay term so you can expect so so this is what we have and so so then you you can expect that so so this S1 has exponentially decay because of just because of this exponential indicator okay so the second term is much better to estimate we just use L to estimate so because outside Because outside R prime, this one will automatically give you a fast exponential indicator. So we don't worry. We don't have to use wave propagation. We don't have wave, we cannot make use of wave propagation. But it's automatically fast exponentially decay. So if we put these two together, so we can adjust R prime. adjust R prime so that we can make this to be to be less has this exponentially decay like that all right and so on this analyst so then from L2 we can go to L1 by cosine equality so L1 is bounded by this and so at this point let me point it out why we cannot use cosine inequality at the beginning because our manifold has volume exponentially growth so so you have to estimate this To estimate this very accurately because this is an exponential growth term, supposed to be that. So, if we have that, these two cancel out, you still have some leftover exponential indicator. And then your summation from R from one to infinity, you will get all the L1 estimates. So that's that's that's that there's still some tech technical things we have to pay attention to, but that's pretty much the That's pretty much the method of L1 estimate. And so, with the previous lemma, so this is our result. So, it's interesting in the sense that we have a manifold, we assume rich curvature has a lower bound, and the Wensenberg tensor, if we are working on k-forms, Wensenberg tensor has a lower bound as well. And so assume lambda y is the infumor of the spectrum of L2. More of the spectrum, L2 spectra are k-forms. Actually, this lambda one, well, it in the worst case is zero, doesn't matter. So we define H to be Laplacian minus L1, and we consider this resolver. And the result is that if the image of Z, so Z is a complex number, and we assume that the image of Z is bigger than gamma over 2, half of the volume growth rate. The volume growth rate. So then this is a bounded operator, L1. Okay, so that would be the key to, if you apply that to this situation, to hyperbolic space, that will tell you that the left-hand side of this problem will be known, that they are known, not spectrum. To prove the right-hand side, all the spectrum we have to, because this is hyperbolic space, so we can estimate like. So we can estimate the special functions you can use a tester function to do that. Yeah. And so the estimate is, as I said, we use both heat kernel and wave kernel estimate. Roughly speaking, the observation is that we have some resolvent identity. So this h minus z square inverse is quite difficult to estimate. Difficult to estimate. If you try to use heat kernel estimate, it's quite technical. And so I was only able to successful in like special case and n equal three-dimensional. It's very complicated, but it's doable. But using wave kernel, everything is much better. So this looks complicated, but I just need to write out one resolvent in equality. Resolvent inequal equality. So this guy is going to be compared to, let's say, compared to this. So this is a good operator when alpha is a big positive number. So this is very easy to estimate. So the difference is actually, it looks like x minus z square minus x plus alpha square is basically a constant x minus z square. x plus alpha square. square, x plus alpha square. Basically it's like that. So the difference is basically a constant times their multiplication. And you can iterate again. So this guy you use this formula, you iterate n times. So eventually you would get a lot of good operators which you can handle. And then the last operator will be hc minus squared times. Z minus squared times this car. Okay, so that's an observation. And once you obtain that, so well, those good ones you can estimate using heat kernel estimate. And this bad ones is actually nice because, so as I said, this looks like a delta function and this guy acting on delta function. And so by our previous lemma, we have lemma we have such a we exactly provided such an estimate. So this operator itself with this modification we can estimate we do the L L1 estimate and so so this is for resolvement and then we want to generalize it to for general function f on a Laplace operator delta we can say what we Delta, we can say what we how much we can generalize. So we want to start with a complete non-compact manifold n. So first we assume the rich curvature of n is at the lower bound. So put it into the potential. So for example, a Schrödinger operator minus Laplacian plus V of X. Yes, that would be the same thing. That's all. I'm not sure the Schrödinger. I'm not sure the shooting operate. Can the F depend on the X or it can only depend on the X? We haven't thought about that one so far. Yes, you're right. One can do that. Yes. So we first assume Richie has a lower bound, and maybe backward Emory will work. And then we assume that the volume growth is gamma. And so we assume that there's f is a holomorphic function which is defined on a Which is defined on a strip of width like half gamma over 2 plus e short. So our function, so the resolvent function is f looks like this. It's actually f is this 1 over x squared minus z squared. So so this is our function. And this function is holomorphic on the strip because we assume that the image of z is strictly bigger than half of gamma. Strictly bigger than half of gamma. So z is outside the strip. So this is a well-defined holomorphic function. And so we assume that the j derivative of f, each time you take derivative, you improve the decay. We assume that. And so we also assume I need to wait. We also assume that in addition, well, f is an even function I mentioned somewhere here, holomorphic, even holomorphic function. So gz is a holomorphic function because it's even. And we assume that when this gz is a holomorphic function, but let's restrict gz on the positive part of the real line. And we assume that the gz has the inverse Laplace transform for the g tilde t. And we assume that it And we assume that G t has exponentially growth, not exponentially decay. Exponential decay is too restrictive. We assume that it has exponentially growth. So with all these assumptions complicated, then we have the following result. Then F of L L is square root of L. That F L is bounded in L1. And so let's compare our result with. So let's compare our result with the classical result of Michael Taylor. So he proved the above result is true if in addition n is bounded geometry. So in particular he needs a local injectivity radius to have a lower bound to use parametrics of wave current. And so we cannot see ours is a strict generalization of his result because we dropped the bounded geometry assumption but we add those red. Those red ones. So we add on those functions. We want those functions to have more property. And well, but we actually reduce that this should be different color. So he assumed this should be for all J, but our method just needed J for the first several of them, derivative. That's okay. So we are still working on how to remove this assumption that a function has inverse Laplace transform. At the beginning, I thought I don't. At the beginning, I thought I don't have to do that because most functions should have Laplace transform, which is true, but Laplace inverse Laplace transform is different. It does not exist in general. So we are still working, yes, excuse me, this assumption two is automatically satisfied on the last page. Two. If you have bounded geometry, then you have it for free. Yes. No, assumption. Yes. No, assumption no this is true. True. But you still need this exact gamma. Yes, it's the volume is exponential gross, yes. And you have lower injectivity radius components. Yes, yes, you're right. You should be able to play with these. Yes, you are right. You are right. You are right. So in the definition, we say this is gamma. It's exponential growth, but the growth rate is. Growth, but the growth rate is gamma. We have to assume that it's gamma. It's a number that is related to all the definitions, like f has to be defined on the strip, which is dependent on. So it's stronger. So it's not clear that boundary geometry will. No, no. Even in Michael Taylor, he has to assume that. Yeah, yeah, he has to assume. He assumed the boundary geometry and assume the exponential growth. If you assume the exponential volume growth is common. But it's not the exponential volume growth, it's different. Couldn't you switch the perspective and say bounded geometry gives me some exponential volume growth rate, all that gamma, and now I need f to be defined on a strip with gamma? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Assume it's bounded geometry, then there must exist a gamma. And for such a gamma, I have a function that satisfies it. All right, so. All right, so, but then we realize one thing. This function, I searched the Wikipedia, I say this nice function does not have non-negative inverse Laplace transform. The reason is that if such a transform exists, and then this is a log concave function, but any positive Laplace transform function in Laplace transform has to be log convex. So it's not possible. Convex. So it's not possible. But I don't know if anybody can tell me whether this function has inverse Laplace transform, maybe oscillating. I don't know. And the reason I'm interested in that is, so I'm not able to answer the question whether this function, this operator, particular operator is L1 integral, or it's L1 from L1. So some PD people told me, People told me, so this, the kernel for this has exponentially decay property for Rn. But the question is for manifold with lower bound of Richie curvature without bounded geometry, the answer is yes or no. So two questions, whether the kernel of this has exponentially decayed property. A weaker one is that whether this is L1 from L1 to L1. I bet it's true. It's true. No. Oh, okay. I'm almost done. So, therefore, I think our assumption on the function at the beginning, we say we can, for the function, we can assume a lot, but it does not include those important examples. So we want to study to move it. So, this is probably the last slide. So, our result actually can be viewed as a generalization of a result of STOOM. Result of Stoom. Stoom basically proved that if you have a complete manifold with Richie curvature as a lower bound, and the volume is called, he called uniformly sub-exponentially gross. So in our terminology, that's equivalent to gamma is equal to zero, sub-exponential growth. So then Stoom claimed that, so all the LP spectrums are the same. So Stoom's result is basically Euclidean space-like. Euclidean space-like. So for Rn, all the LP spectrum are the same. But for hyperbolic space, as you can see, all the LP spectrums are different. And in order to generalize, so our result is a generalization of his result from gamma equals one to gamma positive. So that's one point of view. And so that's the end thank you very much.
