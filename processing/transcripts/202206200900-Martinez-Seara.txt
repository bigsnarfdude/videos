Good. So, the title of my talk is Symbolic Dynamics and Oscillatory Motions in the Teabody Problem. And this is a joint work with Marcel Guardia, Paul Martin, and Jaime Paradella. The talk is going to be about the T-body problem. Okay, so we are going to consider three bodies with masses, M0, M1, and M2. All the masses positive, not any masses more or something like that. Not any mass is more or something like that. Our motion is going to be coplanar. So we are going to consider the T bodies in the same plane. And here you have the classical equations of motion. Let me remember. I can just like that. Yeah. Here you have the classical equations of motion. So Q0, Q1, and Q2 have two coordinates each. Okay. And we're going to talk about final motion. So which is the asymptotic, let me say asymptotic behavior. Let me say a synthetic behavior of the orbits of the system. And related to this, in fact, this final, sorry, sorry, I have to take to be okay. These final motions are going to be in fact a consequence of this other result. We're going to talk about chaotic motions. We are going to see that in the phase space of this problem, there is a set, an immediate set, in where the dynamics is chaotic. As a consequence of this chaoticity, we are going to also have results about the final motions. The final motions. Okay, so chaotic motions, as everybody here probably knows very well, is that we are going to take a set of symbols that can be finite or infinite, and we are going to take the sequences, the sequences, the double sequences of these symbols, and we are going to consider the Bernoulli shift. This is an abstract dynamical system, and we are going to see if we can embed these dynamics in the T-body problem. So, in other words, if we can prove the existence of a small horseshoe. You can prove the existence of a smell horseshoe in the dynamics of the thebody problem. Okay, uh, moreover, we want to construct hyperbolic sets. We want to construct hyperbolic sets in which embodiment hyperbolic sets where the dynamics is conjugated to the shift. In fact, in our case, will be of infinitely many symbols. Okay, so related to these are the final motions. So, the final motions were studied by Chazi in 1922, and Chazi made a classification and Made a classification and just classifying and reducing, he saw that the possibilities for three bodies are listed here. So you can have, when I talk about final motions, I mean in the future and in the past, okay? And he saw that in fact the possibilities are several ones that are written here. Basically, you can have hyperbolic. That means that if you call RI the mutual distances between the bodies, all the bodies, all the distance go to infinity with positive velocity. To infinity with positive velocity, parabolic when all the bodies go to infinity with zero velocity, bounded when the supremum of the distances is finite, is bounded, and then you can have combinations. So you can have hyperbolic parabolic, meaning that one body, the body k, the distance k, goes to infinity with zero velocity and the others go to infinity with positive velocity. Elliptic hyperbolic, you can imagine all the combinations. But he also found one interesting one that is the last one that is in the interesting one that is the last one that is in red where what happens is that the the supremum of the the limb soup of the supremum between the distances is infinite so the motions uh the bodies separate and separate and separate but at the same time the infimum sorry i don't see i don't know why okay do it with me so the infimum uh of the the limin of the supremum is finite so this means that the bodies separate but come back Bodies separate but come back, separate and come back. And they can every time they separate more, but every time they come back together somehow. Okay? And these oscillatory motions, so these were all the possibilities that Chassis found that were possible. He was able to see all the others ones, but not the oscillatory ones. Okay? So he knows that this motion was possible, but he couldn't find an example. And it was until 1960s. 1960s, that Sidnikov proved for the first time the existence of oscillatory motions in a restricted T-body problem. So, if he considered the restricted spatial elliptic T-body problem, so you have two bodies, M1 and M2 with masses, and the third body without mass. So, this is not a T-body problem, but a restricted one. He considered the two primaries with the same mass, so mass one-half, if you work with the mass ratio. And then he considered that the two bodies were moving in. He considered that the two bodies were moving in a plane, no, in elliptic orbits, and then the third body is in the perpendicular axis to the plane, which is an invariant, is an invariant axis. And in this, I don't know why this doesn't work. Push, sorry, wait a moment. Wait, okay. The third body moves in this perpendicular axis and he found, in fact, that there exist oscillatory motion. So the third body goes out and back, but comes all the time close to the prime. All the time close to the prime, to the go to zero plane. Okay? He also found free combination of past and future motions because it's not clear a priori that if you have a kind of motion in the future, you need to have the same kind of motion in the past. And in fact, in this case, he proved that no, you can have different motions in the future and in the past. This was in 1960, but until 1973, Moser gave a different proof for the Sindikov problem. Syndicov of a problem via, let me say, the classical tools in dynamical systems like the symbolic dynamics. Okay, and this is the proof that most of the authors later have followed to prove the existence of these motions. Okay, so let's talk about the restricted T-body problem for the moment. In the restricted T-body problem, there is also the case of the planar circular T-body problem. Okay, restricted T-body problem. So you have the two masses Q0 and Q1 in a plane, moving in circles. One, in a plane, moving in circles, now not in ellipses. And then you have the third body that now is called Q0, Q1, Q2. Sorry for the notation. Q2 has no mass and moves in the same plane. Now it is in the same plane as the primaries. And this problem was considered by Simo and Libre in 1980. And they proved the existence of stilatory motion for disturbed body, considering the mass small enough. So they need a strong condition in the mass to assuming that the mass will... To assuming that the mass was very small to prove the existence of these motions. And then in 2016, with Paul Martin and Marcel Guardia, we were able to see that in fact these oscillatory motions exist for any value of the masses. I will tell you a little later why this restriction was needed and how we overcome it. So this is for the restricted circular T-body problem, but there are other also other works like these ones where the Martinaza Like these ones, Guardia Martin Sabafor, the elliptic case, Chia, also Saran Zhang. These other works, let me say they have a little more restrictive motions. For instance, we can prove existence in the future or in the past, but not combinations. And they are based not in using symbolic dynamics, but using other kind of methods. Let me say more based in narrow diffusion techniques. Okay. And there is also this other work of Kaloshin and Galante, where they use every matter theory also to have results about. Theory also to have results about oscillatory motions. Another interesting result is this work of Alexef in 1969, where he could extend the proof of Sidnikov to the case where the third mass is small but positive. And in general, as I said, in all these cases, oscillatory and collective motions can be used because the motion approach can be used and gives the results. There is also this other remarkable. Remarkable result of Meckel in 2007, where he considers a different setting and he proves also the existence of oscillatory motions for an open set of masses. Okay, it's not dense, but it's open in the sense that he can prove that it has some open conditions for the masses. And what he does is a semi-conjugation with a small horseshoe. So it doesn't have hyperbolic dynamics, sets with symbolic dynamics, but has a semi-conjugation that guarantees the existence of oscillatory motions. The existence of oscillatory motions and his proofs is related to the passage near triple collisions. We will see that all the other cases I told you are more related with the passage near the infinity. The proof of Meckel is more related with the passage near a triple collision. Okay? Good. This is a little of history. There is also another kind of questions which are at the moment more open. That is the measure of this motion. So you can prove the existence of these motions. So you can prove the existence of these motions, okay? Which is the measure of these motions? Are there bundan, are not, etc.? And this is a very open question about if the measure is positive or zero or whatever. The conjecture is that, by Kolmogorov and Alexef, is that the Lebesgue measure of this motion should be zero. Remember that the oscillatory motions are related to the conjugation with the shift. So in fact, it's related to the existence of chaotic. Fact is related to the existence of chaotic dynamics. Okay, so the question about the measure of this set is also related to the measure of the chaotic dynamics set. And Marcel said already that nowadays people think that probability is not zero, the measure, but there are no proofs at all. Arnold said that this is the central problem of celestial mechanics, knowing if the chaotic motion is a positive measure or not. There is this work. not there is this work of kalosin and gorodesky where they they had results about the hasdor the hausdorff dimension of these oscillatory motions they saw that this maximal in the syndikov problem and also in the circular problem and the restricted sibody problem that i explained you before and then the the challenge we had in this work was that in fact all the results that i have i have listed here usually deal with restricted models no With restricted models, no, when mass is zero, and also with restricted sets of parameters, because you, as you will see in a moment, at some moment need to use some kind of perturbation theory, and this makes you to restrict the parameters in some how. So, our challenge was to see if it is possible to work with the thebody problem without asking these restrictions to the masses, and this is our result. In fact, you consider the thebody problem, the thebody problem. Heavy problem: the the body problem with three masses, three positive masses. The only condition we need is that one of the masses is not equal to the other one, so when two masses have to be different. This is a technical condition that could be overcome, but requires lots of technical work. And then we proved that you can take x minus any of these values, oscillatory, bounded, parabolic, elliptic, or hyperbolic, elliptic. Elliptic is equivalent to bounded. Elliptic is equivalent to bonded, okay? So it means parabolic bonded or hyperbolic bounded. And y plus also any of these ones, and there's always an empty, a non-empty intersection. So there exist motions that are oscillatory in the past and bounded in the future, etc. So all the possible combinations. In particular, we can have also oscillatory motions in the past and in the future. Good. We can combine then almost all these regimes. The motion we are going to find, I will show you a picture, is basically that the bodies of mass M0 and M1, so the two bodies, will be all the time close to circular. So they are not going to be circular, they are going to be close to circular. So the distance between them is going to be close to constant. And the other body is the one that can have different behaviors. So it can be cons, it can be bounded. So it can be cons, it can be bounded also, it can be oscillatory, it can be hyperbolic or parabolic. This is more or less the construction we are going to do. Okay, as I said, the existence of these motions that I show in the previous slide are a consequence of this result. That is the, in fact, the most important result that says, with the same conditions, you take the flow of the theory problem, you take a section in the physical space. In the phase space. You consider the Poincaré map, of course, restricted to an energy level. You consider the Poincaré map P, that is from some subset of this, sorry, yeah, P, from pi to pi. In this section, this section is going to be four-dimensional with all the restrictions, etc. And we are going to prove that there is an invariant set X, okay, which is homeomorphic to the shifts of infinitely many symbols. This gives This gives in particular positive topological entropy. And also, we also are going to prove that X, in fact, is a hyperbolic set. It's a hyperbolic set and where you have this conjugation. Other results, and there exist also other results for restricted models in other regions of the phase space, etc. And here I have a list of people, Volotin and McKay, Volotin. Bolotin and McKay, Bolotin itself, Adrioli, Marko Niederman, Wilsa-Silicinski, Kapinski, etc. Okay, but I want to make propaganda of our work in the sense that we don't have restrictions for the masses, almost any restriction for the masses. Okay, this is the picture. So this is more or less how our bodies are going to behave. These two bodies, Q1 and Q0, are going to move more or less in circles. And then you take a section, okay, and the third body is going to... Okay, and the third body is going to come back to the section. Okay, and then every time the body comes to the section, you count how many turns q0 and q1 do. Okay, how many turns they do. And then this number, the number of turns, is then k. Okay? So every time the body q2 crosses the section, you write the number in k of turns at the q0 and q1 and 2. And this gives us the symbolic dynamics. And what we see is that. And what we see is that, in fact, you cannot put any number of terms because our body Q2 is going to pass a little away from the two Q0 and Q1. So the time is always big. So as the time is always, it has a minimum, it's not going to be infinity, but the time this big means that these two terms need to be at least some number that is this L. Okay, so we can put any number of terms, omega k plus n plus l, okay? And this is the Bernoulli. And this is the Vernuli chip that we get. Okay? It's clear this? Yeah, so we have a minimum distance. It's not going to farther than farther. So it goes back and comes back, but it cannot come very close in our construction. So it doesn't have collisions, etc. Okay? Our construction is like that, exactly. But so let me explain you, remind you, how is the proof of the Signikov problem? Is the proof of the Signikov problem, and then tell you which are the difficulties in this problem to use this approach? So the approach of Moser was the following: the Signikov problem is a one and a half degrees of freedom Hamiltonian. So you can take a section of the phase space, or you can take time, or you can take a section in the phase space and consider time as a variable. And then you have a two-dimensional map. Okay, the Poincaré map is a two-dimensional. What you see is that this map at infinity has a fixed point. Why are we interested in infinity? Point. Why are we interested in infinity? Because the oscillatory motions go very close to infinity, more and more close to infinity. Okay, so you can put infinity at the origin using magnificent coordinates, for instance, no? And then you have that infinity is a fixed point. First step, then what you see is that this point has a stable and stable manifold. Remember, we're talking about two-dimensional Poincaré map. So you have a fixed point with stable and stable manifolds. It's not obvious the existence of manifolds because the point at infinity becomes parabolic when... Infinity becomes parabolic when you do the proper change of variables to Magishi coordinates. So, parabolic points in principle is not clear that they have manifolds, but this was proven by Magishi in 1972. So, you have these two manifolds, okay? And then, what you have to study is the global manifolds, okay? The Magichi coordinates gives you the local manifolds, you have to study the global manifolds, and then you have to see that these global manifolds intersect transversally, okay? Transversally. Okay? Once you have that the manifolds intersect transversally, if the point, if the infinity was a saddle point with a stable, unstable manifolds, which intersects transversally, then you have a small theorem that gives you a small horseshoe and its symbolic dynamics, etc. In this case, this needs a little more work because the point is not hyperbolic. And as you know, the existence of the Smeal horseshoe is based in the Land Da Lemma. Okay, and the Land Da Lemma is not a priori trivial for. A priori trivial for parabolic point, but this the approach of Moser also deals with this, and then you got the. I didn't say that to prove the existence of the transversality of the invariant manifolds. Here is where you need to use perturbative techniques, because the global manifolds are not possible to compute in general. Okay, so in this case, you need to be near some interval regime to control the global manifolds. Okay, in the case of the Signikov case, then the Case of the Signikov case, then the integrable regime was the eccentricity. When the eccentricity is zero, the circular case, the manifolds coincide. And then you can apply some regular perturbation theory like a Melnikov method to compute this transversality. Okay, so once you have all this, the parabolic Land dilemma gives you the local dynamics of infinity like a classical Landa lemma, and then you can build the classical isolating block. So the picture is here, now here you have your remokini point, and what you do is. And what you do is a set of blocks that accumulate to the stable manifold. And then, when you come back through the return map, these blocks become transversal, no, in the other direction and accumulate to the unstable one. And this construction gives you, instead of a horseshoe with two symbols, a horseshoe with infinitely many. Basically, this is the idea. Then you have this isolating blocks plus confields that give you the existence of this small holes. And this was the most. This small holes. And this was the most approach. In this approach, what was crucial was to have a 2D area preserving map to build all this construction. And this could be also done in the case of Alex Stephen model. So now we have to say what we do in the T-body problem, because the T-body problem cannot be reduced to a two-dimensional Poincaré map. This is a big difference. So in the two-body problem, using the classical first theory, Using the classical first intervals, the preservation of the energy, taking a proper section, etc. The Planckary map is four-dimensional. This is the first thing. At infinity, that in the Sidnikov problem, infinity was a hyperbolic, sorry, a periodic orbit, no, because it was a one and a half degrees of freedom Hamiltonian. So infinity was a periodic orbit. In the Poincaré map, it became a fixed point. Now we are in four dimensions. At infinity, Dimensions, at infinity, what you have is a circle, a disk of fixed points. So every point is fixed, but this is a disk. Okay, so it's a two-dimensional object, infinity. In infinity, you have center directions, of course, because everything is fixed. Okay, so it's more complicated to build hyperbolic sets here. And moreover, we want values for all the masses. This was our goal. And the transversality of the, so we are going to prove the. So we are going to prove the existence of invariants. So we are going to follow the same ideas with more dimensions. At some moment, we will need to prove that these manifolds of infinity intersect transversally. And we cannot play with the masses because the masses want them to be fixed. So how can we prove the transversality of the manifolds of infinity? The main idea is that. Ash, there are two moments. Now we have to go back. Wait a moment. Okay, yes. Okay, so I'm going to explain a little the scheme of our proof, and then I will tell you how we can prove this transversality. So we are going to take infinity. Infinity will be a disk of fixed points, two-dimensional. We're going to consider the manifolds, which are going to be three-dimensional. We are going to prove this transversality of the manifolds. Okay. The transversality of the manifolds. So infinity is an invariant. So, infinity is an invariant manifold. Okay, a disk, which is an invariant manifold, is a kind of normally hyperbolic invariant manifold, but instead of being hyperbolic, it's parabolic. But it has a stable, unstable manifolds, intersect. Then you can define what we call the scattering maps. If you are not familiar, you take a point in your manifold, you look, the manifolds intercept responsibly, remember? So you take the point, you take the unstable leaf, and look the stable leaf, where it goes. So this gives you heteroclinic connections between points in your invariant manifold. Points in your invariant manifold. And this is what you call the scattering map, the map that sends one point to the other when they are connected through an electroclinic connection. We will prove that we have two scattering maps, not one. So every point has two different electroclinic connections to another. And then using these scattering maps, we are going to build not in land, not in the at infinity, but taking a section close to infinity, we're going to build a return map. Okay? So the main idea is that when you do the turn around the homoclinic, basically The homoclinic basically the dynamics is going to be given by the scattering maps that we can compute. And on the other hand, we are going to now go to the parabolic normal form. So we are going to take this manifold of infinity, close to the manifold of infinity, we're going to the normal form, a parabolic normal form. We are going to prove a multi-dimensional dilemma. And this is going to give us a local map near the manifold. So how the things behave when they pass close to the manifold of infinity. Manifold of infinity. So, joining the behavior of going through the tomoclinic connections and the behavior when you go to the map, you are going to build some return maps. And we are going to prove that a suite of all iterators of these maps has these symbolic dynamics. Okay, this is a little technical, but this is more or less the idea. As I said before, how we prove the first step, that is the transversality of the invariant manifolds. Transversality of the invariant manifolds. As I said, you need a perturbative regime because, if not, it's impossible to deal with global manifolds. And the regime we're going to choose is that the point Q2 is going to be very far away from the other two. This is the setting we deal with. So, as Q2 is very far away from the other two bodies, in first order, what you have is that Q2 only sees one body, okay, whose mass is the sum of the masses, because he's very fast. Of the masses because he's very far away. Okay, so this is a nearly perturbative regime. So you have two-body problems: the two bodies moving here, and this body with the zoom of these two. These are the two-body problems in first order in our setting. Okay, so this is an integrable setting, and in this setting, we are going to see that the manifolds coincide, etc. We are going to be able to deal with the global manifolds. The problem of this approach is that it's true, these are two-body problem. True, these are two-body problems, but then you have different scales in time because the two bodies move at velocity one. Let me say, no, they are moving in circles or near circles, and this body goes very slowly because it's far away. So, then you have two scales of time, and this creates a lot of complications in the perturbative approach of this problem. Okay, so basically, the transversality between the invariant manifolds cannot be studied with classical perturbations. Be studied with classical perturbation theory. You have to deal with all these exponentially small splitting of separator phenomena to prove that the manifolds intersect. So the manifolds intersect, but the angle between them is very, very small. And this happens every time in a system where you have a fast rotation coupled with a slow motion. That is what I was explaining you. You have a fast rotation with the bodies that move and the other one that goes slowly. You cannot apply classical perturbation theory, but you can use this sophisticated. You can use these sophisticated techniques that deal with exponentialism of phenomena, studying the manifolds, going using parametrization of the manifolds not in the reals, but in the complex, and then using some results of exponentialism phenomena. This is very technical, it's not the point, just to say that this is one of the difficulties on this problem. Moreover, as we are dealing with a problem with high dimension, there are no proofs in general of this phenomena in such a high-dimensional model. Uh, high-dimensional models. Most of the proofs are in one and a half degrees of freedom. Okay, so this is a little the idea, no, the picture. No, here this is the infinity that is a circle of fixed points, and then it's coupled with a pendulum-like, a pendulum-like, because this angle is very small, but it's more or less this idea. So now we have to build associated to this a system of blocks, no, that gives you the horseshoe. Okay, and then the idea is that in the Then the idea is that in the, let me say, parabolic, hyperbolic directions, you can do the same as we did in syndic of case. So you can do the same here, the magnetic bond, you build the Plossidra, but the problem are the central directions, okay? So how we do the central directions? Remember that I'm going to consider a return map. Okay, this is my Poincaré map. And then I have to see what happens with the central directions. And then the idea is that the following. And then the idea is that the following. So the idea is, this is the infinity, remember? Okay, so in the next slide, infinity is now this lambda, this green line here. Okay? This manifold has stable and stable manifolds, which intersect transversally along something that we call homophytic channel. In fact, we have two channels. Here, the plot only gives one, but there is another one. So we have two. Then this is the scattering map. You see, you take a point in infinity, x minus. point in infinity x minus you look which is the pteroclinic connection to this another point x plus and the the scattering map sends x minus to x plus simply this and this maps um has lots of good properties we studied this with zamadeo and rafedo deballabe and it's a map has lots of properties in particular it's symplectic and we have formulas for it that's the good part okay so in our perturbative regime you can have formulas for this map then the idea is that when you take a section Is that when you take a section here, no, and you study, sorry, here, and you study the return map, because the scattering map is not a map because the points to go from x minus to x plus, you need infinite time, so this is not a map. But if you take a section near lambda and you study the rotor map, in the central components, the central components, not the hyperbolic ones, the formulas of this rotor map, so to speak, are given by the scattering map. This is the idea. So the central directions are So, the central directions are governed by the scattering map. So, then the only thing you need to study is these scattering maps and see if you can build blocks for them. The scattering maps are bad because, in fact, they have fixed points that are elliptic, not hyperbolic. So, when you study the map, you see that the fixed points are elliptic. But then, the great idea that Marcel had is to take, as we have two maps, so you take one map and then you iterate the other several. And then you iterate the other several times. And then you can build a block that, with this combination, becomes like that. So you have a block that, with the combination of these two, this combination of maps becomes an isolating block. Okay? So then in the central directions, you have this construction for the scattering map. Now you have to reproduce it for the return map. But as the scattering map is the first order, then you get in the hyperbolic directions the same. The same construction that in silico remember this is the infinity, so we know when we go back, we do all the turn to infinity, we have these scattering maps where you have these blocks. Then you build a return map from a neighborhood. You take a section, and you do the return map. And the return map is the global map. So you take a section here, from here to there. This is the global map, okay? And this is what the one that is given. Okay, and this is what the one that is given by the scattering map. And the map near the point, near the infinity, then you need all this parabolic Landa lemma that this case, the expert is Paul Martin. So in this case, the parabolic Landailema gives you the whole information what happens. Sorry, because I cannot point what happens when you go close to the infinity. Okay, so we have a map near infinity that is given by the Near infinity, that is given by this control of the parabolic land dilemma, and a map that gives the whole turn, that is the one that is given by the scattering maps. So to speak, this is the idea. And then you have to do this convenient composition, because remember, the global map, we have two, because in the picture you see an homoclinical, but there is another one. So you have two global maps to combine with the local map. And using a suitable combination of these maps, you get the map that has the hyperbolic set. Hyperbolic set. Using this combination of maps, this is the picture you see in the four dimensions. In the, let me say, parabolic dimensions, you see the same pictures as before, and in the central direction, you see this one. So in this way, you can build four-dimensional blocks, okay, that gives you the existence of this horseshoe in more dimensions, okay, with infinitely many symbols. And then you can prove the existence of a hyperbolic set. We also have to prove the. You also have to prove the confields, etc. All these technical conditions. But the idea is that you get a set of blocks that match one to the other, no, and then you have, as a consequence, the existence of a counter set with hyperbolic dynamics, infinitely many symbols, etc. And I think my time is more or less over. If you need some declaration, you tell me. Thank you. Okay, the question is where I use the assumption that two masses are different. This assumption is needed when you prove the splitting of the invariant manifolds, if I remember correctly, because how you do the splitting? How do you do the splitting of the manifolds? You have to use some kind of perturbation theory. Perturbation theory is always: you have a system with manifolds that coincide, and then you do perturbation theory to find that the new manifolds do not coincide. And then the method is always to find a first order and then neglect the rest to prove that the rest is smaller. So you need the first order to be non-degenerate. And this is the condition. If m0 is equal to m1, the food. 0 is equal to m1, the Fourier coefficient that you need to be different from 0 is 0. In the case of the restricted T-body problem that we did with Marcel and Pau, we also had this problem when the two masses were the same, when mu is one half, and we could avoid it using symmetries, etc. But in this case, the work is so long that we decided that is enough. So what is writing the But how do you what are you that the masses m zero and n one are lost in circular motion for long time? Repeat me? Yes, how do you can what it is that the mass is then lost in circular motion for a long time? No, no, because this is the way we decide. So you take at infinity the disk that I was showing you in the center. Was showing you in the center, there is in the center of the disk, there is the circular motion in the variables that we use. We use Poincaré variables, so the center of the disk is the circular motion, and we can only prove the existence of the scattering map, the existence of the petroclinic connections, etc., in a neighborhood of zero. It's a technical condition that we use, in fact. If I want to, yeah, the construction. No, I'm trying to think a little. Let me see, because we take the motion. See, no, the way we construct the motion is that we take the at infinity, no, when we look at infinity, the infinity manifold that reflects the motion of the two bodies, we can only, it's a technical question. It would be better. In fact, we have a future project to see that we can make the Project to see that we can make the motion to have to change in the eccentricity, but then this is again a technical condition in the problem of splitting. The problem of splitting of the invariant manifolds is a little hard and technical. And as we don't have parameters here, no? So we need to control all the time that the parameters are in the correct places. So it's a control that we need to do. We do it in purpose. For any more questions?
