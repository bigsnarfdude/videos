All right, second talk of the day. Thanks. First, I would like to thank the organizers for this very long workshop. This is my second time to visit the bank. The first time was back in 2017 on this workshop women in control, and then we are looking forward to the next one. So today I'm going to talk about missing. Going to talk about a new mixing problem I have been working on for a couple of years now. I think some of the audience may have said this slides before, but today I'd like to revisit the problem, hopefully with some ideas and inspirations from the EAE system, the community. This project has been partially supported by NSF. Also, lengthy Okay, so here is my outline. So I will focus on the system of transport magnetic equations to describe the three-mixum problem where molecular diffusivity could be detected. And then sometimes, in the presence of the molecular diffusion, that leads to a parabolic That leads to parabolic multi-tiques. Now, the core question here we'd like to understand is what velocity fields mix it. So, that I will introduce a little bit results about my control design I've been working on. And then I will also propose some open problems. Hopefully, that will get your interest. So, to start with, so what is a quantum mixin? So, mixin So mixing basically is to express one theory of a field in another medium. And we see this happen very often in daily life, like mixing in painting, for baking, or spreading of pollutant in the atmosphere, the ocean, or the lake. Sometimes we look at the mixing of air and fuel engine with application to combustion. But the problem I'm looking at is rather I'm looking at is whether, well, I will look at the simplified for a minute. I'll say if you like to mix two fluids, just by binary, or bicolor fluids, yellow and blue, let's simply assume the density is separate. The question is how can you introduce the mixture to generate a velocity field and get well mixed, right? For example, like you put the milk into your coffee and then you introduce your spoon to stir it, right? The question is: how can you stir them? Stir it by the question: How can you stir them effectively, or by the last way of using custom experience? That's a question that I'm interested in. Then, to focus on the discussion here, I would first look at the case where I gave a state of difficulty. So, simply, I considered the transport equation in the open boundary domain to describe this mixing sort of process. What can this transfer equation have? Can be either two or three-dimensional with a sufficiently regular boundary. And here, theta stands for mass concentration or density distribution or calculus distribution. And then the scalar field is affected by an incompressible field though, B, with low penetration boundary conditions in that version is zero, and no component of velocity will start from boundary zero. Now, with this type of This type of properties associated with velocity, one can easily show that any LP norm of theta at any t greater than zero equals its LP norm of neutral energy. P can take the values from one to LP energy. So this can be easily done just to LP estimate, energy estimate. On the other hand, since here we have operator serial function analysis, people are familiar with this. Analysis, people are familiar with this type of approach. They continuously show that this convention operator is co-adjoint. So that's the semiconductor essentially is unit group. So you get the conservation of mass, right? So on the other hand, you can say that there's no fluids in or outside boundary, so the mass is conserved. Then the question is, how am I able to quantify this degree of mixedness? I was saying I like to introduce a velocity field. I like to introduce a velocity field so that two fluids can be very well mixed. And mathematically, what would be the measure to quantify the mixing? So the further demonstrate idea would be this object book. Some of you have seen these pictures maybe many times before. So let's say initially we have two fluids, black and white. We think the initial condition of setup Initial condition of data say one stands for black, the TV one stands for white. Among all those figures, well, the last one might be the best mixed ones. In the sense, if you draw minimate the plot for each black dot, you say the white dot even distributed. Also, for each white dot, the black dots are even distributed. Then, mathematically, how can we describe what's observed? Any ideas? Absolutely related that to a certain degree. So an European norm is not quantified, right? Yeah. Oh no, I mean we can just look at the semi-group. It's unitary, so the match is conserved from that perspective, but this, we can use LPS minimums. So yeah, well, an LP norm certainly cannot be used to quantify the orthogonalities. Let's say how people look at this problem. It's better simplifying the domain 1D, we consider one. The domain 1D, we consider one-dimensional to writing the domain 10 of L. We first define a metric D by taking integral of the scalar field at any point x, at which any radius W F because really you want to zoom in at any point. That would define this magic. And then the mixed norm given by M of theta is then obtained by averaging D squared over all. Overall, so you want to see any point whether the two colors are very well mixed. So, then this MIPS norm, I mean, through this definition, can be shown precisely equivalent to data in terms of H2F one-half norm. The proof actually was first shown in Matthew Mesick in Katzworld back in 2005. And then what they did was, let's just do this, because we have a periodical domain where you look at the Puri expansion of data, and then you can show this precisely equivalent to one norm. In fact, any negative subway norm which quantifies a weak convergence can be used as a mixed norm. And then since the other day we at the table, we were talking about. The other day, we at the table we were talking about chance of GPT. I'm asking you that can you uh construct a sequence which converges in LO2, but not to convergence in H to negative one? Well, I take the integer for simplicity, but not to in L2. And I think it provides me a rather reasonable answer. But actually, for some simplicity, we have this very well-known step. We have this very well-known sequence sine nx, right? If n goes to infinity, we know this sine ns quickly converts to zero, but not in some case, in other two. So that's an example. But the construction somehow makes sense. It's increased the frequency, that's the key. So let me go back. So let me go back. Sorry. So basically, here there is a theory about this norm. Suppose spatial lineman zero, say the integral of feta over space zero, bounded uniform mean L2, since we'll have a periodical domain. Then when this statement in terms of h to negative r function converts to zero, if only if the integral status with any test function in L2 converts to zero in T. L2 converts to 0 when t goes to infinity. This really stands for the weak convergence. But in my following discussion, I will simply take alpha to be integer 1, since they are all equivalent in terms of the 0.5 mix. So for the general domain, edge connect one norm will not be well defined, right? So, and then instead of the edge, Instead of the H, that's one norm, I will just introduce the dual norm as a mixed norm, but general domain. So dual norm, I will take this H1 prime, right? Due to the guy from the trigger. Then in order to interpret this H1 norm, I introduce the higher regularity counterpart, eta. Through an elliptic problem, therefore, the H1 prime of your scalar field essentially equals the H1. equals the H1 norm over eta. So this quantity later on will be the quantity I'm interested in to measure or to control. And here I will just take this lambda squared with necklace plus and plus i. So after shifted then it's invertible. And then of course my fluid problem essentially governed by a transport equation. Well the fluid is diverted free and was there Free and with the significant problem. So I have a transport and delivery system. Now, the key question here is: what's the relation between velocity and the carry rate of eta in S1 or theta in H1 prime in time? I mean, in other words, what velocity field enhancement? So here, about the mixed norm, we think the smaller h1, the smaller h1 prime, The smaller h1 prime that means better the mix and this. And on the other hand, I want to point out since the mass is conserved. So any other two norms of theta remain constant. And if you look at the duality, theta in terms of H1 and H1 prime, right? And then if theta is H1, so it's more than equal to H1 or I equal to h1 norm of theta times h1 prime norm of theta. Now I want to drive this zero, if I assume theta has been zero. And meanwhile, the h1 norm is going to blow up. So the gradient of your scalar phase is going to blow up while the mixing is effective. Computational music create a lot of issues, I'll point out later on. So anyway, this is the problem I'm going to look at. The problem we're going to look at. And the question is: what would be the velocity, which enhanced mixet? So there is an extensive literature on the relation between the velocity field and the mix and decaying time, especially the relation between regularity of the velocity field and the mix and decay. So there is a sort of survey paper by Alberti, Craba, and Basupel in 1916. They showed for any initial So it's for any initial initial boundary distribution and then for mean zero over certain periodic domain and delta they try to understand the following relation. Now this assume velocity in WSV, so we have space, and uniformly time, so L infinity in time for velocity. Now S is great non-negative and then P is between 1 and infinity. And take the balance. And take the box. So they showed if s is smaller than one, for example, we lost just simply the L2 specialized, the perfect mixing in finite time is possible in the sense there exists a time, t star such that until prior to t star, you can drive the mixed norm to zero. So this is so-called perfect mixing. However, if you increase the s, let's say if s is one, say if velocity is simply h1, one can only get exponential. One can only get exponential decay. Perfect mixing is not possible. Now, if you further increase the S, then they said, okay, only polynomial decay they are able to prove. And then it was unknown whether X decay rate had expanded when S word is not one. So this was the Open Prompt posted their early paper. And then later on, in 2018, Jindian Gigatus, they showed the answer is affirmative for the S. The answer is affirmative for the S between 1 and 2, and P satisfy this relation. They actually construct a certain velocity such that the exponential decay is possible. However, the answer is still unknown if S greater than or equal to. So basically, we don't know whether sufficiently smooth flow is able to drive mix and decays exponentially in time. So one way to look at this is if we're looking One way to look at this is if velocity field is very smooth, theta is rather well behaved, then it can't really go anywhere to achieve maximum. So that's really like a scalar field, it goes like a chaotic somehow get through to make sense. So when I first, oh, sorry, this is one example, I'm polynomial mixer. So this is a quite interesting example. So let's look at the two-dimensional unit disk. Now we consider scalar field is driven by a station of the older flow. So the velocity is two-dimensional, scaling by that. And then this flow satisfies the station of the older equation. And where pressure can actually flood in gets a relation between the pressure and the velocity. And then they test in. And then the test initial condition is just again the bi pop bi-color roots. I think that the black is standard by one and the white region, I'm not sure if you see it clearly, white region standard by 31. So with this type of initial condition, they showed actually declarate the next norm for the polynomial decline. Of course, the initial conditions have to satisfy certain property. So, when I first looked at this problem, it was due to a talk by Charlie Storing at Universal County, Commeab I think I would post that there. He was one of those people to look at the mixing problem in terms of this mixed norm. And I was thinking, realistically speaking, the velocity in general is governed by flow equations. So, later on, my work is influenced by the. My work is incorporating the flow dynamics to this problem. So the idea is you control the velocity field and then through the vection, you steer the mix. And consider two type of flow systems. The first one is the self-flow, the second is another self-flow. And it's well known mixing can be effective in turbulent flow, but also effective in naminal flow with rules number in one or even less. And then for the numbers of cases, there are two scenarios. One is There are two scenarios. One is so-called the passive figure. So there is only one-way coupling. So while being transported, the scalar does not affect the velocity field, then the scalar is called passive. However, if the scalar does influence the velocity through a lot of forces, then that leads to an active scalar. And this actually is rather challenging in case, for example, you have buoyancy. If you couple the transport equation with the number source, with also buoyancy, that's actually Also, Boyan says that's actually the next equation with zero diffusivity. And then the well-closeness of the system is rather challenging. There was an open problem proposed by Mathet. He was asking whether the gradient of data is going to blow up when the diffusivity converts to zero. And later on, we actually answered the question. The answer is often no, it won't blow up. And then later on, we did option. That needs round with optimal control for this type of system. So let me, oops, sorry, kept doing that. So, if we reformulate this flow transport problem, you may abstract differential algebra system, then you have a transport equation, and then you have a flow equation and be either Stokes or Labor-Stokes, right? Depending on how you like to pick the Nappy term or the level of the bodybuildes. And this is the equation, which is to interpret. Nikki equation, which is to interpret this Nikk norm. So, again, here system operator now is not a boundary condition. And this P, little over projector, maps the function with narrow tool to divergent phase space. So this is sort of the standard formulation, and then this denominate term. And here the V U, so the U stands for the console input, the V is the control operator, depends on how it's formulated in a way. It's formulated in a way depending on how you like to introduce your contributions. I will briefly introduce what I did with another Stokes case and the result observed, and then I will pose the problem for the session. So when we look at this problem, Stokes flow, again, this pressure turn, this is the viscosity, and then divergence frame, normal component on the boundary there. Then the question is how are we able to introduce And the question is: how are we able to introduce our control? So, there, of course, naturally speaking, there are two ways. I stir through it in the interior of your domain, that is the internal control. However, motivated by the observation that moving walls accelerate mixing compared to the fixed walls boundary conditions, so we actually consider the Navier-Chief boundary control. So, why this phenomenon occurs? We think about But think about some of you may mix the flour with water, if you just stir in the interior of your container, you would realize very thick boundary layers along the wall of your container. So for this case, if you have a fixed wall with no slick boundary condition, then you may have separate stresses to stop mixing, go cross the boundary. The boundary. Now, if you assume you have a you are able to like rotate the wall, or sometimes you may want to stir along the boundary, that will kill sort of the boundary layers, or that will create flows of it along the boundary so that the mixing can be effective in the central regions. So, this motivates us to consider the boundary control. So, we're going to introduce our control along the boundary, but in a tangential direction. And also, we assume the fluid is able to slow. Assume the fluid is able to slide a boundary with the friction, so friction term. So essentially, by the way, this B stands for the deformation temperature, which is the average NAS transpose. And then tau is the along the individual average. So we control the boundary, and then through the boundary control, we can model with the velocity field and the stores of the. With the velocity field and the stores of advection term, hopefully we are able to control mixing procedure. So although the map from D to V is a fine, but due to advection, this essentially leads to a nonlinear or bilinear control problem. Then one may ask whether effective. So we did forward simulation. We simply assume that we have a unit disk as our domain. So initially we As our domain. So initially, we have again this binary fluids, yellow and blue. And then we simply impose velocity, the initial function for velocity zero. And then we assume boundary input just the g equals cosine phi times tau m m is the tau there. So we use the coordinate. So if the input is cosine, we observe there are two vertical vortices up here. And with this type of velocity field, we run We velocity field, we run it for a while when T is one hundred, we realize these two fluids are nicely mixed, and we look at the decay rate actually follow the polynomial decay. And then we said, well, what if we have a sign thing as a control input? If we sign thing now, we have two horizontal vertices sort of generated. However, when we apply this velocity field to a semi-true condition, it ends up being. Linear condition ends up it's nothing right when we ask what if we do a simple linear compilation can we get something well yes but it's not as good as the first one okay actually one of the sorry one of the reasons for for this case ends up mixing nothing is due to that the streamline of The streamline of the velocity field possibly coincides with the level state of the Briggs theta. So basically, if you look at transform equation, you have V-dot Bridge theta. So if this term equals zero, of course, nothing is going to change. So the velocity somehow has to be carefully chosen so that you do have this advection effect introduced to your LUG especially. How should I think of this physically as in stirring? As in stirring. You can either stir in or rotate your computer. Because in a lot of the microfluidic. What's the difference between the two? The cosine and the sine? How should I think of that physically? I actually don't know. Because normally when you turn on the mixer, the spatial profile is sort of determined. You cannot really actually control. I don't know how to interpret the spread design, maybe sort of. I don't know the person. I don't know how technically designed this design. The question naturally rise here is how can we control this? Well, how can we choose an optimal velocity? So we did the optimal control when I started looking at the problem, I did optimal control. So I like to ask, say for given final time, Given final time, can we find opportunity such that the mixed norm at t equals capital t is minimized and the subject is PT constraint and wants to make a panel? So this is sort of a standard formulation for the PD constraint optimization. Of course, to solve this problem, we have first to show that this problem is well posed in a sense for any initial condition, always find the G, the console input, such that, of course, the functional is finite. And then we show Is finite, and then we show how to choose this appropriate admissible set of controls such that you can get the existence of a control and then establish the mathematical conditions for solving such a control. So the procedure is rather standard, but the challenge actually has several aspects. First of all, there is a nonlinearity due to the vection term, so this is a nonlinear control problem, as I mentioned. Problem as I mentioned. As a result, this is a non-convex optimization problem. So the solution may not be unique. And the zero diffusivity in the transport equation actually causes very high regularity required for the velocity theoretical. Because once the first variation of the transport equation is well posed, then we need steta in H1. So if you would like to have stata in H1. Theta in H1, of course, the initial condition has to be in H1. And also, regularity required down the velocity field. And then this condition actually causes trouble when we design a boundary control. Because you really need a very high regularity imposed on the boundary condition. In fact, we need a time group to be imposed on the boundary input. As a consequence, the compatibility. As a consequence, the compatibility condition may come into play. So if the velocity field is very smooth, then you will require the boundary condition when t equals zero coincide with the initial condition where boundary. So basically you have additional constraint on your control, which is very unpleasant. So it's very important to choose the right state space where you do have impressive heat, yet it's not too strong because you can. It's not too strong. The compatibility condition is not needed. So, that was the challenge when we deal with this sort of semi-displayed system. Now, computationally, here, first of all, you need to choose appropriate numerical algorithm to make sure the mass is conserved, meaning compressible through the field. That's very important. Second, as I mentioned earlier, we really want the mixed norm, H1 prime norm decays, but meanwhile, the H1 norm of theta, or the greater theta, is going to blow up. So, you're going to encounter very, very small, like. Impact of very, very small scales and also large gradients appear in this procedure. So, those are something we have to be aware of when we construct a numeric algorithm. So, solving the optimal control problem, either use variation again quality or the algorithm can derive this optimic system. One has to solve the state's point forward in time and back the adjoint system backward in time and then capitalize the And then coupled with the optimal system, sorry, optimality conditions. Basically, the directional trace of the joint state of the velocity. So, deriving this optimal system is sort of standard, yet again, like I said, because the differentiability can be an issue. Deriving this is not directly done. We have to introduce certain approximating control. We have to add small efficiency back to the transport equation and then get the For the equation, and then get the optimatic system from the optimal approximating system, and then show the convergence. So, the procedure was a little bit tedious, but this is the optimal system. So, that's something we will solve numerically. And also, I showed the uniqueness. I don't say that in general, the uniqueness does not hold for non-convex problems. But for 2D, when you have large control weight, no one can show No one can show the uniqueness. So basically, when the control weight is large, it means your control is very expensive. And then that somehow causes this to a convex problem. However, we did the experiment in the case where you have a unique solution but not necessarily used to a good mixing. So, but theoretically, that's the condition. Now, how do we use? Now, how did we implement this Kato data? Of course, the Kanto integer is simple dimensional. We have to figure out a certain way to simplify the structure. But in real life, as I mentioned, if you turn on your mixer, the spatial profile is predetermined. So I assume the control input is the minimum compilation of the function in space P and time functioning in time. So normally you control is the strength of a mixer, right? And when turned down, when turned down, It right and when turned down, when turned off, like the air conditioners. So we assume the spatial info is pre script, the only console function in time, which is air tool. And numeric skin, we applied, so this numeric simulation premise done by Xiao Menzen from Central Michigan University. We use standard time quote fine element together with projection method to really make sure the bass is conserved and then backward the project. And then backward the differentiation order tuning time for solving soaps. And then the transport equation is a tricky part. So we use the Rampy Code that miscontinuous Garak method for solving it. And then together with some numeric optimization algorithm to actually solve this entire system. And I will just simply present the doubt, say what we have. See what we have. We actually tried several different basis functions for control input. We really like to have the irregular fluid field to really drive my scalar field. So we get pretty interesting results by taking the control input in the linear combination of constant function cosine sine and cosine 2 phase sine 2 phase. And then we observe. And then we observed the mixed norm decays in time follows a polynomial decay. Also, we did a feedback control for mixing. The feedback control design is sort of an approximation of the optimal control. So we get some optimal feedback until we also observe the polynomial decay. And this somehow coincides with the result when coincide with the result when regularity velocity is greater than s, sorry, greater than two. Normally one can only expect the polynomial decay. And in fact with optimal control the flow field is very smooth, right? Because infinity is bounded. So polynomial decay is really noble. But it's really difficult to analyze it, like to figure out polynomial decay. To figure out what long. We only observe this in early. So then I thought, okay, probably I should take one step back. Let's revisit the problem without the dynamics. So I come back to the original problem. Well, not original. The original problem I solved. So it's a transformed Cavalier's elliptic problem. Elliptic problem. And I don't really take this divergent free as a constraint because that's where it's reflected in the space, the state space I look at the problem. So essentially transport with looped. Then, if I use, I just use energy estimate, say I take an energy linear product of the transport equation with eta. With eta. So eta is the higher counter regarding part of theta. And then so H1, so you can get the H1, a prime number of theta, decay in time. So or if I think about the labor function of being one half of theta is normal squared. So I replace this term by eta. So basically right-hand side of negative weight dot version eta, inner product is eta. And I just apply it versus. And I just applied version bypass, use those formula and you can just get this term here. This V is divergence phrase, so V for the red projector act on the cell. So the red projectors therefore don't pull over the act on this term. So if you simply look at this term here and then the last term, then my question would be what would be the velocity in how the mixer, in other words, drive the drive. Mixing, in other words, drive the derivative to be negative. Well, the very naive choice is what if I just choose V, go to the opposite direction, right? Theoretically typically unique productive. I just have a V could be active, some function in time, a positive function, times this term. That will help me drive the mixed norm decay problem faster. Decay probably fast. Well, for the question you talk on, choose a C, the coefficient function. Again, naively, what if I just take the norm of this guy, negative norm, and then to the negative two power, then I'm very greedy I can somehow get a linear decorative. So if the right-hand side becomes negative one, I could expect the mixed norm somehow vanishes the final time, right? Okay. Now I give numerical simulation. Now I do numerical simulation. I use a different initial distribution. Actually, this really requires we have very fine mesh to observe this. You realize we really get a very chaotic mixing. And the detail rate here is really linear. Everything looks just fine. However, of course, at a certain point, we couldn't continue because the gradient theta is going to blow up, going to convert the approach to positive infinity. Configure infinity. So there is no way we actually are able to somehow capture entire process. But unfortunately, if I take the velocity squared, the coefficient t of this form, you see the velocities of this form, right? And then the denominator is going to blow up. Sorry, the velocity in time is going to blow up. So the question is, essentially he's asking, can we customize? Is asking, can we construct the velocity simply bounding time? And then you still get very nice mixing at the deterrent. Then we take a slightly different approach. If I'm going to do integration by paths one more time, I still take the inner product of my transport equation with eta. Now here I will look at the case where the mean value is zero for our scalar field. For you, for our scalar field, so now my space is essentially L02. So I can get rid of the identity operator in my negative equation so that the lap loss is still invertible. So if we revisit this term, I click integration bypass one more time, I get this structure. So this looks like nice, right? You look at great conversations, certain matrix. Certain matrix. And of course, here you see where this regularity kicks in. If you want right-hand side well closed, you do need the gradient value near the infinity, somehow it's bounded. So for 20 case, this base divergence rate, there's a matrix. This is a matrix. You have choice zero. So the right-hand side is not, or it's infinite fine. Then the question is Is Kanban construct, divergence free, and time, possibly time-dependent velocity, right? So with no penetrating boundary conditions, well, ideally, I would like to have big dependent edge, so I have a feedback loop, such that the right-hand side is non-negative, so you do have this effectivity, right? Or an even nicer, whether we can get a lambda key in non-negative. So possibly that leads to the m the the uh exponential decay, right? Exponential decay. So, this actually is from the PDE approach. Then, now I formulate this problem, need to discover the system Virgin has shown. Actually, when she did this in the conference in KO, I said, oh, I need to talk to Birget. How can we revisit this problem? Say maybe we can use some ideas from this DAE system. I'm going to derive this mixing problem into the top. Mixing problem into the cup system. So the coefficient is a degenerate matrix, operative matrix, and then A is of this form. I have A1, A2, A3, A4. So here, A4 is, oh sorry, since I'm looking at this space, I don't have any time is I for record. I don't have it. And then this A1 does the number of signatures, right? We need to receive. So this is an example that's shown the other day. Example of Briggs and show another day. Now, my question is here: can we somehow characterize the V for dissipation? And then can we somehow construct the B or characterize the B to get polynomial mixing, so the decay rate follows the polynomial? Okay? Or even like some exponential mixing. I think that that's my question for this type. For this type of problems, I'll come back to the slides. Now, there are also cases where one considers the diffusivity in the problem, right? So that's also very often encountering in real life because molecular very often does have the diffusion. Then, if I rewrite this problem into the coupler system, of course, here have a lot of plastic up here. And then this activity is straightforward. But here people, I mean in fluid community, they are interested in more understanding how advection enhanced diffusion. If one simply use L2 estimate, you basically don't see the advection term, right, because divergent free, and you only basically say the And you only basically say the diffusion due to like the pd equation. So they'd like to somehow establish a relation between this mixed norm and to figure out how a vection current can enhance diffusion. And in fact, there is a very nice result due to Peter Constantine publishing analysts they actually showed. I was also talking to a more person the other day. So if you have a Diffusion advection problem, I'm going to write it as which way. So I'm going to put some parameter gamma in front of my advection term. So here I simply get my diffusion term. So people are interested in how a direction would include diffusion. Well, we can think about it the direction term, this operator is a lower order. This operator is a lower order perturbation, right? So Laplace. And then you can either push the spectrum of Laplace towards the left-hand side or right-hand side. So yeah, I don't really have zero as my first eigenvalue. So this first eigenvalue, lambda one, this is strictly negative. Or a class when we're moment boundary condition, but the state space is L02. So the perturbation basically can either push the first item value to the left-hand side or right-hand side. The question is. The right hand side. The question is: what's the velocity for a direction turn? I'm able to just push this first item to the left-hand side. Then there is a sufficient and the lesser condition is defined only if in the case of gradient, this operator has no non-trivial eigenfunctions in H1. If this condition holds, then you can ask. This condition holds that you can actually increase the strength of your flow to push this eigenvalue as far to the left as you wish. So there are a lot of discussion on that. But analytically, they like to see how exactly this velocity sort of hunks the dispersion. So there is one paper I think is very interesting by those authors published in 2002. Authors published in Zimbabwe, they actually showed the precise connection between the negative software norm and how this enhanced this pressure occurs. But my personal interest is still sort of for the case where there's no diffusivity. And that's my question I raise for today. So I think this ends my talk. So I think this ends my talk. Lemila, if you have any questions, and then I will still go back to my other slides, because I thought the face is nice to spot. Okay, so that's my questions for our discussion.
