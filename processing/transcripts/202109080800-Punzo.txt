Coexistence for a class of non-linear reaction diffusion equations on Riemannian manifolds, an approach via Sobolev and Poincare inequalities. So all, I want to thank the organizers for the kind invitation. It's a great pleasure for me to participate in this workshop and to have this talk. Talk. I will discuss some recent results obtained in collaboration with Gabriele Grillo and Giulia Melioli from Politecnico di Milano concerning global existence and blow-up for a class of quasi-linear parabolic equations on Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we consider We consider no negative solutions to this Cauchy problem. Ut equals Laplacian of U to dm plus u to d p or d p and we have an initial condition u equal u zero at time zero. The differential equation is posed on a Riemannian manifold. We assume that this Riemannian manifold M is complete, non-compact. Is complete non-compact and that has infinite volume. Its dimension is greater or equal to three. The assumption of infinite volume is not essential, but it is the more interesting case. Concerning the parameter P and M, we assume that they are greater than one, and the initial datum U0 is non-negative and it belongs to LS. And it belongs to LM. We consider a non-negative initial data, so we also deal with non-negative solutions to this Cauchy problem. In this talk, I want to give a brief introduction to this kind of equation. I recall some related results in the literature. Then I state two results concerning. Two results concerning this problem, and I will give you an idea of the proof. So, this differential equation is a porous medium equation with a reaction term. So, the behavior of solutions is determined by two facts. We have the diffusive pattern associated with the porosum medium diffusion since we have Laplacian of U to D M, but we also have this real. But we also have this reaction term u to the p, and since it has a positive sign, it can cause blow-up of solutions. This problem has been studied in the literature in the case of the Euclidean space Rn with n greater or equal to 2. There are important works by There are important works by Galactionov and others, by Vasquetz. And suppose that the initial dedome is non-negative and with compact support, then it is known that if P is between 1 and M plus 2 over N, then for any non-trivial initial datum, we have fine time. Datum, we have fine-time blow-up. Indeed, also the limit case m plus 2 over n is included in this blow-up case under an extra specific hypothesis on the initial deduce zero. In the other case, when p is greater than m plus 2 over n, we have global existence of solutions if initial datum is. If the initial datum is sufficiently small in a suitable sense. Moreover, for any t greater than one, if the initial datum is large enough, then we always have finite time row up. Note that if we consider the linear diffusion, so m equal to 1, these results agree with the famous results by Fujita for the semi-linear parabolic program. The semi-linear parabolic rule. This problem has been also studied by Sachs in the case that the problem is posed in a bounded domain over n. In that case, of course, homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed. And he studied the case that P is between one. Case that P is between 1 and M, and the initial datum is in L1. And proved under this assumption that there exists a global in-time solution u. Moreover, such a solution satisfies this absolute estimate. So for any positive time, the L infinity norm of U is controlled by an absolute constant. times one plus one over m minus one t to some power the proof of sax exploits a sort of Aronson-Benilan estimate for this problem and an important ingredient of its argument is the finite measure of the domain omega. So note that So, note that for this reason, this method of sucks cannot be applied in our situation, since we are assuming that the Riemannian manifold has infinite volume. Moreover, our Cauchy problem has been studied on a special class of Riemannian manifolds when M is a When M is a Cartan-Adamach manifold, this means that M is a simply connected Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvators. And there are some results by Grillo, Muratori, and myself. And in that paper, it is assumed that rich curvature, a sectional curvature, satisfy sweetwall bounds, U0 is bound. your zero is bound at the compact resupport and the non-negative m and p are greater than one and it is proved that if p is greater than m then all sufficiently small data give rise to solutions existing globally in time for p greater than m again For p greater than m again, if we have sufficiently large initial data, then solutions blow up in finite time. The situation is different for P less than M and here we have two cases, in fact for P between one and M plus one over two. Plus one over two. In this case, all solutions exist globally in time. Moreover, we have blow-up in infinite time. And in the last case, when p is between m plus 1 over 2 and m, blow-up occurs in infinite time, but in this case, we have to assume that the solution is global. In fact, our existence In fact, our existence results have a gap. In that paper, we do not prove that we have global solution when P is between m plus 1 over 2 and m. So our goal now is to study global existence of solutions to the same Cauchy problem and we can We can study two different cases: P between one and m and p greater than m. Today I only discuss the case that p is between 1 and m and this is the most difficult case. And with respect to previous results, our aim is. Our aim is to get the global existence for every p between 1 and m. Moreover, we want to consider general manifolds, not only Carton-Derman manifolds. And also, we aiming at enlarge our class of initial data, not only abounded data, and indeed we will consider. Indeed, we will consider initial data in LM, and then we want to prove a smoothing effect in the sense that the solution becomes bounded for any positive time with an explicit quantitative bound on the L infinity norm of the solution. Our hypotheses are the following: we assume that Following, we assume that n is greater or equal to 3, p is between 1 and m, and u0 is in lm and is non-negative. Our main assumptions are two functional inequalities on the manifold. In particular, we assume that the Sobolev inequality holds and that also the Poincaré inequality holds more. Poincaré inequality also on the manifold. Observe that in the special case of Cartanadamar manifold, of course, Sobolev inequality holds. And furthermore, if we assume that the sectional curvatures are bounded from above by a negative constant, then also the Guanca Rein equality holds. We consider very weak solutions to our problem. To write the notion of solution, we only require that U belongs to L M and we assume that the differential equation is satisfied in the distributional sense. Now I can state our main global existence result. Global existence result. So, under the previous assumptions concerning M, P, and U0, we prove that there exists a global solution to the Cauchy problem. Moreover, the solution U belongs to L infinity of M cross tau capital T for every capital T bigger than tau. Moreover, we prove this smoothing. We prove this smoothing estimate. Note that for any positive time, the L infinity norm of U is controlled by some constants. We have this exponential term E C to T and then we have the L M norm of U zero to some power. So these are the main ingredients of this smoothing. Of this smoothing inequality. Moreover, if the initial w0 is also in some LQ, then we can prove this estimate. The LQ norm of UT is controlled by the exponential of CQT for some suitable constant CQ times the Ercu norm of U0. And And then I will come back on this constant sequence. Note that a priori, we cannot ensure that the solution is uniformly bounded in L infinity m cross zero plus infinity. Indeed, the solution can blow up as t goes to plus infinity. And at the end, I will explain this point. Now, I would like to give you an idea of the proof. It is given in several steps. First step, we make an extra assumption. We suppose that u0 is also bounded and consider the truncate function t k of s. Now, by means of this truncate function, By means of this truncate function, we introduce a suitable approximate problem. So we consider the Cauchy problem posed in our geodesic ball, Br, of radius R at centered at some point of the manifold. Instead of the power u to the p, we have the truncate t k of u to the p. truncate Tk of U to the P. And this problem has a unique solution. It can be proved by standard results. This solution is bounded in PR cross zero infinity. Of course, this solution depends on R and K, but we call it U for simplicity. Step two, by Two by means of the Poincaré inequality and by using our assumption that P is between one and m, we can prove this LQ-LQ estimate. So the LQ norm of U in Br is controlled by the LQ norm of U0 times the exponential of CQ times D for some constant C which depends on Q. Note that this constant Note that this constant does not depend on R and K, but CQ goes to plus infinity, SQ goes to plus infinity. So this inequality has some sense when Q is finite, but this is enough for our purposes. Step 3. We have the following Aronson-Benilan type STMA. This can be Estimate. This can be proved easily. So minus Laplacian of u to dm is less or equal to u to dt plus 1 over m minus 1 t u. Now we said for every fixed d, v equal to u to the m, f one equal to u to the p, and f two equal to the other term. Equal to the other term. So this Aronson-Beniland type estimate can be read as an elliptic problem. We have minus Laplacian of B less or equal to F1 plus F2 in the ball BR, and we have V equals zero on the boundary, since U is solution of the approximate problem and is zero on the boundary. Now we study this elliptic problem. Is a elliptic problem, and we prove an L infinity estimate for the solution B. So we have a Stampachia type estimate. There is only a little modification. I do not have time to go into details. There are many parameters, but the idea is the following: by this estimate, we obtain By this estimate, we obtain a bound on V, but V is u to the M, so we have a bound on the L infinity norm of U to the M. And we call it a modified Stampakia estimate since, but it is very little modification. Since in the right-hand side of this estimate, we do not have the measure of the domain. So we do not have the volume of BR as in the classical case. R as in the classical case. Instead of it, we have the L1 norm of B, so of U to the F. Moreover, we have L P norm of the source terms, so of F1 and of F2, but F1 and F2 are defined through some powers of U. So in the right hand side, we have some LS norm of U for certain S. For certain S. Now, look at this inequality. We have the L infinity norm of U to the M controlled by suitable LQ norm of U. But now we can use the LQ-LQ estimate we have seen before. So we have So we have an estimate of U to D M in terms of suitable LQ norm of initial d1. But after some computations, we obtain this L M L infinity estimate. And this is the smoothing estimate we had before. Here we have all Here we have all constants written explicitly. Note that in the right-hand side it appears only the lm norm of u0. So the assumption that u0 belongs to lm is essential for our argument. And just a comment on this. Comment on this smoothing inequality. Before I have to end the proof, so we have a family of solutions to approximate problem, but by standard methods, we can extract by this family of solutions sub-sequence and we obtain as We obtain as a limit the solution of our problem. And all estimates are stable under this passage to the limit. So the limit solution u satisfies the desired properties. And finally, we have assumed that u0 is bounded, but we can assume that u0 is in lm. In this case, we need another approach. In this case, we need another approximation. In fact, this is a standard tool. Instead of U0, we consider a suitable sequence of functions U0H in L infinity, such that U0H converges to U0 in Ln. We pass to the limit and we obtain the solution as a ball. Now, a comment on the smoothing estimate. Note that in the right-hand side, we have a side, we have a term, the exponential one, which goes to plus infinity, s t goes to plus infinity. This is the reason since we cannot say that the solution u is uniformly bounded in zero infinity. So a question naturally arises and is there actually blow-up in infinite time and the answer is yes at most on special men. At most on special manifolds. We are able to prove it on special manifolds. In fact, this is the other result. This is GoAP. Let M be a cart and a mark manifold and assume that the radial Richie curvature is bounded from below and that the sectional curvature is bounded from above by a negative constant. And suppose that the U0 is in Lm and is large enough. Is large enough. I can be more precise about the condition U0, but just in a moment. Under this assumption, then there exists a global in-time solution and this solution blows up at s t goes to plus infinity for every x in m. How to prove this result? How to prove this result? So, the existence part is contained in the previous result, since under these assumptions, both the Sobolev and Bonker inequalities hold. So, by the previous theorem, we have the existence of a global in-time solution. Moreover, under the hypothesis on the initial data, on the Richie curvature, and on the sectional curvature, we can apply some results. Can apply some results proved by Grill, Lomoratori, and myself. And we proved that under these conditions, the right-hand side of this inequality is a sub-solution of the problem if alpha, beta are suitably chosen and C is big enough. Here, R denotes the geodesic distance. The geodesic distance of X from a pole on the manifold. So this right-hand side is a subsolution. We have comparison principle. So if u at time zero is bigger than this subsolution, this inequality also for every positive time. So we have this inequality. And from this inequality, easily follows that we Folllows that we have a blow-up of the solution u as t equals to plus infinity for every x in the metric. And I have finished. Thank you for the attention. Thank you, Fabio, for the nice talk. So I see that there is a question in the chat. The in the chat by Daniele Castorina. So, Daniela, if you want to speak up, that's fine. Or do you prefer me to read? Hi, everybody. Sorry for the disturb and it's good to see everybody. Okay, well, at least online. Okay, I want to thank Fabio for the very nice talk, and I had a very naive question, if I can. I'm interested in the semi-linear regime when M goes to one. When m goes to 1. So imagine p greater than m greater than 1. Do these very nice estimates explode or lose, how do you say, significance as m goes to 1? No, no, they they hold also for when When m is one, the result can be proved. The same type of estimates can be proved, but by other methods. Okay. In this case, you have one over n minus one, so it is not possible. But by other methods, you can prove it is easier in some sense, the case. But they can be proved. But in that case, no. But in that case, no, just a model. But if P is greater than 1 and M is 1, if P is less than 1, I don't know. In this case, P is less than M. I'm interested in P greater than 1 and M. Okay, no, in that case, the same type of estimates can be proved by other minutes, but P is greater than 1. Is greater than one for p less than one. I don't know. Okay, okay. Thanks a lot, Fabio. And bye to everybody. Thanks. So is there any other question? Yeah, just me. Yeah, yeah. Hi, Fabio. How are you doing? So I have just a naive question, Fabio. Do you think that there is any chance? There is any chance to generalize this result if we replace the Laplacian with a non-local operator like the fractional Laplacian? It is a good question. From a general viewpoint, I think that similar results should hold. Concerning the methods, Middles, uh, I think that at some points local aspects are even used, but probably it is only a technical problem. But from a general viewpoint, I think that similar result should hold.
