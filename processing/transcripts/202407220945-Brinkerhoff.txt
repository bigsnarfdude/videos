We have Josh to talk about the sustainable energy system for remote communities. Thanks, Whitney. All right. Good morning, everyone. Thanks again for this opportunity to participate in the summer school. I'll introduce myself in case some of you weren't here last week. I'm Joshua Brinkerhoff. I'm a faculty member in the Faculty of Applied Science in the School of Engineering here on this campus, UBC Okanagan campus. And I was This and I was uh here. I remember um many of your faces, and I probably can get about three or four of your names, a few of you, um, earlier last week. And I was I enjoyed the interactions talking about meteorology and especially wind forecasting and those kinds of conversations last week. And I'm trying to participate in the summer school as much as possible while at the same time juggling my actual job. Juggling my actual job. And this is the problem of not going away, right? If I was away, then I could focus on the summer school completely. But as it is, I'm trying to divide my time as much as possible. The content of the summer school has been really invigorating for me, and I've learned a lot. And I'm an engineer who is trying to apply my research expertise and research knowledge to the various questions around. Various questions around renewable energy. But really, I'm not an expert in a lot of the meteorological processes that we talked about last week or a lot of the optimization and other things that are relevant to renewable energy that I understand are being discussed this week. And so extreme values and optimization and all of those things are really outside of my wheelhouse. But what I hope to be able to deliver in my lecture today and tomorrow. In my lecture today and tomorrow, and then also some exercises, is a kind of run-of-the-mill, rudimentary-level engineering analysis for renewable energy systems in the context of applying them to remote communities. And I hope it's informative and useful. But if I'm pitching it at the wrong level, please let me know and I'll see what I can do to improve the delivery and make it more relevant and meaningful. This is based off of a course that I taught for a number of years. That I taught for a number of years at the fourth year engineering level, which is a kind of survey course of sustainable energy systems for kind of, it's not for remote, remote communities, but it's sustainable energy systems. And then we did a project in that course where they applied all the topics that we looked at. Is there a question? Is there a question in the Zoom? Is there a question in the Zoom? Yeah. I think we have some. Just me and Punk. Thank you. Thanks, Leanne. Fantastic. All right. So maybe to start off, I'll just give a little bit of a discussion about what I mean by remote community. I provided in the OneDrive a link to an interactive map. To an interactive map that is a database containing about 358 communities in Canada that are not connected to the North American electricity grid. 117 of these are First Nations or Indigenous communities and 51 are Inuit communities. The rest are other remote communities. Some of them are towns. Others may be power installations that are not connected, but are associated, for example, with a mine site or another facility. With a mine site or another facility like that. The population of these communities is dominated by small communities. This is a histogram of population based off of the data available from 2018. And you'll see there's some larger ones. Whitehorse and Yellowknife are two of the larger ones, where the population in those communities is on the 20,000 plus. Those are territorial capitals, and curiously, Capitals, and curiously, they're not connected to our North American electricity grid. So, if you go there, you feel like you're in a normal city. However, the electricity being produced is being produced through diesel generators or other electricity systems, but they're not connected to the rest of North America electricity network. So, largely small cities is what I'm saying. The other one is largely small. Is largely small energy systems as well. This is a histogram of energy systems in terms of the megawatt hours of production in a year in 2018. And the number of communities that fall into the small bin is quite substantial. There are a number of communities that fall into the large bin, and these are the yellow knives, the white horses, and the other communities like that. But overall, the remote communities are spatially dispersed. Spatially dispersed, remote, disconnected from the electricity grid. That's the point. Many of them are also disconnected from the natural gas network. And so, if you want to replace diesel generators with natural gas technologies, that's also generally not a viable option because they're not connected to the natural gas network. And shipping natural gas is much more difficult because it's a gas than shipping diesel because you can't get a good volumetric energy density. Can't get a good volumetric energy density of the gaseous fuel relative to the diesel fuel. And so, generally, like shipping natural gas far from a location on a pipeline network is generally hard. And then the other comment that we'll make is that the orange dots represent systems that run on diesel. And you'll see the vast majority of systems are diesel. Some blue dots are hydro systems that are standalone, right? So you have a community that has a community hydropower system, but Community hydropower system, but it's not feeding into the rest of the electricity network. It's feeding into that community or a cluster of small communities. Yes, sir. So, what I wondered is, so in terms of the population, you mentioned two areas with a comparatively high population. Yeah. Like, when compared with others, right? So, they're kind of outliers in the setting. Certainly. So, I was wondering why did you include Why did you include them? I think that was. Sure. So this is the NRCAN database, and I have a link to it in the OneDrive. And it actually is a GIS system. So you can look around and identify the different components and the information associated with the different pieces. So the slide that I presented, I just provided information of I just provided information of all of the communities. Yeah. And if you want to think about a remote community, we may think of remote communities as being small communities disconnected from the electricity grid, and that's generally true, but there are some outliers, right? And White Horse and Yellowknife are two outliers where they are remote in that they're disconnected from the electricity grid, they're off-grid, but they're not small. And so if you wanted to, just from If you wanted to, just from a national level, reduce the emissions associated with remote communities, maybe you don't do anything for all 358 communities. You only focus on Yellowknife and Whitehorse. And that's where your emissions intensity reduction is going to be the greatest, right? Because they're the largest producers. And it may be that the hassle of decarbonizing all of these remote communities is not worth it because they're just a tiny little puff in the atmosphere in comparison to the two large ones. In comparison to the two large ones, Whitehorse and Yellowknife. But I don't actually remember if Whitehorse and Yellowknife are diesel generation, diesel systems. But you can see, right? So if you click on this one, Whitehorse, it is, in fact, doesn't tell us. And also, white horses and yellow light are more likely to. Are more likely to grow in population at a faster rate compared to others in the future, right? That's a fair guess. Yeah, that's a fair guess. Yeah. All right. So the way that I use this information in the context of my course was to run my course at a kind of basic level where I provide an overview of sustainable energy systems and enough information so that you can look at a community. Information so that you can look at a community and assess: is this sustainable energy system at all viable for this community? And that was basically what I'm going to do today and tomorrow. Enough information that you can assess at a very coarse-grained analysis. Am I crazy to consider this energy system for this community? And so, it's enough information, very basic information for you to just basically give a yes or a no. Is it crazy or not crazy? It's not enough for you to. Or not crazy. It's not enough for you to go into great detail, optimize, et cetera, but it does provide a kind of basis for even thinking about it. All right. And so I'll give an example of what the students did with this information in a prior course. So this is a presentation that students did. This is probably around 2017. And they chose a remote community in BC called Hartley Bay. And it's home of the Gitva Nation. It's 600 kilometers north of Vancouver. It's 600 kilometers north of Vancouver. It's right on the coast. You see, it's highly mountainous, very spatially remote. It's a very beautiful environment, and it has a relatively small population. This probably is out-of-date information. This is likely around 2010 data. But these small communities don't generally grow very abruptly. So it's a good picture of what they're looking at. And the students looked at the annual power production in the year and how it's being produced. They have three generations. It's being produced. They have three generators. The efficiency on average of these systems, the costs for running these systems, and the cost is highly variable, likely, especially in terms of time. The data that they got this from is relatively dated, probably from 2010. The waste heat, which they can estimate from the efficiency of the systems, and then the corresponding CO2 emissions, which they get based off of the consumption of the fuel. They also have. The fuel. They also had information about the availability factor, which I don't think is highly reliable. It's hard to get, oftentimes, good data information from these communities because the management of these communities is not uniform. Every community does not manage it necessarily in a uniform way. I have a question about the efficiency. Can you explain more what you mean by the efficiency? Yes. Efficiency of the generator is. Of the generators, the generators usually have an efficiency of between 60 to 70 percent. The answer is yes, it is the efficiency of the generation system. So, in their case, they have diesel and what they want is electricity. So, they put the diesel into a diesel engine that has a certain efficiency. That diesel engine powers an electrical generator with a certain efficiency, and then the output electricity is what you get. Electricity is what you get. And so, from here to here, on average, it's about 40%. So, the energy that you put in in terms of the energy content of the fuel and the energy that you get out in terms of the electricity that you produce is about 40%. And I'll talk about that a little bit more. That's an important question. Thank you. And then, sorry, two other questions here. Are those large? Like, in terms of generation size, is that a fairly small generator? Or are those generators almost like? Are they how do they compare to other generator sizes? In terms of their capacity, rated capacity. Yeah, not very big. Not very, okay. Yeah, not very big in the kilowatts. But they only have 150,000 people. But exactly. So they don't produce much power, but the demand is not very high. And then what's your definition for availability back? To be frank, I forgot. So I'll get to it later in the slide. To it later in the slide, 14% of the time it's available, or it's um or is it okay? I don't want to give you the wrong answer. I'll have to have a have a look at it, but it has to do with the I don't want to give you the wrong answer. It's a non-dimensional keeper. Do you know what I'm talking about, Vini? Maybe I'll just wait until we get there. All right, so they looked, then these students looked at different alternatives. So they looked at natural gas. Alternatives. So they looked at natural gas. The efficiency is a bit better, so they get some savings. The fuel is cheaper, so they get some savings. I don't remember whether they accounted for the cost of getting the gas there, probably not. Then they looked at the amount of waste heat, which is less because it's more efficient, the emissions, which is less because it's much cleaner to burn natural gas generally than diesel, and then the cost for the installation on a per kilowatt basis. And this is an example of what a combined power plant could look like. So this is with the gas. Combined power plant could look like. So, this is with a gas turbine engine. They looked at all the other alternatives, right? Geothermal, what is the improvement in efficiency? What would be the costs for installing and whether or not there's a good resource there? So, their community is located right here, and they saw that actually the resource is not so bad in terms of the downhole temperatures. The nitrogen gas is only 200,000 control when I bring this slide. I think so because it's on a pretty I think so because it's on a per kilowatt basis, but that maybe that's a anyway. This is from this, this is from the students. So, whether they made a mistake or not, I'm not sure. So, there we go. I think maybe this was the two different costs. I can't remember. Anyways, then they looked at title, it's on the coast, and so they looked at would a barrage system work? They looked at They looked at run of river systems, would that be suitable? And they eventually, I think, decided that there would be, the cost would be too high and the environmental impacts would be substantial. And so they abandoned that idea. And then they looked at wind and estimated what that cost would be and what the production would be and what the availability would be in terms of the production. They also did solar. I think the agreement was. I think the agreement was that it wasn't very alternative. And then they assessed all of these different ones on different criteria, right? They wanted to achieve a 75% reduction in CO2 emissions. They wanted the capital costs to be less than the 10-year operating costs of the existing system. That was a constraint that I put on them. And the other constraint was the annual operational costs need to be equal to or less than the existing diesel system. And so that was the criteria upon which they made their assessment. That was the criteria upon which they made their assessment. And the final selection was a combination of wind turbines and a combined cycle gas turbine. And the gas turbine was there for periods when the wind is not sufficient to produce. And there's probably a lot of holes in their analysis, right? Like not considering how will the natural gas get there and so forth. But maybe you get the idea. The idea was that they learned a little bit about a lot. They learned a little bit about a lot of different energy systems and then applied that knowledge to a particular community. And so, what I did in terms of my lectures for the summer school, where am I, is, and this already has begun in some of my conversations with you last week, is I've provided you information for the NRCAN database. The NRCAN database for remote communities. And some of you have landed on an idea for your project for the core, for the summer school, of looking at implementing a renewable energy system for some of the remote communities that I provided. And that's a great idea. So that's kind of how I had envisioned. So I've included in my OneNote, in my folder, in the OneNote files for the summer school. Summer school, a sample exercise. And the exercise includes information that, if you were to design a sustainable energy system for a remote community, the kinds of things that you might want to think about. So if it's a wind system or a solar system or a biomass-based system or a geothermal system, what are the things that you would want to consider? And that's available within the Within the it's called exerc it's a exercise and it's available within the where am I within this one drive for the summer school so under my name within exercise then I've included this document there so that if you look at it and you do want to do something aligned with sustainable energy Aligned with a sustainable energy system for a remote community, you can think about the things that you might want to consider, right? The energy system achieving reduction in CO2 emissions, cost considerations, operational cost considerations, and other relevant information, right? The electricity output, is it adequate? And then more specific things specific to other communities. So if you want to do a June If you want to do a geothermal system, considering the different resources and types of geothermal systems, if it's a hydro-based system, information around, well, what's the water body that you're going to be used? What's the source of water that you're going to have? Or the type of turbo machine that you want to use for your application, or the amount of power that can be available, demonstrating that from available heads or flow rates or wave amplitudes, etc. Some information. And some information that might be relevant in terms of the water office water data. And then the same thing for wind and for solar, relevant information that you might want to consider that would be relevant to a design of a sustainable energy system for a remote community. So then for the rest of today and tomorrow's lecture, I wanted to jump into, let's just call it a very surface level description of how different sustainable energy. Of how different sustainable energy systems work. And I did remember from our introductions that some of us have engineering backgrounds, others have math, physics backgrounds. And so I'm presenting it kind of at the very novice level. And if this is knowledge that you already know and everyone is just dying of boredom, let me know and we can move more quickly. But I wanted to make sure that we're all on the same page because if we're talking about renewable energy and we don't understand some basic things about Some basic things about photovoltaic electricity systems or wind or what have you, then I think it's good for us to be all on the same base. All right, does that sound good? Does that make sense? Perfect. Perfect. Very good. Okay. So the first thing that we want to think about is if all of these communities are using fossil fuels, remote communities, or the bulk of them are, it's important that we have a clear understanding of fossil fuels and how we get the energy out of fossil fuels. The energy out of fossil fuels. So, we have different kinds of fossil fuels, and the energy content is different. And, of course, getting the energy out generally involves a combustion reaction, and that releases heat. And of course, there's also carbon dioxide that's emitted as a result of that reaction. And so, the important things that we need to consider is the amount of content of energy we have in the fuel, the amount of heat it produces when we combust it and get it out, and the amount of CO2 that's produced. Amount of CO2 that's produced. And then we can do convenient things, like what's the CO2 emissions per unit of energy? Because that's a convenient way of measuring things. But to do that, we need to make sure that we're careful. And a lot of students maybe there's some nuances that are not fully appreciated. One of the things that, I don't know, maybe it's just us dumb engineers make mistakes with is the we forget that a watt hour. We forget that a watt hour is not a unit of power. Because it has the word watt in it, we get confused. And we think watt hour as a unit of power, but it's not. It's a unit of energy, right? A megawatt hour is a megawatt being produced over one hour. So it's a mega joule per second times 3,600 seconds, which is 3,600 megajoules. So that's maybe this is way too basic for everybody here, but the students in my class, maybe we're especially dense, make this mistake a lot. Dense make this mistake a lot. So, this is an important one to keep in mind: a megawatt hour, a kilowatt hour, it's a unit of energy, and it has the equivalent of 3,600 times whatever the times the hour is. All right. Then to get the emissions of a certain fossil fuel, we need to consider the reaction of the fossil fuel. And it's not quite as simple as this, but I'm dumbing it down a lot, just to be very, very basic. Knowing what the mode is Knowing what the molar ratio is between the fuel and the CO2, and knowing what the molecular mass of the fuel and the CO2 is, we can calculate the amount of energy released per mass of CO2 if we know the heating value of the fuel. The heating value could be a higher or a lower heating value, depending on what you do with the vapor that's produced, if it's condensed or not. And the heating value Not. And the heating values you'll get with different types of gasoline and diesel and so forth will be very different, slightly different and it's variable depending on the composition. There's low sulfur and other types of things. I'm choosing kind of representative values. If you want to get something more specific, you can look up specific properties of specific types of fuel. All right, plugging in my energy per unit mass of methane. Mass of methane multiplying by my molar ratio, which is in this case one, one mole of or one kilomole of methane producing one kilomole of CO2, and then multiplying that by the molar mass of the gases, what you'll see is the kilograms of CH4 cancels with the kilograms of CH4 here. Kilomoles of CO2 cancels with kilomoles of CO2, kilomoles of CH4 cancels with kilomoles of CH4. Of CH, four cancels with kilomoles of CH, or the only thing we're left with here is mega joules and kilograms. This unit analysis is what I do all the time to make sure I didn't make a mistake. And what we end up with is this value gives us for methane about 20.2 megajoules of CO2, excuse me, 20.2 megajoules of energy is released per kilogram of CO2 emitted. Kilogram of CO2 emitted. Or maybe a more accurate way of saying it is methane has 20.2 megajoules of energy content per kilogram of CO2 released if it's combusted in a combustor, okay, based off of the reaction. And that's a very rudimentary analysis because it doesn't have anything to do with the completeness of the reaction. And, you know, this is assuming a perfect stoichiometric ratio of. Perfect stoichiometric ratio of fuel to air, et cetera. But it does give us a rudimentary basis for comparing the fuels themselves, not considering the technology required to convert the fuel into electricity. All right, one can do the exact same analysis for other fossil fuels. And when you're dealing with liquid fuels, you also have to keep in mind that we don't. You also have to keep in mind that we don't use mass generally as a measure for the quantity of a liquid. It's more convenient to use volume. And so then the mass to volume conversion based on the density is required. And so this is important to keep in mind because we want to make sure that we're comparing apples to apples if we're evaluating emissions reductions associated with different technologies. Then, Then, can you remind me what your name is? Yes, Marian. Mariam. Thank you. The question that Miriam had a few minutes ago around efficiency of the electricity system also comes into play because the emissions that we get from a certain fuel source must take into account the efficiency of converting that internal energy in the fuel to a useful electrical energy. To a useful electrical energy. And so, in this case, the emissions for diesel would be the mega joules of electricity produced by your diesel generator, divided by the generator efficiency. And then you have to divide that number by the what we call this carbon dioxide emissions intensity for that fuel. All right, and so this is the same calculation that was done. Calculation that was done here, but with the numbers associated with diesel rather than with methane. All right. Now, this might be so basic because it's kind of high school level, but it is important that we are careful with the way that we're comparing emissions. And really, one needs to be more careful that I've shown, right? There's a lot more intricacy here that we should be careful about. But for a run-of-the-mill analysis. But for a run-of-the-mill analysis of different production systems and just doing a first-off-the-glance look for a specific community, this probably is sufficient. Any questions about what we've looked at already? Where exactly did the efficiency cost in the previous when we screened it? Yeah, so I didn't make a calculation here, but this. Calculation here, but this generator efficiency would come from the known information of the specific generator that you're using. Yeah. And the diesel, the electrical generators are quite efficient. The diesel engines are less so. And if we multiply their efficiency, generally for a diesel system, that number around 40% is good. Yeah. If you're using Yeah. If you see that your community has a very old system, then it could be that the efficiency is worse. So, Ada is the diesel any electricity. The total electrical generation efficiency. Yeah. So, if you want to break it down, you could break it down into a whole bunch of different components, but one would be the diesel engine and the electrical generator. And there would be the product of those two. Yes? A general question on channels. A general question. I'm trying to understand why specifically remotes. Like, if you're just considering renewable energy sources, wouldn't it be the same for remote and non-remotion communities? Yeah, that's an excellent question. The question is, why are we looking at this and then applying it to remote communities? And really, the way that we apply the topic of alternative energy systems is somewhat. Energy systems is somewhat, it doesn't matter whether it's a community that's far away or a community that's local. And in many respects, communities that are already a part of electricity grid will be much, much easier, right? Because the electrical infrastructure is already available to connect that community with. And maybe there's other, the availability, the ability to bring stuff there, right, is easier. The reason why I chose. The reason why I chose remote communities is mostly because of the social impacts of the lack of electricity or a lack of energy has on life in these remote communities. That was my motivation, right? If we look at the effects of climate change are disproportionately felt by many of the people in these remote communities, right? And they're the ones that have contributed, in a sense. And they're the ones that have contributed, in a sense, the least among Canadians because of the small amount of energy footprint they have. And that's being felt by people who are already historically marginalized, First Nations communities and Inuit communities. And the fact that these are remote makes it a little bit, helps us to be a bit more creative insofar as the constraints are a little bit tight. Insofar as the constraints are a little bit tighter, one could argue, right? We're looking at communities where getting something there requires either driving over ice roads, which are available only at certain times of the year, or flying in an airplane, right? A lot of the diesel used in these remote communities is literally shipped on airplanes or via ice routes, right? So there's no like mathematical reason why this should be applied to remote humidities, but there is tremendous soil. But there is tremendous social and political reasons to do so. Yes. Denise? I was wondering, what is the feel-to-contribution of remote communities to the field of field emissions of Canada? I mean, would they have large CO2? No, I don't think so. I don't think it's substantial. But over the Reducing their CO2 emissions is not going to make a huge impact on global warming or things that we need to do to reduce Canada's CO2 emissions. So, what should be the primary objective then in order to improve their livelihood? Yeah. I'm reluctant to speak on behalf of people who I haven't lived any of their life experience. But from my outside perspective, what I have gleaned in my conversations with these community people in these communities is that their impact is small, but they care about that impact a lot. And even though it's not going to make much of a dent, it's Make much of a dent. It's their dent, or it's our dent, that they want to diminish. And they are not happy that our community is producing these emissions when it might not be necessary. And then, of course, the other reason is for cost. If there's a way in which the electricity could be produced at a lower cost, that would allow for a lot of other benefits, social and economic benefits. Yes? Think about Denise. I'm guessing that. Oh, Denise, I'm guessing that these communities they in the grand scheme their emissions are low, yes, but per capita it's probably higher. That's a good point, yeah. That's a question. That's very important point, yeah. Yeah, it was the same question. It's per capita. You said energy footprint is small, but you know, per capita because they're using efficiency. Yes, yeah, because they're using old systems that are inefficient. Exactly. I will propose to like the view of this. I would propose to like view this question in a longer time feel like so far they're not making much of a big difference because their population size is quite small. But I wouldn't hope they maintain this size for a long time. So in the future, they may grow and why not just do the transition now instead of do the transition then? Another good argument. Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of good arguments. And yeah. Yeah. Some of the students that were involved in this exercise, we ran this exercise over about four years. Some of them really became quite passionate about the needs that are being experienced by people living in remote communities, especially Indigenous First Nations. And it helped them guide their selection of career. them guide their selection of career. And, you know, some of them are now in the kind of engineering advocate type of career. And it's quite, it's nice. It allows for students to explore and express some of some things that they're passionate about. And I see that there's some questions on the chat. Let me just look. Okay, no, just noise. All right, let's jump into looking at some of these systems. Geothermal. Geothermal is essentially taking advantage of the heat flux that's available within the Earth and harnessing that energy. So when we look at the total power flux within the Earth, it's about on the order of 40 terawatts. The world power consumption, this was from probably. This was from probably around 2016, so it's out of date now, but with something on the order of 20 terawatts. So there's a lot of energy being transferred from the center of the Earth to the outside. The problem is it results in a very low temperature when you get near to the crust of the Earth. And in my course, we talk about exergy or availability. Has anyone studied exergy or availability? Has anyone studied exergy or availability before? A few, right? It's often taught in a fourth-year thermodynamics class. Exergy, the concept of exergy, is not just the content of the energy, but how available is it to get out. So if you imagine a cup of hot water, or even better, a pressure vessel of high-temperature steam compared to Okanagan Lake, how much energy is of energy? How much energy is in Okanagan Lake? If you imagine the, like, if you were to heat it up from the temperature it was in the summer, in the winter, to the temperature it is now. Tons of energy. But what can you do with that energy? Very little. It's not in a form that's readily available to us. As compared to a pressure vessel of high temperature steam, we can use it to generate electricity through a turbine. And so that's a concept that we use. And it can be defined using the That we use, and it could be defined using the thermal second law of thermodynamics exergy. So, this is the challenge with geothermal systems: the energy flux is high, but the temperature is low. And so it's very, very low availability or low exergy. And most of it, of course, is dissipated in the ocean. So, the solution then is, well, let's drill down so we can get a little bit closer access to those high temperatures. And the depths we're talking about are generally in the thousands of meters. Are generally in the thousands of meters. And of course, the availability of geothermal energy aligns with the seismic activity because you're going to have more flux of energy where you have these boundaries between tectonic plates, which means Western Canada actually has a relatively good resource of geothermal. And that's what we see when we look at geothermal potential within Canada. However, However, there's a, when you look into the kind of energy space, what you see is a disconnect oftentimes between geothermal as an energy source for producing electricity and geothermal exchange used for building heating and cooling, which could also, I suppose, be used for generating electricity, but at a very small scale. So, this campus actually has a geothermal exchange and it uses it for And it uses it for heating some of the buildings. And that basically means you're using the temperature differential between the ground and the air to cool your building in the summer or heat your building in the winter. And that's, I suppose, similar to this, but not the same thing. What we're talking about here is accessing hot temperatures down deep in the ground and then using that heat to generate electricity. What, six kilometers? What six kilometers? It's geothermal at six and a half kilometers. Yeah, yeah. And if one was to overlay depleted or orphaned oil wells, you see a lot of depleted and orphaned oil wells in BC, at least in the northeastern part, Peace River area, simultaneously where there's a reasonably good geothermal resource. And so, you know, one of the projects, one of my So, one of the projects one of my PhD students is working on is: could we develop technology that doesn't require drilling a new well, but can use an existing well that's been decommissioned from whatever oil or gas exploration that is being used. How deep are those wells? Are they also five? Yeah, in that range. Yeah. We have a driller here. Yeah. What's a typical well depth you see for oil over gas? UC3 oil or gas. It's all depends on the formation you're going after in the northeastern BC or in the north of Belgrade. I don't know off the top of my head. There is anywhere from like three to six to six kilometers. Yeah. And there was another question. If you're going after oil, at least if you're going after oil higher up or lower down. Forget it. Higher or lower. Okay. It's all over the place, everywhere. Yeah, it's all over the place. I can appreciate that. Yeah. And of course, when you're looking at a resource. When you're looking at a resource, you have to go where that resource is. In the case of geothermal, it may be that some used wells are at an appropriate depth that could be considered for harvesting some of that available geothermal energy. I remember southern Alberta is not really suitable, right? It doesn't seem to be based off of what this plot shows. There is something in the blacklist. There's some wrong formulation that just you can't make it unliable. Yeah. Was there another question over the side? Yeah, you're in. Thanks. It's a major fraction location use V sale. Robert, I don't quite understand the question. Could you maybe come off of mute? Yeah, I was just, can you hear me okay? Yes. Yeah, I was just, I was struck by the. Yeah, I was just struck by the northern BC map because there's obviously very good fracking, very good geothermal potential. But I just also know that a lot of natural gas extraction via fracking is in abundance in that same region. It's just, it gets to the paradoxical question of utilization of the available resource versus potential sale on the open market. For example, you can extract the Example, you can extract the natural gas and sell it, whereas geothermal is more localized. Yeah, but very good point, Robert. For me to comment a lot more on this would be speaking out of the side of my mouth because I'm not really an expert in the gas side or, for that matter, on the geothermal side. I can tell you that there are no geothermal plants at the utility scale used in BC or in the Northern Territories, despite the fact that there could be, you know. Despite the fact that there could be a reasonably adequate resource in those locations. And why that is, I'm not sure. But my theory is that BC is not motivated, despite having a good geothermal resource, to generate geothermal energy because the electricity grid is already quite clean, being mostly driven by hydro. And so that's a factor. The other factor is, I think the location of the high geothermal resource. The location of the high geothermal resource is not necessarily located near population centers or electricity distribution networks. That being said, the Kootenays down here in the southern part of BC looks like a reasonably good resource. And there are electricity distribution networks that go through there and some population centers. There's a number of small communities. They're not very big. They're all a bunch of pot smokers, but they're beautiful. It's a different thermal. It's a different thermal, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's a great motorcycling and mountain and skiing, and everything else. And on that map, sorry, can you just point out where like, say, Edmonton or something is. I think something like right here where my cursor is. Okay, there you go. So higher. Thanks. What's this large lake here? Is that Athabasca Lake? I'm not sure. That's pretty close to Granada Port of. Yeah, yeah. So, where my cursor is about where I've been doing. Okay, so up and up and up. Yeah. Yeah. One forgets how big Canada is when you go north. So I, two summers ago, I rode my motorcycle from Kelowna to Whitehorse, and it took me four days of hard riding. And I stopped at a bunch of provincial parks in northern BC. And then in the provincial parks, they provide information about parks, the parks in Canada. Parks, the parks in Canada and the parks in Northern BC. And the land area associated with provincial parks only in Northern BC exceeds the land area of all of California or something like that. Huge. And we're used to looking at maps like this, but then, of course, we have to remember that this scale gets shrinked depending on your projection. Depending on your projections. But this scale is still accurate. Anyways, it's yeah, remote. When we say remote communities, it's really truly remote in Canada. All right. That's a bit of an assignment. No, it's the project. You gotta cancel it out. Yeah, that's right. All right. So typically, this is what I do. Typically, this is what a geothermal installation would look like. And this is how they're used in Iceland and in New Zealand and in some places in California, where geothermal is used on a utility scale. So you have this insulating sedimentary rock above a porous geothermal resource, and then your power plant uses steam directly or another binary fluid that's heated by the steam. And depending on the And depending on the nature of the steam or the resource that you get coming out of the geothermal well, you'll use different types of technology. So, dry steam would be at a high temperature and you, as the steam comes out of it, you'll have flashing. And so, what you get coming out of your geothermal well is truly dry steam, like high, it's saturated or superheated, so there's no liquid present. You might get liquid water, so it's at high temperature. Liquid water, so it's at high temperature and it's pressurized, and so it's at a liquid state. Or it may be that you just get lower temperature water, but it's pressurized. And so you can flash it to, if you need to, below atmospheric pressure to produce steam and then pass that through turbines. So then the heat loss generally in wells is not substantial. So we often imagine the process of getting the fluid from the bottom. Fluid from the bottom of your well to the top as being relatively constant enthalpy, isenthalpic. So, no very little heat is lost in like heat to the heat transfer to the surroundings. So, then if you look at a plot of this is pressure of the fluid to specific volume, or if you like inverse density, you'll have dry steam process kind of following this process where down in the hole, it's in liquid state, but then In liquid state, but then as you bring that steam down to the surface, it decompresses and it comes out as dry steam, some fraction of liquid, or geopressurized hot water. The ability to get work out of that resource decreases. We like this dry steam the best, and it goes down as we look at this geopressurized water. It's not so good to get, you know, warmish or hot, but liquid water, it's harder. Liquid water, it's harder. The availability of energy is lower, the exergy is lower. All right, this is hot rock. You can also use hot, dry rock. There's no water in the rock, but you can use the heat content of that rock if you introduce your own water or another refrigerant. And this is what a typical geothermal system would look like. You have a production well, this is where the fluid is. This is where the fluid is coming out of. And imagine that it's perfectly dry, then you don't need a separator. You just pass it straight through a turbine. That's the nicest way of doing it. But that's not always the case. And so generally, you have to separate your dry fraction from the wet fraction. The wet fraction, there's not a lot to do with it unless you have some other use for warmish water, right? Like, for example, if you were having to heat a district energy system. To heat a district energy system, that's a good way of using that waste heat because it's not hot enough to do a lot of useful work with, but you could heat a district energy system or a greenhouse or whatever. Then the gaseous fraction gets passed to the turbine, generates electricity that needs to be condensed. And if you want to replenish the aquifer that you're getting the water from, you could pump that back into and then re-inject it back into the well. All right. All right, the turbine power that you can get out depends on the availability of the energy that's coming in. That times the mass flow rate of water coming out is the maximum possible energy that can be extracted. The actual turbine power is going to be some efficiency associated with your system, and that relates to the enthalpies before and after your turbine. When I say enthalpy, is there anyone here who's not clear on what enthalpy? Who's not clear on what enthalpy represents? Okay, so enthalpy represents the energy in a flowing fluid per unit mass, incorporating, as I've written it here, this is the specific enthalpy. So this is per unit mass. And when you think about the energy in a moving fluid, it's different than the energy in a stationary fluid because you also have to consider the Because you also have to consider the work for that fluid to cross through a boundary at a pressure. And so it's the definition of enthalpy is the internal energy plus the pressure times the specific volume, and which we call that term boundary work. But if you like, it's the amount of energy per unit mass of the flowing fluid. And in this case, we have fluid flowing from one to two through our turbine. One to two through our turbine, and the difference in energy per unit mass between the two times the mass flow rate gives you the amount of power that's produced. James? It might be a dumb question, but we talk about, we look at wind turbines in terms of velocity moving through, and all of a sudden we say, oh, we care about the temperature of it. I'm not quite sure how does this turbine work? Yes. Okay. So This is a funny thing. When we talk about the equipment used to extract energy from a fluid, we have a not very broad vocabulary. When we talk about things that put energy into a fluid, we have a very broad vocabulary. Bands, compressors, pumps, blowers, we all have different words for all different ways in which they work. But when we're talking about getting the energy out. But when we're talking about getting the energy out, we just call everything turbine. Right? I don't know why this is, right? But it's just how it is. So this would be a steam turbine. And if you look at it, it looks very different from a wind turbine. However, the aerodynamic principles are quite similar. You generate, you have a shaped surface, and you flow a gas over that shaped surface. Over that shaped surface or liquid, I suppose, and that shaped surface results in the generation of aerodynamic forces. And those aerodynamic forces are harnessed to produce torque and generate power. Okay. The way that it works for steam versus a wind turbine results in the equipment looking very different. Sure. Right? So a wind turbine has these three blades that stick out and spin around. Yeah. A steam turbine, if you look at it from the outside, you can't really. If you look at it from the outside, you can't really see anything because you'd have to hold the gas in. But essentially, it looks like a whole bunch of discs mounted on a shaft. And then on each of these discs are a bunch of blades. This is the most conventional way of looking at it. And those blades are really small in the first stage, the first set of discs, because your gas is highly dense. But then as you take energy out of the fluid, the pressure. The pressure has to go down and the density as a result goes down, but you have to maintain the same mass flow rate. So the area needs to get bigger. And so a steam turbine looks like a bunch of discs, and then the blades on top of the discs are arranged in a cascade, and the flow goes around this tortuous pass, and then the area gets bigger and bigger. Okay, that's for a steam turbine. And a gas turbine is similar, but the difference in a gas turbine is the gas. But the difference in a gas turbine is the gas doesn't change phase from a liquid, from a vapor to a liquid, which it could in a gas in a steam turbine. And gas turbines take advantage of the fact that the air is ideal, can be considered ideal generally, whereas in a gas turbine, it's highly non-ideal. And technology is a bit different. Okay, now, if you have a good source of geothermal energy. A good source of geothermal energy, geothermal can be the cheapest form of sustainable energy, even cheaper than hydro. Because if you think about energy systems, the input is the, you have to get the energy from somewhere, right? And in geothermal, it's the Earth that's doing it for you. So you're not having to pay for any of the fuel that you would otherwise have to pay to produce that heat. It's like free energy, if you like. It's like free energy, if you like. It's energy that comes from geological processes in the Earth. And so, if that energy is accessible to you because you have a nice resource and it's not far down and it comes out as a dry steam, then the cost per unit energy is very, very low, highly attractive. And when you look at the history of electricity utilization, especially in North America, some of the earliest electricity grids were powered, especially in Western Canada. Powered, especially in Western Canada, Western North America, by geothermal, especially around the San Francisco area. How many years ago did we go back? This would be in the mid-1800s. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, you know, some of these places where you have geysers coming up, geysers coming up. That's a lot of geysers is where I participate. No, geysers coming up. That's a lot of energy that's just readily accessible. Just readily accessible if you're smart. You utilize it, and then you have a relatively easy, accessible source of electricity. Yes. So, what I wondered is the price game is very hard, right? So, when it's getting out, how so would it impact on a temperature kind of stuff on Earth? Would it like on a climate level? So, it's actually warming things up around there. Yeah, so Coda has a point that it could be that you're the heat that you're so to answer the question, I'll back up a little bit. So yes, you're right. We are getting heat that's coming out of the earth. Then we're using the energy to generate power. And so in so doing, we've reduced. And so, in so doing, we've reduced the temperature of that resource, but it's still somewhat in a vapor state. So, we condense it and we let some heat go out into our earth. And so if you were to look at a geothermal plant, you would see quite a bit of steam coming out. And that's because of the condenser where you're letting that material to cool down again and condense all the way to a liquid state. And so, in that sense, I suppose we are contributing because we're emitting water vapor into the atmosphere. Emitting water vapor into the atmosphere. But the global warming capacity of water vapor is much lower and faster than carbon dioxide, for example. So I think that if you were to look at per kilogram, per kilogram equivalent greenhouse gas warming potential, geothermal is very, very low in comparison. And a part of that is because we do introduce that water back into the ground. We don't just at this point. We don't just at this point eject the steam into the atmosphere and let it go away. That would be a waste and it would deplete our reservoir eventually. And that was the point that Keita was making, that the water does eventually go back into the ground, often, if not always. All right. So, this is what we mean by the flashing process. I won't go into it in detail. If you are, Detail. If you are thinking about a geothermal system, if you're taking an approach in your project of evaluating sustainable energy systems for a remote community and you want to use geothermal, the flashing process is critical because it determines how much of the available resource does turn into steam. And a way that a flashing system works is essentially it's a pressure vessel where you allow the gas to expand below. Below atmospheric pressure, if necessary. And so you change the saturation pressure of that gas so it evaporates. That's how a flashing system, essentially a flashing chamber is a chamber where you can reduce the pressure rapidly. Okay. And then you separate the gas and the liquid, and then the gas goes through. But generally, the flashing process is thermodynamically, in a sense, inefficient in that the It's inefficient in that the bulk of the mass becomes liquid, and you only recover a fraction of the steam. And so, a steam fraction of 10 to 25 percent is typical. So, then you need to use the steam fraction for estimating your turbine power. And then the flashing conditions need to be set up at a certain way. All right. So, if you're contemplating. So, if you're contemplating a geothermal system, you'll need to consider whether you'll need a flashing chamber based off of the temperature and pressure of the liquid coming out of your resource. Now, what we see is if we flash a system once, then we get a certain amount of steam that comes out. And then what we end up having is liquid from our first flashing process is still at a high enough pressure that we could flash it again. That we could flash it again and get more C. And so you could have two flashing units, and you flash the first one at a certain high pressure, you flash the second one at a certain lower pressure, and then you have more steam than if you only had a single flashing unit. And you could do that umpteen times. But the problem is, every time the flashing unit pressure goes down and the cost is high, and so generally, I've seen in commercial operation. In commercial operation, only ever dual flashing systems. So they're two flashers, two flashing units. And so this is what a thermodynamic process would look like. And this is temperature versus entropy. If you've taken a thermodynamics course, you probably recognize this. And if you haven't, don't worry about it. It's been said that the first time you study thermodynamics, you really don't understand. Really don't understand what you learned. And the second time you study it, you think you understand. And then the third time you study it, you know you don't understand. But at that point, you're so used to using it anyways that it doesn't bother you. All right. One could use a geothermal binary unit when you use a geothermal fluid as a boiler for a more conventional energy system using steam like a Rankine cycle. You don't have to Cycle. You don't have to use steam in your Rankine cycle. You could use a secondary fluid. CO2 is a good secondary fluid. And the CO2 exists in a closed loop, so you're not emitting any of it. And so it works quite well. Or you could use a hybrid system where you have a fossil-fueled superheater and you're using fossil fuels still, but much, much less because. Less because all you're doing is just bumping up the temperature of your geothermal resource. And so instead of burning your fossil fuel to produce electricity, you're burning the fossil fuel to heat up the geothermal resource. And so you can improve your first and second law efficiencies of your geothermal system at a lower cost. And this would be appropriate if you don't have a great geothermal resource, but it's okay, and then you're using less. And then you're using less fossil fuel in the end as well. Adio? The degree to which you warm the water and the fossil fuel, the price of that is way outweighed by the warmer water. Sorry. Yes. Yes. Okay. So you can generate more electricity at a lower cost than if you were to do one or the other by itself. Yes. Yes. Just curious about it. Is the geothermal constant and reliable resource or like wind power is intermittent? Yeah. If it's constant and reliable for the time scales that matter to people. The tectonic plates are moving all the time, right? But that's occurring over time scales that are not relevant for us. For us, right? We're talking about hundreds of years and more, thousands of years, maybe even more. And so, over the span of the lifetime of the equipment that you install, I think you could say it's completely uniform. Right? Because all of this equipment is going to have a 50 or 100-year lifespan max, right? Good question. You can actually draw it down a little bit. You can actually draw it down a little lower, but if you're smart about it, you can keep it pretty distant. Good to know. Yeah, excellent. And it probably depends on the resource, right? There's probably some resources where there's just so much accessible water in that reservoir, in the geothermal resource, like in Iceland, for example. You'll see pictures of Iceland where they have big pipes along the ground. It's not moving gas or electricity, it's moving steam from where this resource is to where. Resource is to where the electricity plant is. I've always wondered why they do it that way rather than producing the electricity and then transporting it that way. But that's just, I guess, I don't know. Yes. So the geothermal plants are subject to seismicity, right? Systemic events. Do they cause any effect on the operation of the unit or is that just a safety concern for people? Safety concern for people who live around. Are you talking about induced seismicity by the plan? Yeah, yes, that's right. Yeah. I don't know. I don't think. I think that the induced seismicity that we think about is the result of hydraulic fracturing of rock formations, right? Where you introduce high-pressure water or steam or some other fluid to fracture the fluid. To fracture the rock to get the gas out. In the case of geothermal systems, I don't think that fracturing is ever used to increase the porosity of the rock because we're not trying to release anything. We're trying to extract heat. And so if the rock has abundant in already existing water, then that water is hot and we just get it out. If it isn't, maybe then we would fracture the rock in order to increase the porosity. Of the rock in order to increase the porosity to heat up the fluid better, if we're using just a hot, dry rock to heat up the fluid we put in. So, I think the seismicity related to geothermal is probably the seismicity that's there because geothermal resources are located on fault lines generally. And I don't think the geothermal contributes substantially to induced seismicity. It may be that the induced seismicity as a result of As a result of gas and oil exploration and activity on the back end, could be used if those orphaned wells or decommissioned wells could be used for geothermal. It's a good question, but I don't have a clear answer, but these are my thoughts around, yeah, maybe there's an answer somewhere inside there. All right. A couple of comments around environmental issues. The pollutant. The pollutant emissions in terms of CO2 per kilowatt hour is very low, 1,000 to 5,000 times lower than fossil fuels. There are other emissions that may be present, right? Because you're releasing gases or steam resources from the underground. And so there may be emissions of hydrogen sulfide, for example. Are there you could miss the radio when you drill down? I don't know. That's another good question. I'm not. That's another good question. I'm not sure. I don't actually know how radon comes out of the granite. Yeah, it's a great point for the radius, right? The deeper you go, the more kind of radioactive isotopes you can pick up. Maybe it's a stupid question. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. That's a good question, though. When you are removing, so maybe this relates to your previous question, Lise. To your previous question, Lise. When you're removing water from the soil, then you are changing the subsistence of the soil and you could get cracking of the soil, or the porosity of your aquifer could change. So that's a factor. I think this is more concern if you're removing the geothermal resource and not putting it back, right? Because then you're reducing the amount of water that's present. The thermal pollution is low relative to, or excuse me, the efficiency is low. Or, excuse me, the efficiency is low because the geothermal resource is at a much, much lower temperature than you would get in a combustion engine. And the basic law of thermodynamics, Carnot cycle, Carnot law, Carnot efficiency, excuse me, says that the maximum efficiency any thermodynamic cycle can get is this. Where you're looking at a thermodynamic process. You're looking at a thermodynamic process where you have heat exchange between two reservoirs. You have a cold reservoir and a hot reservoir. And the hotter your hot reservoir. Do I have this correct? Yes. The hotter your hot reservoir, the more efficient your system can be thermodynamically. But if you think about a diesel engine, the hot reservoir is your combustion of fuel inside your diesel engine. That's hot, right? That's maybe a thousand degrees Celsius in that range. That range. In a geothermal system, it's a few 200 or maybe 250 degrees Celsius, much lower. So your thermal efficiency is, you know, never mind all of the frictional losses and everything else, but just thermodynamically, your thermal efficiency is going to be less. And so there's more thermal pollution. You are emitting more heat out, waste heat out into the environment. And that was your question. But it may be that you could account for that by using some of that waste heat for other things, district heating, for example. Other things, district heating, for example. A final comment is flashing processes and steam turbines are tremendously noisy, and so there could be noise pollution, which might be impactful. All right. Yes, sir. And can you remind me your name? Yuri. Yuri. Yeah. Nice name. Do people consider hybrid heating electrical system for remote communications? For a typical household, especially. Perotypical households, majority of the energy is heat and cool, yeah, and this sort of piggybacks into horizontal geothermal. These are vertical loops, right? Only for the piece generation, but for horizontal 9% is like you go six, seven feet down and you run your loop, and it's much easier to deploy and remote places where there's, I imagine, abundance of land, food and things like that should not be very problematic. should not be very problematic, but hypothetically. I think that centralizing heating systems, especially in northern communities, makes sense. There's probably some factors that I'm not thinking about related to how do you distribute the heat in tundra or frozen like permafrost and those kinds of things that may bring some challenges. District heating systems are not common in North America, but they're more common. Are not common in North America, but they're more common in European cities, probably because of the density in which people live, right? And there's like major efficiencies that can be made. And so campuses, like university campuses, that's a great way to reduce the energy consumption of individual buildings is to produce the heat using in UBCO's case, a geothermal exchange, which is by parking lot H, which is, where am I? That way. And then heating the building centrally. Heating the building centrally that reduces the emissions associated with each building a lot. So, yes, one geothermal is an interesting idea because it does open the mind to interesting ideas of what one could do to kind of new and interesting ideas for energy. All right. What time am I supposed to be done, Denise? Three minutes. Okay, we took way longer than I expected. Okay, we took way longer than I expected on that. I'll talk about geothermal, hydroelectric now. Hydroelectric is taking the potential energy, normally, associated with differences in head in water. So if you look at a hydroelectric dam, this is maybe the most conventional that you might be familiar with. This is what you, most of BCD gets power by dams like this, generally on rivers. You stop the flow with. You stop the flow with a concrete structure. You generate a reservoir upstream. The difference between the elevation of the top of the reservoir upstream and downstream is what we call the head. And the maximum power we can get by bringing the water from here to there corresponds to the flow rate of water, gravitational acceleration, times your head. That's the max. The actual power. The actual power we generate relates to the shaft torque we produce in our generator times its rotational speed. And the difference between these is our efficiency. And so we can calculate the actual power by applying a turbine efficiency. And the turbine efficiency depends on the type of turbine. And hydraulic turbines are generally in the 70 to 80, maybe high 80% for hydraulic turbines. For hydraulic turbines. The equipment around this is really important, but I'm not going to get into it. Okay. There's a lot that one has to think about. It's an old technology, but it's very sophisticated. I work with some projects with BC Hydro, and there's a lot of smart people doing important things to make sure that this works. The type of turbine you want to use depends. To use depends a lot on the kind of resource that you have. If you have a little bit of flow, but a large difference in head, you have a certain kind of turbine is preferred. On the other hand, if you have a lot of flow, Three Gorges Dam in China, where the head is only a few meters, but the flow is like, you know, they moved millions of people to generate these reservoirs. Of people to generate these reservoirs, large amounts of flow, then you have a different kind of turbine. And then you have some kind of turbines that work relatively well over a broad range. And how do you know what kind of turbine to use? You calculate something called a specific speed. This is the rotational speed. This is the power that you need to produce. This is the density of the fluid you have. G is gravitational acceleration. And H is an effective head. And it accounts for some losses in head that I can talk about. Accounts for some losses in head that I can talk about later. Calculating these in this ratio gives you quantity and radians, and you just, these are plots that you can find all over the place for selecting a certain turbine type for a given type of specific speed. And generally, the way that they work are quite different. One is more, well, we'll talk about those in a bit. So maybe we can stop now as we move on to the next. As we move on to the next, is it noon that we were supposed to finish? Yes, yeah, because I can't. I started a few minutes late. Should I take a few more minutes? All right, I'll take a few more minutes. The two broad categories of turbines that are used in hydraulic systems are called impulse turbines, and that takes advantage of the kinetic energy content of the stream, and reaction turbines, which take advantage, if you like, of the potential. Which take advantage, if you like, of the potential energy content in the form of pressure. And large utility-scale hydroelectric facilities generally are these. This is where you have the Revelstoke Dam, which powers Kelowna, or Site C Dam, or the other large dams that you would find in most of like part of the electricity system. Of, like, part of electricity systems. Oh, I see somebody else has a question in the chat. Oh, okay, just saying thank you. A Pelton turbine, these impulse turbines basically consist of a wheel with these shaped buckets and a bunch of jets. And so you have flow that's, again, low flow, high head. So what you might see is a turbine with a little creek coming off of a mouth. With a little creek coming off of a mountain. If you've ever seen at Whistler Blackholm, the electricity that they generate for the resort, it's produced by one of these. There's a little creek coming off the mountain called Fitzsimmons Creek. You divert a portion of that creek high, put it into a pipe, and then all that distance down by the time you get to the bottom, that is the amount of pressure that you've built up in your tube, right? The amount of pressure is rho times G times H. Rho times g times h. So if rho is about a thousand and g is about 10 and your h is a few hundred meters, that's a lot of pressure. And you can get that pressure out by shooting these jets at these buckets. And you see the shape of the bucket allows for the jet to hit the bucket, swirl around, and impart a force against that bucket. And you can have a bunch of jets and the buckets, and the shape of the bucket. The buckets and the shape of the bucket and the number of jets all have an impact on the amount of power that you can produce. The more you turn the flow in the bucket, the better. You can't turn it 180 degrees because that means it comes right back at me. So I have to turn it like 160 or 165 degrees so that it goes back away from me. And one can calculate what using something called Euler equation, Euler's turbine equation, the amount of work. The amount of work that you can extract. And from there, you can actually do an analysis of what's called the runner efficiency, which is the efficiency of the wheel, what's called the runner, in converting the available energy, which is the kinetic energy of this stream, to power. And what one shows is that it's a function of this quantity eta, and eta. Quantity eta and eta is the ratio between the blade speed of the runner as it's spinning around, which is U, which is just the rotational speed of the runner times the radius at which the buckets live to the flow of the speed coming in. And what you want is actually you can demonstrate under ideal conditions your blades, your run. Blades, your runner should be spinning at half of the speed of the water coming out. So if the water is coming out at, let's say, 100 meters per second, then your runner needs to be spinning around at whatever hert frequency times the radius gives you 50 meters per second. And then you get the maximum efficiency. And in my course, I do this derivation. It's very straightforward. Now, your turbine is directly coupled to your generator, and the amount of power your generator needs is going to fluctuate depending on the load. And so, your Pelton wheel needs to change the amount of power, but you don't want to change the speed at which it rotates. You want that to stay constant all the time because it's at the best efficiency point. And so, the way that you can modulate power is by delivering more or less. Is by delivering more or less flow into your Pelton turbine, but at the same speed. And the way that you do that is by you can deflect a portion of it. You can have this spear valve, which allows more or less area of your jet. And a deflector basically just allows a part of the stream to hit the buckets and a part of it to not hit, and so not introduce an influx. Introduce an impress. And so this is how you can modulate the output for a given to follow the load. All right. There's efficiency losses, frictional losses in pipes and other changes in head, and that changes your effective head. So if you know, if you have the length of pipe from where you collect the water all the way down, if you know the length of that pipe. If you know the length of that pipe, the flow rate of that pipe, the diameter of that pipe, and the friction factor, which is essentially the frictional roughness associated with the friction in the pipe, which you can find from a diagram, Moody diagram. If you're a mechanical engineer, you know and probably have bad dreams about these moody diagrams. Then you can calculate the losses associated with that, and that gives you your effective head. All right. These Pelton turbines are. These Pelton turbines are useful in mountainous regions where you have large deltas. If you're in the Canadian Shield or the Northwest Territories or somewhere far away and there's no mountains, not so useful. All right, I'm going to stop here. This is the way that the efficiency changes with losses that could be in the runner system and other places. And I also have an example. And I also have an example which I'm going to walk through. All right, let's stop here for now. And I guess that the afternoon is going to be some time spent on this exercise, right? All right. All right. Thanks, everyone. I realize I need to pick up the pace, otherwise, we're not going to get through very many other systems. So, I wrote. So hydro is a big part an important part of an electricity that has a lot of things and solar because it can lose the balance of line when those are not available. So, but then you need long distance transmission. So, what are the constraints that are posed on the system if it's a long distance transmission? Is it just like Is it just like just the cost of building those transmission lines, or is there it takes time to take the power through that line? No, it doesn't take time. It takes time to build the line. You do have transmission lockets in the transmission of the electricity. If I understand your question, I think. Question. I think the answer that I would give is: hydroelectric power is highly dependent on geography, right? You need the flowing water, you need the falling water to be able to produce hydroelectricity. I'm just going to understand what ways are. Well, there's a couple of challenges, right? You can only produce as much electricity as your hydroelectric dam can accommodate, right? And that's a function of the flow rate that you can have of the water and the change in elevation in water. And so, when you put in a sight seed damage, right, the province has been talking a ton about sight seed handling. I know that you're in Alberta. I know that you're in Alberta, so I may not have heard about it, but the Sightsee Dam is a big dam project in the north part of BC, and the province has been batting back and forth for several decades whether they would develop it. And about a decade ago, they decided they will. And it was supposed to cost some billion dollars. And now it's cost like five times more, but they can live longer. And as more and more of the province is electrified, we have more and more electric cars, for example. Sensei is not yet either long, it's not installed yet, but we are already like at a it doesn't produce enough is what we need. We need it to be bigger. We need to build more. And so I think the answer to your question is it's a combination of we're going through so much in a certain place and then we have to transmit. And there's losses associated with the transmission, and you can't put the dams where we want and you can't put them. And you can't put them, you can't put too many of them. Polona's electricity is produced by a Rubblestoke Dam. The Rubblestoke Dam is on the Columbia River. The Columbia River is one of the most dammed rivers in North America. And that creates all kinds of political as well as economical and environmental challenges. If I put too many down by the river, If I put too many down by the river, I'm going to be changing the hydrological resource for the folks that live downstream. And I'm also going to be creating reservoirs for the folks that live upstream. And so it has to be managed. And this Columbia River is very interesting because it crosses through BC, Washington. Okay, let's get started then. Roxanne, are you ready? Okay, so hello. I will continue with maybe with the application that which is based on research papers, but before doing this, so I've given the mean field formulation of a problem. The formulation was this one, just to remind you. And here, as you can see, Here, as you can see, represents for me the law of X. But one can consider more general problems, where, for example, you have, so if I take n players, and here is the dynamics of each player, of the ith player, sorry, you see that the coefficients depend on this mu tm. Efficiency depends on this, the empirical distribution, which could also be the joint empirical distribution of the state processes and controls. So in the example that I gave in the lecture was only the state process, Xi, but I could also have the joint distribution of the process and control, or I can only have, for example, the distribution of the control. The distribution of the control. So, in this case, we say that we have interaction in the control, and I'm talking about this because in the application, you'll see that I will have the interaction through the distribution of the controls. Okay, so the formulation of the minifiging problem is exactly the same. This is the only thing which is, let's say, a bit different. Okay. Yes. Yes? Can you make it bigger? Yes, okay. I do. Okay. So I will not talk now about the approaches. I'll rather talk tomorrow a bit more about the approaches. We have the analytic approach to solve the mean field games. We have the probabilistic approach and we have also the compactification method. But now I would like to discuss about the application of The application of mint feed games to demand site management. So, you remember that, so, first of all, this presentation is based on two papers of mine. One in collaboration with Clémence Alassar from EDF, Electricité de France from Paris, with Giano Campi, and a former PhD student of mine. And the second one, where we mainly focus on proposing new deep learning algorithms for Deep learning algorithms for fully coupled for backward SDs with jumps, but we apply this to the model that I will present. And this is again in collaboration with Clemence, a current student of mine, and Xavier Barron from Électricité de France as well. So you remember that when I introduced the current context about the energy transition, the fact that renewables. That renewables have to increase. I also mentioned that there is an issue. The issue is that renewables are variable. So we have to deal with this variability of renewable type of energy. So in order to adapt to this variability, we have to increase the flexibility on the demand side. So it means that the consumers have also to participate actively. To participate actively to this energy transition process. So, what does it mean demand response? So, there are several strategies of implementing demand side management, a demand side management program. One of them is based on what we call energy savings. So, this means just reducing the overall consumption over a certain time of period. Period. Another way to do it is demand response. Demand response does not mean reducing the overall consumption, but it refers to balancing the demand on power grids by encouraging customers to shift electricity demand to times when electricity is more plentiful or other demand is lower. So it means that, for example, we We postpone some consumption or we anticipate some consumption, let's say, in order to be able to balance the supply and the demand. And how is this usually achieved in practice? This is achieved through prices incentives. So you'll see that in the model that we propose, we incentivize consumers to shift their consumption through Consumption through dynamic pricing, and I will explain what it means. So, the main idea of the model is that, and I will introduce the mathematical framework in a few minutes. So, we have an energy system where we have, actually we'll have two classes of consumers. And this is linked to the last question that I received after the Last question that I received after the last lecture is if we can introduce some heterogeneity between the agents, and the answer was yes by considering several classes of agents, but each class has identical players. So here in this model, we have two classes of agents. Our agents are the consumers, okay, where some consumers will not make any effort to Not make any effort to shift their consumption. So they just have their usual consumption, but they do not make any effort to change it. And we have another class of consumers that we call active consumers. These will be the consumers who will make an effort to shift their consumption. And these consumers are linked by what we call a demand side management contract. We should have Should have two features. One is dynamic pricing that I already mentioned, and another one is an interruptible load feature that I will present in a few minutes. You have seen that when we talk about mini-games, the players, the main difficulty is that the agents interact. Okay, so we have the interaction aspect. So how do the consumer interact in this framework? They interact through They interact through the electricity price and they also interact through a penalty cost that I will explain. So which will be the mathematical tool to solve this? This will be the mean field gain theory. And in this particular setting, I will have the interaction in the control. So if you remember the general setting that I introduced where the empirical distribution of the population is the joint distribution of the Is the joint distribution of the state and control, where in this case is just in the control. So there is no interaction in the state. Okay, so let's see which is the formulation. So here I formulate the end-player game problem. And as said, just as a reminder, you remember that I have two classes of consumers. I have those Two classes of consumers. I have those who don't do anything, so those who are inactive, and I have those who enter the demand side management contract, so they are active. So here, when I write the formulation of my game, I write only for the class of agents who are active. Okay, so I will formulate the problem. So, first step is that I fix a consumer eye, okay, and I want to. Okay, and I want to see which is his objective function. So he wants to minimize the expected, his total expected cost, which is a sum of several different terms. So one of them is a function G, which depends on alpha i, S i, and Q i represents the consumption. S i will represent the accumulated change. The accumulated change in the consumption. And alpha i represents the effort that the consumer is making to reduce its consumption. So basically, it's the instantaneous change, let's say, in the consumption, alpha it. So this G will represent some inconvenience cost due to change its consumption. Then there is a term which represents There is a term which represents the subscribed consumption, so the demand charge. And then we have some terms and these terms, the CIT and DIT, will be the most interesting terms, let's say, because they will have the interaction with the other consumers. So we have CIT represents what we call the real-time tariff. Tariff and TIT represents some divergence cost. I will describe these two terms in detail. And also, we have some terminal cost, which depends on the final value of the accumulated change in the consumption. So, real-time pricing, which represents this term CIT, I have interaction in the control in this term between the In this term between the players, between the consumers. And this term DIT represents the divergence cost. And again, we have interaction in the control. And what we like to do is to find a Nash equilibria for this game in the sense of the definition that I have given in the first lecture. Yes. So what's the interpretation of the terminal cost? Interpretation of the terminal cost, why would there be that term? Basically, what we would like and in the application to do is that the terminal accumulated change to be close to zero at the end. And why is that? Because we don't want to have too much, I mean, to postpone and to anticipate overall. Postpone and to anticipate overall. I mean, we want that over the time period zero time capital T, that the consumer is overall satisfied in the sense that the accumulated effort is not, the accumulated effort is zero. Okay. Basically, this can be the cumulative effort of the consumer. And my question is about the interruptible load. Yeah. Do you mean that the consumer golden twitch agreement that whenever they need it, they stop using electricity? Is that what it means? I will explain this DIT in detail a bit later. I will explain what we understand by this interruptible load. If you wait just two slides, I will explain. Two slides, I will explain this in detail. And the goal of this model is to see how the consumer will behave under this situation. What we want to see is we want to see two things. One thing is we want to see which are the impacts of such a contract on the consumption levels. Okay, and also during the time period zero capital T and capital T here is a small time, it's like two days, for example. And we also want to understand which is the impact on prices, on the short-term prices. So we want to see if we succeed that in the moments when the consumption is at its peak without any effort, if we succeed that during this effort, the consumption If we succeed, that doing this effort, the consumption can be reduced. You see, so if we are we succeed to do this shift, because what we want is in the moments when the consumption is at the highest and the balance between supply and consumption is would not be satisfied. We want to reduce the consumption at the moment and to postpone it or to anticipate. So we want to see which are. So, we want to see which are the impacts of such a model of this real-time pricing and interruptible load on the consumption pattern. On the overall consumption pattern, I mean, is it clear? Okay, so I will see so I introduce first So, I introduce first, so I said the two terms I'm really interested in are the terms CIT and DIT. So, SIT is the real-time tariff. So, this will be P will represent the price per unit of consumption. And the total tariff will be, of course, the price times the overall consumption of the item. The overall consumption of the ith player, which is Qi represents the natural consumption, let's say, plus alpha it represents the effort the player is doing either to postpone or to anticipate some consumption. So the total consumption at time t will be qit plus alpha it. And now how is this price defined? So this is a real time pricing. Time pricing and the price is not a fixed price per unit of consumption, but it is a price which depends on the total consumption. Okay, so it means that when the total consumption will be high, the price usually the price will be higher and the CIT will be higher. Okay, so then we'll be in the consumer will be. then we'll be in the consumer will be incentivized to decrease its consumption. So you see here I have two terms in this price functional. So I have this QST represents the consumption of those what you call standard consumers who are not entering such a contract, so they do not make. Such a contract, so they do not make any effort. And we have n prime players, consumers of this type. Okay. So we take the average consumption of these standard consumers. And then we have the average consumption of those consumers who have a demand site management contract. So this So these consumers, their consumption is Qj plus alpha J per player, okay? And then we take the average. Okay, so you see that through this term, we have already the interaction between the ICE player and the others, okay, because the price depends on the overall consumption. And I would like to insist also on the fact that why we are interested here in Why we are interested here in the midfield game theory? Because what we are interested in basically is not on the individual consumptions of each consumer, but we are interested in the overall consumption. This is what is of interest for us. So the mid-credit game theory in this case is very adaptive. So we introduced the proportion of standard consumers with respect to the man-side management consumers. Demand side management consumers in the total population is pi, okay, and the power cost CIT using this pi can be defined as given here. So what already looking at this problem, we see that a lot of large numbers will enter into play, okay, so that we can justify the Can justify the mean field limit. So, this consumption, so, in contrast with the first part of the lecture, where I assumed that the state processes of all players have noises which are independent. Here, as you see, these consumptions have also a common noise. And we have also a version, let's say, of the law of large number propagation of chaos for. Large number of propagation of chaos for this type of processes. And this term will converge to the conditional expectation of QST with respect to the common noise filtration. And this part here will converge to the conditional expectation of Q plus alpha knowing the common noise filtration. Okay, and I will specify the common noise. Okay, and that will specify the common moist filtration. Okay, and now we have this interruptible feature. So what happens that when the supply, the balance between supply and demand might not be satisfied or is very critical, the operator system can give a signal to the consumers to To the consumers to reduce the consumption. And what it is wanted is that the overall consumption to achieve a certain target, okay, which I denote here by alpha bar t. So I want that the overall consumption, but I will not take here into account the standard consumers as I did in the price. Okay, the price depends on all consumers, but here is. Here is only those consumers to participate in this type of contract who have to have the overall consumption to achieve the target, this target alpha bar T. And usually the operator system might ask this reduction of the consumption for a certain time period that I denote here by theta. That I denote here by theta. F represents a penalty cost by unit of deviating from the target, consumption deviating from the target, which is multiplied by the individual deviation of the consumer from the target. And sure, here I should have alpha multi. And here, Jt theta. Kt theta is, as you can see, is an indicator function which is equal to one during the interruptible load contract activation. So let's say that theta is three hours and then for t smaller than three, okay, I will have this penalty activated, but then if I don't have any other signal, meanwhile, Any other signal, meanwhile, to reduce the consumption, I will have T, I will have this process J to be equal to zero. How do we model these signals? Yeah, the moments when the consumption has to be reduced, which are indicated by the operator system. These are modeled through a process N0, which is a junk process. I don't know if you know, for example, already. Know if you know, for example, already the Poisson process. So, the Poisson process is a process which has some jumps, some times, okay, and the jumps are of size one. So, here, when there is a signal that the overall consumption has to be reduced at this target alpha bar, then this process M zero has a jump. N0 has a jump at that moment. And before explaining what this process is, I want to say that a Cox process is a version, let's say, of the Poisson process where the intensity is, so for the Poisson process, the intensity of jumps is lambda, is a constant. For a Cox process, the intensity is stochastic. stochastic so uh lambda t is a process and you see uh that this process lambda t will be um we have some measurability um assumptions that i will explain a bit a bit later okay but for the moment just retain that m0 is a jump process and it has a jump of one at the time when there is a signal that the overall consumption has to be reduced and this process are process R measures the time since the last the last jump of M0 occurred and when oops sorry okay so this process R measures the time okay and when there is a new jump the process becomes equals to zero because I started becomes equal to zero because I start to count the time again. Okay. So if I'm the time period under which we have to apply the penalty is theta. And assume that I have a jump and theta is equal to three, but after two hours I have another jump, then R is set to start from zero again. So I start to count the time again. So this is the Time again. So, this is the role of this process. Okay. And the role of the process J is defined using this process R, because I said Jt will be one when Rt is smaller than theta. So it means that I have less than theta hours since the last jump occurred. Jump occurred, and then it will become zero. Okay, so this is the interruptible load feature. Okay, so now I will go. So for the moment, I already had the end player game problem. And now I will go to the Minfield game formulation. So I will introduce some probabilistic setup. So I will have three Brownian motions. We have three Brownian motions which are independent. W0 will be a source of common noise. And you'll see how the consumption will depend on this. So the consumption will depend on W0. W is some, and W will be some idiosyncratic noise for the standard consumers and W bar for the active consumers. For the active consumers. Then I have this process L0 that I have just introduced in the slide before, which is a double stochastic Poisson process with intensity process lambda t, which will be F W0 adapted. So will be adapted with respect to the filtration of the Brownian motion, which is the source of common noise. And so in this model, I have two sources of noise. Model: I will have two sources of common noise. I will have W0 and I will have N0. I want to say that it's normal to have N0 as a common noise because this will be observed by all consumers, this signal. And also, what is known from probability theory is that the Poisson processes have jumps which are totally inaccessible. Okay, totally inaccessible means that you cannot predict basically when the jump will arrive, but this intensity, so the intensity measures the probability to have a jump at this time t. So, this is something that the consumers will be able to evaluate the probability. They will not know the exact moment when. Not know the exact moment when the jump will arrive, they cannot predict, but they know the intensity, the probability to have a jump, to have the signal to reduce the consumption. And I would like to say that actually, as far as I know, in Spain, they have already introduced this type of contracts. And also in France, consumers received, I don't know in the US, but in France, they also receive. In France, they also receive offers for such types of contracts. And this becomes possible to implement such contracts also with the development of smart meters. So the consumers are well equipped to receive the information they need in order to know if they have or not to reduce their consumption. Okay, then NTT represents what we call the compensated 12% problem. Call the compensated 12 Poisson process. Okay, this is not very important. And then we have, we'll introduce two filtrations. So, the filtration, as you know, is the information that we have. So, we have the complete filtration generated by all these noises that you have here. And I also introduce some independent random variables which will represent the initial values of the consumptions and of the accumulation. of the cumulated of the cumulated energy energy process s and I also introduced by F zero the common noise filtration okay so this represents the common noise filtration and will be generated by W0 and N0 okay so now let's see which are the dynamics Dynamics. So Q represents. So here, when I wrote the mean few game formulation, and remember, I have two classes of consumers. Since I have two classes of consumers, I will have a representative consumer per class. So for the representative consumer from the class of active consumers, his natural consumption is given by this process Q. Is given by this process Q. Okay? And as you see, I have a trip. So I take a generic SD for the moment. And you see that W is its idiosyncratic noise and W0 is the common noise. And little Q0 is the initial value of the process. Then I have also a dynamic for the process at QST. Is a QST. And I apologize that here I shouldn't have J. Sorry for that, for the typo. So here I have the QST process. And then I have this process S, which is the controlled process, which represents the cumulated change in the consumption. So this process gives the cumulated change. Alpha T is the instantaneous change and S alpha is the cumulative change. Change. Alpha represents the control process. Okay. As usual, we introduce the space of controls and the necessary measurability and integrability conditions. And also, I'll introduce a notation that I will need afterwards. So if I take salt to be a process which is adapted with respect to the general filtration of all noise. General filtration of all noises, then I denote by psi t hat the projection into the common noise filtration, which is the conditional expectation of psi t knowing f t0, where f t 0 represents the common, f0 represents the common noise filtration. Excuse me, I have a question. Yes. Can we go back to that previous slide? Go back to the previous slide, yes. So, like, regarding the control alpha, I imagine is there any some type of like bulk constraint? Because if I'm a consumer with a storage system, then it's probably the control should be like some type of bulk constraints going on, right? Or here, I'll be assume relaxing and assuming I'm restricted. I agree. So, but here we that's why I didn't, because we don't assume here any constraints, that's why I don't present. Any constraints, that's why I don't present as a storage because usually you need constraints, but it's just the cumulative change. Okay, it's the effort, the cumulative effort that you make to change your consumption. It's not necessary storage here. I see. Okay. But if you want to consider storage, indeed, one should consider constraints on alpha and on S. Yep, yep. Great. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay. So now let's describe the mean. Let's describe the mean field problem, which is the formulation. Now, remember that in the lecture, I so always the mean field game problem is a fixed point problem. In the first part of the lecture, I said that I was giving mu, which was the distribution of the population, and then I was looking for the fixed point. Here, it will be a bit different because the interaction is in the control. Is in the control. So I will fix a process sum which will be adapted with respect to the common noise filtration. So I will do, as you see, a fixed point over processes here. And you see what it represents. So psi is a given process which is adapted with respect to the common noise filtration. Now what I do is I write the objective function. The objective function of the representative agent that he wants to optimize. So, here this objective function depends on two things: it will depend on psi, this psi that I fix, and on the control alpha over which the consumer can optimize. So, let's see where the xi appears. So, the xi, so here I have the g, I have no interaction. I have no interaction, it is the same as before. I have the L, no interaction as before. So the ψ will represent the average effort of the population, if you want. And this is adapted with respect to the common noise filtration, because I explained you, I come back to my slide with the end players game. Where is my problem? Here. Problem here. I explained to you that when I take the limit here, I will have the conditional expectation. So, in this part here, here I have the conditional expectation with respect to the common noise federation. So, when you take the limit for processes which have a source of common noise, you get to the conditional expectation with respect to the common noise. So, this is the reason for which here. which here we have q hat t which is the expectation of q t if you use the definition owing f to zero plus psi t which will represent the conditioned expectation of the effort of the effort which will be at the equilibrium the effort at the equilibrium knowing the common noise filtration okay so here i have psi and i have another I have psi and I have another psi in the f, where I also have, I just go back to remind you. I have f, which depends on this average. Okay, you see the sum q th plus alpha th. This guy here also, when you take the limit, you will have a conditional expectation known as the common noise filtration. So I replace that conditional expectation by psi. So I just try to give you the intuition why we have the expectation. Give you the intuition why we have the xi and where we replace it, why what do we do with it? And this process q hat, as a reminder, represents the conditional expectation of the process knowing FT0, of the consumption of the standard consumer or of the consumption of the active consumer. Okay, so I have this problem, and now the representative consumer tries to optimize. Representative consumer tries to optimize so he will minimize over all admissible controls. And which is the goal? The goal is to find a process alpha star, which will be adapted to the general situation, okay, which maximizes for the given sal, which maximizes, which minimizes the objective function. So it means that the infimum is attained. And furthermore, I'm looking now for the fixed points. Now, for the fixed point. So, what I want is that the projection with respect to the common noise filtration of this optimal alpha star to be equal to the xi t that I gave as an input, which represents, once again, the average effort of the population. So, if we find such a control, such a process alpha star, then we have a mean field Nash equilibrium. Okay, so such a. Equilibrium. Okay, so such a process alpha star will be the mean field mesh equilibrium in this case. And I will explain also at the end how we can use this equilibria that we get at the limit to construct approximate equilibria for the problem with the end consumers. Because finally, this is the purpose of this theory. Okay. Yes. Okay. I'm a little bit lost. So what is Q and what is S? So I see that in the formulation, the control only appears in S and Q. So S is the related change of the consumption of the active consumers. Okay, and Q. Which is, here is the definition. So S time capital T is the integral from zero to capital T. integral from zero to capital T of alpha S ds. So it's the total change in the consumption. Q is the usual consumption when you don't make any effort. So if I want to see which is the consumption, that's why in the prices here, you see, or here, for the active consumer, the overall consumption at time t is the normal consumption. Is the normal consumption Q plus the effort he's making, alpha it? But isn't alpha a rate? Yes, it's the instantaneous effort, yes. So adding these seems a bit odd because one is a rate and the other one is consumption. But the consumption is also instantaneous, it's a time t. Also instantaneous, it's a time t. Oh, oh, Qt is the consumption at time t. Okay, so that's your rate as a rate as well, yes, expressed in gigawatts or, yeah. So both of them are rates. It's the instantaneous consumption, natural consumption, and the instantaneous effort. And what was QS? And what was QST? QST was the usual consumption of those of the other class of consumers who are the standard consumers who do not make any effort. Oh, I see. Oh, yeah, okay, I see. And then the Q plus ST becomes the consumption of those who are making efforts. Right? Sorry? So when we add the QTI. add the Q Ti and alpha Ti we get consumption of the consumption. QTI plus alpha T represents the consumption of time T of the ICE player who is active. Okay, makes sense. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay, so I have the formulation of the mean field game problem, and now, okay, I'm not. Okay, I'm not entered too much. Sorry, can you just please let me know how much time I still have? About 17 minutes. How much? 17 minutes. 17? Yeah. Okay, thank you. Okay, so I'll not enter too much into details because I'm not. So we use here the second approach that I mentioned to you, which is the probability. Mentioned to you, it is the probabilistic approach to solve this problem. The probabilistic approach is based on four backward systems. So, basically, the idea is that we can obtain a characterization of the equilibria in terms of four backward systems. So, if we have a control, so if I have our function, we need that our function to be strictly convex. Okay, this optimization function with respect to alpha. Optimization function with respect to alpha for a fixed psi. So, if we have a minimizer of this functional, then we have a unique solution of this backward SD. And the forward SD is our process S. So, S is forward because I give the initial condition. The process Y star is backward because I give the terminal condition. The terminal condition and this is linked to P Ds as well because here y star basically represents the derivative of the value function with respect to x. You see that also the terminal condition is the derivative of the terminal function and which also satisfies this what we call coupling condition. Basically, if you want, this characterizes the optimality. This says that alpha star is optimal. Star is optimum. In PDE theory, you remember that I said that I'm looking for the alpha which is maximizing the Hamiltonian. So this is, let's say, a version of the Hamiltonian, okay? But in this case, which is a bit more complex because we have also this conditional expectation of the control with respect to the common misfiltration. So if we have a control which is optimal, then we have a solution of the forward-backward system and this coupling condition. system and this coupling condition is satisfied. And we also have the reverse, which is actually important for us, is that if we have, on the other hand, if we have a solution of this forward backward system, S alpha star, sorry, and y star, and such that this coupling condition is satisfied, then we obtain that alpha will be a minimizer of this functional. And furthermore, if we have that alpha heads. Have that alpha hat star, which is the projection again of alpha star with respect to the common noise filtration, coincides with the x-hat that I gave here at the beginning, then we say that alpha star is a mean field mesh equilibrium. So this is the characterization is using the Pontiagin maximum principle. And now, if we focus on the linear quadratic case, which you have all these. Which you have all these assumptions, um, what you obtain is you obtain a semi-explicit, let's say, a solution of the equilibrium. And to do this, we use this characterization and we use this sense. Actually, we find the solution of this system and such that the coupling condition is satisfied, so we obtain the existing. We obtain the existence of an equilibrium. Okay? I think I will not go into details of the proof because it doesn't, it's maybe too hard without any other details. Anyway, what you have to retain for the moment is that we have in this case a mean field game equilibria, which is a reminder from the first part of the lecture, we have some nice functions phi, which depend on the time and side. On the time side, but here are not simple ODEs, as in the case of the first lecture, but we have a bit more sophisticated equations. We have Licati BSDs and linear BSDs. Okay, because this is due to the fact that we have a linear quadratic problem with random coefficients. The linear quadratic problem that we considered in the first lecture was with deterministic coefficients. Here is with. Deterministic coefficients here is with stochastic coefficients. Okay, so we have the equilibrium, and now the interesting part is that in the linear quadratic setting, using the form of the equilibria, we can show the existence of an epsilon Nash equilibria. So, what we understand by epsilon Nash, I will not give the mathematical definition, but it's an equilibria which is close to the true Nash equilibrium. To the true Nash equilibria, okay. So when epsilon goes to zero, this epsilon Nash equilibria converge towards the true Nash equilibrium, and it is given by this quantity. So basically, it's very simple to construct such an epsilon ash equilibria from this one. How do you do it? As you see, the expressions are basically the same. For these terms in hat, all the terms in hat Hat are the same. I keep them. But what it changes is in the terms where I don't have a hat. What it changes, so if I go back to Q and QST, if I want to construct the QI for the I player, I replace the W here, which was the noise for the representative consumer. Consumer, I replace it by WI for the ICE player. Okay, so this is what you should do in the dynamics. The common noise is the common noise, so you don't do anything. So only through the individual noises W and W bar, you take the individual noises of the players. And by doing this, you can use this formula to construct the epsilon. To construct the epsilon Nash equilibrium. Okay. Now let's show some results. So first of all, now I would like to come back to the fact why did I consider an intensity of the jump process which was stochastic. Because I said, okay, we cannot anticipate the times to know exactly. The times to know exactly to predict the times when the signal will be given to reduce the overall consumption, but we can have an idea about it. And how can we have an idea when the probabilities are the highest is when the overall consumption is very high. So what we did, you remember that I said that my process alpha lambda was adapted with respect to the common noise filtration. So if I go back to my slides. If I go back to my slides here, I said that lambda is Fw0 adapted. I took this condition because I take the process lambda t to be a function of the overall consumption. And the overall consumption will only depend on the common noise. It will not depend on the independent noises. Okay? It will depend only on the common noise. And And the idea is that when the overall consumption would be very high, we can expect, we have a higher probability to expect to get the signal to reduce its consumption. So this is a trajectory of the intensity. You see here on the right-hand side. What we have on the left-hand side, on the left-hand side, we have in gray, we have the overall consumption. And you see that on this scenario, the intensity. Scenario: The intensity: you see that here the consumption is at the highest, and here we have also the intensity, which is much higher. And also here, the intensity, if you look, oops, what I here the intensity is very high, the consumption, the overall consumption is high, and also the intensity is higher. Okay, so we see the fact that. The fact that the intensity, this trajectory of the intensity, follows the trajectory of the average consumption. Again, we are not interested in individual consumptions, we are interested in the overall consumption. And then what we also do is we plot two different consumptions of two different players in blue and in red. Okay, so again, in gray, the average consumption of the In of the population, and in red, and in blue are individual consumptions. Now, you remember that I have this process J, which when is a jump, the process J becomes equals to one and it is one. So this means that the penalty is activated for a time duration of. A time duration of theta hours. For us, theta, I think, was three hours here. So you see, I have a first jump, and we keep the penalty for three hours. And then the jump process goes to zero. And then we have another jump. So we have the other time when another moment when we have the signal to reduce the consumption, and the duration is again three hours. Hours. Okay, so okay, so let's see what happens. So remember, we took here pi is the proportion of active consumers. So we have almost all consumers are active. So here in gray, we have the overall consumption of the active consumers, which is Q1. Consumers, which is Q hat plus alpha hat, and here in green we have the jump episodes, which correspond to my process J, okay, that I have here. And you see that, and this here we have the target process, okay? The target process is a fraction, so the alpha target is a fraction of the usual consumption, and you see that during the jump. And you see that during the jump episode, the overall consumption q hat plus alpha hat is equal to the target, okay, corresponds to the target. And the individual consumptions, which are Q plus alpha, and we have two trajectories for two different consumers, might be different, okay, from the target. So, this is again the interest of the mean field is because we are interested in the overall behavior of the population. In the overall behavior of the population, the overall behavior of the consumption of the population, we are not interested in the individual levels of consumption. And now, what we want to see is which are the impacts on the prices. And here to see the impact on the prices, we consider different fractions of the populations which are active. Pi equals to zero. Uh, pi equals to zero means that all are active. So you see that is in orange. So in orange is during the jump episode, for example, the consumption is at the lowest. And more we increase pi becomes 0.1 and until 0.95 it increases okay during the jump episodes. So the effort. So, the effort is much higher, of course, that when we have more active consumers in the population. And we have also, you see here the prices are lowest and here are higher and higher. So, less active consumers we have during this moment, for example, here. I don't know if you see, we have the prices which are. The prices which are higher and higher. So we have a smoothing, the smoothing effect on the prices. Okay. So due to this dynamic pricing, we have the smoothing effect on the prices, which was expected. And another problem that we consider, and probably Mike will also talk about this kind of problems, are a different type of problems, but related are what we Problems, but related are what we call the mean field control problem. So, when we have a central planner or regulator who wants to optimize the objective of the global population, okay? So, this is a standard control problem. We don't look for any fixed point. It's standard. So, here for we consider two types of central planners problem. A first problem when we have a central planner who optimizes Central planner optimizes the objective of the global population, which includes standard and demand-side management consumers. Okay, so you see that one minus pi represents the proportion of active consumers. So here is the cost of the active consumers. And I have then plus pi, which represents the cost of those standard. Of those standard consumers. And we look for the control which minimizes this functional. A different problem that we consider, and then I will compare with the mean field setting. So this is a technical detail, maybe it's not very important. For the moment, I go to the second problem where we have this aggregator who only optimized the overall cost. Optimize the overall cost of those active consumers. Okay, so he doesn't take into account the consumers who are not active. And what we obtain, if you want to compare, which is the behavior of the overall consumption q hat plus alpha hat when we have the min field game and the central planner who optimizes, for instance, only the For instance, only those consumers who are active, we observe that in the case when we consider the effort of the given by the problem of the central planner, they make more effort than in the mid-field setting. Okay, so the consumption, the overall consumption is more reduced than in the mid-field. Is more reduced than in the midfield setting because in the midfield setting they are selfishly, let's say, optimizing. Each player optimizes for himself, while here it's an optimization problem which takes into account the global population. So again, it's something that we expect that the overall consumption is lower when we consider the central planet problem. And of course, that what we observe is. And of course, that what we observe on the consumption patterns, we observe the same property on the prices, okay? Because the prices depend on an increasing weight with respect to the consumption. So the prices, if we apply the control from the central planner problem, the prices are lower than if we consider the problem in the midfield setting. And I didn't introduce here, but if I Introduce here, but if I consider the central problem where the central planner optimized the overall cost of all consumers, taking into account also those who do not make any effort, then you'll see that the overall consumption will be even lower than in the case of the central planner who only takes into account those active consumers. Because, in that case, basically, you can say that the active consumers have to make effort. That the active consumers have to make effort also for those who do not do anything. An important thing is that, okay, I will say a few words about the numerical resolution, how we solve numerically the mean field gain problem. But what is nice in this model is the fact that the mean field gain problem and the mean field control problem are linked in the sense that if I take the pricing rules P. The pricing rules P and the penalty rule F, I can find the equilibria. So if I take a mean field Nash equilibria for the mid-field game problem with pricing rules PM, FG and FMG, then I have this mean field Nash equilibria will be a mean field control for a similar problem with different. Similar problem with different pricing and penalty rules. Okay, I don't want to spend too much time on this because it would take too much. If you want more details, I can give you. But the main idea of this lemma is that basically the code that we'll use to solve the mean field problem will be can be used to compute also the optimal control for the central planners problem. So as you So, as you see, the resolution is a bit. So, if you want to characterize the mean fiernash equilibria in the linear quadratic case, this can be done by solving this fully coupled system of four or backward equations because you have this one, two, three, four, five, six forward equations, seven forward equations, and then you have two backward. And what we do in this case. What we do in this case, we develop, as I said in the second paper that I presented, several deep learning algorithms for fully coupled FBCs with jumps that we also apply on this model to solve it. And I don't know for those who are maybe familiar with the deep learning algorithm, the results that I presented here were obtained using the global method. Method. I think I will stop here, and in case there are maybe questions. I have a question. I have a question. Sorry. Yeah. Yes. Okay. So, regarding the newer recall scheme, I guess like there is this like a DPSD. There is this like a DBSD method, like uh, back in 2017, and now, like, uh, the way you solve it, you extend it for the case with jumps because we are like now jumps, right? Yeah. So this is extended to the case with jumps, yes. But we also propose, so here I just presented the, we have five different variants and for, I mean, where we have also the The local schemes, or also some regression methods, and we also propose different ways to tackle the jump part. Yeah. I see. Okay. Another question is like, so this is something I'm not sure. So like, is there like a clear-cut case? Like, there are two ways to solve the mean view game. You can solve the couple HJP forker blank in a deterministic way, or you can solve in the Way, or you can solve in the couple FBSD sense. Is there like a clear-cut reason why we prefer one method over another or one? So I think that here we have common noise. So since we have common noise, it's simpler to manipulate four backward systems. Oh, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Okay, because we have the common noise. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Thank you. Sorry. Yes. I have one question about page 55. I think I don't hear very well. Page 55? 55? Yes. Yes. Just ask them what's the dotted line. What's the dotted line on page 55? The dotted line on page 55 what is what? Sorry, if you go to page 55, please. 5-5. 5-5. Okay, I instead. Yes. The dot line? Yes. The dot line is the target. So you remember that when the signal of the operator system is given, we want that the overall consumption to achieve a target and this dot. To achieve a target, and this dot line represents the target. Thank you. And we see that the overall consumption is q hat plus alpha hat, which during the jump episodes is equal to the target, to the dot line. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you very much, Rosanna. See you again tomorrow. Tomorrow, okay. Yeah, see you tomorrow. Good evening. Bye-bye. Yes, I do. CFC. Yes. Or just does it have a fall at the end of the part. I have to say that kind of thing of the value page. So. So obviously I don't know this yeah, but it's very much not very. And then we must have tablets and make sure we have so few outputs. Yeah, there you go. Exactly. But I feel like you know what they're doing. All right. Are we ready to move on to the next part of the exercise? Okay, fantastic. Now, I know that you already paired up into groups and that you're working on a kind of mini-project, I guess, for the summer school. And my desire. School, and my desire is that what I have as the exercise for my component is meaningful as it relates to your mini project and what it is that you're doing as a group. And I've spoken to two groups already that want to take information that you have available for a specific remote community and then use that information to evaluate other sustainable energy systems or Sustainable energy systems, or I talked to one group that wanted to optimize diesel consumption and so forth. And so, what I have written down as an exercise for the afternoon today and maybe for next tomorrow is just some thought processes of what you can look at as you're thinking about energy system design for a remote community. Community. And so, what I can do is walk through a little bit of some of these resources and how you can use them. I'm happy to talk a little bit more about some of the topics that we didn't get to in this morning's lecture. What would be the most meaningful in terms of what you think would be in alignment with your kind of mini project for the summer school?
