It's a pleasure to be here. So, yeah, today I'm going to be talking about recent progress on something called the sigma k loader-Nirenbo problem. So, this is a fully non-linear generalization of the Lohner-Nirenbo problem, also known as the singular Yamarwi problem. So, just to start with some very brief motivation from the two-dimensional case, if I take a smooth bounded domain omega in R2, then it's a simple consequence of the uniformization theorem that I can find a smooth conformed. Theorem that I can find a smooth conformal metric, which I've written here, is u squared times the flat metric, which is complete on the domain and has constant negative curvature. So just a couple of examples. I don't know if this is full screen. So a couple of examples. The domain on the left-hand side here in dark blue is just the disk, and in this case, you just have the standard Quantray metric. You just have the standard Pointray metric. So the graph of U will look something like this, tending to positive infinity at the boundary. And another example here is just an annulus. And once again, the conformal factor U will blow up to infinity at the boundary, and this gives you completeness, at least after proving asymptotics. So what about higher dimensions? So Lohner and Nuremberg started this business in 1974. So if you now take a smooth bounded domain, omega in Rn, where N is now a bigger. Omega in Rn, where n is now bigger than or equal to three, then you can find a smooth conformal metric, which I'm now writing in a slightly different form, which again is complete on omega and now has constant negative scalar curvature. And the way that they approach this problem is by solving the Imabi equation in the negative case. So that's the equation you can see on the top line there. And they impose this infinite boundary data in order to get completeness. So having u tend to infinity at the boundary in itself. U tend to infinity, the boundary in itself is not sufficient to get completeness. You do need some blow-up rate in order to get this, but it turns out that you can use the equation to get these asymptotics and show that this gives you completeness in the end. So, I'll come back later to these asymptotics as we also consider them in the fully non-linear case. So, that was on Euclidean domains, and fourteen years later, Avilez and Macohen extended this result to arbitrary compacts Riemannian manifolds with boundary. Riemannian manifolds with boundary. So, if I give you any compact Riemannian manifold with boundary with no assumption on the background metric, you can find a conformal metric which is complete and has constant negative scalar curvature. So, note that there's a difference here between the case with boundary and the closed case. So, for instance, in the closed case, you would need negative Carby invariant in order to find a conformal metric with negative scalar curvature. In the case of boundary, there's no abstraction to doing this. You find a complete one always. You find a complete one always. And there's since been a number of related works on various topics, so things like asymptotics of solutions, relationships of renormalized volume, existence of solutions in non-smooth domains. And I've just listed a few of the authors here that have worked on these sorts of things. But the question that I want to talk about today is whether we can generalize these results to other notions of negative curvature. Notions of negative curvature. And ideally, when I do this, I want to get existence results that don't make any assumption on the background metric. So I want to find an existence result that applies for any conformal class on a smooth Riemannian manifold with boundary. Okay, and the approach to these generalizations are going to be through k-curvatures. So for now, this applies on any Riemannian manifold. Any Riemannian manifold, it doesn't have to have boundary, it could be non-compact. So I'll introduce the main quantities. So you'll have seen some of these definitions of Poppark in the previous talks, but I will go through them anyway. So this all started with the seminal works of Vyakovsky and Changerskin Yang in the early 2000s. Since then, there's been significant interest in prescribing things that we call K codeches within a fixed conformal class. So let me now explain what it's meant. Let me now explain what it's meant by the thing that you see in the equation through there. So, sigma k, as we saw in the previous, is the kth elementary symmetric polynomial. So, you should think of this, well, you can think of this as acting not just on vectors of eigenvalues, but also acting on self-adjoint 1,1 tensors. It just implicitly acts on the vector of eigenvalues. Or if you like, it acts on a symmetric nature by acting on its eigenvalues. So, that's what the sigma. So that's what the sigma k means. And the AG here, this is the Schauden tensor. So it's just the Riftie tensor minus a dimensional constant times the scalar curvature. And there's many reasons why you might want to consider the Schauden tensor. It arises very naturally in formal geometry. Perhaps the simplest, the most obvious reason, is that it arises as the trace part of the full curvature tensor. So you have this Richie decomposition. Have this Ritchie decomposition, which tells you that you can write the Ruben curvature tensor as the Weyl tensor plus the Schouten tensor called Kalin and Mitsu product with the metric G. You don't have to worry about what that product actually means. The point is that because we know that the Weyl tensor is conformally invariant, all of the conformal transformation properties of the full curvature tensor are encoded in the Schauten tensor. So, sort of a central quantity to them in conformal geometry. So, just a couple. So, just a couple of simple examples. So, if I look at sigma 1, then this thing here just becomes the sum of the entries of my vector. And so, this just gives me the trace of a 1, 1 tensor. So, sigma 1 of plus or minus the Schouten tensor is equal to this plus or minus dimensional constant times the scalar curvature. And at the other end of the spectrum, we have sigma n, which is just the determinant. You can think of the sigma k's in between here as just interpolating between the trace and Between the trace and the determinant. So, one thing that I didn't mention was that you have this G inverse here. This is a 0, 2 tensor, so you can just raise it and index, make it into a 1, 1 tensor, so that its eigenvalues are well defined. Okay, so this leads to some Yamabi-type problems. So, I'll start with the sigma K Yamabi problem in the so-called positive case. So, given a conformal class on a manifold, maybe compact, maybe non-compact. May be compact, maybe non-compact, whatever. The problem is to try and find a conformal metric for which sigma k of the Schouten tensor is equal to one, or any positive constant, just every scale. And it's usually accompanied with this ellipticity condition that you see here. So we don't just look for solutions where this thing is equal to one, but we look for solutions where the Shelton tensor actually belongs to this gamma k plus cone. So this is just a set of vectors in the RN. Set of vectors in Rn for which sigma j is positive for j less than or equal to k. And the reason that we include this is this differential inclusion implies ellipticity of the equation. Non-uniform, but nonetheless we have some ellipticity. And this is typical of fully non-linear equations. Like you think, for instance, the Mont Jam-Pair equation, in general, it's not elliptic. You have to impose some sort of convexity condition to get ellipticity. To get ellipticity, and we have the same sort of thing happening here. So, that's the positive case, and then we also have the negative case. So, everywhere where we had the Schouten tensor before, you just replace it with minus the Schausen tensor, along with the corresponding differential inclusion. And so, we look to solve that equation instead. So, just one thing to point out: I mean, even if you think about the case of the Yamabi equation, if you're on a closed manifold, in general, If you're on a closed manifold, in general, this equation up here is not going to have a solution, right? You would need positive, you might be invariant. So, when we study these equations, you generally accompany them with some assumption on the background metric. For instance, you assume that the background metric itself maybe satisfies this condition here. At least in the setting of closed manifolds, as I mentioned already, when you have boundary, you don't necessarily tend to impose this, but we'll get onto that in a bit. So, these generalize the So these generalize the Yamabi equation, which just corresponds to the case k equal to 1. So what do these equations actually look like? So if I write my conformal metric in the form here, if you write your conformal metric in the form e to the 2u g0, then your new Schouten tensor, A subscript G, is equal to the old Schouten tensor, and then plus these. Tensor, and then plus these terms involving the factor U. So you have this Hessian of U, and then you have these quadratic first-order terms here. And you'll notice this compared to the previous talk, is that the sign in front of the Hessian, in front of the Radiant squared term here, is the opposite of what it was before. This is important when it comes to talking about second derivative estimates. Okay, but with this transformation law, it's then hopefully clear. This transformation law, it's then hopefully clear that when k is bigger than or equal to 2, these equations up here are fully nonlinear. So you have these nonlinear expressions of sigma k acting on the Hessian. So, for instance, sigma 2 of the Hessian is going to involve the Hessian squared and so forth. So, most previous work on these equations has focused on the one at the top, on closed manifolds. So, there has been work done in other settings. Done in other settings. There's too many things to list here, so I'll just focus on this for now. So if you assume that the background metric G0 satisfies this differential inclusion, then in certain cases, the existence of solutions is known. And again, just a small selection of some of the authors that have worked on these problems. Okay, so let's now return to the setting of compact manifolds with boundary. So this is the setting of the So, this is the setting of the original Loder-Dierenberg problem. So, given what I've just talked about with these K curvatures, the natural generalization to consider is the following. So, I give you a smooth, compact Riemannian manifold of dimension bigger than or equal to 3 with non-empty boundary. Can I find a complete conformal metric satisfying the sigma k equation and the differential inclusion? Okay. So notice that I've got the minus sign here because this is generalizing. Sign here because this is generalizing existence results for negative scalar curvature. And in order to attack this problem, we follow the same sort of approach that Lohner Nirenberg and Abeles-McCohen did. Write the equation out explicitly in terms of the conformal factor U, impose infinite boundary data for your conformal factor U, and then the hope is that if you can prove an existence of a solution to this, you can then show that you have the asymptotics. Then show that you have the asymptotics to get the completeness of your solution. And when k is equal to 1, remember sigma k or sigma 1 just gives you the trace. The trace of the Chowton tensor is a multiple of the scalar curvature. So you really just return to the original problem solved by Lohner and Nirenberg on Euclidean domains and Ameles and McCohen on manifolds. And the idea is that for k bigger than or equal to 2, satisfying this differential inclusion here, and This differential inclusion here, and also this equation here, is essentially giving you something that's more negatively curved than just negative scalar curvature. The idea is that we want to push this as far as we can, see how negatively curved we can get, and arbitrary, or how negatively curved we can get within an arbitrary conformal class while staying complete. Okay, so I'll make some remarks and I'll give out some previous results. Some previous results. So, the first remark, which might seem pretty disappointing, but actually it is the basis for a lot of the interesting theory that comes out of these equations, is that smooth solutions may not exist for k bigger than or equal to 2. So there's a relatively simple example that was pointed out by Gursky, Streets, and Warren in 2011. So it says that there's no smooth, complete, conformally flat metric with negative definite Schouten tensor on the higher dimensional. On the higher-dimensional angulus, so Sn across an integral when n is bigger than or equal to 2. So this is pretty easy to see. So let's suppose for a contradiction that such a metric G does exist. Then because we're working on a conformally flat setting, G is conformal to the Euclidean metric. And so the Weil tensor vanishes identically. So if I go back to the decomposition I had before, it simplifies to this nice form CK. Nice formula to see here. Now, if we assume that the Schouten tensor is negative definite, as we have done, you can then use this formula to show that actually the sectional curvatures are negative. So you have a complete metric with negative sectional curvature. Carter and Hadamard would tell you that the universal cover of your manifold is diffeomorphic to Rn, which is not the case for n bigger than or equal to two. Universal cover is just itself not Rn. So should that be D with? Should that be D with the X boundary position? So that's G0. Yeah, G0. Okay, so in this very simple case, smooth solutions may not exist. So I'll just keep the equation at the top there. But it turns out that requiring a smooth solution really is the impending. Solution really is the impediment here. So, Gonzalez, Lee, and Wien, I forgot to mention at the start, so all the new results they talk about today are the joint work with Luke Wien at Oxford. So, they proved existence and uniqueness of locally Lipschitz viscosity solutions on smooth, bounded, Euclidean domains. So, I just said Euclidean domains there, but they require bounded and some sort of smoothness assumption. That's an assumption. The precise definition of viscosity solution is not going to be so important today, so I won't give you the explicit definition. But if you're not familiar with it, it's just a notion of weak solution for fully, well, well suited to fully nonlinear equations defined for only continuous functions. So this is basically the counterpart to the results of Lohner and Nirenberg, who proved the result on Euclidean domains as well. Completely undomained as well. So Lee, Gwyn, and Jean, slightly later, shows that if omega in Rn has boundary with more than one connected component, so something like an annulus, then solutions are never C1. So they're locally lifted shifts but never C1 when k is bigger than or equal to two. So remember when k is equal to one, things are always smooth. When k is bigger than or equal to two, we have these situations where these viscosity solutions Where these viscosity solutions fail to be differentiable, in fact, along a hypersurface. What they do show, however, is that the solutions are smooth near the boundary. So, for instance, you couldn't have a curve tending to the boundary along which the solution is lip shifts. You always have a neighbourhood of the boundary in which your solutions are smooth, which is important for not to look at things like asymptotics of solutions. And just another remark on On some regularity results that have been proved recently. So, Jin Yang Wu has proved that solutions on Euclidean domains are actually smooth away from a closed set of measure zero when k is strictly bigger than m over two. So, there's still lots of open questions we want to tackle in this area regarding sort of refined regularity properties of these solutions. At the moment, this is currently the best known. So, you might be thinking, well, why should we expect maybe a lack of smooth solutions in these sorts of equations? I mean, in the case of the counterexample of Gersky, Streets, and Warren, this followed from Carson-Hadamard, that this non-existence of smooth solutions when k is bigger than or equal to 2 doesn't require negativity of the Schaelton tensor. So, what's the reason for the failure of regularity here? The simplest way. The simplest way to think about it is just that we have a lack of a priori local second derivative estimates when k is bigger than or equal to 2. So, in contrast to C-Wan's talk, where he was proving local second derivative estimates for certain quotient Hessian equations, in this case we don't have these interior estimates in the so-called negative cone. If you don't have second derivative estimates, then it's to be expected that you're not going to have solutions with C2. That you're not going to have solutions with C2 regularity. But one thing that I will point out is some interesting related work of Gursky, Streets, and Warren. So they considered an analogous problem where instead of looking at sigma k minus the Shouten tensor, they were looking at sigma k minus the Ritchie tensor. So they were actually able to prove existence and uniqueness of smooth, complete solutions on any compact remanufacturing. On any compact Riemannian manifold with boundary for any value of k. So, a very strong result. And the reason that they could do better in this case sort of boils down to two things. So, at the top here is basically the conformal transformation law for the Schouten tensor. And what I've written down here is the same conformal transformation law but for the Britch tensor. And you'll notice two main differences. So the first is you now have this Laplacian term. You now have this Laplacian term, which wasn't present up here. And this essentially gives you better ellipticity for the equation. So it actually gives you strict ellipticity, at least locally. And if you also look at the form of the gradient terms, then these have an overall sign for the Ricci tensor. So this gradient u squared times the metric bounds this du cross du just by Cauchy shorts. Coaching shorts. And what this means, particularly this thing here, is it allows them to construct explicit sub-solutions because when they do this explicit construction, all the terms in Carp here can just be thrown away because they always contribute good sign. You don't have this for the Shouten 10%. And having this term here, having better ellipticity, this allows you to get second derivative estimates, which is why their solutions are smooth. I'll come back to this stuff of Gursky Streets and Warren in a bit. Any questions up to this point? Okay, so one of our main goals was to develop the theory in the Riemannian setting. So going back to the top bullet point up here, the existence result was attained on Euclidean domains. Euclidean domains, there's sort of two main ingredients there that rely quite specifically on being Euclidean. One is that they construct exterior solutions, which they can use and apply the comparison principle. And second, the comparison principle itself that they use is currently only known in the Euclidean setting. So we needed to get around those two points. And we were able to do this at least for certain cases. For certain cases, so when k is strictly less than half the dimension. So this is the result. So you take a smooth, compact Riemannian manifold of dimension bigger than or equal to 3 with non-empty boundary, no assumption on the background metric apart from smoothness. Then for any k strictly less than half the dimension, there exists a complete, locally Lipschitz conformal metric which solves this k learning reburn problem. Referred problem. And we were also able to get a bit more of an insight onto the regularity of this problem. And this actually gives a sort of hint as to how we carried out the proof. So if we define, in comparison with the Schouten tensor, this so-called trace-modified Schouten tensor, so this is really sort of the intermediate Schouten tensors that were talked about earlier, but just rephrase slightly. So I introduced So I introduce this parameter tau here. Then when tau is equal to one, this is just the Shaupton tensor. When tau is equal to zero, it's just a multiple of the Rucci tensor. And then for other values of tau, you get other things. What we proved is that for each tau less than one and k less than n over two, you can find a unique, smooth, complete conformal metric, g tau, satisfying this sigma k type loner effect problem. So the difference here is Problem. So the difference here is that we're now assuming that tau is strictly less than one, whereas up here tau is equal to one. So we have these smooth solutions to these sort of approximating equations, which in themselves are, I think, of independent interest. And the Lipschitz solution, when tau is equal to one, is then obtained by taking the limit of these smooth solutions, ensuring that we have uniform C1 estimates along this sequence, and then the limit in the standard. Uh yeah, the limit in a standard way. Okay, so I won't go into too many of the technical details of the proof. I'll just sort of give the outline. So it can be deconstructed roughly into four main steps. And the first of these is, I guess, the most non-trivial. So I'll spend a bit more time explaining this step. The procedure The procedure in itself is somewhat standard. So, remember, we're looking to solve an equation with infinite boundary data. How would you go about doing this? You just set finite boundary data and then take that boundary data to infinity and hopefully get something on a limit. So, that's what we do. So, we fix tau less than one, and for each m, what's the one, two, the three, and so forth, we show that there exists a smooth solution, which I'm indexing now by tau and m, to the Dirichlet boundary value problem with finite boundary data. Value problem with finite value data. And as Gursky, Streets, and Warren do in the case of the Ricci tensor, the idea is to use the continuity method here, where we take the parameter to be in this tau entry. So roughly speaking, when t is equal to minus infinity, this returns the scalar curvature equation. So I'm sort of brushing something under the rug there that you can think existing gets very negative. This rich return. Very negative, this Richard term becomes irrelevant, and we're just left with the scalar curvature. We know that we have a solution in the case of scalar curvature, so that gives us a point to start the continuity method, and then we work our way up to any value of tau strictly less than one. But for the reasons that I also mentioned on the previous slide, we need some significant changes to work with the Shouten tensor in comparison with the Ritchie tensor. Okay, so once you've done that step, step two is relatively routine. You just take M to. Relatively routine, you just take m to infinity. By the comparison principle, you have an ordering of your solutions, and so you get something in the limit with infinite boundary data. And then you need to prove asymptotics of your solution, at least to zero thought back. So we show that our solutions, u tau, as the distance to the boundary tends to zero, acts like the log of the distance to the boundary. And if you rescale this constant on the right-hand side, and this constant here, you can make it to be equal to zero. And this is enough to get you the completeness of your method. Get you the completeness of your metric, and also it can be used to get uniqueness for tau less than one. And once you've done this, you then take tau to one, and this gives you a Lipschitz solution to your original problem. And as I said, you need to ensure that your C1 estimates are uniform with respect to tau. Remember, they're not going to be uniform with respect that sorry, the second derivative estimates are not going to be uniform with respect to tau. These will blow up, but you need to ensure what the first derivative estimates are. What the first derivative estimates are. Okay, so if you believe me, that these three sets here are somewhat routine. That's certainly true for sets four and two. Three has some technicalities, but not overly interesting to talk about. Now, I will talk about some of the main ideas that go into step one. Okay, so for any of you that are familiar with fully nonlinear equations, the continuity method is a very typical approach of these sorts of things. Very typical approach of these sorts of things. And within the continuity method, there's three things that you need. You need a starting point, which as I've explained, is the scalar curvature equation. You need to prove openness, which corresponds to invertibility of the linearized operator. I claim that that's somewhat standard. The difficult part is proving a priori estimates to get closedness. So I'll talk about the a priori estimates. I've just written the equation up here explicitly in terms of u. Explicitly in terms of u, you'll notice that when t is less than 1, we now have this additional Laplacian term. And if you plug in t equal to 0, then you get the conformal transformational of the Ricci tensor. So recall that the boundary data in step one is u equal to some finite number m. And as I just said, the key is to obtain a priori C2 estimates. And why C2? Y C2. Once you have C2 estimates, you have uniform ellipticity of your equation. Once you have uniform ellipticity, you can use the fact that sigma k to the 1 over k is concave on this cone of ellipticity. And then you can apply the work of Evers and Krilov to get C-Walfer estimates. And once you have this, you can then apply Schauer theory to get higher order estimates and classical regularity. So let's start with the upper bound. This turns out to be pretty easy. If the maximum is attained on the boundary, then On the boundary, then u is less than or equal to m, so pass the upper bound. If it occurs at an interior point, then the Hessian at this point, x0, is going to be non-positive definite. The gradient is going to vanish. So if I throw these facts back into the equation that I have at the top, then I'll get that e to the 2ku at my maximum point is less than or equal to some quantity which depends only on the background metric. So this gives me an upper bound for u. Gives me an upper bound for you, depending just on the background entry. So very simple in that case. You try and do the same thing to get the lower bound, you'll run into trouble. You let x0 now be the minimum point, and you try and do this method. Then what you'll get is e to the 2ku at the minimum point is bigger than or equal to something that could be negative. Eventually it's always bigger than zero. Zero, so it tells you nothing. So the lower bound is the key difficulty. Mursky, Streets, and Warren dealt with it in the Ritchie case by constructing this explicit sub-solution that I mentioned, using the fact that the gradient terms have this overall sign. We don't have this in our case, so we need a different approach. And for this, we develop two new ingredients. So the first thing that we do is we prove a uniform lower bound in a uniform. We prove a uniform lower bound in a uniform neighbourhood of the boundary, and then we prove a local gradient estimate, which is allowed to depend on the upper bound, but not the lower bound. And we use this local gradient estimate to propagate the lower bound to the whole manifold. So if you think of this being your manifold and this is the boundary, then if in some uniform neighborhood here you get a lower bound, you make a lander equal to minus c. U bigger than or equal to minus c, then if you combine it with the gradient estimate, the gradient estimate controls how quickly you can decrease. The gradient estimate itself will blow up as you get close to the boundary, but because you're only applying it in a uniform distance away, this controls how much you can decrease as you go into the interior. So these two things together give you the global lower bound. And interestingly, both of these ingredients crucially use the assumption that k is less than 1 over 2. So, how do we get this lower bound near the boundary? The idea is to construct suitable barrier functions, which we do on sufficiently small annuli. So if I take an annulus of inner radius r minus and outer radius r plus, then what we're able to do is construct an explicit subsolution on such an annulus. So we construct a subsolution gw where w is radially decreasing, so sigma. Decreasing, so sigma k at the minus the Schaelton tensor of GW is bigger than or equal to 1 inside the annulus. We're going to construct it so it takes the same boundary data as our solution on the inner sphere, and such that it tends to minus infinity on the outer sphere. So the picture looks something like this. And once we've constructed such a sub-solution, we basically sort of transplant these along the boundary of our manifold to use them as barrier functions. To use them as barrier functions. So if I attach a column neighbourhood n to my boundary and I transplant an annulus up here in such a way that the inner sphere just touches the boundary by manifold and the outer sphere goes somewhere inside. Then because by construction my subsolution w is equal to m on the inner sphere and it's radially decreasing, it means it's going to be less than or equal to my solution Be less than or equal to my solution along this whole portion of the boundary of n. My construction is equal to minus infinity on that part of the shaded region. So we get that w is less than or equal to u on the boundary of that shaded region. And the comparison principle then gives us that w is less than or equal to u in the whole of this shaded region. And this gives me a uniform lower bound, at least on this portion, but then just a standard covering argument gives me the lower bound. At the lower bound around the whole battery. And it turns out, so we only recently sort of figured this out, that such local barriers do not exist when k is bigger than or equal to n over 2. So there is no, k is bigger than or equal to n over 2. There is no w which satisfies this inequality here, which w tends to minus infinity at either boundary component of an ambulance. Boundary component of an angle. So these sorts of things are very specific to k less than m over 2. Okay, so that's the lower bound near the boundary. Then we prove the local gradient estimate. So from this picture here, that's what allowed us to then propagate to the interior. And the point is, one important point is this local gradient estimate is independent of the tau. So it holds uniformly as tau goes to one. And it takes the following forms. And it takes the following form: so the supremum of the gradient on a ball of radius r is less than or equal to some uniform constant c1 times r to the minus 1 plus e to the supremum of u on a slightly bigger ball. So the fact that we have this r to the minus 1 here shows why you need to be a sort of uniform distance away from the boundary, otherwise this thing could blow up. And these sorts of local gradient estimates have been proved in the positive case before by Professor By Professor Wang, for instance, and we showed these in the negative case. So, actually, in the case for sigma k equations, this was proved by a student of Matt Gursky in 2009, so Komratai. No one was really aware of this. We only found it a few months into while studying this problem that had actually been done before. He never published it outside of his PhD thesis, but nonetheless, he did it in. Nonetheless, he did it in his PhD thesis. But actually, in our paper, we're not just considering the sigma K equations, even though that's what I've been talking about here. We applied them to slightly more general equations, which required us to get a new proof of this gradient estimate. And recently, so this isn't going to be relevant to this result, but it's definitely important to point out. Important to point out. So recent work of Chu, Li, and Li also proves that this gradient estimate up here holds for k strictly bigger than n over 2. And they actually give counterexamples when k is equal to n over 2. This is a really weird phenomenon. It doesn't happen in the positive coherence case, but does in the negative coherence case. But remember, even if we have these estimates here for k bigger than n over 2, this construction on the previous slide still requires k less than n over 2. That still requires a lesser than 1002. So this doesn't actually help us, at least for now. Okay, so this is sort of just an explicit explanation of how you then get the lower bounds. I'll just quickly run through it. So we know that u is bigger than or equal to some uniform constant in a uniform neighbourhood of the boundary. We also know from a couple of slides back that the supremum of u is uniformly controlled from above. Is uniformly controlled from above. So if I then look at this term in the gradient estimate, this is also uniformly controlled. So the infimum of U is bigger than or equal to the infimum it takes near the boundary minus the diameter of the manifold times the supremum of the gradient away from the boundary. All of these things here are controlled uniformly, so we get the core boundary. Okay, so this gives us the global C0 estimate. Use the global C0 estimate. Once you have this, work of other authors from years ago gives you the remaining estimates. So in particular, in this negative cone case, you can appeal to the work of Gersky and Vyaklovsky, which gives you the global gradient estimate, so something that doesn't blow up as you turn to the boundary, which upholds for all tau less than or equal to one, and also gives you the global Hessian estimate, which, just to reiterate, does degenerate as tau less than equal to equal. Rate does degenerate as to how it is dependent on that. Okay, so that is an explained step one. Any questions? Okay, so what about k bigger than or equal to n over 2? So a large part of our existence proof that I just talked about, so the case where k Talked about, so the case where k is strictly less than n over 2, concerns obtaining this local boundary C0 s to n. So I say local here because this argument here doesn't require you to be a solution on the whole manifold. As long as you're a solution with this given boundary data in this portion of the data in this portion of the near the boundary, you can apply this argument to get the lower bounds. This is why we call it a local boundary. So, given that this was an important part of our proof of k less than n over 2, when we were looking to try and extend this existent result to all values of k, we tried to replicate this sort of idea and get a local boundary C0 estimate for k bigger than or equal to n over 2. And so, in upcoming work, we show that actually such estimates fail in general. So, we get counterexamples for all k bigger than or equal to n over 2. m over 2. So to explain these solutions in a bit more detail, I'm going to write my conformal metrics now in a slightly different form. So I'm going to write it as w to the minus 2 times dx squared. So I'm just going to talk about the Euclidean setting for now. So previously when we were looking at infinite boundary data for u, this will now correspond to zero boundary data for w. Okay, so we proved the following. Okay, so we proved the following. So let k be bigger than or equal to n over 2, then there exists a one-parameter family of smooth solutions to the sigma k lohnen-Nurenberg problem in the upper half space in Rn. So I change this constant one to something depending on n and k. It's just going to be for convenience. You don't have to worry about what that constant is. So we find a one-parameter family smooth solution. We find a one-parameter family of smooth solutions to this equation, where each solution depends only on the xn variable and satisfies the following properties. Okay, so the first of these is that the initial solution in this one parameter family, w0, of xn, is just equal to xn. And this is the hyperbolic solution. Have xn to the minus 2 times dx squared. This is just the hyperbolic metric in the upper half plane. Hyperbolic metric in the upper half plane. No surprises here that this should be a solution. We're talking about Hegas and curvature equations. The hyperbolic metric in the upper half plane should always be a solution. Indeed, we have this. Sketch what's going on. So our initial solution, w0 of xn is just equal to xn, so it looks like this. Ws at 1 is equal to At 1 is equal to 1 plus s. So this value here, of course, is just equal to 1. And then every possible value here is attained where we s. Ws prime is bigger than or equal to 1, so in particular, every solution is bigger than or equal to the hyperbolic solution. We also have an ordering, so if a is less than b, then wa is less than w b for all positive values of xn. So basically you get a So basically you get a one parameter family of solutions whose profile curves essentially foliates the region above the minimal solution here. So you get something like this. And these, as s tends to infinity, start growing arbitrarily quickly like that. And the final condition is that these things are complete solutions. Complete solutions. So I haven't actually said here why this gives us counterexamples, and that comes from this condition here. So for all little m less than big m, the infimum on an interval of ws tends to positive infinity as s tends to infinity. So if I were to take any arbitrary interval maybe looking like this, so little m big m And I take any point inside of here and let s tend to infinity, then the corresponding solution is going to tend to infinity at that point. So these things sort of uniformly tend to positive infinity near xn equal to 0. And this gives us the counterexamples to the local boundary C0 estimates. So, what does this actually mean in the context of the loan-Nirenberg problem, the sigma-k loan-Nirenberg problem? The sigma k-lon in your inboat problem. So it demonstrates that when k is bigger than or equal to n over 2, you really need some sort of global construction or global assumption in order to get existence of solutions. You can't rely on this sort of local estimates. So, also having found this one parameter family of solutions when k is bigger than or equal to n over 2, the natural question to ask is: do these constants? To ask is, do these constitute impossible solutions? And the answer to this is yes. So we have the following Euville-type theorem, which actually applies just for continuous viscosity solutions. So if I take a positive continuous function w in the upper half plane, which satisfies the sigma k Loma Nironberg problem in the viscosity sense, then we have the following. So first of all, if k is less than n over 2, then w is the hypothological. Over 2, then W is the hyperbolic solution, so you have uniqueness. If K is bigger than or equal to N over 2, then W is one of the solutions from the one-parameter theorem in the previous theorem. So we get a complete classification of all solutions to this problem in the upper half space. And we actually found this sort of surprising for the following reason. So if K is bigger than L, then the is bigger than L, then the constraint that lambda belongs to gamma k plus is more restrictive than lambda belonging to gamma L plus. So if I just look for instance in the two-dimensional case then the cone gamma2 plus is just this region here and gamma one would be this bigger region you see here. C here. And so it's more restrictive to impose that something belongs to the code gamma 2 than it does for gamma 1. And if it's more restrictive, then you should maybe expect there to be fewer solutions to your equation. But we have the opposite phenomenon here. So when k is bigger than or equal to n over t, you have infinitely many solutions. When k is less than n over t, you have a unique solution. So it's a bit weird. Okay. So I'll just finish with a few remarks and some open problems. So everything I've talked about today has been sigma k loninary problem. There's actually nothing, there's sort of no structure in the sigma k problems that we crucially need. We apply, we obtain these results in a much more general context. So we look at equations just of the form f of minus the Sharp intensity equal. F of minus the Chaupin tens equal to one, along with the corresponding cone condition for f and gamma satisfying standard assumptions. So for instance, gamma being a convex cone with vertex at the origin, f being concave, and so forth. And there's a sort of dictionary, if you like, between the sigma k problems and the assumptions that we oppose there, and the ones for these general codes, which sort of motivated my question earlier in the previous talk. You have this distinction between k less than n over 2 and k bigger than or equal to n over 2, which corresponds to the following. So, if I give you an arbitrary cone, you can define this constant mu gamma plus to be the unique number for which minus mu gamma plus 11111 belongs to the boundary of the cone. And it turns out that mu gamma plus being bigger than 1 corresponds to k being less than n over 2, and mu gamma plus being less than 2. And mu gamma plus being less than or equal to 1 corresponds to k being bigger than or equal to n over 2. So any result that you store for k less than n over 2 holds, and this holds, and likewise for k bigger than or equal to n over 2. And what about the regularity assertions? So we were talking about this difference between tau being less than one, where you have unique smooth solutions, and tau equal to one, where you only have Lipschitz viscosity solutions. Well this corresponds to the type of the cone. To the type of the cone. So any results that we obtain for tau less than one extend to this more general setting when vector 1, 0, 0 belongs to gamma, and our results obtained for tau equal to 1 extend to the case where 1, 0, 0 belongs to the boundary of gamma. And for those of you that may be familiar with the more classical work of Caffarelli, Nirren, Berg, and Spruck, where they look at these Hessian equations, they call this thing here a comb of type 1, and this thing here a comb. Of type 1 and this thing here cone of type 2. And generally speaking, you can get much stronger results in type 2 cones than you can in type 1. Okay, so the obvious open question from all of this is, does the sigma k Bona-Nurenberg problem always admit a Lipschitz viscosity solution when K is bigger than or equal to n over 2? Still don't know how to do this. As I said, it will require some sort of global construction. And if the answer is no, so if you can find a counterexample, then under what conditions can it be sold? So, one condition is to simply assume that the background metric already belongs to your cone. So, if you assume that the background metric is in your cone, then this is essentially giving you a sub-solution. And so, you end up with this sort of typical result in the theory of fully non-linear TVs where Fully non-linear DVDs, where the existence of a sub-solution is equivalent to the existence of a solution. It's not quite the case here, it's not quite true because, okay, we're having infinite boundary data, so what does it mean to be a sub-solution in that case? But if I'm just talking about what equation is satisfied on the interior, then the idea holds. So if you assume that the background metric is already in the cone, then Yuan in 2022 proved existence solutions for the train. Proved existence solutions for the trace-modified problem. So, not for the case of the Schouten tensor, but for the trace-modified Schouten tensor. And in upcoming work with Luke, we prove the general case. So, if you assume that you have an admissible background metric, in fact, you only need this to be satisfied in a viscosity sense, then you can find a Lipschitz solution which is complete for any value of k. And this, of course, is a global assumption. Assumption. One more open question: Is the Lipschitz viscosity solution unique in the non-Euclidean setting? So I mentioned earlier that there was this comparison principle, so due to Li, Royan, and Bo 1. So they were able to prove the necessary comparison principle in Euclidean domains, but it's still not known to hold in the Riemannian setting. If you can prove that, then you'll get uniqueness of the richest. Then you'll get uniqueness of the Lichetz viscosity solution. And I'll just finish with a somewhat more open-ended question. So, the loan and Nurenberg problem, the one addressing scalar curvature, so the singular Yamabi problem, has found recent application in the study of renormalized volume, sub-manifold geometry, and other areas. So, again, there's some of the authors that have worked on these sorts of problems. And so, can the solutions to the sigma k loner-Nirenberg problem offer? Leiner-Nurenberg problem offer anything new here. I know that the paper of Graham and Gursky considered the sigma 2 liner-Nurenberg problem in this context, but as far as I'm aware since then, there hasn't been too much work that's been done on this front. So if any of you are interested in talking about that, then I'd be very keen. Okay, thank you.
