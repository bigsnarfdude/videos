Okay, so let me start by thanking the organizers for the invitation. Very happy to be able to speak here, even though I'm not able to be there in person, unfortunately. So the title of my talk is Differential Invariance of Kube Space-Times. It's a joint project that I worked on together with Boris Kruglikov. And the talent And the tale of my talk is the following. We'll start with a short introduction. I will introduce all of you to quant space-times, define what they are and why they are kind of interesting for us. Then I will talk about jets and kind of put the Kunt space-times in the define them in the JET language. And in the end, I will start. End, I will start to show you some differential invariants of these space-times. So, introduction. The equivalence problems of Laurentian manifolds under the Lee pseudo-group action of local diffeomorphisms is an important problem in mathematics and physics. And there are several approaches for solving it. So, one is through. So, one is through scalar polynomial curvature invariants, which are obtained by complete contractions of the Riemann tensor, its covariance derivatives, and their tensor products. Another method is through Cartan invariants. They're obtained from the structure functions of the absolute parallelism on the reduced frame bundle and their derivatives. And then, what we will concentrate on today is the rational. Is the rational scalar differential invariants, which are rational invariants of the Lee pseudo group of local diffimorphisms acting on the space of Jetson metrics. Okay. So of course there is, well, these methods kind of intersect and in some sense, well, they all give invariants, but there are slightly different flavors and. And yeah, and we will see one of them clearly today. Because we will use the last approach to solve the equivalence problem of degenerate Kunt space-times, which is a class of metrics that cannot be separated by the first approach. And this was kind of why we were interested in this problem, because the problem cannot be solved with this. The problem cannot be solved with these invariants, so let's try to see if we can find another way to solve the equivalence problem. Yeah, and in the case of a rational scale differential invariants, the invariants are generated by a finite number of differential invariants and invariant derivations. So the task is more or less to find generating set of invariants and derivations. Derivations. Okay, so let's first start by looking at the case of generic metrics. We want to find any or let's say distinguish metrics that are different under the well that are not related by coordinates transformation. Coordinates transformation. And it can be done, for example, in the following way. So let G be a Lorentzian metric on a manifold M, and let rich be the corresponding Ricci operator. So you raise one index of the Ricci tensor. And then you can compose them. And if you compose them I times, we just denote it by Richie I. Just we denote it by Richie and then we can construct n scalar invariants basically by taking the traces of these operators we get and for generic metrics these n invariants will be independent functions on the manifold m and they can be chosen as local coordinates on m so we can then write g in these coordinates Then write g in these coordinates. And here gij are functions of the i's. And then two metrics can be distinguished by simply comparing the corresponding functions g i j over the i's. So basically go through this for two different metrics, compare the functions g i j. If they are the same functions, then they are equivalent, and if they are not, then they are not equivalent. Are not equivalent. And as we will see, these functions, the i's and j's, they can be thought of as restrictions of invariant functions on third-order jet space of symmetric power of the cotangent bundle to the restriction to the prolongation of a particular section of this bundle. And they will in some sense. And they will, in some sense that we will make clear, generate all invariants of any order. So, this was kind of just the introduction, and we will go through this several times. But this is the main idea. We want to find n invariants and use them as generators. Yeah. So now let me tell you what Kunt spacetimes are. So a Lorentzian metric G on an n-dimensional manifold M is a Kunt metric if there exists a vector field L such that all of these conditions hold. The Ernable G is the Lavish Vita connection. And these are kind of technical definitions, so don't worry to Definitions, so don't worry too much about it. We will soon find a simpler way to think about it. And also, we call G a degenerate Kuntmetric if, in addition, the Riemann tensor is aligned and of algebraically special type 2, and double G or the coherent derivative is aligned and of algebraically special type 2. So, again, some quite technical conditions, but It turns out that for any quantum metric, there exist local coordinates u x1 xn minus 2 to v such that g takes this form here. So we have n minus 2 functions here and one function here. Both of them depend on all coordinates. And we have these functions here where you can think of ij as being ij as being symmetric indices and they do not depend on v so that's important and yeah so so any cunt metric takes this form in suitable coordinates and then the degenerate metrics they are the ones that in addition satisfy these two These two equations. So wi vv is zero and h v is zero, partial derivatives here. And we also notice that the l above here, it's just partial v okay, so this is kind of the object we'll be working with now. And yeah, let me just Uh repeat what the question is. So we say that two metrics g and g tilde on m are locally equivalent if there exists local diffeomorphisms taking one to the other. And the important task is then to identify equivalent truth metrics and to distinguish inequivalent ones. And as I mentioned, one of the standard ways is to use polynomial curvature invariants, meaning total contractions of the curvature tensor, its covariant theory. Of the curvature tensor, its covariant derivative, and their tensor product. But not all spacetimes can be separated by these invariants, and in particular, in dimension n equal to 4, the degenerate quant spacetimes are exactly those that cannot be separated by polynomial curvature invariants. So, yeah. Therefore, we must use other invariants. So, to simplify the problem, as I said, we will use coordinates in which g takes the form here. But then we should also restrict the diffimorphisms preserving this form. And this pseudo group of diffimorphisms was found for dimension n equal to 4 by Pravda, Pravdovak, Kohli, and Milson in 2000. Pravdova, Colli and Milson in 2002, but actually, it's basically the same for all dimensions. So, and it looks like this. So, here C is a local diffeomorphism on the line. A i's are diffeomorphisms or invertible transformations on the x coordinates that are parametrized by u. By u. That's basically what these two conditions say here. And B is an arbitrary smooth function. We can also find the corresponding Lie algebra. It consists of these vector fields here. And now C, A, I and B's are arbitrary smooth functions. Are arbitrary smooth functions of the indicated variables. So it's in particular it's infinite dimensional and yeah, it still becomes quite an interesting problem to solve. So let me try to reformulate the problem a little bit. So we will consider Kuntmetrics of the form one on the previous slide as sections Slide as sections of this bundle here. And f is some open set in Rn. It will be clear soon what it is. And N is just and just two. And we will use coordinates u axis and b as coordinates on m and these here as coordinates on Rn. So before they were functions, but now they are coordinates on the fibers of this bundle. Bundle and yeah, if you count these, you will see that it's exactly entries to them. And then the domain F is defined by the requirement that the matrix, symmetric matrix Hij is positive definite, just because we're interested in non-degenerate metrics. Okay, and then the vector fields of G, of the Lie algebra of shape-preserving transformations, they can be lifted to F times M by requiring the lifts to preserve the horizontal symmetric form. So we have this kind of universal form. Now H, Wi, and Hij are the coordinates on the fibers, but if Coordinates on the fibers. But if you restrict this to a section, then you kind of get back exactly the metric in the formula one on the previous slide. So this reconstructs the metric if you compose it with the section. And yeah, and we require the lift to preserve this. So the lift X hat or the vector field X. Vector field x. This was just a general vector field from before. It's found by adding some vertical terms here and then determining the coefficients a, b, and c from the equation the derivative of g along x at equal to zero. Okay, it's a straightforward computation, and the result looks like this. And by the way, we sum over. Um, and by the way, we sum over all repeated indices always. So, this is how the vector fields look on the total space of the bundle. Now, let us introduce the space of jets. We use the notation jk pi. If you note the space of k jets. If you notice space of kjets of sections, I assume that most people here at the conference are familiar with kjets or with gefts, so we'll just go quickly through it and agree on the notation. So choice of coordinates f times m gives a natural set of coordinates on jkÏ€. For example, on j1, we'll use the following coordinates here. So we have these on the total space of the bundle. Total space of the bundle, and then we have kind of the first order derivatives, but they're just coordinates. And if g is a section of pi given by these functions, h i j tilde w i tilde h, use the tilde to separate them from the coordinate coordinates. So yeah, then it belongs naturally. Yeah, then it prolongs naturally to a section which we denote by J one key of the bundle J one pi to m and it looks exactly like this. It's kind of the yeah in the normal way and of course this this extends to any order in in the obvious way but of course we're not interested in arbitrary sections but Interested in arbitrary sections but in sections satisfying certain differential equations and the differential equations look like this. So for Kuhn spacetimes, we have this first order equation. It's a very simple system. Just V derivative of h i j equal to zero. It defines a submanifold in j one pi. If we take all derivatives of this equation, Derivatives of this equation and add them, we get a sub-manifold in J2Ï€. And continuing this, we have EK, which is a sub-manifold in JK pi. So this was the general Kuhn spacetimes. The degenerate Kuhn spacetimes define a sub-PDE inside of EK called tilde EK and it is defined by this. By this. So, first order, the first order conditions are exactly the same. We have n minus two additional second order conditions here. And then when we go to third order, we differentiate the second order conditions and we add a new third order condition. And after this, when we go to higher order, it's just It's just to differentiate this and add to the other system to get tilde EK instead of JKÏ€. It's the promunation. And of course, the meaning of the significance of this is the following. So if G is a section of pi, then the image of the section JK of G is JK of G is contained inside EK if and only if G is a crit metric of the form one. So this is kind of why the geometric definition of a PDE makes sense. And the same statement holds for tilde EK and degenerate kinetometrics. And as explained above, any vector field in G belongs to a vector field on JK point. Field on Jki. And the prolonged vector field is tangent to both equations at every order, which means that G actually consists of symmetries. It's kind of obvious, but it's good to keep in mind. So it takes solutions to solutions. And now we can reformulate our problem. Reformulator problem. So basically, we want to distinguish sections of pi satisfying e or tilde e under the equivalence relation given by the Lie algebra G, well, or equivalently the corresponding Lie pseudo group. So the space of sections and the Lie algebra G are both of infinite dimensions. So it may look like a difficult problem, but what But what one thing that will save us is that each of the manifolds ek until ek are of finite dimension, and so are the g orbits on these. So in order to find a generating set of invariants, we will start by just considering invariant functions on these ek until ek of low order, and then we will be able to generate everything from these so. So let me define differential invariants. A differential invariant of order k is a function i on ek or tilde ek, depending on which we are considering, which is constant on orbits of g so the differential invariants are solutions to the system. So if you yeah. Yeah, the derivative along the flow of these vector fields are zero. And the rational differential invariance for k form a field whose transcendence degree is equal to the codimension of a generic orbit. Yeah, so the following statement follows from the global version of the Literature theorem. Global version of the Liederstead theorem due to Kirikov and Nishagin, and it says that the algebra of rational differential invariant separates orbits in general position, and it is generated by a finite number of differential invariants and invariant derivations. So this theorem goes back to Li, but important well, maybe the important contribution of Private Onyoshagin is to realize that. Is to realize that the Rosenich theorem can be used in the fibers of the jet bundles because the prolongation of this prolonged action acts rationally in the fibers. So invariance will be rational, and we will see that. See that. Yeah, so let us again revisit the question of distinguishing metrics. So now a differentially invariant i is a function on ek and by restricting it to a section g of pi, we obtain a function on m. So this j k g This JK G it goes it's a map from M to J K or if G is a solution actually to EK and I is a function of EK so this composition is a function of on M and now assume that we have n invariants I1 to IN that are independent when restricted to G. So we can write it like To G. So we can write it like this. Then they can be used as local coordinates in M and we can write G in terms of B's. This is what I told you at the beginning of this talk. So then two metrics that are written in these invariant coordinates can be compared directly, and they are equivalent if and only if the functions kij of the i's are equal. The ice are equal. So let us see what we can do for general quantum metrics first. So for generic quantmetrics, we may take invariants that I mentioned in the beginning, so just the traces of composed Richie operators. And now I I have not restricted to any section yet. So, this is why I use this hat notation. So, we have this relation here, so non-equality, which holds on the Sovietsky opens at E3 and should define what hat D means. And it is the horizontal differential. The horizontal differential is defined on the function on the equation by this formula here. So, basically, it's like the exterior differential, but instead of the partial derivatives, take total derivatives. And the reason this is important is that it satisfies, well, basically, when you restrict to the metric or to the section, it behaves like the exterior difference. Behaves like the exterior differential. So on this Sariski open set, these horizontal one forms form an invariant horizontal co-frame. And we can also construct a dual frame of invariant derivations. So they are just a linear combination of total derivatives with A, B, and C. With A, B, and C must be that are determined by these equations here. So they are dual. This is what it says here. We call them stressed derivatives with respect to n different invariants, and they commute. And the importance of this is that basically when you restrict to a section, A section, then the invariants become functions on m, and these become partial derivatives along these functions with respect to these functions. So now we can express the horizontal symmetric form G as k or j times. Kij times these horizontal one forms. And here Kij are rational differential environments of order three. So this is basically exactly the same as in the beginning, but now I did not specify any section or any metric. So these are just things that live on the jet bundles. And And the statement is the following: The algebra of rational differential invariant is generated by these n-invariants i, the kij's, and the invariant derivations that we get from the n-invariants i. Okay, so this was kind of the story of the general. the story of the general kunt met metrics. And it's it's the same as if you wanted to if you wanted to separate completely general metrics, you could use the same approach. But it does not work if you consider the generate print metrics. Because for these metrics, these And one forms here, or these invariants are not horizontally independent. So, by horizontally independent, I mean that when you restrict to a generic section, they are independent functions. So, I need this adjective horizontal is to distinguish it from just independent because we can think of these invariants as functions on the jet space. Invariants as functions on the jet space, and then there are much more independent invariants. So yeah, if you study these n-invariants that we got from the Ricci tensor, we will notice that none of them depend on V. So total derivative of V with respect to V. V with respect to v of ii is equal to zero for all of them. So, this is why we cannot use this approach anymore. Or, well, we need to find a complete set of invariants in another way. But in general, we have n minus one independent invariants, so we can at least try to use them. So, let us take n minus one. Uh, take n minus one horizontally independent invariants from the above set j one to j n minus one and we let nabla one to nabla n minus one be the g duals to the total differentials of these environments. So these are one forms, horizontal one forms. We can use the horizontal symmetric form G to horizontal symmetric from G to raise indices and construct n minus one independent invariance derivations. The invariants j1 to j n minus 1 can be chosen such that na2 to naba n minus 1 are spaced-like vector fields after restriction to a degenerate group metric. So this will make the matrix G naught I na J noble i double j from 2 to n minus 1 positive definite and this means that we can define the nth derivation by this set of n equations so of course the derivation has n components and we have here n algebraic equations and by solving them we can find an invariant derivation nabla n. This completes the frame. This completes the frame. We can construct the horizontal co-frame dual to this frame. And then we can write our horizontal symmetric form in terms of this frame. Then we will get some coefficients here, L ij, that are differential invariance order 3. So, in this case, since we didn't use stressel derivatives, we made the invariant derivations in a different way. We have non-trivial commutation relations. And here, Cijk are differential invariants of order 3. And we have the following result. So, the algebra. So the algebra differential invariance is generated by the differential invariants Lij, Cijk, and the invariant derivations nablai. We have made no attempt, and this is kind of the general. In all of this work, we made very little attempt to minimize the number of generators. We will soon see in Soon see in when we go to dimension three and four that it must be close to minimum because we have very few generators. But here we have much more than we probably need. Can I make a comment there? So the commutator invariants can always be generated by differentiating a single invariant. So you don't actually need the CIJK. This is commutator trick. Case. There's this commutator trick I used in other contexts. But don't you require then that you have an well, you start you have the no, you only need one. One of the Lijs is enough to generate the Cijks. In this case, some invariants don't depend on B direction. So differentiating in this direction, you get C. You have to be a bit careful about it. Yeah, you have to be a little bit careful that the matrix you end up with as maximal rank. As maximal rank, but yeah. Okay, I just wanted to comment that. Yeah. So, yeah, so this was kind of the general story. It's difficult to make it precise, more precise than this in general dimensions, but we can do, I would say, significantly better in lower dimensions. In lower dimensions. So, as you probably saw, this above approach is very flexible regarding the choice of n-invariants or n-invariant derivations. So, all we require is that they are independent or that derivations we have are independent on generic points. So, and for any choice of dimension, we actually have one and exactly. We actually have one and exactly one differential invariant of order one. And it looks like this. So this is simpler than all of the invariants you can get by this from the Richie tensor in the way I showed you before. And note here that we have upper parentheses on H, and this means that it's basically the inverse, it's inverse matrix of Hij. So this is the matrix with symmetric matrix where with the coordinate functions h i j, we take the inverse. In particular, this invariant has the determinant of this matrix in the denominator. So let us now focus on the low dimensions n equal to 3 and n equal to 4. And n equal to 4, and find a set of generators that is simpler than the ones we found above. And now we look at three-dimensional generic quint space-times. So let us simplify our notation a bit and use these coordinates here. Since we have only one index in each coordinate, we can just One index in each coordinate, we can just remove it. And our total space is now just six-dimensional. And let's start by giving an invariant horizontal frame. So it looks very nice, actually. You can write it like this. So we have NABLA1, NABLA2, and NABLA3. They are invariant, and they are independent on Azariski open subset of E2. And again, they are much better than what we would have gotten if you used the general approach I told you about before in dimension three. So this is much simpler. And all of these derivations satisfy this. So if you so all of the these derivations commute with These derivations commute with prolongations of every element of the Lie algebra. And actually, we found them by solving this system of PDs. And we again we can compute the horizontal co-frame and we can write the We can write the g in terms of them. And then it takes this form here. So I1 is the invariant I showed before, the first order invariant. And then we also have J1 and J2, which are second-order invariants. Also, quite nice. Notice here that these three invariants are horizontally independent. So we could use them as coordinates in the way we did before, and from this generate everything. But now it's actually easy to see that we can find a smaller set of generators. And again, we don't claim it's minimal, but at least it's not so big. It's not so big. So, for n equal to 3, the algebra of differential invariance on E is generated by the differential invariance I1, J1, J2, and the invariance derivations nabla1, nabla2, and nabla3. Okay, but let us, while we are here, try to give a more complete description of the second-order invariants, because the second-order invariants are functions on. are functions on E2 and the number of independent invariants on E2 is equal to the co-dimension of a generic orbit. So we can compute the co-dimension of a generic orbit basically by just computing the rank of the matrix of prolonged vector fields. And we see that the codimension is five. And here we have three invariants. And here we have three invariants, so we are missing two. Let us try to see what the others are. Well, they are these, so we have number three. Was there a question? No. Okay, so yeah, we can differentiate I1 with respect to Nabla3. To nabla3, we get this. One could think that maybe we could also apply the other derivations to I1, but we only get something constant, so it's not interesting. And then we also have a longer one, J3. And these five invariants are constituted transcendent spaces for the field of second-order differential invariants on each. Now let us. Now let us consider degenerate Qt spacetimes, still in dimension three. We still have the first order invariant. And we also have two more invariants for two here. I to A, it's really simple, and I to B. And i to b is this. I also write down the functions k to a and k to b. They are not invariant, but we will use them to simplify the expressions for the last invariant. So in the previous case, the codimension of a generic orbit was five. And if you remember the difference between general and degenerate Kunt equation of order Q, it was just a single equation, namely W. Equation, namely w vb equal to zero. So we add one equation, the dimension of this manifold E or E tilde, it is one less than that of E, but the orbit dimension is still the same. So we have one less invariant. We found three already: I1, I2A, and I2B. So there should be one more. So, there should be one more invariant of order two. Let us also define these functions before we write down the last invariant. So, they are given in terms of the ice and case and also other variables. And then we have a fourth, second-order differential invariant here, also given in terms of. Here, also given in terms of the ice in the case and Q. We'll use R and Q also on the next slide, so just remember these expressions. But now, yeah, we have four independent invariants. And in particular, I1, I2A, and I2C are horizontally invariant. A and I to C are horizontally independent. And we actually need I to C. The other the do not work, they are not horizontally independent. And now, again, it's possible to express G in terms of this co-frame, and we can find the generic insets of invariants. Alternatively, we may use the following invariant derivations. So they are found in a different way, similar to before. To be before, like in what I showed in the three-dimensional case, basically by solving a system of differential equations. But notice that they are not as simple as they look because we have Q here, it's quite complicated expression. We have the K and I, also R, which was quite complicated. But it turns out that algebra differential. It turns out that algebra differential invariance is generated by I1, I2A, I2C, and the invariants naval 1, nabla22, and nabla3. Okay, I will finish with the four-dimensional degenerate Kunt spacetimes because this is the most maybe the most interesting case. So we have still the single first-order invariant. Now it looks like this. And in addition, there are 12 algebraically independent invariants of order 2. This you can again compute by just looking at the orbit dimension. I'm not going to try to write on all of them, but here are two, maybe two of the Maybe two of the simplest ones. And these three invariants are horizontally independent. But of course, we're lacking one because we are now in dimension four, so we need one more. And all of these invariants have in common that they do not depend on V. So we need one invariant i with tv of i not equal to zero. And in order to do this, we construct a horizontal frame. So the horizontal one forms here are independent, as I said before. And by taking an appropriate linear combination, our Our a1 and a2 are rational functions on e3. We can obtain an invariant horizontal form which is proportional to du. So these are in general, well, they have a du component, they have dx1 component and a dx2 component, no dv component. And we can, yeah, by taking an appropriate combination like this, we can get one. We can get one form that is just proportional to du. And yeah, it's invariant and we can turn it into a horizontal vector field by using g and we denote the invariant derivation, which is now proportional to dB by an ABLA one. Okay, and then we also raise indices of these other. Of these other one forms. This is just what the notation I use for raising indices. And we can then, in the end, complete this horizontal frame by adding a nabla four, which is required to satisfy this system of equations here. Okay, so I won't show any formulas. In principle, they are not that. Not that bad, but I don't think we will get anything useful from them. So they are a little bit more complicated than all the formulas I showed you already. The derivations, yeah, they are invariant and they are independent on a stressful subset of tilde E3. And now, oh well, we want the last the Well, we want the last, the fourth invariant. So let us use the frame from the previous slide to find the fourth absolute invariant, which is independent of these three. So we could try to just write G in this frame and look at the coefficients, but it turns out that all of them do not depend on V. So, in order to complete this, we need to find the narrative room somewhere else. So, let us look at the commutation relations. And these expressions here start to become very, very big. But there's not always anything to do about that. So we can look for invariants here that do depend on V. Do depend on V and it turns out that we can find some, and in particular, C231 does depend on me, which means that I1, I2A, I2B, and C231 are horizontally independent. And that means that we can use them in the same way I showed you to basically write down the metric and compare, for example, compare two metric. For example, compare two metrics and does solve the equivalence problem. So, this was more or less what I wanted to tell you. Here are just more detailed references of the ones I mentioned in the talk. And this talk was based on our recently published paper and That's it. Thank you very much for your attention. Any questions from the audience? Yes, Robert. Hi, thanks for the talk, Erin. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Those that sudo group you showed earlier for the four-dimensional metrics. So I just want to say that we didn't invent those. We didn't invent those. I think they're you can find them in one of Kuhn's original papers, and we just found it in the exact solutions book by Kramer. Oh, okay. Thanks. There's some derivations to each other formulation in the way. We added some stuff, but the actual transformations, I think they're big. Yeah, I think they're cool came up with this. Okay, yeah, thank you. Other questions? Well, if not, let's thank Ivan one last time. Thank you. So this is the end of the morning session.
