Uh our speaker. Oops, that's not that much. Yeah, I think that's better. So our speaker is uh Jerkson Lee. He's going to talk about complex uh interaction networks and specifically of the heterogeneous dynamics. Please. Yeah, thanks very much. Hello everybody. My name is Kok Sun Li from Korea Institute for Advanced Studies. I want to thank Jan, Pakil and Sungwo for And Sungu for organizing this nice workshop at this fantastic place and for having me here. In this talk, I'd like to introduce our theoretical approach to understand very different behaviors, dynamical behaviors of individual nodes in a given complex network. By fault, By talk really given in the context of ecological networks, but the model is quite simple. So I hope it can be considered also as the model for the finding activities of neurons and neural genetics. This work is based on the collaboration with Hyung Li, my former master student, and Che Li, my former colleague. Lee, my former colleague, I like also still colleague. Before moving to my current institute, I worked at Yiha University where I worked with Jeew Li and Canon Li. So the piece was published this year. Right. So network is a very simple representation of complex systems and the internet And the internet, power grid, social network, and biological network, and ecological network too. So when you draw networks like this, then the first impression is that the connectivity patterns are very complicated. But they also show universality like power of degree distribution. So that's the pattern is different from system to system, meaning that The system, meaning that they are specific. So, in natural science, one of the most important tasks is to understand the origin and implications of the empirical connectivity pattern. In this sense, many people have interested in the global features of metric dynamics, in population, everybody interested. Everybody is interested in whether there is a spanning cluster or not. If so, how large it is. In synchronization, how many oscillators are phase loss? In Boolean networks, people interest in the older disorder phase stretch. In academic spreading, how many nodes are infected and so on? I just listed here one of my publications, so, including myself, people love. Myself, people love to understand the global features. But individual nodes may behave differently. So in population, even if the giant component exists, some nodes are outside the component. And if you consider diffusion or similar dynamic processes on a network, then there is a fluctuation in dynamical variables from node to node. And even if the old And even if the older parameter of groundwater model describing the synchronization is non-zero, but some oscillators are still drifting. And recently, many people are interested in the chimera state, as mentioned in the talk in the first session. Even if all the properties are the same, but there appears some oscillators are drifting and some oscillators are drifting. Are drifting and some oscillators are rotting. Also, in neural networks, some neurons are firing, but others are dormant. And in the ecological networks, which is the main theme of this talk, some species are flourishing, but others are sometimes extinct. So, the question I would like to address in this talk is that how net of structure generates such a different, dramatically different Dramatically different dynamical behaviors across nodes in a given network and its relation to the network structure. Let me show you one example that attracted my attention. So this is the Lotba-Volterra equation. Here, this quantity can be considered as the growth rate. So if this is constant, then xi will grow with pi x1. Xi will grow with time exponential. But usually we include the self-regulation. And also, this growth rate can be related to other species values. So here, I is the index of species, and then this quantity can be interpreted as the coupling with other species abundance. In this abundance. In this talk, I call X as the abundance of species I in the context of ecological community. And let's think about this simple model. Then this coupling makes interesting effect. And let's assume that a sub ij is a random number, minus 0.5 or plus 1 and so on, and there is no divergence. On and there is no diagonal element. Here, I would like to emphasize that this is the brain network workshop. So, X of I can be considered as the firing activity of individual neurons in a large-scale neural network. So, this Lotka Volterra model is also utilized as a dynamics model for firing activity of units. By activity of humans. About here, I focus, I utilize this model as a model for ecological systems. Here, f sub i is the abundance of individual species I, right? Then, what's interesting to me is that if you integrate numerically this equation, and then let's focus on And then let's focus on the equilibrium values of x in the long time limit. And here, y-axis is the equilibrium values of x. This was obtained for 100 variables, and x-axis is sigma. Sigma is the strength of the coupling. When coupling is 0, then you can easily guess that x will be equal to 1. But as you increase sigma, As you increase sigma, then x variables are becoming different. And then the dramatic effect happens when sigma is larger than 0.25. Some x value becomes zero. If you interpret x as the species abundance, that means that that species went extinct. As you increase more sigma, the more and more x becomes zero. On the other hand, the x is the same. become zero. On the other hand, the other x's grow with sigma. So the behavior of x as a function of sigma are very different from i to i, I mean depending on which variables we are looking at. And this criterion, uh when sigma is further increased then uh many of x is are zero and the other x's are zero. Are seems to be diverse. So it's a very different behaviors of X and but this can be understood by a simple algorithm. Let's think about all surviving solutions. So assume that all x variables are positive and we are interested in the equation. We are interested in the equilibrium values of x, so we can set the right-hand side equal to 0. Then x values are given by the inverse of the interaction matrix. Here, interaction matrix is given by the identity plus coupling matrix. And then, if sigma A is sufficiently small, then we can get a series expansion in terms of sigma. Sigma is the strength of the sigma. Sigma is the strength of the coupling dynamics. And then we assume that for simplicity, the element of A is a random number with a mean value 0. So if you take the average value, then we can easily find that the average of x will be equal to 1. Then the variance of this x value will be given by the square, average of the square of this second term, and you can find And you can find that the variance is given by this function. Let me tell you the meaning of this one. This one is that n to the p and sigma 2p means that the contribution to the variance from length p, length p path from i to all the other species. So each path has length p, so we have to sum this. We have to sum this quantity square of this quantity over all possible j. It gives n to the p. And then h gives the contribution to variance sigma square. And I told you that the length of each pass is p, so that exponent p appears here. So this is the infinite geometric series. So common ratio is n sigma square. So this variance is simply representing it. Is simply representing like this. Then you can find that if n sigma square is smaller than 1, then everybody is happy. But if it is larger than 1, then something bad happens. So the conclusion is that if sigma is sufficiently small, smaller than 1 over square root n, then there is no expectation. There is no x-values fixed divergence. But this result, ah, right, let me tell you one more. So, by the central limit theorem, we can also predict that the distribution of p, distribution of x, is a Daushan function. But this simple argument allows us to understand the origin of extension. So, we found that we said that the distribution of x is Gaussian distribution. Distribution of x is Gaussian distribution, then you can think that if the average is 1, then when sigma is small, the distribution looks like that. When sigma is large, it invades the negative x region. And then, when this region is small, then no problem. But suppose that this probability of negative abundance is not so small, but larger than 1 over n. That means 1 over n. That means that among n species, on the average, we can expect one species to have negative abundance. It cannot happen in reality. And when you numerically integrate the detection, the result is that that one species has zero abundance, meaning they are extinct. So from this argument, we can find that when sigma is larger than 1 over square root n log n, then n log n, then some species or some of x values become zero. That is the criterion for extinction. And then once extinction happens, then the number of surviving species is reduced. Then in the previous slide, I told you that the condition for everybody happy, I mean the condition by which we can neglect the possibility by which we can neglect the possibility of divergence of x is given by the condition that sigma times square root n is smaller than 1. In place of n, we have to think about n plus. n plus is the number of surviving species. So the diversion free region is expanded because the number of surviving species is reduced. There is a region. So as a result, this plot summarizes these findings. So this line is the original expectation for the critical value distinguishing divergence 3 and divergence region. But these two arguments allow us to understand that at sigma E, when you insert 100 in place of N, you 100 in place of n, you find that this value is similar to 0.05. At this value, extinction happens, begins to happen. And number of surviving species reduced. So this criterion shifted to the round. And after this criterion value, some of S values are divergent if you numerically integrate the image. So I thought that this is an interesting result. I mean, we also Interesting result. I mean, we assume just a random interaction model, so we expect everybody is identical to one another. But this numerical integration result says that highly inhomogeneous and heterogeneous. So it is although simple model, it makes many much implications. But you can think that then model is a tool. That model is a two-ide. And one of the important assumptions is that we assume that the coupling coefficient Aij is a random number. It is true idea. And we know that everybody is here knows that the interaction matrix is not a random matrix, but it is structured. This is some paper showing that the interaction matrix is structured. Matrix is structured, not random, and also it takes different forms depending on the nature of the intra-specific interaction. For instance, food web has high modularity and mutualistic network. Mutualistic network means that the network between bees and flowering flats. So they are helping each other. Bees pollinate flowers to help their reproduction. To help their reproduction, and the flowers provide nutrient bees for their survival. So they need each other. In those networks, the ecologists found that the network structure is highly nested. I like explaining the details of exact definition of nestedness because there is no exact definition for that. So it depends on who uses that. On who uses the terminology. So, this is the system I'd like to study in this talk. So, my question is that instead of taking the random interaction model, let's take the real-world networks and then let's and then study the heterogeneity of dynamical variables defined on them. Obviously, defined on that. So I chose the mutualist metal. These red suckers are bees or different animal species. It's number 64, according to this data set. And green triangles represent different plant species. The blue lines represent their mutualistic relationship. That's not all to all. The ecologists thankfully collected all the field data. Collected all the field data to understand their mutualistic pattern. Then, in many studies, the species in the same group are competing with each other to compete for acquiring a given amount of resources. Of course, the plant can be considered as one of the resources from the perspective of animals, but those Of animals, but those relationships are represented by neutralistic ones. So here, these gray lines represent all-to-all competition between different species in the same group, animals or friends. Then that means that there are competition for other resources than the mutualistic relationship. Then, in this real world, more realistic methods, I would like to study the extension dynamics. So, of which Dynamics. So, of which, yeah, let me go forward. So, this system is interesting because each species is competing with other species in the same group. That's a minus contribution for my survival. But there is a mutualism. So, partnership helps for my survival and reproduction. So, there are two different factors in dynamics. In dynamics. So, my question is global features. My question is about the criteria for extinction and instability refers to the diverging abundance of some species. And also, as I emphasized in the introduction, I'm interested in the local properties. So, if extinction happens, then which species will extinct? And how abundant are the remains? How abundant are the remaining bases? I'd like to answer these questions. But from the next slide, I present some theoretical approach. But the key idea is already presented in the introductory part. So the key idea is similar to the result I presented for random interaction button. Right? So let me do So let me define the problem. I'm considering the road car volta application for that real-world network. And because I'm considering plants and animals, this interaction matrix takes the form of block matrices. And this represents the self-regulation on the diagonal term minus C in this block and in this block represent the background confusion. background competition, the oral way, and this off-diagonal blank matrices represent the mutualistic integration. It's not oral, but depending on the integral data set. So rows and columns are different, so the element distribution are different from row to row and different from column to column. So in that sense, we cannot apply without change the random metric theory. Metric theory, we are familiar with. But one more assumption is that we fix the interaction strengths M and C. So mutually stick interaction strength is M and competition strength is C. That is the simplification I introduced to solve this problem. But I focus on the difference of this uh distribution of M's from rotor and for current. From raw true and for count. This is the numerical integration result, and as we expected, some x values become zero and others are non-zero. I want to understand why this happens. And of course, if you understand my problems, then you can easily expect that the abundance, my abundance. My abundance will increase with my degree. Degree means that the number of mutualistic partners. So everybody suffers from the competition with other species. But the number of mutualistic partners, the number of non-zero elements in these optimal blocks represent mutualistic infection. The number of mutualistic partners are different from species to species. So if you have many partners, then you are more likely to have a large partner. More likely to have a larger abundance. So this abundance increases with degree. But interesting point is that when you compare this result across different values of M, then we could expect that this abundance will increase with M without regard to the degree, but it is true only for large degree species. If you have sufficiently large degrees, then you can enjoy it. Degrees, then you can enjoy the increase of mutualistic interaction. But if you have just few patterns, then increasing M is bad for you. So your abundance decreases with increasing M. So but and we can conjecture that yeah that might be due to the competition with other species that enjoys more than me the mutualistic interactions. Interesting. But my goal is to make some quantitative understanding of this term. So the first thing is that I'm interested in the equilibrium abundance of S variables. And when you look at the right hand side, there are two ways to Right, and then there are two ways to make the right hand side zero. So some species have zero abundance and some other species has non-zero abundance, non-zero values. And a classification of species into extinct and surviving depends on our choice. And here the non-zero component is given by the inverse of the effective interaction battery. The effective interaction batteries. And the problem is that how to classify the species in extinct and surviving species. And we refer to, we have to check the stability of each fixed point. And when you write down the Jacobian matrix for each fixed point, then you arrive at the conclusion that the eigenvalues are given by this one. If I belongs to the surviving species set, then each eigenvalue is equal to equal to equal Then each eigenvalue. I mean, there are the same number of eigenvalues as the total number of species. And for surviving species, the corresponding eigenvalue is given by minus abundance. And for extinct species, the eigenvalues are given by x prime. x prime is the abundance of that extinct species that would be observed if it were alive. So we have to check out the other neighboring 6.2. Other neighboring 6.2 to understand the eigenvalues of the Japan metric. So we have to check out the stability, and among 22S fixed points, we have to pick the only stable fixed point to understand the numerical results. And this is example, but times are running out. Let me speed up. So, as in the random interaction model, we first assume that all the species are surviving. Then we have to find out the Find out the inverse of the interaction matrix B. D is much more complex than the previous one. The first method we can take is that to take the series expansion. So we consider the mutualistic interaction as the perturbation and then we can obtain the inverse of interaction matrix as a series of M. As a series of m but it is limited. So the other way we take is the only approximation. So we take, we assume that the mutualistic interaction matrix is given in this form. So it's a rank 1 matrix. Rank 1 means that the number of independent rows is just one. So it is given by the degrees of each plant and animal species. Once we introduce this one, then Introduce this one, then by expanding the previous formula to our blank matrices, we can obtain the inverse matrix, even in this form. And the point is that network effect rescales the coupling strength. So competition strength is rescaled, and mutualist interaction strength is rescaled by network effect. And the key feature of network effect is the degree heterogeneity. The degree heterogeneity defined here as the ratio of the second moment to the square of the first moment. So, exact abundance can be obtained by utilizing the exit expression for the inverse matrix. And here you see that k bar is a normalized degree. It can be positive and negative. It explains the why the abundance may decrease in or increasing the motivation. And as we observe in And as we observe in numerical results, you know, so uh uh this just explains the meaning of this uh exact formula to the species of contents. Our approximation is based on the replacing the interaction matrix by the onield form. So it has it is deviating from the true value, but still explains well the degree dependence. Then we can obtain the uh the We can obtain the first criterion that the old surviving solution is normal correct. And then from that on, we obtain this phase diagram. And here you see some extinction, the parameter region where extinction happens. Then then region can be understood by identifying which one goes extinct and which one surviving. Then Then, starting from the old surviving solution, we can find that some of x values are negative. Then we have to decide that we have to think that that species should have been extinct. So, we modify our classification of species into surviving and extinct. So, we repeated that procedure to arrive at the self-consistent classification of surviving and extinct species. that this slide summarizes this test. And then our approximate algorithm works well, as you see here. And this shows the fraction of extinct species as a function of n tilde. It's the rescue strength of mutualist interaction. So n tilde increases, there is a transition. And these open scales are the true values. Sorry, the lines are based on our analytic formula. Based on our analytic formula and so on. So, I want to say that our analytic solutions explain well why some species was some other species not. And also, we chose one specific lecture for our study, so it can be doubted its validity. So, we applied our formula to other electrons, and then as one of the tests, we plotted the minimum abundance as a function. The minimum abundance as a function of m tilde, as you see here, and then this dashed line is analytic prediction and it works well. Right, so this is the summary. Our question was that we wanted to understand why some species are extinct and others are surviving in lectures. And our contribution is that we presented the analytic expression for the species abundance of individual species. And main finding. species and main finding is a net network risk interaction strength and the next step might be uh step forward towards the uh the more realistic network constraints beyond the only the parsing concern. Great, thanks. Thank you very much for your okay we have time for a few short very short questions thanks for your Thanks for these results and you mentioned this multiple exponential and many fixed points. So I do understand which equilibrium chosen, supposing that all of them are, some of them are stable, right? But let's say which one is chosen over the others or the other one. So is there any say a way to evaluate any something I say a graphic basing of each? Single each stable volume to so in this problem at least we don't need to consider the basic attraction but yeah so there are many fixed points but suppose that we have 10 spaces and then two to the ten fixed points are there so 1024 and then in the in this 1023 fixed points are on stable Three fixed points are unstable, and just one fixed point is stable. Yeah, so it's just a unique fixed point phase. And then finding out that unique fixed point is not so easy, so that's why we introduced the approximate algorithm that we hope to not easy to find that because I mean the equilibrium since the general is generalized, so you can write down the equilibrium as a closed form identity possibly. close for identity and university so but uh as I wrote here uh I mean suppose we have ten species and then uh seven species may have zero abundance and then the other seven may have non-zero and then it depends on my choice nobody knows seven uh three species extinct all right and then it should be checked regarding the stability but there is only one stable one right right exactly Right, right, exactly. What? Uh so I I think there were some studies trying to kind of map uh neural dynamics to the motor system. So I'm wondering like what would be the kind of mapping when we talk about the extinction yeah I mean yeah that is a good question. I also thought about the people committing I also thought about that before coming to Europe. Actually, I found some literatures mentioning that there are a lot of power in understanding the neural networks. But for instance, in neural actors, there are different literature, excitatory and inhibitory being, and their ratios are different consistent. So in my problems, I was interested in extinction that is translated into the inactive. Translated into the inactivation or just the dormant state of some, for instance, seven among ten neurons are dormant and seven are firing activities and so on. And the idea is that such dormant and firing are caused by the interaction among neurons. So I don't know, I mean, I'm not so sure about the validity of such a simplified description for neural activity, but at least we can try to translate this finding. We can try to translate the finding into the context of the writing and while we can find out in the context. Thank you very much, Arm for asking. Any questions online? Okay, so let's thank our speakers. Okay, and we move on to the last talk before the
