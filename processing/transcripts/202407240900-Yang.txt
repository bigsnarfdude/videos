Of not being able to get the visa to travel. So, this is actually a work done almost single-handedly by a senior poster in my lab, Dr. Shi Wei Sun, and of course, with tremendous support from the whole lab. So, this is a work about a somatic mutation. So, we know that clearly a somatic mutation. Clearly, somatic mutations and its accumulation play a really important role in tumor genesis. And it has been reported that tumor mutational burden, TMB, defined as the number of non-synonymous mutations of an individual, has a very strong relationship with the response to immunotherapy. To immunosterapy. And this slide actually shows the correlation in response rates with TMB. And actually, actually also true at individual level. So the question we had was: why there's a variation in TMB among individuals and whether there Individuals and whether there is a genetic underpinning underlying TMB. And so it is actually a matter of the relationship between germline genetic variation and somatic mutation. So a few years ago, we tried to address this question by looking at the TCGA. The TCGA data set. So, with over 10,000 people, we called somatic mutations from the tumor sample and then performed a SNAP-based herbability analysis for pan cancer TMB and showed that actually the SNAP-based herbability is about 10%. Advability is about 10 to 15 percent, depending on what kind of method we used. But if you run the GWAS for TMB of pain cancer, we didn't see any signal. So suggesting that there is a genetic component for TMB, but it's likely to be polygenic, but otherwise there's a sample size of about 10,000. These are sample size of about 10,000, you should be able to identify some GWAS signal. And we further did a GWAS in each cancer subtype, and we did see a few associations, but the sample size for an individual cancer subtype was too small to achieve sufficient power to detect more genome-wide significance. Genomal significant signals. Then the question tends to be whether we have so many mutations in normal tissues. And certainly it is the case. And this is for instance, this happens quite often in chrono hematopoiesis. And that's been also the way to To measure or characterize chronohematopoies using driver whether an individual carry a known blood cancer driver mutation in those known genes. And this is actually being called a chronohematopoisis of indeterminate potential or chip. Chip. So, but the question we had is, or the argument we had, is whether really there's only mutations in the known genes that are important, or whether there's a way we can generalize this concept to quantify somatic mutations in all coding regions. So, but that is a challenging. But that's that is challenging because in tumor we have matched a normal sample to call somatic mutations, but for normal tissue like blood, it is actually challenging. So we developed a pipeline to detect somatic mutations from whole exome sequence data from normal tissues. So we started with an analysis with the Yucbio Bank whole genome whole exome sequence data. For exome sequence data. And we use the tumor-only mode in MUTAC2 to do the first round of somatic mutation detection and using the individuals with age smaller than 40 as a panel of normals. After the first round of mute-to-analysis, we add a bunch of filterings like Of filterings like we removed mutations or reads with orientation bias, or we removed reads in low mappability regions, or we didn't really, we kind of removed all the mutations that being seen as a germline variant. We removed reads with read depths lower than 30. Lower than city, and the mutations, so many mutations have to be supported by more than three, at least three reads. After all these filterings, we then build a model to further validate or to do another round of filtering. So, this is kind of on the basis of a method called a Moset forecast. Called a mosaic forecast developed by a group in Harvard. So the idea is that if we see a somatic mutation and we do a read-level hepatite phasing, we can use a germline variant as an anchor to see if after phasing we can see three hypertypes because. Hyperotypes because if it's a somatic mutation, it will form this kind of pattern of three hyper types. And if it's only two hyper types, then it's very likely to be a germline variant. And a more complicated situation is that we may have more than three hyper types. It's a lot more complicated. We kind of ignore these hypertypes. These hypertypes for now. But the problem is that only about 10 to 20 percent of the side with feasible can be faced. So then we developed a kind of a machine learning model for the size. We have three hyper types. We can train the model with a bunch of A bunch of read-level features. And after model training, and we can use this trainer model to predict the probability of having two hepatypes, three hepatypes, and more than three hepatites for the non-feasible sites. So, to validate this model, we use the UK. We use the UK Biobank data. We took 100,000 random samples, all unrelated. We trained the model in the first random half of this set, exactly 50,000 individuals. So, in that case, we train a model. And after model training, we predict the probability of having two. Probability of having two, three, or more than three hapotypes, and then validate that with a read-level phasing, of course, at the feasible site only. As you can see that on this plot, the model performs or the kind of identification method performs very well after the two rounds of filtering. Mosaic forecast. Mosaic forecast default means that it was trained in the using whole genome sequence data. And we kind of customize this model using whole exon sequence data. And MUTAC2 is a version without the second round of filtering with mosaic forecast. So you can see that both precision and recall are really high. So once we have this pipeline, we apply This pipeline, we applied it to the whole Yugi Bauer Bank co-exon section data around 450,000 individuals. We detected over half million somatimutations, including, of course, most of them are SNAPs and also indels. And this is the variant. A VAF distribution. And you can see that this is because it truncated at 0.4, and because we have a requirement that the mutation has to be supported by at least three reads, so there's a cutoff here, but the mean VAF is about 10. And then after having those somatic mutations, then we kind of Somatic mutation, then we kind of propose a concept called a somatic mutation burden. It is actually the total number of somatic SVs or indels of exon. About more than actually more than half of the UQ biobank individuals have at least one somatic mutation detected by this method. So, just remind you that this is actually a, because we have been used a kind of conservative approach. So, as this Approach. So, this is likely to be an underestimation in terms of the total somatic mutations that an individual can carry. So, there are about over 20,000 individuals with SMB greater than four. Also, to highlight that there are about 4,000 individuals carrying more than 10 meters. Those are carrying more than 10 mutations. So we then look at the factors that can affect or associate with somatic mutation burden. And obviously, one of the biggest factors is age. So somatic mutation shows a very strong relationship with age. And smoking is again also another big factor. So here, Pakya is different. So, here pack year is defined as pack per day times the number of years of smoking. And this relationship is a bit non-linear as well. But if we put a threshold here, then essentially the two kind of linear relationship. Before, like I think 39 PAC year, the association between SMB and PAC is almost linear. SMB and package almost linear and then plateaued afterwards. So, given having got the SMB and then we can use SMB as a phenotype to do genetic study, so to address the question in terms of the interplay between somatic mutation and germline genetic variance. So, from this GWAR study, we identified GWAS study, we identified 52 loci in total. Of these loci, 226 loci have not been reported previously related to any chronohematopoiesis-related phenotypes. And out of the 52 loci, we can from the conditional analysis we identified or clumping analysis. Analysis: 57 COSI-independent SNPs, which in total explain over 56% of the SNP-based herbability, meaning that because of the large sample size, we have been able to dissect most of the SNP herbability into individual loci. And we have also done a variant, rare variant. Variants, rare variant-based association analysis, either at the individual variant level or a kind of burden, a gene-based burden test. These analysis identified seven loci and six of them are actually noble, meaning that they have not been reported before. And one of the genes to be highlighted is that TDK protein kinase is actually associated. Nikinase is actually associated with cell cycle and DN damage, so with some known function related to somalimutation or DNA damage. And further, we wanted to ask whether the effect size of the germline variants on somatic mutation are kind of dependent on environmental effects or not. Effect or not. So we performed a genome-wide VQT analysis just to remind you that a VQT analysis has the advantage of detecting genotype by environmental interaction without knowing having or without having to specify the environmental factors. Through this analysis, we identified five QTLs. QTLs with a and all of them have been tested separately in a genotype by environmental, a specified environment, GIEI test. And this environmental factor can be age, smoking, or chip status. Having known that age and sex has shows, sorry, age and smoking shows. Sorry, agent smoking shows some sort of G by effect. We then do a more systematic analysis by kind of doing a direct genotype by age interaction analysis. For the age interaction analysis, we essentially split the data into two halves by age at a threshold of 55, as we can see on that graph. Can see on that graph. Clearly, there's a large number of genotype by age interaction with the effect size of SNAPs on SMB tend to be larger in old age. And this is an analysis using smoking as the environmental exposure. And again, we also see a few. Again, we also see a few, three significant GBA effects. So we've identified a number of loci, but you know that it is not a straightforward goal from genetic association to genes. So we developed a pipeline to link the associated variants to genes. The variance to genes. So essentially, just like we do a fine mapping and with a function annotation. And once if the file map variance is actually missensivariance, we note it as a putative codogene. And then further, if it's not a coding variance, then we combine molecular quantitative trait locus data like the expression QTL, mesylation QTL, splicing QTL. Mesylation QTL, splicing QTL, protein QTL, and the PC high-C data and the textic data as well, all together to prioritize genes. And then with this V2G pipeline, we also combine this pipeline with other gene prioritization approach like SMR, DEPICT, ABC model, and open targets. And open targets, predicted sets, and some of the gene-based tests. And all together, we kind of built a scoring system and prioritized 66 genes. And very interestingly, out of the 66, 39 genes are actually connected in a single PPI network. And some of the hub genes like TERT, ATM. ATM unknown have some function related to hematopoietic stem and progenic cells self-renewal and differentiation. So here just example to demonstrate how we can go from genetic association to gene. So this is actually a locus. So we, as you can see that we So we, as you can see that we did, you can see the MPR and APIP1 locus. There are two conditionally independent signals in this region. If we do a fine mapping analysis for this signal, we can identify a single missense variance with a really strong PIP from the fine mapping. And for this, And for these locus, there's no clear lead SNEP, even after file mapping. But we do see two SNPs that are actually located in a function element that can be connected to the promoter of this gene. And if we look at the chromatin accessibility of the region where the two SNPs are located. Region where the two SNPs are located, there are actually cell type-specific chromatin, open chromatin peaks in this region. Then we took the cell type-specific open chromatin accessibility and then plotted against the expression level of this gene in each cell types. This gene in each cell types, we see a strong correlation, suggesting a mechanism that there could be a caudal variance somewhere in this region affecting the chromatin accessibility and therefore may affect the expression level of this gene. And this SMB can also be used as a biomarker. So we've demonstrated the The use of SMB as a phenotype and do genetic analysis, but SMB is also a molecular phenotype, can be used as a biomarker. So we have been fortunate to get access to the longitudinal data from the Yucca Bauer Bank. So when we called SMBs, all the individuals were healthy, but after the sample was taken, you could buy. Was taken. Yucca Bauer Bank had some follow-up sort of questionnaire, and then we have more disease data from afterward. So here is just a plot to show the dosage-dependent effect or association between SMB and blood cancer or different subtypes of blood cancer. As a very strong association, I can see that. Association can see that the hazard ratio keeps increasing until we don't have many data beyond SMB greater than 10, but at least between the range from 1 to 10, there's a very strong dosage-dependent effect. And some of the other ratio is very strong, can be over 10. And then we asked whether SMB can stratify individuals who have known blood cancer driver mutations or labeled as chip. This also showed that even for individuals labeled as chip, we can further use SMB to stratify their risk to develop blood cancer. Develop blood cancer or different subtypes of blood cancers in the future. I need to be a little bit quick. Okay, so in the end, so also just one more slide to show that we further did a causal inference to see whether we can identify some causal factors that can affect SMB or whether SB can be causal for some other phenotypes. Other phenotypes. So we use GSMR as a type of SMR method, but also validate the result with other MR approach. And we show that if we use SMB as the outcome and test the effect size of a few different traits of SMB, we show that clearly there's a positive effect of body fat percentage, smoking initiation, and the risk a couple of PC. A couple of PC from a couple of risk phenotypes, and the look-aside tailamer lens also shows all the positive effect, and education attainment shows the negative effect. And if you do a reverse SMR sort of analysis, MR analysis, we didn't see any of the effect of SMB on the trade apart from the telomere lens. So, to wrap up, so we defined Pop. So, we defined a new quantitative measure of chronohematopoiesis, identified 32 new normal genetic loci for SMB, and we found a lot of GBI effects, and particularly with Asian smoking. We prioritized 62 genes with 39 connected in a single PPI network. We found the association of SMB with blood cancer, and we SMB with blood cancer, and I haven't shown that it actually with other diseases. And some of the factors are actually causal for SMB, including a body fat percentage, smoking, and education, etc. I thank you for your attention. Yeah, please. I think this work is super interesting. I had two follow-up questions. One, besides Connell, Besides clonal amount of uses of intrapotent cellular chip, we looked at how SMB relates to MCAs or would say chromosomal alterations, which are large sensitive somatic mutations in biological experience. So I can't hear clearly, but I guess the question is about MCA, right? Yeah. The chromosome alteration. Chromosome alteration, yeah. We had done the genetic correlation analysis. It says that there is a genetic correlation, but not strong. And then if you look at other phenotypes besides cancers, are there associations with other phenotypes? So we haven't, I can't remember, but we've done a broader search of all phenotypes, but in the Yuka Bio Bank, we also have longitudinal data from infection. Longitudinal data from infectious disease, and that's a for a reason we don't understand the SMB associated with infectious disease and some other types of cancer. And blood cancer, of course, shows the strongest effect. Yeah, so the infection association is probably related to the prior association we reported in nature medicine on MCAs on infectious diseases. Definitely some relation between all the medical uses of infection reducing. All of that pleases actually press independent of can't. All right, okay. Uh, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you.
