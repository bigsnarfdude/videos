Do you hear me? Am I unmuted? Okay, awesome. All right. Yeah, thank you very much for the invitation and for the great conference. And yes, since I'm the last speaker, I thought to suggest let's all unmute and clap to the organizers. Yeah, I especially like the discussions in the breakout room. So, yeah, the title is Earing Correspondence on the Pillow Case. And everything I'm going to talk is a joint work with Guim Casazus, Chris Harold, and Paul Kerr. And one funny fact is that you could view this talk as a blend of previous two. So, this talk is going to be about instantons and bounding coachons towards the end. So, let's dive into it. So, the story starts with a reduced singular instantone homology. So, it's a not invariant. So, here I drew a trefoil. And it was discovered by Koen-Heimer and Bofka. And it's denoted by I natural of K. Pi natural of k and so the way they did it roughly is one auxiliary construction that they used is adding an earring. So immediately I want to tell you what is an earring. So an earring is a small circle around a base point on naught K and then an R connecting that circle with that base point. So that's these two things is an area. things is an earing. So they add an earing to the knot and then they consider an SO3 bundle P on the complement of K and E, so on the complement of the NOT K and the circle E, such that the second stiffer-Witting of that SO3 bundle is Puncher dual to W. Okay, so this arc determines the homology class. Cohomology class. And there's a lot which goes into their construction. So that bundle has an O2 reduction around E and K and also a Z2 orbifold structure. And then they study singular connections and then they define this invariant reducing the instantone homology. So the key fact that they prove about this invariant is that there's a spectral sequence from Cavana homology. Spectral sequence from carbon homology to instanto homology. And also, that this instantal homology is isomorphic to another version of instant homology, the sutured instant homology. And these two facts together, they combine these two facts and they obtain that Kavanaugh detects the unknown. So this was their motivation behind constructing the singular instanton invariant. We will be looking at this invariant. We will be looking at this invariant from a representation point of view. So, there is a representation theoretic point of view, which now I want to turn to. So, from representation side, we will be considering traceless SU2 representations, which comprise SU2 character variety, satisfying W2 condition. So, what do those words mean? So here I drew my knot again with an earring and with an arc. And so we'll have this space R, which takes in essentially three arguments. So S3 is the three manifold. Next comes some one-dimensional sub-manifold, which in this case is going to be a knot and the earring circle. And the third argument is W. And so the point is that we're looking into representations from the complement of S3, the complement of K, E, and W. So take out everything which is here, obtain a complement, study representations to SU2, but with certain restrictions. And so the first restriction is that these representations have to be traceless on the meridians to the On the meridians to the green stuff. So here there's one meridian around the knot, there's another meridian around the earring. And so we demand the representation be traceless on those meridians. So here I wrote this property. And then there's a W2 condition. So this corresponds to SO3 bundle on the previous slide being non-trivial. So W2 condition basically tells me that meridian around That meridian around this arc W should go to minus one in inside SU2. And here's this condition. Okay, and so if we put these two properties, this is what we call traceless SU2 character varieties satisfying W2 condition. And yes, I didn't say we also model by conjugation by SE2. So this is the main space. The main space for this talk, the main kind of character. And I'll introduce some more notation. So when I write R natural of K, that basically means that I add an in-earing and I have a non-trivial W2 condition on the R. Okay, so this is a shorthand condition. And also in the talk, when I write R natural pi of k, that will mean that. That will mean that I perturb my representation space and perturb by Holonomic perturbations. And I don't want to talk about it right now, and later I will explicitly describe what those are. So the key point is that instant on chain complex is generated by points of this traces character value. So when you perturb it generically, it's a bunch of points and single instanton. A bunch of points, and the singular instantone complex is generated by those points. So now the motivation behind our work is a T-floor conjecture. So in this case, how would it look like? We would take an n-bridge decomposition of a knot, and here I drew the n-bridge decomposition. Here, the n is equal to three, three bridges. And to this, And to this, I associate a decomposition. So, this gives a decomposition of my naught into two tangles, T1 and T2, along 2n punctured 2-sphere. And so you have this inclusion of 2n-punctured 2-sphere into two tangles. And now, if you apply the traces character variety functor, you get the functor is contravariant, so you get the traces character. The traces character variety of the surface and traces character variety of two tangles, and they restrict to this circle, to the modulus space, to the traces character variety of the circles. And one of the tangles must be modified with a new ring. And that's why one of them contains this sharp natural, sorry, and the other one there's no natural because I added a new ring to one of them. And so. And so now it turns out that this space is symplectic. This goes back to the classical work of Vatiya, Bart, and Goldman. But it is also singular. So its top stratum is symplectic. But it is stratified. And so it's not really a nice symplectic manifold. And these are Lagrangians. And again, these are also stratified. So these are Lagrangians at those points where they are smooth and mapping to the Points where they are smooth and map into the smooth stratum. So things are not as nice. But still, this is a really important kind of philosophy in our field. The TFL conjecture states that if you take these two Lagrangians and take its Lagrangian floor homology, it should be equivalent to instanton nautomology. Should be isomorphic to you. Okay, and so here I wrote. And so here I wrote that, in fact, the character right of a surface is stratified of the top dimension 4n minus 6. And Lagrangians are stratified too. So really conjecture doesn't make sense on the nose. But now we want to specialize. So notice that if you take n equals 2, then 4n minus 6 is equal to 2. Okay? And so the modulus space. Okay, and so the modulus space the traces character variety becomes a surface, and this is the starting point for the next construction, which is called pillowcase homology. It's a construction due to Hedden, Harold, and Kirk. And so, first, they identify the traces character radio of four-puncture sphere, and turns out it's a torus. Turns out it's a torus quotiented by elliptic convolution. And it's also known as the pillow case because it looks exactly like the pillow case. It has these four corners, which are fixed points of the involution of the torus. And then, you know, basically the rest is a four-puncture sphere. So it's really a two-sphere with four Z2 orbital singularities. Okay. Okay, so then if you want to study at here for a conjecture, of course, not every knot is a two-bridge knot. So one needs to allow tangles to be not trivial. So for example, I drew a decomposition here. It's a decomposition along a convey four marked sphere. One knot here is trivial T1, but the other is more complicated, T2. No, you have to allow more complicated tangles. Okay, so now. Okay, so now here's a nice theorem by Harold and Kirk. They tell us that if you take traces character variety of a tangle T1, perturb it, and add an airing, turns out it's going to be a compact immersed curve inside the pillow case. So first it ends up a smooth one-dimensional manner. One-dimensional manifold, and then the restriction to the pillowcase is an immersive code. And then, also, if you don't have the earring, it's still a nice immersed curve, but it can be non-compact. So, basically, an arc from one corner to another will be allowed. But still, in the Okay, but still in the top stratum, it's the smoothly immersed curve inside the Pulitzin. And so the interesting thing now is that the Lagrangian phonology of these two curves makes sense because things are happening on this surface. And you can take a compact curve, I don't know, maybe like something like this, a non-compact, which I Something like this, a non-compact, which I already drew, and then you know, you would take Fleuromology. In this case, it would be one-dimensional. So, the Attile Fleur conjecture statement makes sense. And this is an interesting approach. Let me give you a quick example. So, let's take a trefoil naught and let's take this decomposition. So, this is a trefoil naught. Now, let's take this decomposition. Now let's take this decomposition into two four-ended tangles. So one is a trivial one with a knee ring, and the other is a three-twist tangle. So what's the intersection picture on the pillowcase? So yeah, here I'm, so this is really a pillowcase, but I, so these four things are the corners, and my iPad is a two-speed. Is a two-sphere. Okay, this is how I draw the pillow case. So, this trivial tangle, the red one, if you don't add the earring and compute the traces character variety, it turns out to be a simple arc like so. So this is R of the trivial tangle. Now, if you add a nearing, and we do want to add a nearing because we want to match singular instant or homology, what we will What we will get is a figure eight, which I drew here. And this is a theorem by Hedden-Harold and Kerr. And that theorem is proved using an explicit holnomic perturbation. And for the three-twist angle, we don't want to add an earing, so we get an arc, and this arc is going to be this one. And the reason is quite Uh, quite simple is because three twist tangles you can obtain from the trivial tangle by applying three braid moves. And turns out these traces representational variety are natural with respect to braid moves. So you get this arc, which is obtained by three times twisting. And you see that there is three intersections in the minimal position. So Lagrangian fluor homology of the two curves is going to be three-dimensional, and it is. Three-dimensional and it is equal to the Don Fermi of a trefoil. So in this case, the conjecture is true. So let me say that this computation generalizes to two bridge knots. So the instantal homology of KPQ to bridge naught is going to be p-dimensional, and pillowcase homology also will recover those p-dimensions. Okay? And then What's interesting is that in much more complicated examples, Hedden, Carol, and Kirk give many computations for Taurus knots. And each computation they gave, the conjecture was true. And those examples include 4,5 torus knots, where there's a higher differential on the Kabanov chain, on the Kabanov homology. And we will come back to this example and study this example. This example and study this example in detail later in the talk. Okay. So let me now talk a little bit kind of what's next, what's after pillow K, what's after this kind of framework of formulating a TFR conjecture. Well, first, you want to prove that pillow K etomology is well defined. That's one. Well defined. That's one thing. And then the next thing would be to prove that it's isomorphic to instanton homology. And it turns out that both of these things are quite difficult. And there's many reasons. I don't want to go into those reasons. Let me say that each difficulty in these two kind of research directions gives an open-ended research direction. You can kind of study each difficulty. Can kind of study each difficulty on its own. And that's what we did. We took one particular aspect, which is dependence on the earring location. So what do I mean by that? So I can take a tangle T1 and a tangle T2, two pointed tangles. And the point is that I can put an earring on one tangle or I can put an earring on the other one. And the question is: you know, how does pillowcase How does pillow case homology change with respect to this choice? And in particular, we would like to actually be able to say that pylogismology doesn't change, that it is invariant. So the urine location actually does not matter. And that's what this work is about, is about studying dependence on the Iranian location. Dependence on the area location. Okay, so before, so now I will dive into kind of what we did. So before that, maybe I'll pause. Are there any questions? Sorry, really quick, really naive question. Is there a map from the pillowcase chain complex to the singular instance on chain complex, like a chain map? Like a chain map. So there's an isomorphism. So, okay, you mean the map which respects the differentials, right? Yeah. I mean, I guess that's what's hard, right? Yeah, yeah. That's the hard part. And yeah, not even, I mean, I would guess there is a map, but we don't know if there is a map. We don't know what construction. But let me say, on the chain, as a chain, as a vector spaces, those are identified. And yeah, towards the end, you. And yeah, towards the end, you will see that. Yeah, I'll address a little bit that question. So, in your setup, are you going to fix the tangle decomposition? Are you going to also for, I mean, are you going to study different tangle decompositions along the four times puncture? Yeah, so that's another difficulty, yeah. But I will not address that. So, you know, this would be addressing the location of Conway sphere. You can choose a Conway sphere. Conway sphere. You can choose a conway sphere this way or the other way. And that's another difficulty. But I will only concentrate on this one. Just move engineering through the conway sphere, what happens. Okay. So let me continue. So now, in order to describe this, I need to define an object from symbolic. An object from symbolic geometry. And it's called Lagrangian correspondence. And it is due to Weinstein. So what is Lagrangian correspondence? So Lagrangian correspondence is from one symplectic manifold to another symplectic manifold. And it is an immersed Lagrangian. And you can, you know, there are different flavors. You can demand it to be embedded, but we will work with the immersed Lagrangian. Embedded, but we'll work with the immersed Lagrangians. It's an immersed Lagrangian L inside the product of M and N, and M is with the reverse symplectic structure. That's why I put M minus here. So that's what the Lagrangian correspondence is. And usually, you know, we distinguish the projection into M and the projection to N and write L S, you know, as here in the center. And you will see why that's a handy way to. You will see why that's a handiwork to do it. So, what are the examples? The first example would be a simple Lagrangian in a symplectic manifold. You can have a symplectic manifold N, and Lagrangian in that symplectic manifold is a Lagrangian correspondence from a point to M, because there's a unique map from L to the point. So, this information is vacuous. So, really, it's just a Lagrangian inside M. So, Lagrangian correspondence generalizes Lagrangians. Generalizes Lagrangians. Another standard example would be diagonal. So you can have syntactic manifold M, another syntactic manifold M, and the diagonal correspondence between them. And the diagonal is a Lagrangian submanifold inside M minus cross M. All right. So the next example is the example why we care about Lagrange import. We will care about Lagrangian port. Branch import, we'll care about running force one instance. And the next example, basically, the input is a tangle cobordism. What is a tangle cobordism? It consists of a surface. So here I drew one surface with some number of marked points. Here's two. And another surface with some number of marked points. Here is four. And then a cobordism between them. So here I drew the Borders in between them. So here I drew this Y3 borders between them, which connects these points with a tangle. And you can also put an early on that tangle as well. And we will do that. Okay, so this kind of topological data is called tangle comportis. And it turns out that the object which you get if you apply the traces character variety functor is Is Lagrangian correspondence. So, first to the surface, we associate the character variety of that surface with the corresponding number of mark points. For this surface, we associate the other character variety. These are both symphlectic. Not quite, they're singular. So, really, when I say these words, I always mean singular, Lagrange corresponds. Always mean singular Lagrange corresponds in between singular symptom manifolds. And then, so this the trace kept variable, this cobordism here I drew here, turns out it's going to be a Lagrangian correspondence. So there's going to be two restriction maps, one to one character variety and another to another character variety, and it will define Lagrangian correspondence at smooth points. Okay, so now. So now, having this construction, oh, yes, there's one bit of background that I also need to cover is what are Lagrangian correspondences good for. So the reason we study them is because they transfer Lagrangians by geometric composition. What does this mean? It means that if I have a Lagrangian inside a symplectic manifold, so just a simple Lagrangian here, so here I drew a point. Here. So here I drew a point, just this is a vacuous information. And then I have a Lagrangian correspondence between m1 and m2. What you can do is consider this composition. So you go by the map E, and then you want to invert J to the minus 1, and then go by the map K. Okay? And turns out that this composition gives you another immersed Lagrangian inside M2. So you can having a Lagrangian inside. Can having a Lagrangian inside M1, you get a Lagrangian inside M2. So, this is a nice way to transfer Lagrangians. And let me say that rigorously, you want to do this using a fiber product construction. And you can actually compose any Lagrangian correspondences. So here, this L was a simple Lagrangian, but you can have L01 from M0 to M1 and L12 from M1 to M2. And you can consider its fiber product. And you can consider its fiber product, okay? And we call it a composed Lagrangian, so L01 composed with L12. So this consists of points L inside L01 and L prime inside L12, such that these two points map into the common point. So E of L is the same as J of L prime. So this is a fiber product construction. And it turns out that this fiber product is a Lagrangian correspondence between M0 and M2. And I should say that a certain assumption has to be met in order for this Lochrongi correspondence to be actually immersed, so in transfer-solid assumption. Okay. And let me say that maybe in the interest of topologists, Topologists or to symplectic geometers, this Lagrangian correspondence says philosophically they should induce A infinity functors between Foucault categors of symplectic manifolds. And this is an ongoing research and it's been done in some cases already. And I'll come back to this point. This will be important for us. All right. So now I can. So now I can explain you the main idea for how we're going to study adding an earring construction. So the main idea is basically in the form. If you start with a tangle T, and here I drew this two-twist tangle, adding an earring basically corresponds to stacking a cobordism on it. And the cobordism is between a two-four-puncture two-sphere and another. Four-punctured two-sphere and another four-punctured two-sphere. And this cobordism consists of four straight segments with an earring on it. And if you stack that cobordism, effectively you added an earring to the tangle. So what does this give us? So, first topological diagram. So, four-punctured sphere, the inside one. Let me Let me write here the inside one, and this is going to be the outside one. So this one embeds into D3 of T, so it's here, this tangle is here, but also the inside sphere embeds into this cobordism. This component is a product of two sphere, four points times I, and an earring. And then the outer two sphere. Two-sphere embeds into this combordium as well. So, this is a topological diagram. So, let's apply a traces character variety functor. And what do we get? We get R of T, this corresponds to this tangle. Okay, it restricts to one pillow case, and this pillow case we will denote by the inside pillow case. Okay, well, and this cobordism actually. And this cobordism actually gives me so this cobordism actually gives me a Lagrangian correspondence V. So here I want to introduce notation. So this Lagrangian correspondence V represents basically the traces character variety of this cobordism with four straight segments with an earring. That's why I put a natural here. So this V is a Lagrangian correspondence. And so, what happens is that now, if I want to recover R natural of T, so the traces kept arriving with an earing, all I need to do is basically compose V and R T. So, this is really R of T composed with V, as Lagrangian course. And yeah, there's a little bit, of course, there's some stuff to check. Of course, there's some stuff to check how the kind of fundamental groups map into each other, but this is what this is how I describe to you. So the adding energy is just composing with this Lagrangian correspondence, Lagrangian correspondence. So as a result, what we can do is basically we can just focus our attention on this Lagrangian correspondence. And if we understand this Lagrangian correspondence, And if we understand this Lagrange correspondence, we will understand how to add earrings to our tables. Okay. So now, turns out this Lagrangian correspondence, if you just compute it like this, is a singular, not nice space. So we'll have to perturb it. And so let me now describe the perturbations. So here's a way we perturb it. Here's the way we perturb it. So here's the topological picture is here. So the green stuff is the actual tangle information. So these are four segments and an earring. And so the red P and the orange Q is going to be our perturbation curves. Okay, so the main object for us is Vs. It's going to be Vs is going to be Vs. So it's a Lagrangian correspondence. But on the, yeah, so now I'm going to remind you: as a traces character writing, what is it? So it's all representations from complement of all these gadgets here. Okay, so it's S1 cross I, complement of all these gadgets, into SU2, mod conjugation, satisfying the conditions that I talked previously. So that condition is. Talked previously. So the condition is that it's traceless around the green stuff. Okay, and then it's minus one around the blue RW. And the third condition is the holonomic perturbation condition. So we'll have to perturb it. And the condition is that on this meridian around t, so this is this mu of t, this meridian. Mu of P, this meridian, my representation has to be equal to e to the power s times the imaginary part of rho of p. Okay, what does this mean? Well, s is just some real parameter we will fix, actually. So this is just a number. Imaginary part of the SU2 element, well, I want to think of SU2 as unit quaternion. So imaginary part of So, imaginary part of this unit quaternion is going to be everything without the real part. And this is the condition. And so, let me say about this condition that if you put s equals zero, you see that this becomes, so if s equals to zero, this becomes, sorry, s equals zero, this becomes one, right? And so, basically, what it means. So basically, what it means is that you can just forget about this P. So, this perturbation curve was not there. And so, when you turn perturbation on for a small s, the character variety will change. Essentially, what happens is that I make my connection, I essentially stop, make it stop being Make it stop being flat around that curve. Okay, so these are the perturbations. And so here's the main theorem then. Actually, before you go on, what do you mean by rho of P there? Yes, so rho of P is, so P is, oh, that's, yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, so P, let's say. That's a good point, yeah. So, P, let's say it's the zero frame longitude around the curve P. Thank you. Yeah, actually, you're right. This is a minor problem. So, really, I guess it should be lambda q and lambda q here. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. It's the other way around. The longitudes of the those are just the thing inside M rho where it said the exponents and the exponentials are the meridians of those curves and then the really longitude. All right, let's see. Okay, yeah, I definitely believe you. I think I messed up this. So this have to be lambda p lambda q mu p mu mu. Okay, yeah. Thanks a lot, Chris. Yep. All right. All right, that's right. So, this is the right condition. Okay. So let's go on. And yeah, and still actually, when you set s equal to zero, you still see that this is the same as basically not introducing these curves p and q. Okay. Okay, so let's now state the main theorem. So the main theorem goes like this. So in the background, I want you to keep in mind this picture that we have this capordism and the inside four-punctured sphere, this one, and the outside four-punctured sphere also is embedded here. Okay, so in order to this picture, we associate. To this picture, we associate, as I said, the Lagrangian correspondence vs. And now, between the two pillow cases, and so now I want to describe this Lagrangian correspondence. So it turns out the first statement is that it's a smooth genus 3 surface, which I drew here. And then the second statement is, yeah, so in particular, it's not singular and it's not stratified. And it's not stratified, there's one smith talk stratum or genus three. And so the other one, the other statement, describes how the Lagrangian correspondence actually maps into the pillar cases. So the first point is that it misses the corner. So this is really good news. So the map does not go into these points on either of these two pillow cases. And And moreover, we can describe it up to arbitrarily small homotopy. So the map is arbitrarily close to the following. And so here I subdivided my I divided my three genus surface into two parts, V plus and V minus. And imagine a map from V plus to the pillow. To the pillowcase, we just bijectively identifies V plus with the pillowcase with corners cut. So you see that if you cut those corners right along these lines, you get exactly the same thing as V plus topologically. So imagine that it just bijectively identifies this with this. And now imagine that V minus also bijectively identifies this with this. And then you can see that because these two And you can see that because these two things they meet exactly along these circles, you can glue these two maps along this circle. So this circle will go into this circle. And that's the map into the first pillowcase, the inside pillowcase of the genus 3 surface. And so now the other map is more interesting. So the other map is basically the same thing. So imagine the same map. So imagine the same map, but it is precomposed with something non-trivial. So it's in fact it's precomposed with Dane twists along Ci. Okay, so you precompose along Dane twists, with Dane twists along these curves, and then you map via this map that I just described. Okay, so that's the statement. And in order to better imagine what the statement To better imagine what the statement actually is and what does it imply, let me talk about the action this Lagrangian correspondence induces on curves. So the action it induces turns out is quite simple to describe. So let us suppose I have a compact curve on the inside pillow case. Okay, what's the pre-image inside my GNS3 surface? Well, it's two. GS3 surface. Well, it's two copies of it. Then I do Dane twists as I described, but the curves, these four curves, they don't twist don't affect them, so I still get these two curves. And then I map the other the same map, and so what I obtain is basically two copies of a compact curve. So, really, on the compact curve, my action simply doubles them. So let's study what happens with arcs, with non-compact arcs. So let's start with this arc. Where does it go if you pull it back to the genus 3 surface? Well, it goes back to this arc, but then it goes back to another arc as well, because the map, you know, the map consists of two maps. So you have this, in fact, a circle here. A circle here. And then the interesting thing is that the Dane twists do affect this circle. So if you apply this Dane twist, you get, well, this curve, right? And now let's squash this genus 3 surface one more time, and you get exactly double of that R turned into the figure A. Okay, so this is the behavior. So, this is the behavior that Chris Paul and Matt described previously, but I guess on the level of this Lagrangian correspondence. Eugene asks. Go ahead, Janet. Oh, Eugene asks, is V embedded in the product of two pillowcases? So, excellent point. It turns out it's not. Some point, it turns out it's not, and you can prove that it is not embedded. So the Euler class of V turns out to be zero, but the Euler class of embedded Lagrangian, you know, embedded Vs has to be minus four by Weinstein-Lagrangian theorem. And so these two facts imply that Vs is actually. Imply that VS is actually has to be immersed. Yeah, I didn't explicitly say that. That's right. Thank you very much. Okay, yeah, thank you. And so yeah, so I ended up with the point that if I have an arc, and really this arc can be anything, can be immersed, can be really complicated. Can be immersed, can be really complicated. What it will map into is two arcs turned into this figure eight, into a figure. Okay, so now let me say a few words about the proof. The proof is really a tech, very technical and complicated computation. But once you've done that computation and once you kind of arranged all the pieces to kind of arranged all the pieces to match. Let me describe maybe what happens from the higher from higher point of view. So let me describe first the unperturbed space. So the unperturbed space V0. In order to describe it, let me first describe another three-manifold, which is T2, so it's a torus, cross S1. Cross S1, modded out by elliptic convolution. So involution acts elliptically on T2 and antipodally on S1. So it's a three-manifold, and it is cipher-fibered over a pillowcase with order two singular fibers above the coordinates. And so now, if you take those singular fibers and crush them into the point, you get exactly V0. So crush singular. So, crush singular fibers and get V0. So, you see that V0 is a singular manifold. So, and so the map here is into the wrong direction. So, and you know, the map into the pillowcase basically has fiber S1 above smooth points, but above every corner is just one point. And so, those things, those singularities. And so those things at those singularities, it's a cone over torus. So let's now perturb. And so the way it turns out to work is that the perturbations around those curves that I introduced, if you take a function which is trace along the element which is defined by those holonomic curves. Wholenomic curves, then this function becomes. So, you know, there's a fiber here, S1 fiber, and that function becomes a Morse function on each fiber. And so when you perturb from each fiber, you get only two points surviving. And so what you get out of this is you've got the two copies of pilot case. So one inside one. So, one inside one and the other is outside. And then, well, here we had one point connecting those two pillowcases, but it turns out that when you perturb that point becomes a circle. And really, these two pillowcases, they are connected via these four circles. And let me say that the key computation, and it's a kind of a straight computation that one has to do, is that the Lagrange. That the Lagrangian correspondent misses the corners. And once you've done that computation, you can prove, you can deduce that actually these four corners do become these four circles and everything's smooth. So yes, that's all I wanted to say about the proof. Now let me say what does it tell us about the dependence on the earring? About the dependence on the earring, right? About the problem that I described. What about the daintists? Huh? Dane twists? Yeah, so the dainties, that's a good point. So the dainties, you prove basically by stacking. So basically, you want to draw this map and then you want to stack to this cobordism different angles. You can stack, for example, this tangle, get. Stack, for example, this tangle, get a non-knot, or you can stack another kind of tangle, for example, two-twist tangle, and you get a hoplink. And then by knowing instant homology, roughly speaking, by knowing instant homology of those knots, you can deduce certain intersection numbers and that will in turn prove that there must be those things. That there must be those dane twists. So, in fact, I mean, first you prove that there is n dane twist around one curve, m dane twist around another, k dane twist around the other, l dane twist around the other. So, there's four numbers, and then you prove that the four numbers are one. Okay, um, so now, yes, let me come back to the question that I started with. Um so what what is the insight that it prov that uh this theorem provides into dependence on the earning location? So, first a simple example of trefoil and it works turns out in this example. So, if you have this decomposition of a trefoil, you've got two arcs without a nearing and so if you turn one arc into figure eight, for example the red one, you get exactly three intersections, so three dimensions. Three intersections, so three-dimensional. Now, if you turn the other into figure eight, you get exactly three intersection again. And so the answer does not depend on where you put the okay. So let's study more complicated example, four or five torus nodes. So this is the example that Matt Chris and Paul studied in their And Paul studied in their paper. And the decomposition they take is this one. There's a trivial tangle, and another tangle, the red one, which looks trivial here, but if you do surgeries around this green curve, the rectangle becomes really complicated. In fact, the surgery takes S3 to S3, so one still ends up with One still ends up with the three-sphere, but the tor the knot becomes four or five torrs. Okay, so now if you compute and perturb the traces character varieties without a nearing, what you get is an arc and a complicated, you know, red arc, basically. So the interesting thing is that if you turn the red, sorry, no, let's turn the blue one. Turn the blue one. Turn the blue one into the one containing an earring. So, in that case, you just turn this arc into figure eight. Okay, that's good. And you count intersections, and there's nine of them, and then you count bygons, and then there's one bygone. And so, the answer is seven-dimensional, and it is institutional floor module four, five, fourth, but if you do the other way around, If you do the other way around, if you put the near on the red part, you turn this into figure eight or double compact ones. And it turns out that you again have nine intersections, but there's no more bygones. So the bygone disappeared. And a really interesting question that we stumbled upon is where does the pygon go? You know, I guess philosophically, the Pygon shouldn't just uh disappear. And shouldn't just disappear? And the answer exists, and here's how it goes. So, first, let me locate the problem. So, the problem really can be traced. So, this is a neighborhood of a corner. And if you have this figure eight, a blue one, and then if you have this wrapping red arc, you get this bygone from this generator to this generator. This is from this generator to this generator. But if you turn the red one into figure eight and keep the blue one being an R, there is no bygone. And so you can kind of localize this problem to this and study this picture. Okay. And so it turns out, if you dig in a little bit, what happens is that this Lagrangian correspondence Vs, the way we described it, does not really The way we described it does not really induce a well-defined functor on the Foucault categories of the pillow case. And but there are correction terms that you can add, and then it does describe. And the correction term is called the bounding co-chain. Well, it's the two. Bounding co-chains are the two, and Jonathan described what are those. And in this case, basically, a bounding co-chain B has to be added here. To be added here. And then having that bounding co-chain, this triangle, this triangle will resurrect the lowest point. Okay, so basically when you compose, and so B is in the cell pharmhomology of R of G1 compose Vs. And so the philosophy is that when we compose with our compose with our correspondence, we really should obtain some non-trivial bounding co-chains. And yeah, so the natural very natural question would be, okay, but how do we do this, right? How do we find these bounding co-chains? And I can see that I don't have much time. How much more time do I have, Liam? We started a little late, so you have a few minutes. All right. Okay. Right, okay. Yes, so basically, there's a recipe to find this bounding coaching. And the recipe starts with quilted fluorhomology. So I'll go a little bit quick. So quilted fluorhomology basically is assigns a fluorhomology to this triple of Lagrangian correspondence and Lagrangian. It's more general, but in our case, this is what it is. And then it It is, and then it assigns for it assigns this invariant here this quilt. And I let me not go into what are those quizzes, but quilts substitute bygons. Okay. And let me say that this tool works really well when everything is embedded. And this CUDA Florimoji is in fact equivalent to Fleurhemoji when you compose one way or to Fleurhemoji when you compose the other way. You compose the other way. But this theorem, it's a deep theorem by Woodward and Warheim, was proved only if everything is embedded. And yes, the CUDA formula was definitely invented by Warheim Woodward. So in our case, though, the problem is that everything is immersed. And that's why we need to add these boundary core chains. And the recent work of Botmeim and Warheim described how to add those. Describe how to add those boundary co-chains. And the recipe is basically: they describe a certain object which is called figure-eight bubble. And actually, maybe more generally, morsified trees of those figure-eight bubbles. And those bubbles output the necessary bombing coaching. And let me say that Foucault actually has an alternative approach based on Y diagrams, but it Diagrams. But in his approach, he implicitly proves that this bounding coaching, the necessary bounding coaching exists. But he doesn't provide, I guess, a particular model spaces which output this volume coaching. And the Y diagram technology is due to Likilian Lukansky. Okay, so how does this apply in our case? So So, yeah, I wanted to show you the particular quilt and the figure about the figure eight bubble, which corresponds to the loss differential. So, there's not much time, but roughly speaking, here it is. And, you know, the key point when you study this quilt is that the same condition on the quilt, so the quilt consists of two strips, one strip and another. One strip goes to one pillowcase, another strip goes to another pillowcase. Another street goes to another pillowcase, and then there is a sim condition. Let me say that the key point is that we have this Dane twist discrepancy between this map into pillowcase and this mapped into pillowcase. And this Dane twist discrepancy allows for first finding the quilt. And if you take this quilt and you take the width of one of the strips and map it. Of the strips and map it to zero. So if you let's say epsilon one goes to zero, it's relatively clear that what you get is this bygon that we actually saw. So the point is what happens when epsilon 2 goes to zero? This is the process that we need to study in order to obtain the bounding co-chain. And yeah, so on this page, I describe this process. And basically, what happens is that when this height of the street goes to zero, Botman and Markheim, they argue that this kind of bubble may occur. And in fact, it should occur in our case in order for d squared to be equal to zero. And we identify the homotopy. And we identify the homotopy class of this figure A bubble. So it turns out there's this type of figure A bubble. And the point is that this quilt degenerates into the triangle. So this is the triangle, which accounts for the differential, and the figure eight bubble. And the figure eight bubble consists of a disc on one pillowcase and this kind of strip in the other pillowcase. So we can see that figuration. That figure A bubble does occur. I mean, we only identify the homotopy class, but in fact, by their theorem, actually, they stated as a conjecture, I guess, theorem modulo details, as they stated. By their work, the boundary disfiguring model must exist. And the homotopy class is this one. All right, and let me just end. And let me just take 10 seconds and say that there is, as a result, we understand that killer case homology has to be upgraded to include these bounding co-chains. And there is an understanding that actually it must be upgraded for other bounding co-chains as well. So not only bounding co-chains can come not only from putting an earring, but also from having a high bridge, large bridge tangles. In that case, one. In that case, one has to account for those phony coaches as well. And this is in line with the floor field theory, which Warheim and Woodward studied. It's a framework to study these topological invariants coming from Lagrangian correspondence. All right, that's it. Thank you very much. Okay, well, let's thank our So, this may be a question that you want to push to the breakout room, but I would, is it possible, or maybe you can tell me why this is too naive, to push the, to work with the unperturbed curves and try to push this additional information into a more complicated count, just effectively pushing the earring into the surface. So well, let me say that the main difficulty with working with unperturbed things is that they're singular. And it is a difficulty, and it's not quite clear how they act. There's no general kind of way you can understand how. You can understand how they desingularize. That's one comment. Now, there's a second idea that you expressed that maybe one maybe if we return to this picture when we don't put an earring. Is there a way to put an earring on this picture? And I would say maybe yes. And I would say maybe yes. And I would maybe argue that this, if you take these two curves and take Reflect emoji of these curves, it makes sense. And it should be connected to different invariants that recently have been studied. So there's head invariant of Allianz Crease. There is an invariant of Kunheimer-Morovka, deformed Wincenton invariant, and then there's also KHI. Also, KI minus invariant of Jenkins Leap. And I think this red pharmology of these two things has to be connected to these invariants. And then you want to take a mapping cone on a certain element and obtain the natural single in synthetomology. So it's in short, the story is very similar to Barnettan, I think, but Barnantan, I think, but to work it out here is much more complicated because things are defined analytically. Great. Are there other questions? R. Tam, I think when I tried to correct your holonomy perturbation thing, I actually pulled you the wrong direction. So I think. So I think if you want to go back to that slide, maybe we can just set the record straight. All right. Let's see. I'm too quick. Would this be correct? Yes, that's correct. Thank you for correcting. Correcting. Sorry about that. No problem. Okay, well, I'm sure various conversations will continue in the discussion rooms. John sent the links. Let's thank Artem again.
