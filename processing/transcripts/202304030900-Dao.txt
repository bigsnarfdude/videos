Our first speaker today is Pa Long Gao, and he'll be thinking commentarily as an old bridge, which is different than okay. Go ahead, Long. Well, first of all, thank you very much to the organizers for this beautiful, totally undeserving opportunity to speak in front of you, many of you, many of you are view and Uh, a view I do and your company over the years. Um, so uh, the tip of my talk is that uh, despite the very active you inject between the two area, uh, modern information entrepreneurs, I think there's a lot to be explored, a lot of underutilized bridges between them, and so in this talk, I'm going to. And so in this talk, I'm going to extend that by pointing, hopefully drawing your attention to a few very simple problems that I have not before. And of course, since I'm not really expert in any of this area, if you see something that is similar, something you've seen before, please say so. Most of the So, um, most of the results here have been published, but it doesn't mean that anyone has read them, as we all know, uh, including the web piece. So, I hope to get a lot of feedback from you. Okay. Ah, okay, so my first story is about my participation on Math Overflow. Um, that's my only claim to fame. As you can see, I have two thousand more points than Team Gauer's period of credit. Our serious credential as a complete. And so the problem is it's let's S be a finite set of points in the international vector space, including the skies. So we say that S is two cover if it can be put on a union of substance whose sum is at most d minus one. Okay? So the Okay, so the simplest case is with d equal to two. So we are looking at putting, we are forcing our points to be on two spray whose sum of dimension is almost one, so it can only be one line and one point, right? One plus zero. So all but one have to be on a line. So it has your second to be covered by small. Be covered by small subset two subsets more. So, the question asks: if this thing can be inductively proved, so being too careful can be inductively proved after a certain threshold. So, is there a number so that if you know that any endless point of your set is to cover? If your set is two covered, then your whole set must be two covered. Is it clear what the question is? So let me prove it for D equal to two, right? That if you take at least five points, and if you know that any. Any n minus one is two covered, your whole set has to be two covered. Now, when we group two, we know that it just means that over one have to be on a line, right? So you're proving that in the easiest case, equal to five, you're trying to prove that if any four points has a probability that over one is on the alignment, then your five points have to be have four points on the line. Okay, and so here's a proof. If you have, you know, that every four point has its property, so three of them have. Four point has this property, so three of some have to be on the line, right? So P1, P2, P3, and you have two points left. So now you look at P1, P2, P4, P5. And if P4 is on the line of P1, P2, then we have four points on the line. But we still know that within this four point, you have to have three points on the line. So P4, P5 have to meet P1, P2, the line through P1, P2, and P1 or P2. Would be on p2 at p1 or p2. But once you have the if you pick p1, then now we look at p2, p3, p4, p5, then three of them will be on the line. Of course, this is a simple proof, but the problem is that this kind of proof does not seem to generalize, or at least you have to be perhaps very clever. And so, yeah, so the general question is still over. I cannot prove this general question. So I decided to put it on math overflow, and this is this criterion, modern criterion for math problem to be interesting. It's called MOR. So if you put it on math overflow and the expert there cannot answer within a couple of days, then it's probably worthy. And yeah, so it has been three days and there was a very And there was a very clever looking, very, very uniform approach suggested by Will Scalvin, which is another regular contributor there. But it has a flaw. He said a gap in it. And so I think he's still trying to fix it, but it's not been proved. But the point is that the question is okay. So if you get more of the talk, please try to. Please try to you can you can try to to uh to prove this, right? So just a good question. Okay, um so the original the question is so my point is that there are a lot of uh it's uh unexplored uh path between algebra and geometrics and and um and I will not have time to go into the detail but And we don't have time to go into the detail, but really, this question comes from giving a trying to give a combinatorial proof of the rather very fascinating segment in David Azamet book on geometry of CGGs. So if you look at the projective curve in R-dimensional vectors, in our dimensional projective space over the complex numbers, and if you know that the The certain Betsy numbers of the curve is non-zero, just one spot where it's non-zero, then you can say that the curves have to be a rational, normal curve. So a rather strong statement. So basically, the idea is that you take hyperplane section, you show that the points that lie on the hyperplane section cannot be too not be too clever if your curve is not rational normal curve. Curve at too many points. Anyways, that's. Okay, so move on to the next topic, which is similar to the last one in the sense that we're trying to understand how given a property of objects. Property of objects, we want to try to see if any, but one of them satisfies certain properties, and the whole. So, it's sort of a global segment. So, we now look at a simplification complex. I believe that everyone here is an expert. Probably most of you know more than me about this. And so, I'm not going to. And so, I'm not going to define a simpler complex, but I'm just in this part of the talk. I want to say that a complex is generated by its facets. Of course, a simplicial complex is known if you know all the facets, right? You know the biggest dimension phase. Once you can take all the subsets. And then I'm going to say that conflict is minimally quite Macaulay. Minimally, quite Macaulay. If you take the complex generated by, it's not like deleting one facet, but take the complex generated by all, but one facet, right? You will still get, you will no longer get Coinball. So there's no way to get Kubernetes if you just drop one generator, facet generator. Is there a clock in here? I can't. I'll take it. Okay, thanks. And A means? Okay, all right, thanks. So, oh yeah, so the definition is that, yeah, that's the definition of minimum coincolid and you, yes. Is it clear to everyone, right? So, and again, it's very simple example. In dimension, I was one, they have no interest. There are no interesting minimally minimal complex. For example, if you look at, so if you look at dimension one, right, it's a graph, then being comical just means that it has to be connected. So it has a spanning tree, right? And so if you delete the end, the leaf, right, it will still be connected. So there will always be an edge that An edge that when you delete, still keep it connected, right? And so it's still quernmacaulic. So anything, any graph of more than two edges is not going to be minimally quer-macaulic. Easy to see. And the story starts to become interesting in dimension two or higher. So the first So the first result that is not hard to prove, but I think makes the conceptually interesting is that any one-macaulay complex is shallow over minimum. That's almost by, well, okay. So if it's not minimal, you can remove, you can drop one facet, right? Until you get to the to a minimal one, that's for sure. That's it. That's free from. From um, from from definition, but of course, uh, the only content is that you prove that every time you drop that, it's a shallow, it's a shallow removed, and but that's pretty sad so so it means that you uh you know so so uh so so the facet interact with the rest it's in uh something of four dimensional one right so basically every time you intersect Time you intersect with the whole one, you get a four-dimensional one simpler. So, shallow ball, if you if you're interested in this, of course, the shallow complex is a huge topic in topological communitaries. Okay. And so, any, yes, over some field. Over some people. Yes, yes, yes. Thank you for clarifying that. I did say from the beginning that I would work over some fixed field, but I did not say it. It is on the side. I will send everyone. Are there other questions? You can form a group. Find a room. I haven't considered that. But yeah, that's a yes, in a small drawable example that is minimum. We'll see. We'll see. We see plenty of examples, very modern, therefore. So, okay. um so okay so um so in in a in a very strong sense understanding complex uh it amounts to understand the minimum one plus short bit it's everything shall over something so they generate the whole category by shorting so perhaps it's not surprising that that if you look at many interesting examples in uh in topological community topological communitorates they turn out to be they turn out to be you know but let me give you some uh uh sort of collection result that that that allow uh us to prove such a statement it's not really uh that's not to worry about the detail uh we prove that for example acyclic quadrupole pseudo-manifolds are hemo quadrupoly the join of two minimal Two minimal and former colli ones, a minimal permacoli. Strongly non-shellable balls by SD5 and Zikla are minimally former colleague. So, but you know, don't worry about this. I'll send out the slide if you're interested. But the interesting part is that we can get, as Jose asked, a lot of Jose asks a lot of examples, right? So, any triangulation of projective space over a few characteristics, not two, but of even dimension. So, in dimension two, the first interesting, as we saw before, the dimension one and lower, there are no interesting one, but dimension two, you have triangulation of the project phase, right? Deep spice, right? Um, Dan's had been house in two rooms. Um, the counter example, some beautiful recent counter example of Duvan, Governor, Clevins, and Martin, a non-partitionable quantum-colleak complex that answered a question by Stein. It's a minimum quantum colli complex. And then the Complex and then the follow-up by Gubiska and Ventuelo about a balanced example. It's also meaningful. So of course it's almost there's a proof by nature that, well, if you find some interesting example and it's not a minimal point of quality, you probably can find something smaller, right? So, but it's Right, so but I still feel it quite interesting that people get to all this example and get this in the efficient way, most efficient way possible, even though they probably didn't set out to do it, but they set to this most efficient from our point of view. So that's very satisfying to know that there's some sort of, I don't know. I don't know. Maybe that's a god. I don't know. Guy the world. So okay, maybe let's see. Yeah, so perhaps you have Edmund, so perhaps I can talk about the next two topics. The next one will be a little short, and again, you don't need to really make sense of the theorem here. The theorem here. It comes from algebra. Actually, it's what inspired by a result by Murai Teran about H vector of circuit complex satisfying condition SR. Okay, so S said condition SR is a kind of a depth condition, local depth condition on ring. And right here, I wrote this beautiful paper about This beautiful paper about how the presence of this condition was the edge factor of the complex to satisfy certain strong conditions. And so I visited Matteo Gavaro in Italy. Actually, I was doing this mock back conference. South View were there as well. And I suggested that. And I suggested that we try to generalize morai to write to a non-square-free case. So you will, there are a lot of sort of similarities that appear in the minimum model program that has properties that are similar to Stanley Marshall ring that we can explore. We can exploit it and prove a similar statement. And so that was done. We did that together with Lindsay. And we did that together with Lin Tron Ma, who joined our project later. But then we realized that once we prove this vanishing theorem about the H vector, we realize that we have a consequence of this vanishing theorem. And the consequence lies in this last sentence here. So if you have a variety defined by load, by a point, By a polynomial low degree, relatively low degree with respect to the codimension for the big hard. So the sum of the biggest E degree of the generator is less than equal to some number. Then you get at least quantum calling for free. And so that's again very surprising standard. I have the sorry I what E is the best E plus uh oh yeah I think one or I forgot that yeah I did probably sorry yeah I have to look at the paper but let me let me let me talk about the But let me let me let me talk about uh let me talk about the standard person which is still open which I think is is more um important anyway so the um statement is this if you if you have a simple complex and uh you look at a stellar rational ring and here the E is just the um right the number of vertices minus the number of vertices in the smallest class so it So, in algebra, parallels this will be called the big height of the ring. Okay, so minus the co-dimension of the biggest component, sorry, dimension of the biggest component. So, now we look at the sorry, co-dimension of the simulation code. Anyway, so that's number E, and you look at the generator of the Of the of the um ideal, and you arrange them by size, so d1, d2. And so, the second is that if the sum is less than the number of variables, then your complex is acyclic. We don't get chromocolic, but the conjecture is that you get some acyclicity. So, again, very simple. So, again, very simple statement. And perhaps if some of you thought about it seriously, maybe hopefully you can give us a proof or something. But I just feel it's curious that. And I've talked to Russ and Jay about this problem. Did we put it for two for some special case? And I think. Proved it for some special case, and I think we almost kind of proved it for a bigger case because there was kind of a fable error in it. Yeah, so I think we proved maybe for that complex and but yeah, some easy phase. Otherwise, all of the funnels yeah, but if you will not the mechanic, it will boost up the generator and you will violate. The generator and will violate them. Yeah. One. Yeah, it's strange. It's strange. I agree. Oh, if you want to speak your bar. Okay. If you want to see your body. Two minutes. I have two minutes. Okay. Yeah. So I don't. Yeah, I have perfect. Yeah, two minutes. I have perfect yeah two minutes uh the last one I want to talk about is higher nerves of a of a circle complex simplicial complex so again everyone probably know what the nerve complex are you can do it for any set actually any collection of set you just take the simplicial complex defined by subset whose intersection is not empty right and that from the nerve and if you have a simplicial complex you just simply take the nerve to be the nerve of the Be the note of the facets. So we make the definition. And again, I would love to know if this has been, as I said before, with all the things I talk about in my talk. I just hope that if you can tell me that, oh, but I can't believe it's that something like this has not been studied. So if you have seen something. If you have seen something similar, I would love to hear about it. So it's very simple. You would define another modified version of the nerve by requiring that the subset has an intersection at least some size I. So, of course, it's still simply too complex. If you take i equal to one, you just say that you know it's an intersection, it's not empty. So, but you So, but uh you should and so oh okay and so uh so so what we can prove is that you can use this to uh recover um uh so the classic theorem by uh both shock says that the uh the nerve complex and the original complex has a similar homology uh that we can uh do a little further with this uh you can from this higher nerve complex you can can from this high level complex you can you can recover a lot of algebraic and topological variants um so it's very useful if you have a complex with few facets right so then the higher number very easy to like add so it's in in a way it's kind of similar to the last problem there's some connection there i think but i cannot find a direct connection here anyway this result is not so important the point that Result is not so important, applying that there exists a transfer of information, and yeah. So, what can we do with trying those? Well, you know, you can define it very generally for topological space. You can define, for example, any, in fact, any lattice, any map from your topological space to some lattice, right? You can define a high enough. And I, again, I believe that perhaps some people in algebraic topology have done it. Break topology have done it, but I have nothing in Zambian studies. So, yeah, what else can I do? And with that, I want to thank you for your attention.
