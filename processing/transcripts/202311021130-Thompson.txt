Mass black holes. And then, what is the significance of any black holes within compact star systems? And then I'll end off with some preliminary measurements from one target had observed by the Jane Foam Space Telescope. To start off, the black hole, black holes can be categorized generally into three different categories based on their mass. On the one end, you have the stellar mass black holes that range like one to ten solar masses in size, and these form from the depths of massive And these form from the desks of massive stars. On the other end, you have these massive black holes, which are over a million solar masses, found in the center of all massive galaxies we look at, and they help drive the star formation in those cores. However, there's a large mass gap between 10 solar masses in the stellar mass black hole range and the million plus massive black holes, which leads to the natural question of: are there any black holes that fall in between this mass range? Between this mass range, there's a proposed third type, the intermediate mass black hole, that fills the range of 100 to 100,000 small masses. The only issue is that they have been very hard to find and observe due to various technological and observational challenges. As for how I want to find intermediate mass black holes, there's a couple few main theories on how these massive black holes form or evolve over time. And these different theories can be generally categorized. These super theories can be generally categorized into the light seed theories and the heavy seed theories. The light seed theories say that these supermassive black holes started as very small, low-mass initial black hole seeds, and then through mergers and accretion over the course of the time, they form larger and larger black holes until they become a supermassive black hole. And when we look out into the universe today, we would expect to see a high frequency of international. To see a high frequency of intermediate mass black holes in low-mass stellar systems. On the other side, with the heavy seed theories, this says that the supermassive black holes start as heavy initial mass black hole seeds, and then again through mergers and accretion, form into supermassive black holes. And because of the large initial black hole seeds, when we look into the universe today, we would expect to see a low frequency of intermediate mass black holes in low-mass star systems. In short, the frequency of intermediate mass black holes observed in these low-mass stellar systems helps to improve our current massive black hole formation theories. And some examples of low-mass stellar systems include compact elliptical galaxies, nuclear star clusters, and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, or UCDs. I say galaxies with quotation marks because we're not really too sure what they are. We're not sure if they're just really overmassive globular clusters. Really overmassive globular clusters, or if they once were a much larger dwarf galaxy that just had the diffuse material stripped away. And these UCDs are of particular interest because back in 2014, there was a supermassive black hole detected in a UCD in the Virgo Galaxy Cluster. And due to the technology at the time, they had to use a ground-based telescope, and they were restricted to looking at only the biggest and the brightest UCDs. UCDs. So, fortunately for the James Boat Space Telescope, the resolution has improved. We're able to look at lower mass and dimmer UCD targets. So, the thinking would be that if there's massive black holes in large UCDs, smaller UCDs might host smaller, more intermediate mass black holes. In the years following, there were more supermassive black hole detections in UCDs by other groups. Hole detections in UCDs by other groups. Another perk of searching compact solar systems for use for black holes with the core is that they can, the presence or lack thereof can help us inform our understanding of how UCDs came to be. This is a plot that has the log of the radius of some star systems in the universe. In the universe on the x-axis, and then the mass and the magnitude of them on the y-axis. And here you have your giant splaro galaxies, your giant elliptical galaxies, the ones that are really nice to look at in pretty. And then moving down to the lower and the lower radii and the lower masses, you have your dwarf galaxies. And on this side, you have your globular clusters, which are not galactic in origin. Are not galactic in origin. And then finally, this little group here are the UCDs. And since they're so close to globular clusters, we're not too sure, do they from there? Or were they potentially larger dwarf galaxies that just had material stripped away, moving them to the lower radii and the lower masses? So, to find a black hole, how do you find something that you can't see? How do you find something that you can't see? Because, unless they're actually creating matter, they won't be emitting any radiation. You can look at how the black hole's gravity affects the velocities of the nearby stars in the systems. So to do this, I measure something called the velocity dispersion, which is how much the velocities in these clusters vary from the average. So if we have a perfectly flat spectrum in theory, Perfectly flat spectrum in theory, it would look something like this: with just how intense the flux is on the y-axis, and then the wavelength of the x. And then, if we had some absorption lines where an element or molecule absorbed light at very specific wavelengths, we would see these absorption features here where the light is less intense. And this is if there's one star that isn't moving relative to us, then if we have one. Then, if we have one star that is moving away from us at 25 kilometers per second, these features would be Doppler-shifted to the redder end of the spectrum. And then if we have another star in our field of view, this time moving towards us, those features would be blue-shifted towards us. And as there's more and more stars in the field of view, these absorption features get broader, and this is called the velocity dispersion, how much they average. Average. And different star systems in the universe have different velocity dispersions, and the larger mass they are, the wider the absorption features are. To measure this, I use IFU spectroscopy, which produces data cubes that have a basically have a white image on one face, and then each pixel contains. And then each pixel contains the spectrum of light for that area of the sky, and this is actual raw data from the Danza Space Telescope. So, what I do is I can make velocity maps showing the velocity dispersion throughout these clusters. These are examples of maps that I will be making. And you can group the pixels together, make measurements of the dispersion in various areas around the UCDs, and then What the Group in 2014 found was near the edges. They had dispersion measurements that were what you would expect. But right there in the core of the dispersion measurements, all of a sudden spiked up to around 110 homes per second. And through modeling, they found that the only possible reason for this increase in velocity dispersion was that there was a supermassive black hole at the core. I did the same thing, fit some template spectra. Fit some template spectra to my actual data and some software shifts around and broadens these absorption features and help returns the velocity dispersion based on how much the template starts had to be broadened to fit the actual data. Right now I've been making 1D radial velocity dispersion maps that show how the velocity dispersion changes at the increasing radii in the UCD. So in the center we have about 40 kilometers. So in the center we have about 40 kilometers per second and as we go to the lower, the more exterior radii, the velocity dispersion decreases. And I recently just fit, used some, fit these radial plots with some modeling software that can help determine, determines if there's a presence of a black hole based in dispersion. This black line is based on This black line is based on the light profile of the UCD, what you would expect the velocity dispersion measurements to be at the various radii. And then the blue dots are my actual data, and the red is the model that it returns with the black hole that would cause the measurements that we are seeing. I'm out of time. I'll leave these summary points up and out take questions. Is there time for two quick or one long question? I still have David Dan first. Yeah, have you ever thought about doing this for globular clusters? Yeah, so we, globular clusters, unless they're fairly close to us, they're harder to resolve on the UCDs. And they do, because globular clusters would have a smaller black hole, you need a higher resolution data cube. But you can look at the Globular Cluster as a whole. You can look at the globular cluster as a whole, and from their entire velocity dispersion measurement, infer if there is an elevated measurement that might be dark matter or a black hole or something. Yes? So given my understanding of what you said, really nice talk by the way, we can actually watch the light seed example happening in LIGO data. We have some examples of IRBHs forming. Does that influence the way that you? Does that influence the way that you think about this problem? No, because the overarching question that I'm focused on is, are the UCDs galactic in origin? So we wouldn't really be looking for the mergers in that way. We're trying to mostly look at... Also not too sure since they would have formed. Since they would have formed further at like higher redshifts, with ours, they would be at a quite low redshift, so not really. And we also expect it to be like two galaxies merging together, and their black holes would be merging together. I'm not too sure if LIGO would be detecting those types of things. Let's check. Okay. Sounds good. All right. What's next?
