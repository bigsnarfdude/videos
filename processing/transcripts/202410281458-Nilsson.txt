To be organizers for the invitation to give this talk. Yeah, so I will be talking about a model equation. So this CHKP here stands for the Kamasa-Holgen KP1 equation. So before I start talking about this equation, I will first give some background. I mean, this would be well known to Known to most of you here, and Max also spoke about it in his talk. But I will start by giving some background on the KPA equation. But first, maybe I should say that this is a joint work with Dr. Ross, who's here, and Juxian Wang at Banfurk University. Okay, yes, then so I will start by saying something about the KP equation, but okay, this would be what was known to most of you, so I won't say so much, but it was introduced by Colonel Servant Petroschili in Petroschilli in 1970 as a model for mainly unidirectional waves in a plasma, but since then it has also been seen that it can model other physical phenomena, in particular water waves. And there are two versions of this equation called Kp1 when sigma is equal to minus 1 and Kp2 when sigma is equal to 1. And Kp one corresponds in a case of strong surface tension when we talk about water weight, and Kp two is the weak surface. Do with the wheel of service action case. And important here is which Mats also talked about is that the KP1, sorry, the KP equation can be seen as a two-dimensional extension of the KDB equation. So the KDB equation is here and it's also present here, like the KP equation. And I mean this was a kind of motivation for by that kind of Petricili had when they introduced it. They want to kind of study the transverse instabilities. So that's why they kind of extend. So that's why they can extend it to this two-dimensional model. Okay, yeah, so the other equation appearing in this name was the Camasa-Holm equation. So let me say something about that as well. So this is the Camasa-Holm equation, and this was introduced by Thomas and Holm in 1993 as a model for unidirectional shallow water waves. And this equation has soldier waves. Equation has soldier waves, so traveling waves of this form, which decay to zero as x minus cp goes to plus or minus infinity, only when c is greater than this 2 kappa, or kappa is this parameter appearing here in the equation. And these solutions are smooth, positive, and even. And they're also unique of the translation. So given this C satisfying this, you get a unique solution. And this wave also has. And this wave also has a single peak of height C minus two kappa and decays actually. And this was proved. This result here was proved by Constantinist in 2002. So throughout this talk, I will denote this unique solitaire wave. I will call this the Kamasa-Holm solita wave and I will call it Q of X. So this will always denote this solitaire wave here of the Kamasa-Holm equation. And also, I should mention here famously the Kamaster-Holm equation for Kapl equal to zero, it has these picon solutions, so solutions that look something like this, so an exponential with an absolute value. Okay, so that was a bit of background on these two model equations. So let's now go to the equation that we have studied, so the so-called Kamas-Holm KP equation. So this is kind of what you would expect. You have the kind of Kamas-Holm equation here. You have the kind of Camus-Holm equation here, and then you extend it in the same way as you do for, say, the KDB equation, meaning that you add this term here, sigma, and then a second derivative in y on u. So as I say here, as the KP equation is extension of the KDB equation, this Camus-Holm KDB equation is an extension of the Camus-Holm equation as well. And again, we kind of differentiate here between We kind of differentiate here between these two versions when sigma is equal to minus one. Again, we call this the Camusaholm Kp1 and the Camusaholm Kp2 when sigma is equal to. And so where does this come from? Well, as far as I know, it was first derived by Ning Chen in the setting of non-linear elasticity, but more recently it has also been derived from the Euler equations by Guin and co-authors. By you and co-authors. And you also proved local well-postedness, I think, for one of the versions of this. And one thing to note here is that the Kamasa-Holm sorter wave Q, which I talked about on the previous slide, this is of course a solution of this equation because it's independent of Y, so it solves this. And we call this a line sort of wave. It does not depend upon y. So yeah, so very recently this Camuson Kp equation has been studied in the setting of where they have, well, they have investigated the stability or instability of this line soldier wave. So Chen and Yi proved that non-linear transverse instability of these line soldier waves for the Camus Home Kp1 equation and that transverse linear stability of line salt waves was for the Camusham Kp2. Solarways was for the Camuson KP2 was proved by Anna Geyer, Lewin Polinowski. And I think that Anna Geyer will talk about this result. I think she's speaking tomorrow. So if you want to see more about this, you should listen to the talk. And also, there is a result on spectral stability of small amplitude line periodic travelling waves. And this was also proved in this recent paper. And this is actually for even more general. And this is actually for an even more general family of equations called in BKB equations, which include this Kausa Holm-Kb equation. Okay, so that was some background on this. So what we were interested in in our work was looking at so-called the existence of periodically modulated solitary waves for the Camus-Holm-KP1 equation. So, what are these? Well, these are traveling waves which has a solitary profile in the X direction. Ultra rate profile in the X direction and then a periodic profile in the Y direction. So I will show an example of, I have a picture of an example of this on the next slide. But we show that these waves, they bifurcate from this Kamusha-Horm line solitary Q in a dimension-breaking bifurcation. So this is a type of bifurcation where, in this case, say a two-dimensional solution emerges from a one-dimensional solution. So in this case, A one-dimensional solution. So, in this case, you get like a two-dimensional solution from this line sort of way. And this type of verification, as far as I know, was at least one of the first was studied by Hargers and Kishkesner in 1996. But since then, these types of solutions have been found for quite a lot of different equations. In particular, for the full waterway problem, in the case of strong surface tension, this was proven in 2002 by Mark Panayana and Mark Rayona and Chi Ming. And then in the case of weak surface tension improved more recently in 2016 by Mark Chiming and Edward. And also for the David-Stewartson equation, there are the starts of the KP1 equation and also for the fractional KP1 equation. Yeah, so as I said, we were interested in these types of solutions, these periodically modulated solidarities. So on the next slide, I borrowed a picture from this. Next slide, I borrowed a picture from this 2002 paper by Mark Moriona and Shi Ming. So here you see a yeah, so you have a say a line solitary wave here. So in this case, this is like a KDV solitaire wave of depression, since we're in the strong surface tension case here. And then if you do this barification where you kind of add a periodic part to this, this you This, you will get this periodically modulated wave here. So you see, it's kind of periodic here now. In this case, it's called set direction here. We have a variable, I call it y. But this is what it looks like in this case, for instance. So this is what I mean by a periodically modulated sort. This is what they look like. Okay. So let me start saying a bit how we can prove the existence of these types of solutions. So, first of all, these are traveling ways. So, first of all, these are traveling waves. So, let's start by making just the regular traveling wave answers in the disk-masterhold KP1 equation. So, we introduce some new function B, which is our traveling wave. Okay, then you get this equation. And then, since we are looking here for these types of solutions, essentially, where you start with this line sort of wave, and from this, you want to have this kind of bifurcation into this periodic wave. Bifurcation into this periodic wave. So, what we do is that we make ansats saying that we look for solutions v, which are, we have this q of export, this line-solter wave, plus this new unknown function phi, where phi is periodic in y, and then it decays as x goes to plus minus infinity. So, this will give this so this is the type of solutions we want to find, because so this is our periodically modulated. Our period to be modulated for each one. Okay, so if we take this here, plug this into the traveling wave equation here and simplify a bit, we get this new equation for phi. So this is our new unknown. So this line sort of wave Q now appears in the equation. Okay, and this we can rewrite a bit more. So we go a bit further, introduce a new one called phi, sorry, psi of x. So we say that. psi of x, so we say that phi is equal to psi of x, and then if we integrate in x, we can rewrite this equation that we had here on the previous slide. This can be written now in terms of this new unknown psi in this kind of convenient form. So it's now written as minus L psi. We have a nonlinearity n, and then we have the part coming from the y period. And l here is this operator. So it's minus and then we have dx m dx where m here is this. Where m here is this thing here. So note here that m depends on this q here, since this was in the equation. And the non-linear part looks like this. So this is what it is. Okay, so then we can then formulate our main result. And this is what it says. So if c is greater than this 2 kappa, so this is what's the condition you needed to have these line soldier waves of the Commons-Holm equation, then there exists an open neighborhood. Of the origin and a continuous differentiable branch. So, this is a subset of this set here. So, this is kind of a solution curve of solutions of this equation one. And these are odd in x and 2 pi divided by omega s periodic and y, so this is the period. And this omega 0 is the square root of the absolute value of lambda. And this lambda here is a negative. Negative number is the single negative eigenvalue of this linear operator L. So, this is what the minus of reads. So, first of all, of course, that this operator L here has a single negative eigenvalue. It's of course not immediate. This is something you need to prove. But this is the statement. Okay, so for the rest of the talk, I will talk a bit about how to prove this result. So, the main ideas of the proof were basically two main steps, you could say, and we follow here the strategy of some of the earlier works that I mentioned before, where they prove the existence of these periodically modulated soldier waves. So, the first step is to reformulate the problem as a dynamical system. So, this was this spatial dynamics approach that Bastian briefly mentioned in his talk. In this talk. And then, once you have done that, we use an infinite-dimensional version of the Lyapuno-Center theorem, and this will give us the existence of these periodic solutions. So, basically, an application of this theorem will directly give us this result here. So, that's the idea. We first reformulated the system with Y playing the role of time, and then we use this Lyoponocenter theorem. And I will write down this theorem in a couple of slides and say something about it. A couple of slides and say something about. But yeah, so if we can do this, we will get these periodically modulated solar waves that we're looking for. Yeah, so let me then go in a bit more detail how to do this. So let's start with this spatial dynamics formulation. So this is very straightforward in our case. I mean, this is the equation we have. That's the one I wrote down earlier. So in order to rewrite this as a dynamic system, we kind of do this in the obvious way. We introduce this new variable w, which is w1. variable w which is w1 w2 and just say that w1 is psi y and w2 is just psi and then of course you get a dynamical system this is what it looks like so we now have this new equation that we want to solve this l here now is this kind of matrix valued operator where the operator l here that we have an equation appears here and we have this nonlinearity so so this is this is our then our dynamical system our spatial dynamics formulation okay then as I said Okay, then, as I said, the next step is then to apply this Euro-Pommer-Senti theorem. Okay, let me say this as well first. So, let me just say something about the kind of setting we're working in here. So, we will kind of study this operator on these function spaces, x and y. So, this is kind of the, well, apart from this saying that we consider odd functions, if we just look at the regularity, this is kind of the natural spaces to work in. The natural spaces to work in because see this L here is like a differential operator of order 4, which is kind of why we're working in H4 here. So we will consider this operator L here. We will consider it as an operator on X with the domain Y. So this is why we want H4 here and H2. And then this would be a mapping from this L here is then a mapping from set Y to X. And these are just kind of defined in the And these are kind of defined in the standard way with these models. Okay, so that was a short about that. And I will get back to later why we're just looking at all the functions here, why we're restricted to this, but I will get back to this very short. Okay, but then let's have a look at this Lyoponocenter theorem that I mentioned. So this is just an extension of the classical Lyoponocenter theorem to infinite dimensions. So I mean Um, so I mean, if we have a differential equation of this type that I that I uh wrote down on on like two slides ago, okay, so so more abstractly, then we say here that this W should belong to some Banach space, and we have the following assumptions. So, these three first assumptions here are typically very easy to check, they're more or less immediate. So, I mean, we just say here that okay, L this tends to define a closed linear operator and see this non-linearity. See, this non-linearity n here is sufficiently smooth. And we also require reversibility of this equation, meaning that we have a some boundary operator S on X satisfying this here, so the equation kind of anti-commutes with this operator. This is what we mean by reversibility. But typically, the most difficult thing to check when you apply this theorem is the last three points here. We want there to be a single. Say a single, oh sorry, we wanted to exist some omega zero such that plus minus i omega zero are the simple eigenvalues of this operator L. And then we don't want there to be any other eigenvalues of this type, i, n, omega 0. So these should all be in the resolvent set for L when n is not equal to plus minus 1. And then in addition, we have this resolvent estimate. So we want when we Estimates. So we want when we look at the operator node from x to x, we want this type of estimate. And when we look at it from x to the domain of L, in our case from x to y, we want this type of estimate. Yeah, but under if this hypothesis are true, then the theorem says that there exists an open neighborhood of the origin and this continuously differentiable branch of solutions, and you have that they are periodic in this sense that I wrote down before. So, as I said, if we by applying this. We, if we, by applying this theorem here, we kind of get our result immediately from it. So, this is the task. So, yeah, so as I said, these kind of last three points are typically the most difficult ones. I won't really say anything about these. And in particular, I will focus on these two points. More or less, I will investigate the spectrum of our operator L and say something about how we can verify that we have these types of eigenvalues and that there are no other eigenvalues of this type. Values of this time. And then, if I have time at the end, I would say something about the resolvent estimates as well. But okay, let's start then by just recalling here what the problem was. So we had this operator L here, and this was kind of built using this other operator L, and this in turn was defined using this M here, or M was this thing here. So we have kind of three layers here in a sense. We have M, L, and then we have this kind of curly L here as well. L here as well. So in order to determine the spectrum of this matrix L here, it's kind of natural to first determine the spectrum of M, then use that to determine the spectrum of L, and then finally, you can kind of combine that to determine the spectrum of this matrix-valued operator. So that's kind of the idea. So our first, well, our first lemma here is saying that this operator M here, which is an operator from, well, I said it the From well, it's the domain here is H2 and it's mapped to L2. Our first result says that this is self-adjoint and it has a simple eigenvalue lambda 0 with some eigenfunction psi 0 and ish 2 and it also has a simple eigenvalue 0 with eigenfunction q prime. So q prime if you recall was this line sort of. And then the rest of the spectrum is positive and bounded away from zero. So yeah, let me let me Yeah, let me at least write out kind of the main steps of this proof. So, first of all, self-adjointness is kind of follows from standard results about these types of second-order differential operators. So, I won't say anything about that. But let me say something about how we determine the spectrum of this operator. And here we follow an argument in this paper by Konstantina Strauss with the study, the kind of a corresponding operator for the standard Kamas-Holm equation. So, we start here by making a change of variables in this way. In this way. So then, under this change of variable, this operator m here changes into this operator here, where k here is this new operator defined like this. And the point of doing this is that we kind of now have this, the leading order part of the leading order derivative here now is constant in comparison with what we had in L, where we kind of had this q minus c here in between the derivatives. In between the derivatives. So, the point of that is that since this is now constant, it's kind of easy to determine the essential spectrum of this operator. So, first of all, this Q here is simply a function. So, if you consider this as a multiplication operator from H2 to L2, this is compact. So, the essential spectrum of K here is equal to the essential spectrum of this operator here minus partial derivative z squared plus. Partial derivative set squared plus c minus 2 kappa. And the essential spectrum of this is just this interval here. So c minus 2 kappa is a positive number by assumption. We assumed that c was greater than 2 kappa. And then using just standard Sturm-Louisville theory, we had then added that there are at most finitely many eigenvalues located to the left of this C minus 2 kappa. And the nth eigenvalue in increasing order has a unique eigenfunction with precisely n minus 1. function with precisely n minus 1 zeros. So we can now use this information here to say something about the spectrum of the original operator m. So first of all it will have the same properties as k since they're resolated to each other with this change of variables. And it's easy to check that m q prime is equal to 0. So 0 really is an eigenvalue with this eigenfunction. And we also know that q prime has exactly one zero. So I mean q with this line sorta solution it has just Line sort of resolution is that it has just like a single peak, so Q' has precisely one zero. So, using this information here that the nth eigenvalue has n minus one zeros, we can then say that this zero here must be, say, the second eigenvalue. And therefore, there is precisely one negative eigenvalue, then, and this is what we call this lambda zero, and it has some eigenfunction psi zero in each two. So, this this kind of finish. So, this kind of finishes the proof of this lemma, but this is what we wanted to show. Okay, so then we know something about the spectrum of this operator M. And then let us then go back and see what we can prove using this, what we can prove for the operator L, which was related to M in this way. So, first of all, it's kind of straightforward to show that this is self joint, and then if we then continue to prove the well, to say something about the spectrum, we have the following dilemma. Uh, we have the following dilemma. This operator L has a single negative eigenvalue, lambda. And again, we have that here that the rest of the spectrum is included in this integral 023. So, again, let me briefly kind of go through the proof of this. So, first of all, this operator earlier can be written like this. And again, we have here that this part here, the director here, is a compact operator. So, again, we can say that well. Well, this part here that's left, this is a positive operator, so its spectrum is included in this interval. So the essential spectrum of L will at least be a subset of this interval here. So what we then want to prove is that L has a single negative eigenvalue, and we're going to use a say a min-max principle here. So if you take this sequence of psi of n, such that the derivative of psi n converges to n converges to psi 0 in H2 state. So let me remind you here what psi 0 was. This was this single negative eigenfunction, the eigenfunction corresponding to lambda 0, which was this single negative eigenvalue of m. So just kind of using this just looking at this thing here, so we take the inner product with LPS with self-erpsion. Psi n with self perpsi n. And then just use the definition of L and rewrite it a little bit. We see that, and then using this convergence here, we see that this converges to this. And since this psi 0 here was an eigenfunction of m, this is equal to lambda 0, and then just the norm of psi 0. And since lambda 0 is negative, this is negative. So we then know that the infimum of the spectrum, at least, is negative, so it has at least one negative eigenvalue. And then we use now that the m psi inner product. M psi inner product with psi is at least greater than or equal to zero for all psi belonging to the orthogonal complement of psi zero. So then we can say that this L psi psi inner product here is at least greater than or equal to zero for all for all sine H4 in this set here. So what this means is that L is non-negative on a co-dimensional one subspace, so this means that So this means that L has, if we now combine this with this argument here, that we know that the infromo that it has at least one negative eigenvalue, this shows that it has precisely one negative eigenvalue, which is what we want. Okay, so then we know a bit about spectrum, but now let me come to this why we want to restrict to all the functions here. So the point of making this restriction. The point of making this rejection is that we can prove this lemma, then that if we cannot consider L as an operator on H four odd, so meaning that we restrict all functions to L2 odd, this is self-adjoint and invertible. So self-adjoint is this immediate, this we already knew. But the point is here that it is invertible, meaning that, say, zero is not in the spectrum of L. So this is not something that we necessarily knew because from this attrope, we just knew that the spectrum was included in this interval, but in fact, if we now In this interval, but in fact, if we now restrict odd functions, we can kind of remove the zeros from this spectrum. So, this is what we're doing here. So, this is quite straightforward to prove. I think maybe, yeah, let me briefly go through it. So, if we take an element psi, the kernel of this operator, then by definition we have this is zero, so meaning that this um uh this here must be constant, since the derivative of it is zero. Since the derivative of it is zero. But this should at least be in, say, H1, so this constant must in fact be zero. So then we know that the derivative of psi must be in the kernel of m but the kernel of m is just equal to say, well, it's just equal to the span of this q prime. So it must be a multiple of q prime, but q is even, so this means that psi must be even as well. But since we had this restriction that we But since we had this restriction that we say that we're only looking at odd functions here, we must in fact have that psi 0 here. So L is injected. And if we now combine this with the fact that it's self-adjoint, we have that the perpendicular complement here or orthogonal complement here of the range is zero. So it's actually surjective as well. And then using the open mapping theorem, it has a valid inverse. So we then know that it is invertible. So zero is not in the spectrum. Okay. Okay, yeah, so you can kind of summarize the result here about the spectrum of L now in this corollary. So, this is what we have. It has precisely one eigenvalue, which is negative, and the rest of the spectrum is included in it. So, then we can finally kind of turn to the operator that we're actually interested in, meaning this matrix value operator here, and where we now, as I said, we kind of restrict all functions here. So, this is where we study it on this as an operator from, say, y to x. Say y to x. Yeah, so so the kind of last thing to do then is to say use this result and to say something about the spectrum of this operator. And this is now very straightforward because what you do is that you simply write out the resolvent equation and kind of solve it. And you then see that, well, this mu here is in the resolvent set if and only if mu squared is in the resolvent set of L. But of course we know what the resolvent set is. know what the say what the resolvent set is of this. So rho of L is just equal to this. So this leads us then to say that the resolvent set of this L must be this set here. So it's C with these points removed here. And this I tilde here is this sum interval between R with sigma removed. So in particular from this we find that mu is an eigenvalue of L if and if and only if mu squared is an eigenvalue of L has only if mu squared is an eigenvalue of L and this then implies that mu must be equal to plus minus square root of the actual value of lambda where lambda here is the negative eigenvalue of l. So this is now very straightforward to prove once we know the spectrum of this other operator. Okay I think I will yeah so I mean I had some slide about the resolvent dissent as well but I think I'm almost out of time so I think I will skip it. I will just say that this is what they are. So I mean we can prove this and this is kind of good enough for what you want. Good enough for what we want for our resolvent estimate. So, this kind of finishes the last hypothesis of the Leopano-Senti theory. So, I think I will skip this slide and say that, okay, so then, sorry, bit ahead of it. Yeah, so all in all, that kind of finishes the proof. So, it's a very kind of straightforward application of the Liberal Point-Senter theorem. The difficulty is lying in kind of looking at what the spectrum is of these operators. But there will also be some other. But there will possibly some other so see I I just want to finish by mentioning here that um some possible future work can be done on this equation. So as far as I know currently these these periodically modulated solitar waves are the only say two-dimensional solutions of this equation, but there can for sure be other ones. I mean we have kind of the standard ones that we saw that we're seeing several people talk about today, so lump solutions, so solutions Also, lump solutions, so solutions which decay to zero in all horizontal directions. You could also imagine that this Camasa-Holm-Kp equation has double periodic solutions. But perhaps a bit more exotic, since we are talking about the Camasa-Holm equation here, as we said, this has peakings, you could also imagine that this has periodically modulated peacons. So this is not something that we looked into a lot, but I think it would be maybe interesting to look a bit closer at. To look a bit closer to see how much of this argument can be kind of carried over to the case of pickets. But yeah, I will stop there. Thank you very much.
