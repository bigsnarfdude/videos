So I'm going to talk a very recent paper, just put on an archive just the summer, a joint work with Ying Banglin and Perchuzi and Shaoli Zhao. So I believe none of them is in this conference, and including myself, probably we are all We are all unknown to most of the participants here. So at the very beginning, I have to pretend that there's some background motivations for the product. But surprisingly, this is the actual motivation for this favor. So back to 15 years ago, when I started my PhD. Start my PhD. I learned from my academic brothers that one of the sufficient ways to survive your PhD is to read through your advisor's papers and then find someone who can understand a little bit and try to replace some of the numbers here and then rebuild the view and write down your PhD thesis. And during that, nobody will read it and you got a PhD and never insisted. Read it and you got a PHP, and everyone is happy. So, I read through Tom's paper by the timeline. So, the first one Tom gave me is the one he wrote with which actually appeared in the previous talk. Of course, I got screwed. And then I go to the second one, which is which is uh it's joint work with uh stafford it's one year before i started my phd so uh the story uh was quite elegant to me uh the thing they're starting with is this cuber scheme of points on the projected plane uh everything i'm going to talk about today is over see this guy primaries all of the This guy primaries all of the zero-dimensional subscheme on this projective plane of lens. So, this guy has a two-dimensional deformation direction. So, here you write 10 minus A10 is actually from the, there are many ways to interpret this. So, this is the H1T of this whole scheme or whole scheme or more compatible with the conference is actually the bosson structures on sp2. And this eight is actually just the PGL3. So the deformation second. But obviously you can see this P2 is rigid. So the deformation of this, I mean here I say deformation means the actual deformation, deformation in the commutative world. The deformation does not come from the deformation of Does not come from the deformation of P2. And in the paper of Tom and Stafford, I mean, they this first time I saw this elegant non-commutative deformation story. So they view this V2 in its non-commutative world. So here I write this Q curve for this graded module. For this gradient module, model out this grid model, five-dimensional grid modules, and this is always the coherent sheets on the projected line. And you can deform this to Scriani algebras. And the super scheme of points can be viewed as a modularized in a general setting, can be viewed as a general can be viewed as the modularized basis of some object is a fixed. Some object is a fixed numerical character. More precisely, you fix the numerical character to be the ideal shift of points. Right. And you can also talk about exactly the same thing in here. Given you can, I mean, here, just run quite, you don't need any specific, but given getting maybe token-free conversion. Maybe totem-free conditions. So you can deform it. Sorry, sorry, but you can also talk about the model space of stable objects of stable modules of this numerical cap. Then what they show is actually the deformation of the filter NP2 can be viewed as the first deformed non-completely and then go back to the modularized places. Okay. So two small remarks here. So when n is very equal to true, this really gives you the full versal two-dimensional commutative deformations. I mean, in other words, they're really non-true deformation. And when n equals one, um, what's happened here is uh, it's still still the same t2. But as explained in Bandau's talk, I mean, in t2, we can find some still find some ideas of points on this elliptic curve and some of the line bundles. Another not to mention this. So the key to using there is they show that even in this category, I mean, still have this British and quiver property. So in other words, if you bound the right category of this. Non-compensated P2 do have the same, sorry, similar SOD decomposition as that of the classical P2. So if you're an expert of that, you roughly know how to prove it, prove the whole theorem. So there, this model spaces can be written down as some quiver variety. And then here I just accurate. And here I just accurately deformed the query relations. Somehow, the technical part is you show that it's irreducible in smoothness and something like that. Okay, so this is Tom's first and probably the only paper I actually understand. And now I want to replace some of the numbers here so that I can get my PhD. Get my PhD. So the only number here is two. So if we go up three-dimensional, we see many, many, many topics related. So this conference, the problem is in that situation, even the comparison of this. even the comparison of this viani algebra is very very uh seems very very uh tough for me uh so i can only go down by one dimension uh go about to go to the curve case but the uh but we also learned from this conference now uh if you uh at least if you uh stick into a very classical setting uh there's no even versal uh deformation for uh commutative curves and uh so another uh sad news is um Another sad news is even you go a little bit higher, you go to the abelian category, and those curves have been, I think those kind of one-dimensional algebra has been classified, but hard to give some comparison of the model as story. But then this seems to be, I'll do it again. But let me. Let's be a little bit optimal about the story. So we start from the beginning of the curves. Let's recap the story of the models based on curves. And see what can we go from there. So you know C to be a smooth curve. Generally required gene is a little bit not too small. To small and six numerical characters. The Marvel space is of stable vector bundles are very well studied in history. So we know this to be the slow state. Then there's always you can always take the term out of the vector bundle here, and that gives you a line bundle, which naturally can lie in the P car group of this curve. And there are many, many results about this. Results about this describe this whole space and the fibers of this map. Let me recall some of them. This whole space is smooth, projective, irreducible, and expected dimension. And also, this map, all the fibers are isomorphic to each other. Let's denote fiber by replacing its gray by a fixed line bundle then. Then it's not in the line mono case. This the cybers are also very nice. They're of pickard number one and final index two. And Russia. I mean, there are many, many other results, descriptions on this. Actually, in the full homological range of this are carefully studied and compared the many extra structures. But this talk, let me just mention this very, very classical results. Okay, so now compared to the story. Compared to the story of this Huber skin P2 and deformed, I want to find some other thing, maybe category or maybe more complicated thing that can give you some moduli construction so that you have some base, which here everything's a failing variety, and then you have some fibers which are pretty nice. Oh wa wish two in index two it's a it's a very direct computation. I mean you can given that it's P card number one, you can compute the restriction of this on a particular P1. And this P1 can be extended by something. And this it's a And this is a very direct query computation. So let me show a very, very concrete example. That's given by the smallest possible number here. So suppose the genius of the curve is 2 and also the rank is 2. And we're not taking the number 10. The non-permittive characters of that sector to be one, then in that case, the fiber of this compute, the whole model space is with dimension eight, and the fiber sorry, the whole space with dimension five and shoot on the building surface, and the fiber is a threefold. Uh, is a threefold. Uh, it's the intersection of two quadrics in P5. But denote by Y. Why four form is the degree of the cell cubic peripheral? That's a sort of a very classical result 60 years ago by Newstead. Okay. Okay. And in a more classical, sorry, more than geometry point of view, this can be in the connection of this curve and this final threefold can be connected in a more direct categorical. In a more direct categorical way. So, what you do is the philosophy of, I mean, I think it's starting from Bandau Orlov and then the other by Kuznetsov. So if you look at the boundary draw category of coherent sheaves on Y4, it has two so-called exceptional objects. So-called exceptional objects, the line bonus. And if you take the rest of category of those two things, I mean, the thing, I'm going to write down a detailed definition of that. This rest two part is equivalent to the bounded draft category of the curve, you starvress.  Okay. So uh uh and and for this demo of thy compression thing, uh we can uh can copy the same story for actually any uh family of funnel threefold, this picker number one and uh index two. Uh this one is a little bit This one is a little bit uh complicated. So the the simplest one in uh in the science of talking about it is the the uh the cubic threefold. Assume it's a smooth cubic threefold. Right, and now so starting from here, I'm diving into a very deep Very deep algebraic geometry world. So far, far from any topics of this conference. And here you can do exactly the same thing by kicking out exceptional objects. I'm going to give you the precise definition of the rest of part. So, if you're not familiar with that, so that's theoretically. I mean, it contains all the objects in this boundary draw category. If you haven't heard about this, bounded draw category are just coherent, just complexes, finite, sorry, finalist compact of vector bundles. With some homological vanishing pro uh, with some homological vision Okay, so it's uh the other objects here are uh homologically uh right orthogonal, I don't know the right or left, right orthogonal to uh this one too I I I removed. What I remove. Okay. And so a quick example. If we cubic threefold, there are a lot of lines. I mean, viewing as lines in the P4. You pick any straight lines in P4 containing. In the contain in P4 containing QP34, then the ideal shift of that is in this RASU category, named after Kusnatov. One example. And the character of is just given by one and zero degree, but it has a minus curve class in the second degree, 22, and then a trivial. Check two and then a two and the third type. And to talk about going to talk about the modelized spaces of objects in this triangle category, we have to do some preparation. The classical thing we need to do is we have to understand the numerical classes of that. Sorry. Yeah. As the numerical class of the third fossils rank four, and we remove two of them. Runk four and we remove two of them. It's our falcon compatible slash we still have ranks two two two two rank two letters left here. And need the Euler character to tell me how to compute these groups and finally the dimension of that. So the Euler character is given as minus one, minus one, zero, zero. And here, I mean, more concretely, if I view this object and object in the object in dby, then in terms of the chain classes, this alpha is more precisely given as round to minus degree one class. Per class precise as beta is just a numerical class for the ideal shape of lines. Okay. Now uh Essentially important for mobile spaces, but let me also tell you that there's a Josiah functor which makes this thing look like a curve. If you apply three times of the psi functor, you got Hamlar to shift five. So naively, you can think this is the PBU record. It's a fractional card, the alcatric and this dimension is five over three. So generally psi will shift it by tensor-something with homological shift of dimension. But here divided by three times, it's five over three. But this is less than two. So you may think it's something between curves and this. It's something between curves and the surfaces, but behave more like a curve. You'll see. Yeah, the preparation. And another two important preparation is we have to talk about model spaces. So at least we have to say something, which things are stable. You would work by a By a group of people. There exists so-called condition. That's a datum containing so-called hard structure and a central charge. So naively, this hard structure. So, naively, this hard structure is an abelian structure, which is very similar to, I feel like, the coherent sheaves on some varieties. And this central charge is mathematically, it's a group homomorphism from the numerical class to complex numbers. Numbers. But intuitively, it tells you that the slope of all objects, so it can talk about which objects are stable and which thing we are going to prompt twice. And another, so we have this thing, so we can talk about the stable object. Another also very important thing is As uh as by using this uh the condition constructor here, uh uh the model space are really uh good. I'm not going to write on the full food data. So this slide parameters all of the stable objects with this character V and stable under this condition. Okay. But naively, I mean, this is something we prove at the very, very end. But for this model space, at least all of them. Modular space, at least all of them are going to talk about today. A generic object in this modular space is a coherent sheaf or even a vector bond, when the character is not so crazy. So I hope that helped you a little bit for your understanding. Right, so another, okay, so I think we can show very concrete examples of the model spaces that people already know. That people already know classical D or somehow me explain this graph. So here, here, I draw the stop. So alpha and beta give me this lattice. I'm not drawing it on the quadratic, the quadrant coordinate for some. The quadrant coordinate for some reason, I'll explain. I draw it on a second. And so, what are the model spaces? For example, this beta is the character of this ideal sheaf of lines. And not very surprisingly, that the model space of character beta is the funnel of lines, funnel surface of lines. You also compute this. I mean, look at the table, that's the dimension given by one minus the equals one, so it's dimension two. Not very surprising. And how about this alpha? We are need used also very elegant result by Pertusian Young. They say that the sire functor is Sire functor is compatible with whole stability condition. So, in other words, if you have something stable and then you act it on by this sire functor, you got something stable. And on this picture, why draw it in the second way is the sire functor acts three times rotated by this homogeneous shift five. So, the picture, I think, if you do a sign. If you do a sire and then, yeah, if you do a sire inverse, then shoot by two. Map all the characters alpha to beta. Rotate the whole graph by pi over three. And then you shade, rotate, rotate. So to describe all of the model spaces, we only need to describe everything on this section coordinate. So in other words, So, in other words, this alpha is also the final lines. And here, the next one is the alpha plus beta. You get table, got 111, 3 dimension 4. So this moduli space is the C the divider in the medium Jacobian. It has a singular point, and the model space is the resolution of singularity. Singularity. And the resolved, the exceptional part is just the original cubic threefold. Sorry, let me maybe explain this. Two beta. Two beta can compute it at four plus one dimension five. That's a vastly blow up of this phenomenon. This funnel of lines inside intermediate Jacode. Yeah, all right, and uh the only uh the very last one. The only very last one that you'll still vaguely understand before our work is this 2 alpha plus beta. Compute this from here should be a dimensional eight moduline space, which is too large to understand. But for every model space is a picture, we have a like the curve case by taking determinant, we also have a natural. Determined, we also have a natural Abel-Jacobi map from the model spaces to the intermediate Jacob. That's simply by taking the second term class of every object, which also makes sense for every object in the boundary-derived category. A fixed somewhat so that's in the non-twisted intermediate intermediate. And this guy is very well known in the algebraic geometry world, which is sort of which is a building variety of dimension five, so that reduce the fiber dimension to dimension three. And yeah. And they are so all the fibers are also they are panel threefold this Let me write as V14 as final threefold, Picard one, index one, and degree labeled in the corner 14. And there's actually a very more detailed description for each fiber which this V14 should be, but I think it's a little bit too much to go so deep. To go so deep. All right. So that's everything people know before our work. Any questions? Next, I'm going to talk about what can you say for other model space. That's what I wrote in the tag. So the first result we have is about the non-emptiness, which is surprisingly not very easy. But we can show that very general setting for more general case. Setting for more general cases, let me write a precise statement. You can do it for every almost every family of the funnel three volt. Smooth projective funnel three volt number one. And there are, I mean, it has been a so this kind of threefold has been very well classified by as far as by its index and degree. When index four it must be P3 and when three must be a quadric. When it's index two, there are five different families. We can do four of them. In that case, we have the Kuzneto component. Also, when it's one, I think there are 10 different families. I think we can do most of the interesting ones. In that case, the Kubernetes component is a little bit tricky to construct, but Tricky to construct, but now we have a somehow a commonly accepted part as this component, but relies on some existence theory of the some special rank two or three or five exceptional vector bundles. Some details here, but anyway, we have finally got those notions. And the theorem, first theorem is on. The theorem, first theorem is Tom. In that index one case, you can't put a line bundle here. There's no way to do that. So here, this E, depending on different H, it could be of rank two or rank three or rank five. But still, need to be very careful since the construction that rely on some theory by Mukai, but that proved by some. That proved by some so-called Fujita extension theorem, which is not completely correct. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. But that's not known for when the degrees are small. That's a problem. Why I put With uh okay, so the first one is for the done anti-stamp. So, for everyone, so for every uh non-zero uh numerical character, uh, the model space is nine. V V22, the problem is you have a quiver representation. So V22, I mean, D V22, it has a full strong acceptance. I don't know if it's strong. So it's something like that. Yeah. But so if you take, take, remove this, the other part is equivalent to the quiver. Other part is equivalent to the equivalent of those two guys, definitely you don't have this. Don't have this non-emptiness for every character. So it could be, you know, the character could be if you say, say, the home, I don't know the actual home, but let's say this is M. Then you can put, you know, M plus one, E2 plus E3. This is a character, but definitely there's no stable thing like that. This is just a quiver, you know, this time arrows from one to the other. This time arrows from one to the other, right? So you don't have any, you increase the dimension of CM1, right? So there's no stable, stable queer representation. There, I mean, it's V10 to V V 18. Yeah, this is V is used for any non-zero V, any, every non-zero V. V any every non-zero v that's the reason why we have to remove this uh v22k no no any any anything anything anything i mean if say for example you have the some some of them are equivalent to curves and uh the rank is zero but for point you can also know or i should say semi-state yeah yeah thank you  There's some some applications to a hypercaler job. The no, I mean, the index two, I mean, the the the RAS2 component is uh naturally defined by removing by keeping this uh O and O one. King is O and O1. Index one, you have to be a little bit careful about which to throw away. Sorry? Yeah, yeah, for all the cases I wrote down. As I explained, the the the the actually is for all of them. The the the rest part is not either not interesting or uh people can't even start with. Uh, people can't even start with. I mean, for example, when index is four or three, it's a p3 or quarter can p4. And for this remaining cases, when the degree is five, it's also this case of v22. And for the last case, I just explained and then index one, yes, yes, yeah, v22 is here, yes, yeah, so it's. Yes. Yes. So it's uh it doesn't satisfy this just I mean j it it just quiver if you if you if you uh copy down the the the same same the same definition. But Right. So, yeah. So, to reduce the torture of most of the audiences, I just jumped to the final theorem without giving details and some other application of this non-time theorem. But for here, we have to go back to the cubic three-fold case. And the first result is about the properties of the whole model space. So the still Now, we want to have a primitive character. Not very surprising, but technically difficult to prove is this all modularized space is smooth, irreducible. Useful projective and of the expected dimension. So in this case, we have the same story as that of the curve piece. But more interesting case, more interesting geometry happens in the fibers you can see here. So, for that, we need this whole space, the dimension of the whole space, the model space a little bit larger so that we really have it's not injected. So, really fully, this Abel Jacobian map really subjective onto this Jacobi. So, let me yeah. Let me make a notation first now. Every point in the middle meter coping, like the curve case, you know the fiber by this character, but this fixed somehow comparable to the determinant. What can we say about it? So, for example, even this V14 fiber, you have five dimensional very uh different uh different V14. Sorry, Afan. That that that's a that's the character the basis of the numerical group. Yeah, the alpha is the beta is the one for the ideal shape of line and the alpha is um the the rank two I think they're similar to the rank two. There's a wrong tool, and I don't know the actual good geometric meaning of that, but let me write it down. The beta is that it's this about the coping map is not isotrival because I think curved case. So, if you're but still subjective. So, when the dimension is greater than five greater than five attractive and so in most cases, in all cases, we know that the fibers are actually different functions. Fibers are actually different. But for general fiber, five in the same five. But it's five in this case, it's a blow-up of the Fanov lines. I'm going to say the fiber is, no, I'm going to say something more. The fiber is smooth. The fiber is loosed and it's funnel aside in the curve case and it's almost with index one. So you recall that in the curve case with index two. It's with a primitive canonical device. So that's some comparison result for the null property in the curve case. And also for the rationality case, we can only say something much weaker than that. Since if you have some knowledge in the classical algebra geometry, you know this cubic threefolds are not rational. And this family, this corresponding family in this V14 are not rational at all. It's unlike the case that in the curve case that. The case that in the curve case that every fiber is rational, we can say something, we can still say something about the rationality of the fiber, but it's a little bit nasty to describe. Let me show you. So when the when the dimension is sufficiently high, the total space has dimension greater than or equal to 20 threads. 20 thread. So the fiber is dimension greater than or equal to 18, then general fibers are so-called it's quite by Birational geometry things that are stately birational. Okay. I mean, for the thing in the middle, we have some other results, but I mean, it's enough to think. Yeah. No, no, no. V and w are two different comma. Yeah. But w is also a new. But W is also a numerical capture, primitive. Yes, yes. Ah, sorry. Sorry, yeah, sorry, yeah, sorry. So for different, for different model spaces, for different fibers, it's different characters. They are all stable by rational. It's a much weaker result compared to the curved case. case that's uh something uh we can do and because uh should be a weak no no in stabilized vibration you can you can time step no no no this is a question uh question uh yeah they're definitely not as so trivial they certainly have different fibers Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's another example. So, this is the generic fiber is just a point. But here, also, I have a blow output along the funnel lines. And even for this, and even for this, and actually, that's just the generic fibers to be 14 that are really five-dimensional, different, different. I'm not expecting any questions from the audiences, but by attending this conference, I have some questions for myself. So maybe that's the thing that the audience know much more than I do or than the group of our four authors. I want to understand them. I want to understand what's the non-competitive deformations of cubic threefolds. And especially I want to understand is there non-competitive Rust to categories. Naively, I mean, in the P2 case, we have this. The Spellingson quiver. So if you non-completed deform it, it doesn't deform these factors, but it just deforms the relations. So, but still very, very, very tiny hope that there might be some deformations, really, really deformous factor of the grassroots part. I believe so, right? I believe so, right? So just compute this. I don't know. I didn't compute the actual number, but there should be some. Yeah, maybe we think there. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah. Right, so I saw your contractor yesterday about this. Yesterday, the bosson leaves and relation is the rank of the boson leaves is the other side of the, I don't know whether this funnel varieties, but I thought you particularly mentioned some funnel threefold case. Oh, yeah, okay, then maybe there's no hope now. Yeah, so I'll Yeah, so and uh there uh and that that's actually the the only example uh we we we know it's very similar to uh the modified behavior is very similar to that of curves. So you have a base abelian variety that has some controllable uh variants whether there's some non-commutative deformation of cubic threefold yeah but. Yeah, but I mean in the P2 case, if you not completely deform, it only deforms the relation between these three groups. But it doesn't make sense. But for this, I think even there's some that just deform the relations. But I don't know if there's any tiny hope that we can really deform this. So we can, you know, see. I mean, yeah, for all the hypersurfaces, you can sort of relate it to matrix vaporizations. But I don't know if that could actually help to think about it. That's all nature. Yeah, I think I finished. Thank you for your attention.
