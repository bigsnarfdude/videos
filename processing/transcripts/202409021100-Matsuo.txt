And uh my talk consists of two parts. Uh first part is uh uh based on this uh uh uh review paper uh which Nots and uh distributed and and uh um ACAB number twenty three nine and uh zero seven five nine six. And this is uh uh sort of the personal uh well uh Of the personal, well, this is written as a formal introduction of the subject, but in my case, my talk is more like a personal summary of the application of the great mathematical ideas to physics. And so, maybe this part for most of you, it's just everything obvious. And I feel in the in this case, In this case, in Japan, we use a word like preaching to Buddhas. And I'm very upset to this jobs. And the part two is slightly new result on the construction closure model for Novania Hole effect, and which was published this year with Jamie Bujin. And Boojing and this part has some connection with the part one and the previous talk. So I hope some of you might have some interest on it. And so as I said, it's a personal review. So I s got PhD in nineteen eighty eight and uh at that time uh uh in mathematical literature uh there is a very uh Very strong movement in the study of Birasola algebra, cutsomudi algebra, and so on. And in physics, starting from this Belovine Project of Samoa Cook paper, species start to learn about this infinite-dimensional symmetry and apply it to clavier complexification or OB fold. And this side is my own My own experience from the great mathematical literature. And this side is a great movement in physics. And so in the 90s, we have sort of what we call the DRT revolution just by CyberGuitten or Maldesina. But I'm not going to talk about radio CFT, but more focusing on this CyberGuitt. And other big And other big movement in physics is this whole discovery of flux nerve Hall effect by Loffering and so on. And that's also a very important application of this affine Yankian or G N infinity or W infinity, I guess. And during the 90s, there is some great work by Nakajimbasan and Chief Man Baseru and Maurikov Kunkov. And this is a very influential paper. This is very influential papers. And on the other hand, in physics, we have Neklasov's computation of this instant and Partium function. And then finally, AGT conjecture shows up, which directly relates to this instant and partial function to this to load algebra or affine Jungian stuff. And it's a And it's a bit, well, I'm not sure it's a good idea to start from developing polycosomological fitness so classical. But anyway, it's the beginning of the application of this infinite-dimensional symmetry or representation theory of Girl-Solar algebra to physics, where it is applied to the critical phenomena of statistical system in two dimensions, like a Ying model. Like a Jing model. And so from this paper, we understand that representation theory is so powerful to understand the physical phenomena like critical exponent. And so we realize the power of this infinite dimensional algebra. And then there are many, many analogies. Many analog algebra shows up, like continuity, superconformal, and W algebra, and so on. And so, those algebra has many, many applications in string theory and statistical mechanics. So, this is a sort of connection between string or gauge theory and statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, and like. Matter physics and the representation theory, they develop all together to have a bigger bigger goal. So one of the information symmetry is so-called higher speed symmetry, which is motivated by to apply to wider application range of physical system. System and this W algebra, which was found by Zamojkov and Fatev and Rukhanov about 1986, they consist of the higher spin currents, like starting from spin 2 to spin n. And which has a nonlinear symmetry, and normally it's difficult to write down the algebra itself. Itself, except for this just simplest non-trivial example like W3 algebra. So algebra itself is rather difficult to define, but later for the kind of introduce a so-called mirror transformation, and which defines this higher spin algebra. In treatable way. And this is inspired by the relation with the integral model. And also, this W algebra is defined by this so-called screen current, which is used for the construction of singular vector. And at the same, this screening, the structure of this screening current is used to define this W algebra. Although the structure of algebra itself is very difficult to. By itself is very difficult to express. Then it's natural to take n going to infinity limit and to have a double infinity algebra. And in mathematical literature, it was studied by Katza and Radur. And it is essentially the algebra coming from these higher order differential operators. Operators and which admit one parameter C, central charge. But this algebra turns out to be too simple and admits only the free field representation. And more details involve the structure of WM infinity algebra. Infinity algebra shows up only at 2010 where Gobakumaran and Gabadil introduced the two parameter family of the algebra. And they introduced a central charge and this is a structure constant appearing in the veto product expansion W3 to W4. And from this parameter, we have This parameter, we have about three parameters, but it has one restriction. So essentially, we have two parameters. And this W infinity algebra has a nice connection with a fine Young Young later. And here is another subject which may be really uh which is relevant for this uh kind of development and uh which is Development and which is called the quantum Hall effect. And this is defined by the 2D electron motion under the strong magnetic field. And for this under the magnetic field, this translation of it satisfies this kind of algebra, which is more like Hazenbeg algebra. So this is more or less similar to this. More or less similar to this W infinity algebra studied in mathematical literature in Katakan Razul. But later during the 90s, it was realized that we have sort of what is called fractional whole effect. And although the integer whole effect is can be describable in terms of free fermions, In terms of free fermion, this long-range interaction among the electrons becomes more difficult to treat. Namely, for instance, the single electron have a three-magnetic flux, and this three-magnetic flux then gives extra power appearing in the ground state wave function. And this wave function is called ruffling wave function. And so the interaction is the wave function. And so the interaction triggers this fermion without interaction to higher fractional powers. And for this purpose, this Kali model was realized to be useful. And so this is the Kali-Suzerand model, Hamiltonian. But for this model, the ground state is written like this. Is written like this, and the feature is more or less the same as the ground state referring wave function. So, this closure model is exactly integrable, and the many property can be understood from the study of cultural model. And implication to this whole effect is very large. So, in this whole effect business, what is called generalized statistics is very important. And in massive literature, it was studied by Feikin Jimbo Miwan Mukhin in 2002. And so the description on the So the description of this general statistics is like this. Namely, we have lambda A non-negative is negative integers which satisfy this kind of the constraint. And the Feng so it is has characterized by two parameters, P and K, and both non-negative integer. Negative integer. And for p equal 1 case, we have this kind of constraint. So the eigenvalue should not close to any more than k. So on the other hand, we might have some extra parameter p and in that case uh some particle can degenerate, but uh after that uh it should uh there should be some kind of distance among them. Of distance among them. And this kind of what is called PKN admissibility is important to understand the non-avarian enum structure. So for peak or case, it is directly related to the fractional control effect like this. But this is a single component electron system. But for the multi-component electron. But for the multi-component electron system, we have this kind of constraint. So this Ferminic statistics is mixed with some kind of bolognic statistics. So this FEG paper implies that this kind of general statistics is realized by Claudio-Suserand model with this parameter beta. With this parameter better. So, in this sense, Carlos model captures some core features of the quantum Hall effect. And so, this is menu UI expert. So, to relate this closure system with W infinity or W infinity or affine younger, we need to introduce this kind of Dunkle operator, which is essentially the differential operator combined with some kind of interaction among the coordinates. And this SAB is the exchange operator between the coordinate X and X B. And these operators are chosen in this way, satisfies this kind. Satisfies this kind of commutation related. So, YA commit with each other, although we have interaction among them. So, from this donkey operator, we can define the Hamiltonian of the Claudian system as the square of this coordinate Dunker operator YA. So, we have this So we have these two sets of operators, XA and YA, and from which we can define the W infinity like operators with XA with some arbitrary power of XA and YA. While XA has an integer level and YA have a And ya have a positive, non-negative integer of label. And this should be sandwiched with this dash symmetrizer of the coordinate. And this large and taking large and limit of spherical degenerate dahli is affine youngian. So maybe uh it's not uh necessary to for you to to explain, but uh affine young GL one has uh this kind of uh uh rough represent uh rough represent uh definition. And then we have a set of ubilinear derivations and the fit defined gives uh a fine young Yang G1. So essentially this cardio-sutherland system is described by the algebra black machin uh is set up on the the mach algebra black machinery of uh Alpha Yangian. And at the same time, we can relate them with Diracolo algebra or W algebra. So for instance, the Hilbert space of Claudius system is spanned by the symmetric polynomial, and the constituent of symmetric functions is the power some polynomial. And one can assign the merge. And one can assign the uh the multiplication of this power some polynomial with the U1 current uh j minus n and the derivatives with this uh u other uh positive mode uh u1 current. Then it may be possible to rewrite uh the Hamiltonian of the Caudio-Sutherland system and uh which is uh uh directly related to uh central charge one minus six q square. Minus 6q square conform of H theory. Q is related to this better in this way. So we have a sort of the physical system mathematical systems. One is the Karja system and Fan Yangian. And the other one is the Kuhong Wafi theory with this central charge. So in general, so this GFT and the spherical designer Daha can be regarded as dual faces with the same algebra. Namely, for this M1N is the two parameters defined in this used in this definition of all. used in this definition of ONN. And if we define the generators in this way, we have a fine Yang Yang algebra. On the other hand, we can reorganize the generators into the horizontal line. Then we have a W infinity or W infinity of mu. So this understanding of a CF Conformal fee theory and the integral models, and described by Afan Yang Yang, will be essential to the next development in the gauge theory. So so so uh just okay, so as I said, uh this identification was essential to understand the EGTP. Was essential to understand the AGT correspondence. And then what is the EGT correspondence itself is that the sub the partition function of n equal to t equal 4 sub pier mu written in this way. So n equal to means we have two types of supersymmetry and in that case because of the cancellation between boson and ferromion the higher we have although we have one loop quantum collection we don't have Quantum collection, we don't have a higher order uh uh quantum con collection. But uh uh instead of that, we have uh so-called instant on collection and uh server grid time and we can relate this super MUs with the Sybergen curve and uh and the Savagrit for this uh so-called type S squeever gauge theory where the gauge group is uh direct product like this, then Product like this, then this submitting curve is nothing but the square with L plus one functure, L plus maybe L plus three functions. So AGT correspondence related to this is an automatic um partial function with a conformable block function. And uh the in the end the proof was uh like this, but uh proof was like this but so so to calculate this correlation functions so this is a sphere with n punctures and on the puncture we have vertex operators on it and the standard way to calculate this kind of uh correlation function is to divide uh the uh uh sphere into um To n plus two pieces, and each component has a shape like this with one puncture and two holes. And we have to calculate that this amplitude, and then it should be identical with the negro factor. And so here we have n young diagrams to level the Hilbert space, and this gives the level the Hilbert space of W n. So this size should be studied as the correlation function of W n algebra. So we need a careful choice of We need a careful choice of this basis state A and lambda. A is n complex numbers and lambda is n tuple young diagrams. And the naive choice was to use W generator itself. And but in this case the computation itself is extremely complicated and can be done in the computer and In the computer, and but only for the first few levels. But on the other hand, the use of SSG or of a Yangian gives a very simple formula which gives the necklace of factor directly. So in this way, AGT conjecture can be proven in the framework of Yang Yang. This is This is a framework presented by Schiffman Basilo. And so this originally the hub space of this affine Young Yang consists of single Young diagrams, which is the eigenstate of the Claudio Sutherland model. So it may be identified with the Jack polynomial. With the Jack polynomial. But for to describe this kind of thing, we need n-tuple Young diagram. So we need a sort of coproduct and take a direct product representation. And for this fine Young-Yang case, we have this kind of co-product which can be found in Shift Mama of the Barcelona's paper. And then with the help of the Afan Yangian, one can And one can derive. This comes from my paper with Jaime Brujing and Chan. And this B is the vertex operator, which satisfies very simple commutation relations. And Y is the diagonal operators of a Yangian. So I forget the EL, but so this may be related to the So this may be related to the sort of the decadent relation that defines the Microsoft factor. At the same, it gives the nature of this primary field, satisfies this kind of simple commutational relation, and which may be regarded as a sort of the Schunger-Dyson equation. And more precise characterization, Characterization is obtained by using the so-called auto-feiging Shirais vertex and which consists of the intertwining operator between the three representations of a fine youngian and five star. And one may combine them into a single diagram. Then one can defi and the f on this side we have very simple uh commutational directions. Uh Commutational relations with Nafa and Yangian. But by combining them, we have sort of the formulas like this, which may be regarded as the transformation of the primary field in WNA algebra. So this is the conclusion of the part one is the namely the Namely, the very short summary of the development of the Opan Yangian and Kong Field theory. So we have a dual picture of the same symmetry, namely the quantum field theory described by free Bogons and so on. And the other one is fine young Yang defined by during field currents. One during fair currents, and they give the equivalent description. And from this knowledge or duality relations, one arrives at a complete understanding of cyberguiting classes and AGT correspondence, and at the same time, the flux and whole effect, in a sense. Okay, so this is part one. Then I go to part two and And a Carl General model for the non-abelian quantum field theory. So the Causian model for the aberrant case is well known, but a Causian model for the non-averian case is a bit more complicated. And this work is based on this paper with Jaime Bujin. So the recent development of control foreign. Recent development of quantum fall effect uh so is uh the the the observation of no abarian anyone, namely the uh occupation number 52 over two and uh guess album itself is there is some flateau associated with this number during uh so it was observation in the 90s. But uh recent uh development is uh to realize this kind of To realize this kind of low-avarian honomy more directly on the experiment. So it's studied by Google Group and Continue Group, which appeared in Nature. And there's also some groups in the University of Tokyo. And so So let me explain very heuristic imagination of what the uh novarian enion looks like. So in this case uh we have some kind of loose bond between two electrons and then uh exchange of two electrons in one block has a very non-trivial rotation structure. Namely the wave function have an extra level Uh have a extra level of the component. And uh after rotating uh this particle over the other particle gives some uh some kind of rotation matrix. So for the available case we have a disrupting wave function with a feeling fluxion 1 by n and uh and then uh and this uh And this uh uh um affliction wave function is uh understood as the ground state of Clausius-Switzerland. But uh for the non-abelian case uh it's more complicated object, uh, which may be regarded as the endpoint function of the the primary field, some kind of primary field in conformity theory. Then uh no ability holonomy may be written like this. May be written like this, but there is some kind of district from the physics that this originally this VA is the coordinate of the electron. So if you can take a model holonomy along the particles, we have only the integer power. So So the GFT the con the study from the GFT const viewpoint was studied by this Grokan Wen and which is related to this SUP level K baselino width model and here they took the primary field in this customoji algebra for to describe For to describe these bosons, vertex operators, and find some kind of admissible electron wave function from the viewpoint of the Kaufman Heat theory. And some years ago, Dory, Tong, and Tana proposed Matrix model realization of this. Model realization of this Nova Nion. And they introduce Z and Z dagger, it's the times n complex matrix, which describes the coordinate to this n particles, electrons. And phi and phi dagger is like peak times n complex matrix. It looks like ADHM construction. Construction of the instructor. And then they introduce UN gauge field. And they propose the action for this matrices. This is Zerbus one-dimensional quantum mechanical system. And the action consists of the Action uh consists of the um kinetic uh Chan Simon like kinetic term and that also channel Simon like uh first first of the Lagrangian for phi and uh then this is uh alpha is a gauge field so trace of A is the chance Simon field in 0 plus 1 dimensions and so and some kind of the harmonic potential and they this drug And they this Lagrangian gives uh this constraint, uh uh this operator put uh commutation relations. And uh they claim that uh this by study of this uh matrix model uh they reproduce uh this broken grand state wave function with uh the this Katsmodi algebra and then uh Katsmudi symmetry uh it shows up in this uh large analytic and this current Limit and this current become gives the description of the Tasmodia operators. So, this gives a good candidate to describe the Norway annium. And eigenvalues of Z is the coordinate which we have seen. And on the top of that, we have internal spin states, spin degree of freedom, described by Phi and Phi Tagar. And in the work by Jaime with Jaime Gujing, we diagonalize one of the real components of this complex matrix. And this eigenvalue is taken as this X1 to Xn. Then X2 gives is solved in this form with UP rotation matrix. And And then the previous action for this DTT is rewritten as the Carogel-like models, where we have square 1 over XA and XP square potential, but there are some slight difference in the coefficient. Namely, this is Namely, this is the UP rotation, but for the spin k representation. So and also we have we start from the gauge field, so we have also gauge law constraint, and this gauge transformation should be regarded as zero, and which gives rise to this. Uh the constraint on the physical state. So this is in Clausian model anyway, but it's slightly differently different from the non-cloudial actually. And for Pico one case, namely avarian case, this is a single component cloud Color zero model. And for T general and the K Core1 case, this is equivalent to Spin Color Zero. Namely, this part gives the can be replaced by the coordinates exchange and the features related to Dunkirk. But in this case, it is known that it is solvable. Described by Ugurov long ago, during the 90s. But for P and K general, as far as we studied, it's not known. And we have to understand whether it is solvable or not. And according to this DTT paper, the specs should be displayed by SCP. By SAPAK, customer dissimetry in large elements. So it seems to be just some kind of non-trivial model. So since we didn't know that the system is solvable, so we studied very we begin to study very simple models like n equal 4, particle. n equal 4, particle number is 4 and uh uh the colour number is 2 and k equal to 1 case. Uh this is already of course well known because of the this is string colour zero but uh we start from there as an exercise. So the spring state is written in terms of the determinant like this. So we have three types of the product of determinant but there Determinant, but there is one dedication between them, namely we have a so-called fluker relation. So since this is just a determinant, so we have fluka relations as a constraint. And after some struggle, well, because of this spin state have this kind of structure. This kind of structure. The exchange between, for instance, two and three particles goes to this state and so on. But then the exchange of one, two particles remains, this spin state remains the same. So we have a sort of nobler structure in the description of the ground state. Of the ground state. So it's not so trivial to solve the system, but for KCO1 case, we know the result of Ugroff and it can be written in terms of the determinant like this. And but for the hierarchy case, we need to take a product with such kind of value. Take a product with such kind of wave functions. And then this product of such kind of determinant state is not linearly independent from each other because of this kind of Blucker relation. So we need to understand how to remove the extra state coming from this Brooker relations. So this looks like a Hilta equation of Kp here. Hilta equation of Kp hierarchy. So the main claim is that the product of this determinant gives the spans a qubit space and it has a triangular, the homogeneous triangular action on this product state. So the spectrum can be written, can be understood from Can be written, can be understood from this eigenvalue directory. P is nothing but the number of this from the by summation taking summation of this power of z x. And the constraint of this form was solved by this random directory. So we found that this kind So we found that this kind of uh uh wave function solves the cultural uh equation with eigenvalue E R. So for the K go one case uh this is the identical to the Uber of during 90s but uh for the uh higher K case uh we need to solve this split correlation. And before going to the analysis of this block coordination, we studied some general property with this product determinant state. And so the ground state is the product of this kind of state. And then we can directly derive that they satisfy. Derived that they satisfy Knizing theological equation over SUP level K. So we have this Knishing themological equation, so this implies the Carogel wave functions is directly related to this correlation function of the vertex operators. And then so Uh so some part of the s um problem is solved uh uh before the uh going to this uh uh hew tech uh to study the Hewlett equation. But uh the Hewlett equation part is we need some kind of more we need to elaborate more. Namely, we uh so to describe the determinant uh the convenient way to introduce uh free fermions. Free fermions like this, and which satisfies this kind of commutation relation. And this I and J goes from 1 to P, which describes the colour or the internal degree of freedom or the free fermion, and the alpha going from 1 to K and which describes the product structure of the data. Product structure of the determinant. And we introduce the ground states, and then the product weight state is written in terms of this free Fermi-Fox space by using this kind of the vacuum extreme value. So we here we have a free fermion by taking the product of the Taking the product of the fermion with alpha 1 to K. So by taking the inner product, we have a it's straightforward to observe this kind of the relation. And so we uh call this uh X and Y uh state as a translation state uh which translates from the free Fermi Fox space to Folk space to the wave function of the coverage system we study. So then of course we have some extra degree of freedom introduced to describe this internal degree of freedom, namely alpha equal 1 to k associated with the level level of the Katsumuji or the cloudian system. System and then we have to understand the nature of these Hirotta equations. But in the end, we found that the Hirota equations is written in terms of this UK current. Namely, we have we changed the alpha and the beta in the by we take the baryonic combination, which satisfies this UK. Satisfy this UK commutation relation. Then this translation state satisfy this kind of constraint. So namely, we have a project, we can project out this part to understand the hub space. And on the other hand, the SUP part is written in this kind of Written in this kind of fermion baryon here, and the feature operate on this translation state like this. And this implies this translation, the operator appearing in the translation state is the primary field of SUP current algebra, loop algebra. So this gives the origin of KZ equation. So in that by taking So in that by taking Dajan limit uh uh this SUK uh duplic uh symmetry becomes SUP level K Katsumoody and the SU uh P duplic algebra symmetry becomes SUP level K Katsumudi. And of course the Fermi algebra is U hat K P level 1 Katsumudi. So this is exactly what appears in the Exactly, what appears in the talk by Mukhin. It's a deformed version, but it's much simpler version appearing here. And then we have a sort of a conformal embedding, namely from this UKP to SUPK and SUKP and U1, which has satisfies this kind of relation among the central charge. Charge. So this implies that the Hamiltonian for this free fermion can be rewritten in terms of SUP level K and S K level P. So in that sense, the FOX space is decomposed as the SUP FOX Katumoji Fox representation space and SUK space and U1. And U1. And by taking the imposing protection, I mean one can forget this SUP part. So we in the end we obtained SUP level K times U1 Hub space as the solution space of this current model. So it's So it's a bit too early, but to conclude this part, the Courage model with the DT matrix model seems to give some kind of new suitable models. And it gives some proper description of novel Hall effect along the line of broken VN, in the meaning of broken VN. And have this kind of Katamodi algebra and KZ equation. And the KZ equation, the primary field, and so on. So maybe we hope that this is very simple, but not known CloudGL type models. I don't know. Maybe there may be some objection. I imagine that all the CloudGL model is known during the 90s, but I don't know, but this seems to be. No, but this seems to be new. And this and also we have a disconnect. Maybe I should not mention I have to mention, but this model was recently started by Y Hao Tsao. And he is preparing the paper. And this general statistic shows up. And of course other under As we explained by Professor McKing, we have GLM, GLN, DRETs in this description of current model. And then it seems to give how we should deform or how what will be the relevance of quantum Troller algebra and so on. Okay, so that it's So that's it. Thank you very much.
