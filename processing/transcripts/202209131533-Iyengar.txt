Is that good? They can see it. No, it's recording. They can see it too? Yeah. Shree? We can see, we can see. Thank you. That's great. Alright. I thought he'd start. So it seems like an extra time, actually. Alright, so I'm going to draw a chain of subspaces. Subset. And I'll leave some colors. And I'll leave some colors, so I'm going to choose it so that this is a rank 1 subspace, this is a rank K subspace, and so on and so forth. Then I want to, I will just state as a fact that there's a variety that parametrizes all such chains of subspaces inside of this vector space B. So I'll say parameter space for all such chains. And many of you will recognize this as a complete flag variety. Alright, and so a nice fact is that the Picard group of the complete flag, I'll just state this as fact. And when I say Picard group, I mean all the isomorphism classes of line bundles on this variety. So this is isomorphic to just Z-jin nanomeric, and this standard is coming from the right of the vector space. vector space. So if you hand me kind of a tuple of integers here, then I can associate to this some one bundle, which I'll call l lambda. And so a fundamental question is how can I compute the colonology of these line buckles on the flag part? So compute the colonology of these L lambda. E of these L lambdas. Alright? So now here's where the characteristic assumptions come into play. If the characteristic of k is equal to zero, then we have a full solution to this. So I'll put a check mark next to this and then write in parentheses that this is a more or less famous world about day film. I won't say too many words on how you compute this kohnology, but it's You can do it with Scott Monky, but it's real really clean and nice answer. Inc positive characteristic. Well, in positive characteristic is absolutely wide open with essentially no good all-encompassing results. There's really a huge difference in these two cases. And so I just want to talk about a special case. I'm just going to kind of say one theorem and maybe see. Going to kind of say one here and maybe say some words on the methods. Is to you can push forward a flag onto projective space by kind of ignoring all these subspaces and just looking at this one-dimensional subspace. And so I want to look at computing the cohort of something of this form. Well, let me just say some things about this. This is a sure functor. Sorry, definitely don't have time to define that. Of time to define that. And this is the code-led bundle on projected space. Alright, and so I guess I'll have to take between egrets. But the main theorem is the following. So this is joint work with Claude and Breitco. The first is a nice general statement that this cohort. statement that this cohomology is a trivial GL module. I mean literally the GLV action on this is trivial. It doesn't do anything, which is very strange. You would think that there should be representation theoretic structure. And the second comment is that this is already really hard. Really hard. So we have a complete answer. I wish I could just stop and say complete answer, but I cannot. Well, I won't write it on the board and play like it. But I am confident in saying that we have a complete answer when lambda is either a hook partition or a two-column partition. And It would have been five minutes already, but oh my gosh. All right. So just some words on the techniques. Is to construct strategic resolutions by vector bundles. If you want to know what strategic means, you can ask me. And then the second step is that we kind of develop a theory of categorification for symmetric function operators. So there are the theory of symmetric functions has a lot of fundamental operators. And it's a good question to know, like, symmetric functions arise as characters of representations. And the question is, when do operators on functions correspond to operators at the level of representation? Operators at the level of representation. It turns out there's a very elegant score here. So I will stop there. So any questions, just always go ahead. Naive question. So in the characteristic zero, as I understand the relay bot, representation theory encodes all the. Theory encodes all the quality. And this suggests that that's just not going to work in second positive characters? Yeah, that's exactly right. So, this case actually, if you look at the corresponding weight in this case, it'll actually, using Brahma weight, this is just zero. It's just straight up zero and characteristic zero. But you can actually have arbitrarily long chains of non-matching cohomology and positive characteristics, even just at the level of symmetric powers. It'll go on, yeah. It's very fast. Yeah. It's very strategic. Very different. Strategic, yeah. So it actually is kind of similar to Michael had mentioned that they had in his project with Groot, they had constructed resolution with diagonal by line bundles. And so line bundles are very nice. And in this case, we want to construct resolutions by tensor products of exterior powers. Powers. And the reason for this is that if you look at, I'm going to assume that the dimension of my space is sufficiently large. If I, this has only one non-vanishing cohog, where when I write this, I mean, look at what alpha 1, omega, tetz, so on and so forth. Alpha n, omega. This has only a single non-vancing cohomology, and it's one-dimensional. And so we want to construct resolutions by objects of this form, because when you take the hyperchromology sequence, it degenerates with the first step. And you're just reduce the quantity computing homology of a complex of vector spaces, which is a seemingly easy problem, but it's also kind of difficult. All right. My timer is not working, so I'll just tell you. My timer is not working, so I'll just tell you all miner's not working. I'll just tell you why I'm just going to go to the bathroom. Okay, I'm Clover May, and I work in Excel. I'm Clover May, and I work in equivarian homotopy theory. And I specifically mostly think about ROGE graded cohomology. So, Poling talked about this a little bit in her elevator pitch, but I will not assume that you're experts based on that. So, I'll tell you a little bit about what I mean. So, this is an equivariant ohmology theory. So, I'm looking at GCW complexes like we have been. But the issue that comes up here is. But the issue that comes up here is that if V is some real G representation, we've got this vector space, so the group action, right? So we can one point compactify and get an induced action on a sphere and call this a representation sphere. And the idea of R degraded cohomology is to build into the theory these representation spheres. So have a nice suspension isomorphism with respect to them, in particular. Respect to them in particular. So, unlike Borel, this is a cohomology theory graded on these representations. So, the real representation ring, and that's what I mean by ROG. So, in the example I care most about, when the group is the smallest non-trivial group. Is the smallest non-trivial group I can come up with. Then here I've got two irreducible representations. So my trivial representation and the sine representation. So I'm talking about a bi-graded theory. Rather than just graded by integers, graded by dimension, it's now graded by these two irreducible representations. And so I've got this bi-graded theory. And so I can start to compute vibrated cohomology of, say, I don't know, the simplest Z mod 2 space in an analog of F2 coefficients. Holland mentioned Machu functors, so that's really what that underline means. Is there some machine functor around? But in any case, it turns out that computations in this bi-graded theory are quite challenging. So already, this kind of simplest setup that I can think of gives me an infinite dimensional. gives me an infinite dimensional non-Nothrine ring. Okay, and so when I talk about these vibrated cohomologies of ZMON2CW complexes, for example, then I'm already working in modules over this messy ring, right? So this non-nokurian ring. So maybe let me just also say, because I think this came up a little bit. Because I think this came up a little bit in the link's talk as well, that this figured cohomology theory, saying F2 coefficients, this is represented by a genuine equivariant Eilenberg-McLean spectrum, which I'll write HF2 underline and And so, this is kind of like a very quick crash course in what RG-graded colomology is in this genuine aquivarian world. But my work has mostly involved doing some colomology computations in this setting. And in my thesis, I showed that actually there's only two types of modules. That can appear in the cohomology, the spy-graded equivariant cohomology of a Z mod 2 CW complex with F2 coefficients. So although you have this incredibly complicated module theory, you really only need two types of things to compute covalenties, at least when this is finite C12CW complex. Okay, so that's sort of where my story. That's sort of where my story begins. And then, from this, with Dan Ducker and Christy Hazel, we generalized this work and described all compact modules over this island-burdened plane spectrum. So, turning to this genuine stable equivalent. Genuine stable equivariant homotopy category and looking at HF2 underlying modules. And we did this, I'll just sort of briefly say, by turning this into a story about the bounded derived category of modules over this Macupuct. So somehow it became an algebra computation, and we completely classify these, and so we completely classify those. Five minutes, but go ten seconds. Okay, so I'll just say maybe one thing. So, I'll just say maybe one thing that I'm working on now, which is joint with Drew Kurd, is now, okay, well, let me say this complete computation then allowed us to compute the bomber spectrum of thick tensor ideals in this category, or in this category. And so, in joint work with Drew Hurd, now trying to extend this to the bomber spectrum. Say HR modules for various Mackie rings, and also generalizing the group sum. And in general, we have no hope of describing the entire category there. So really, we're trying to compute the Bomber spectrum to get a better idea of this otherwise very complicated category. Okay, and I'll stop. Questions? Would the HRR modules, is that always some derived category of Machiafunctors for okay. Yeah, yeah, so I only learned this pretty recently. I think it's Baron Sanders and someone else. I know, I can't remember after. Else, I can't remember off the top of my head. But yeah, they show that the Bernstein macufunctor, if you look at HA modules, where A is the Bernstein macu functor, then there's an equivalence of infinity categories to the derived category of modules or the macu functor. So then I think you can base change and get any other thing. But that, even that, is still not written down in full generality. And up here, we used a colon equivalence that is known. Equivalence that is known rather than the sink any categorical version. But yeah. Y'all should go through it. Any other questions? Okay, thank you. Hi, I'm Mark Stefan. Alefando told us today that if you are interested in actions and products of spheres, you can think of that very geometrically, where you think about smooth actions, you think maybe about it more topologically or only homotopically, or all the way in the algebra. Or both away in the algebraic world. And I like to think about very algebraic questions in the interactions with the homotopy world. And to illustrate that, we can, for instance, consider the following question. Let's say C is a chain complex of finitely generated. Three models over the group ring of an elementary in the T group and let's say it was a bounded. So it's a perfect complex and let's say it does have some homology. And let's say it does have some homology. And you can ask how large is the homology, or what is the sum of all the dimensions. And so how do I So, how large is this sum? And maybe more precisely, what would be a lower bound? And two answers for that. So, D is at least 2n, where n was the rank. This is when P is 2, and U to Carson. So, the point is that such chain complexes you get if you have free group action on a finite. Action on a finite CW complex, for instance. And that's why you're interested in these dimensions. And this was proven via EG modules over the polynomial ring. For odd primes, we have only a weaker bound. Have only a weaker bound, which can be proved, for instance, via LEMOS. This is due to Avramov who writes Jinger and Miller. This is why analysis in triangulated categories and more complicated construction, but if there Construction, but with their methods, you cannot improve this panel because if you just think about the levels, you forget actually about what these dimensions are. And so there is a different approach that Jeremiah Heller and I developed, where we also work with our polynomial ring, but now not with Digi models, where you have a differential that's squared. There you have a differential that squares to zero, but a map whose p power is zero. So this is why P d models. And I think now, so we don't get a better bound either, but I think now it will be a good time to go back and see if actually can try to improve the bound. And another result about this question I would like to mention is that it was conjectured. To mention is that it was conjectured that D is always at least true to the N, but in the same paper that Irina mentioned today, country is not this first construct by Sherry and Mark. And what they left open is the question: if you have now such a counterexample to this conjecture, which is just a chain complex, can you realize it topologically? And this I have answered together with Henrik Gripping that they cannot be realized. Now, in our work, we came up with another question, which was again in commutative algebra about automorphisms of causal homology. And then we teamed up with Pandiengar and managed to somehow answer this question. So I really like this back and forth between topology and commutative algebra. And I hope this workshop leads to many more thoughts. This workshop leads to many more such interactions. Thank you. Any questions? How small can D be? What's the best conjecture possible now based on the for the country examples? These are lower bounds. What would be a sharp lower bound based on what we know? So so what what the lowest example that that we have um so so maybe you know that it's slightly smaller than that it's like 1.96 the exponential but yes I mean that just based on examples possible exponential but it's not sudden yeah so there is uh still a lot of room between the country examples and these linear boundaries yes yeah Yeah. Those specific counterexamples cannot be realized published. Yes, that's right. And does it show that height of a counter example could not be realized technologically? Some property that could um I don't have like a family of counter examples that that cannot be realized. I think does it say like uh It says, like, our example would have to have a specific property. It does not say something about it. But what goes into showing that it can't be really sub-logic then? So I don't have a short answer to that. A short answer to that. But I'm happy to talk more about it. But for instance, I mean, you use that you would have multiplicative structure, but you also use, for instance, Kaplan products. So we also use some higher information. So I think if more questions we'll ask later. Thank you. Oh, sorry, yes. Good. Hi, Finnish. Hi, everybody. So, I'm a basically committed host of majorist at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. And I'm used to going to commit a host of conferences where everybody knows everybody. Conferences where everybody knows everybody, so it's really exciting to meet all these new people, and I'm really enjoying the conference. So, on logical algebra is one of my favorite things. So, most of the things I think about are some sort of application of, oh, this is really, you can hear yourself up here, I didn't know that. Or some sort of application of homological algebra to columns in commutative algebra or algebraic geometry that sometimes don't sound homologous. That sometimes don't sound homological at all. And so, in particular, I count among those things things like applications of heuratistic P tools that I claim are secretly just homological as dry. Can you turn it up? Yeah, another 30 seconds. That's okay. It's just very distracting. Where's the sound? Okay, from that. You just get an extra point. I can't see it. Okay. Okay, that's that was really throwing me off. Sorry. Also, my neighbors were having a party last night, so I didn't sleep. We're having a party last night, so I didn't sleep quite well. Anyways, so maybe I'll tell you about one of the things, one of my favorite things that I think is closest to the topics we're talking about in this conference. So maybe I'll add a little bit to what Josh told us yesterday. So he talked a little bit about chronological support varieties, and one of the things he mentioned was some joint work. Was some joint work we have with Ben Briggs and, well, John Ellis, who are both here. And I'm not really going to tell you theorems. I'm going to tell you some of our favorite questions that we're thinking about. So the rough idea is you hand me your favorite workloading, and we're going to assign to all elements in your derived category of R. Category of R. So if you don't like thinking about the right categories, pretend I'm talking about complexes of R modules. And for each such thing, you assign some variety. So it's actually some sub-variety of a n, where this n is a number that kind of comes attached to your ring r. It's the number of equations you've got to mod out by when you write r as a portion of a regular ring. And this is some iconic. This is some conical sub-variety of this. So that means it's a union of lines that go through the origin. And I want to give you a definition, but I claim that there are multiple ways to define this. They're all very homological in nature in some way. And this is some variety, a geometrical object that contains homological information about M or about R. And some of the things we And some of the things we would love to know about this. So, yesterday Josh told you about which varieties you see as homological supports. I don't know, which varieties do we get when we look at all the possible homological supports of things. And we were talking about this at dinner yesterday, and I'm going to repeat a theorem I told you yesterday, but I'm going to tell you the real theorem. So the theorem we prove in the paper looks really technical for computer algebraists, but we realized last night that maybe it actually looks less technical for the topologists. If I tell you that what we prove is the dimension of these varieties, we have a lower bound for it given by n minus the ls category r. So I won't define this, but if you know what this means, so it's maybe it means something to some of the topologists also. The topologies also. But in particular, this is something that allows us to say that when we have a colonacauli range that is not a complete intersection, that there are lots, potentially lots of varieties that could have been the chronological support of something, but are not. But let me tell you something. He didn't say. I have no idea how much time I have. Two minutes. Oh, cool. Okay, so here's one thing I would like to think about. I like thinking about conversation. About. I like thinking about computational problems. And so, in particular, I didn't give you a definition, but again, it's something very abstract. But when you want to sit down and actually compute to the support of something, I would love to teach my computer how to do such things because it's really hard to compute these things by hand. So I love writing Macaulay 2 code to do things. And so, in particular, one thing we've done is with Beginning Noulettes and Josh Politz, we've written a package. We've written a package called Fix of Categories for Vocalia 2. So this is me and Lance and Don Pullet that, among many other things, computes comological support variants for you. And it actually does it in two different ways. And one of those ways comes from a new definition that's equivalent to the old definitions that Josh and Brandon and Pyrrho. And let me just tell you very quickly. And let me just tell you very quickly that another thing that we've been, maybe the thing we've been most excited about lately, is some connections between these themes and the homotopy algebraic ball. And we keep running into evidence that there is some sort of trichotomy between, let me just say, the geometry of, you know, this chronological support, the The let me say the algebra, so the ring-theoretic properties of your ring R and the homotopily algebra R in some ways that I was going to make precise, but I think I might be out of time. So I can tell you over coffee some very specific instances of this. Like some theorem, the things we expect are true that we have partially proven, I claim. Proven, I claim, that sort of would translate into some kind of dictionary between these two kinds of signals. Okay, that's it. Questions? What is the LS category of R? You didn't define that. No, I didn't at all. Maybe I can give you a proper definition over coffee leader, but for now I'm going to say that it's sort of a generalization of what the Of a generalization of what the lower wall is. It's some sort of no potence degree type thing. And I'll give you a proper definition too. But yeah, I think I would just delay this if I give you a proper definition. What's the bottom of that in the triangle? How would you put it? So I mean like the ring theoretic properties of R. So for example, okay, I'll sneak this in. Whether or not R has an embedded deformation. R has an embedded information is something that we believe translates into the supports being contained in the hyperplane. And it translates into information about the radical elements of the almond double unit. And then we have one more board talking about. Oh, yes. I like groups. I think most of us actually like groups because groups are beautiful, they are about beauty, they model symmetry, we all like that. But sometimes they fail us, right? They're not good enough. They're not good enough. We need, I don't know, new tools, and they've been developed, like quantum groups, hop algebras, to model symmetries. And this is also where quantiles come in. So, quandals, it's some fantasy word for an algebraic structure that it's very much related to. It's very much related to groups, but different. You no longer need a multiplication. So, it's what category theorists hate if you don't have compositions. But you keep the conjugation as the most important aspect that you try to abstract from it. So, with quantitative, I now claim there are new theorems that you can formulate that you couldn't formulate with groups and would somehow help to explain similarities. And it would somehow help to explain symmetries in real-life mathematics. Of course, the question is: where's the evidence? So I brought two pieces of evidence, like two theorems. First, number theory. Look at the rational number field, its absolute Galvan group. It's a very complicated profinite group and it's very difficult to describe. Even elements are actually very difficult to describe explicitly. So what's easy? What's easiest to say is if you look at the finite order elements, Artin and Schreier have shown that the only finite order elements in absolute Galois groups are involutions. So you look at the subspace of involutions in this absolute Galois group. And this is not a subgroup, but it's an involutory quandal because conjugation preserves the property of being an involution. And this can be described. It's the free involutory quandral with a basis that's a kind of. With a basis that's a counter space. So it's all profinite, so the basis is not a set, will be a profinite set, it's a counter space, and then the rest is just freely produced by this algebraic structure that you have. That's the description of that. Second, like completely different, or maybe not completely different, in knot theory, like our ancestors, they've tried to classify knots using the not group. It doesn't work. And someone came up with not quandals. And these classify Bundles, and these classify knots. Isn't that beautiful? That's already very good. And it gets better. The classical Dean-Nielsen-Schreier theorem about surfaces has an analog for knots. So the moduli space of knots has a completely algebraic model that's given by the knot quantitative. So I think these are very good points on why you should study quantities. Of course, I haven't told you about the definition. I haven't really told you why I first came to become interested in those ideas. First, I came to become interested in those algebraic structures. It's not the theorems that I gave you. These are somehow side effects of the study. But I hope I've made you curious, and somehow, if you want to chat about it, I'd be more than happy to do so. Thank you. Any questions? I checked you're not getting missed a death questions. Oh, yeah, exactly. No. So the beauty of all this, I mean, groups, what's that? Association. I mean, groups, what's that? Associativity, neutral element, inverses. What's that to do with symmetry? So a quantum is a set with a binary operation so that all left multiplications are automorphisms. So that's about symmetry. And so all natural symmetries that you have, so the natural transformation from the identity functor to itself, they have to be the identity. It's again about symmetries. So I could translate it into equation, but you won't be able to re remember the equations. You can remember that left and multiplications are automorphisms, and the natural ones are the identity. So that's the definition. For the knot thing you mentioned, like, can you, like, if I drew a picture of a knot, could you somehow easily give like a presentation for the Quambo or something like that? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Quantal or something like that? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look at the, I mean, this is a randomized representation of the not group. It only involves conjugation. You take that. Okay. And that completely. It's a generators and relations description, like you would accept for the not group. But you said that determines the not, even though the not group doesn't seem to be a. Oh, no, no, there's a forgetful. Yeah. Oh no no, there's a forgetful functor from group from groups to quantiles and that has a left adjoint. The left adjoint, if you fit in the not quantum, it produces the not group. So the group is determined by the quantum but not conversely. And somehow. For homotopy theorists it's pi 0 of the homotopy fiber from the boundary of the naught complement into the knot complement. It doesn't look like a vibration but it's actually a homotopy cover unless you have a trivial. Actually, a homotopy cover unless you have a trivial norm. There's lots of interesting homotopy theory associated with these kinds of things, but I only have five minutes. The screen should come down. Oh, you need more than just too much because it fell on the floor of the floor. Where's the up here to it? It's a second one. Uh how much charge is charged to add a little cheap. Oh, it's okay. Somehow you don't think it's that's like not. That's like there's more and higher distractions. Yeah. So I thought I would talk briefly about digital topology. This is sort of a discrete combinatorial setting in which I've been sort of using some ideas from algebraic topology. The reference here is one of a number of papers. This is in a journal applied in computational topology. Journal of Applied and Computational Topology with Nick Scoville and also with John O'Prier. We've kind of been busy sort of generating lots of page length in this kind of area. So if you look at this paper, you'll see references to our other stuff and also references to quite an extensive literature in this kind of area. We're on the elevator in the digital topology department store, floor four, digital topology. Floor four, digital image. So here's a digital image, an actual one. This is extracted from a satellite image of a forested region, binary digital image. The legend gives the dark pixels, forest, the white pixels, non-forest is pretty binary. And then what we actually work with to the right here, sort of a kind of an Here, sort of a kind of an abstraction of this. So these are points in the integer lattice, and they come along with an adjacency, which I'll indicate sort of like graph style here. You know, just kind of giving edges of points which are adjacent, neighbours to each other, determined by coordinates, you know, location. So these are the points which are sort of vertically adjacent, the y-coordinate. Adjacent, the y-coordinate differs by one. Horizontal adjacencies, the x-coordinate differs by one. And then you also have these diagonal adjacencies points where both x and y coordinates differ by one. And so this indicates one exercise to see if I've missed anything instead. So some points are adjacent, some are not. Okay. And here's a digital image, sorry, a digital interval. I think length 4. These are just consecutive integers. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Again, adjacencies indicated. Graph style edges here. You can map a digital image to another digital image, points to points. To points. Third floor, continuity. So continuity is just adjacency preserving what we mean by a continuous map of digital images. And this is kind of already enough to get going with sort of basic ideas in homotopy theory. And so, for instance, if I indicate what So for instance, if I indicate where this is going, so 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, here we have a digital loop, a continuous map from an interval into a digital image with the initial and terminal points agreeing. And so now we're just one step away from the fundamental group. I should say I'm just focusing, just mentioning the fundamental group here, but you know, if you look in the papers there's a whole raft of kind of uh you know function space ideas and so on and so forth. Uh Ideas and so on and so forth, developing a setting. Second floor, oh no, sorry, still on the third floor in between. Yeah, so add in a suitable notion of homotopy. What's a homotopy? Just a continuous, which we already said what that is, map from a product of the unit interval and a digital image into another digital image. Into another digital image. Okay, so you have all the verbiage ready to do this, and then with some technical details that need to be ironed out, we'll led to a group of equivalence classes of digital loops with some sort of enhanced notion of the homotopy of loops. And this gives us a digital fundamental group. And second floor, results. I'll just mention one. We've developed many results about this. This digital fundamental About this digital fundamental group, this digital cipher van Kampen theorem. I'll just indicate it like that. This is the result that allows you to effectively compute many fundamental groups by sort of dividing and conquering in that kind of style. And many results flow from this. Applications, we're now on the ground floor. And some applications, big question mark here. This is kind of where we are. Market. This is kind of where we are. We're sort of to some degree on pause in just continuing to develop more and more stuff in the search for kind of actual genuine applications. So I'll tease this a little bit and mention something. Time's up when you keep people from here's something cool. So morphological image analysis. Image analysis is a sort of an area in oh, this is excruciating. There we go. Morphological image analysis. It's an area in image processing that is very rich in kind of topological kind of ideas, essentially, and they even use that word. Essentially, and they even use that word in places. And I'm sort of hoping that in this, plus the ideas that we've developed, you know, the scope of sort of applications, if I can kind of return up to this guy here. Again, this is a sort of extracted from a satellite image of a forested region, and this is part of the paper from which this came. It uses ideas in morphological image analysis to try. Image analysis to try and index fragmentation of forests. So you can see the forest is fragmented. What does that mean? Can you quantify and index it somehow? So already, you know, my topology radar is going off here, and I'm thinking about homology, like fundamental group. And their endeavour was to somehow sort of quantify fragmentation and then use this in a sort of a scientific way to study or to. To study or sort of analyze the effect of fragmentation, deleterious effect of fragmentation of forests on fauna. And I'm sort of hoping that we can perhaps contribute something in this kind of area using our topology kind of ideas. Why was the elevator going down? Why was the elevator going down? You know, it's the sort of thing where I regretted that because when I was practicing, I kept going back up. Once you start, you can't stop the whole thing. Maybe because you step out into the real world, the big floor. And you're also nothing to the real world stuff. Yeah. So in here, i if I have that little uh the I had that little digital image with the dots and the adjacency relations. I could imagine building, like, I could build a space where like over the little, like, the tiny triangles, I would glue in a little cell. And then is there a relationship between the photo mugger of that and the digital, like the regular functor mugger of that and the digital photo muggles? So, this is more or less described in the title of the paper. So, using So, using the digital image in exactly the way that. By the way, I should mention this also, not just plain digital images, unusual digital images. And so, you would construct the CLIEP complex, considered as a graph, construct the CLIEP complex in exactly the way that you're describing. And our digital fundamental group, which we sort of initially kind of defined sort of intrinsically, just kind of following our nose, indeed is isomorphic to the edge group of that Greek complex. Edge group of that creek complex. And then this opens the floodgates, you know, the theorems start flying out because these are easy to compute. So everything works well. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Do you know how to work? Awkward light. Uh uh oh yeah. Oh, then I can turn off the moonlight. No, no, no, don't turn off the moonlight as well. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Hi, I'm Maya Banks. I'm a grad student at UW-Madison, and I am going to give a little elevator pitch for something that I've been thinking about lately, which is voice-soder theory for differential modules. So I'm going to consider the polynomial ring over some field. And in this setting, if I have a graded module, If I have a graded module over the polynomial ring, I can write down a graded minimal free resolution and I can look at the number of generators in each degree. At each step of my free resolution, I can write down the value table of my module. And so this is encoding some numerical data about the module. And so a a big question is, can we classify all the things that are Betty tables of S modules, maybe with finite length in particular? Modules, maybe with finite length in particular. And so, so, like, you write down some big box of numbers, and I want to know if it's, oh, it switched from if it belongs to some module of RAS anyway. And so, I'll walk that way a little bit. That'll talk to the talk, talk. Is it talking to you? This doesn't seem okay, there we go. Yeah, okay. So, um, okay, great. So, and I want to know if. Okay, great. So, and I want to know if this diagram belongs to an S-module with finite length. And so, the idea of voice-sided breakthrough is that we can classify these things if we're okay with just thinking up to rational multiple. And so, I have this big vector space, and I can describe the cone where all of the Betty tables of these modules live. And I can also describe what the extremal rays are and have all this combinatorial structure. And so, the extremal rays are The extremal rays are what we call the pure Betty tables, which are comfort resolutions where in each spot in the free resolution, there's only one degree present. Okay. Great. So now I want to think about, say, I have some graded free complex, which I have up here, I just wrote a short one. And I can take some module D that I get by just taking the direct sum of the guys in my complex. The guys in my complex. And then I can sort of collapse the differentials and the complex into this block matrix. And this defines an endomorphism on D. And because I started with the complex, this is going to square to zero. And so this is what the pair D and del here. This data describes what we call a differential module over S, which is a module over S that has a square zero morphism on it. And in particular, it's going to be a map of degree, whatever the degree. The degree of the maps in the complex mode. Okay, but now I could look at this black matrix that I have here, and I could just sort of add more entries into the other blocks of the matrix. And so long as the matrix still squares to zero, I'm still going to have a differential module. And this sort of can imagine it, like I took my original complex and I added all these other maps in. Okay, so this is now a differential module that's no longer a complex. And so, if I have some differential module, it could be something weird. We can still sort of have a notion of a minimal free resolution of a differential module, which I won't define. But I can write down a minimal free resolution of this guy, which is going to be another differential module. And it's going to be free and it's going to be graded. And so now I can get the numerical data of this guy by just writing down this vector where I track the number. Vector where I track the number of generators in each degree of the morphologization. And so, a question that I'm interested in is: what does the cone look like that is spanned by all of the now Betty vectors of differential S modules that have finite length homology? And so we call this like, what does the voice-water bird cone of this thing look like? And so, first of all, any complex I can think of as a differential module. So, any free resolution. I can think of it as a differential module. So, any free resolution, I think of as a differential module. And so, this means that I get this map where I start with the voice-Stuterberg cone for S modules. I get a map to the Voice-Hutterberg cone for differential S modules. But we know that it's not surjective because we found examples of Betty vectors of differential modules that don't come from minimal figure resolutions. So, it's like a Betty vector and it doesn't appear as a Betty vector. Appear as a beddy vector of something that's actually just a complex. But we have a conjecture which is that actually the extremal rays of the downstairs one still come from the extremal rays of the upstairs one. And so in particular, all of the extremal rays of the guy downstairs are still buddy vectors of differential modules that are actually pure resolutions. And my watch timer went off, so I will stop. Because I had to knock around a bunch to do that plate. So all I'll say is that the other stuff that I have written down here is like a couple ingredients that we have floating around that we think are some evidence for this conjecture that I think we'll happily discuss with anyone. So let's go to the questions. Any questions? I would have thought I think I had to. Are hit that it not is your job? No, so at the level of like actual beddy vectors, it's not. At the level of cones, yes. So like anyway, so yeah, so definitely anything, or if the conjecture is true, anything down here is like up to scalar multiple agrees, but there are things that actually on the nose are betty vectors, where upstairs they're only a scalar multiple. Is there any chance the differential grade of the cone is saturated? You're distinguishing between the cone and the lattice points in it, right? Oh, yeah, yeah. So the difference between the cone and the lattice points. I am not sure. I've not thought about this at all. I know that's a good usual one. That's a good question. Yeah. That's a good question. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not sure. I have to have to think through some examples, I think. Okay, hello. Okay, so I'm I'm uh James, and uh I'm gonna uh say something that this uh thing Say something that this thing that I noticed in grad school, so it's like not exactly new, but I've been thinking about it a little bit more recently because of this meeting actually. And it's kind of this new kind of take on this sort of standard technique in group cohomology. So for the setting here, G is a finite group, and then we're looking at this Borel equivalent cohomology with coefficients of Fp. So this. Coefficients of Fp. So, this thing that you do all the time when you're studying the chromology of groups is you take this embedding of G into UN. So, you take a faithful representation of your group and then what you can do. So, then you can think of G is acting on UN with this free action. And then UN has this maximal ominibelian T subgroup of rank N, and then this thing. This thing that turns out you can do is you could look at the S equivariant cohomology of this UN mod G. So you think about G acting on one side and S acting on the other. And then this turns out to be isomorphic as modules over the columnology of BG to just the colomology of BG and then tensored with this little columnology of this manifold. So the point of doing this is that if you care about Is that if you care about the cohomology of Bg, now you can think about the cohomology of manifolds where you have an element of Belium Pg fraction. So it's kind of like more structure that you can use there. And so this space, I think Alejandro mentioned some things around this technique. And for this foundational work of Quan and Buflo, they're kind of looking at this thing there. Else thing there. Okay, so one nice thing that you could do, so one thing that I care about, and something we'll care about, are the local colomology modules of the colomology of BG. And so one thing you could do to get at these is if you have, if your group S, if it's acting, you know, it's acting on this UN mod G, if it has fixed points, the fixed points that's not empty, then you can cook up a strategic map from this S-leck of rank homology of UN mod G to Of UN model G to a shift of the cohomology of DS, where S is your Elmer Billian guy. And that M that you're shifting by is the dimension of this UN mod G. So this works for compact Ligues 2, by the way. Okay, and so one thing you can get out of this is you can get that in this situation, this kind of top, so this H. So, this HHM is denoting local cohomology. So, you have that this is kind of sort of understand what the local cohomology of BGU looks like kind of roughly. You know where it's, oh, my phone went away. You know where it's zero and non-zero. And so this is like kind of like the top right place where it could be a non-zero, and it is in this case. Okay, but this restriction that That you have this representation where this maximal element billion of UN will act with fixed points on this UMIG is very restrictive. So then one thing you might like to do is you might like to say, can you replace this unitary group with something else? And I think I'm maybe almost out of time. No? Okay. So I'll just say that you can sometimes. So if G Sometimes. So if G embeds in the Cenoteria group, then you have this induced action on this Stieffel manifold of K-frames in C. And so you can think about this as just this homogeneous space. And so it might be the case that G might not act freely on these Geiefog manifolds. But if it does, then you can play the same game. So if you do have a free action on the Stiefel manifold, then you have this fact that the S-equipped call model. This fact that the S-equivalent collomology of this GIFO manifold on G is the same as the collomology of BG and then tensor with this manifold. So you could focus on this over here instead of this unitary group 1G. And this would be a little bit smaller and maybe easier to understand if you're trying to analyze it closely. Okay, so the case that you'd be interested in is when the P rank of G is K, and then you have this. G is K, and then you have this free action of G on these K frames, and then you'll have this fact that this quotient space will have fixed points for this X action. And then you could do get this thing of a local colonology there. So, these groups where you have this action, these are the groups like this fixity that Adam was talking about this morning is involved in here. So, the groups that have Involved in here. So the groups that have a representation with this property where you can get this free action on K, on a sheet of mammal with K frames, where K is the P rank. These are the groups of minimal fixity. And then so for these, you have this proof. I'm showing it says non-zero. Okay, I just wanted to mention, just for truth in advertising, that there's other ways you can show this. So this is true, like this proof I kind of outlined only works for these groups. kind of outlined only works for these groups. This is in fact true for all groups, but the proof is sort of complicated and it goes through this local colonology structure sequence. It's hard to build. So this is kind of a more elementary way of getting this. And I hope that there's some more stuff you could get from this. So I'll stop there. Thank you. Any questions? Oh, like where the fixity is and isn't this thing? Yeah, so there's like, I mean, like, kind of like a dumb example would be like you could embed an element billion P group in the UN. P group and UN, and then like then that has like the fixity as a so then you're you're acting on the sheet plan of the in-frames and UN, so just you'd be acting like the action on UN would have the property you want, but that's kind of a silly example. But I think like one example is like metacyclic groups have fixity things like fixity one in this thing, so they act on the shield manifold of two frames, but but they Of two frames, but that they don't have a table representation on YouTube. We have one chocolate left, and it's one point. So, Adam, right there. And I've got two ways to try and share my screen. Let's try way one. Okay. I think laptops. Oh, whichever way it. Can you see anything? It should be video conference. Oh, video conference. Got it. Okay. Hold on then. Add them into black screen. Alright, let's try option two. Oh, wait a minute. We can't see it right now. So you. Oh, this one's the other. No. Yeah, so. Yeah, so I'm. I don't know if it's going to be possible to share my video, and also I'm logged into the meeting in two different ways. So if you want to do it, I'm just sharing your screen. This is great. It's good. It's great. Does that work? Yeah. Okay, that's for later. Now I'm in charge. Okay. Look at it away. Okay, so you can hear me and you can see? Yes. Yes. Okay. All right. Well, yeah, my name is Adam Wooker. I'm at the University of San Diego. I've been in and out, but I'm really grateful to get to participate remotely this week. And from my elevator, which is moving up and down, I don't know if you'll be able to experience that in real time. But I just want to talk about balance embedding numbers. And I know that Irena talked about this. Talked about this a bit today and yesterday, but we have a polynomial ring, say a finite length module, then, of course, a big recent theorem is that the sum of the Betty numbers has to be at least two to the number of variables. And a remark that was screwed by Mark Walker in 2018 and requires that we're not in characteristic two. And there's a stronger version of related conjectures that gives a bound on individual. Conjectures that gives a bound on individual betting numbers. That each individual betting number should be at least a number of variables, choose i. And I think I didn't write that down, but this is still open if n is at least 5. And so that's, I think, a really interesting conjecture I've thought a lot about. And I want to try and explain some generalizations of these things. And so, one generalization that we can do that still Do that still applies in the context of Marx's theorem is that if we drop the finite length assumption and just say that we have a finitely generated graded module, we can replace the role of the number of variables with the codimension of the module or the height of the annihilator. And the statements are still true, right? We still have a true theorem for the total Betty number, and we have a conjectured lower bound for. A conjectured lower bound for the individual numbers. And so, but that's not all. I give an elevator pitch so there's more to the story. There's one little bit extra in Mark's theorem, which says if we assume further that that module is not a complete intersection, so we know that it's not resolved by a Kazoo complex, then actually it may not look like anything's changed, but there's a strict inequality yet. And so the question. And so the question, what I'm going to fill in here with the conjecture, is that it seems that the actual lower bound may be as big as 50% bigger. And so, you know, I'll kind of explain where there's some cases where we know this is true. This bound was reverse proved around 1990 in In small codimension cases and in a multi-graded case. But what I want to kind of end today with is like a slide that shows that this seems to be true in different cases for kind of crazy reasons. And so maybe you saw this before I hit it, but there is a joke when I was preparing the talks, and it's an extension of Mark's result, because I realized that this actually is true if 2 is equal to 0. So I hope the color quoting came through, otherwise it doesn't make any sense. Right? And so I talked about a couple conjectures. And as I remarked, kind of everything is completely open, at least for the individual bounds, when C is at least 5. And in the multi-graded case, which I wrote monomial there, everything is known. Both of these conjectures are true. Are true. I'll have another slide a bit with some who to attribute this to. And there's also this paper by Idana Ehrman from 2009 that shows using bois-Sodeberg techniques that we can get this for modules I call low regularity. And I'll just mention briefly, I know some other people have talked about it, this corresponding conjecture for complexes turns out to be false. To be false. That was a counterexample by Shree and Mark. It is true if the complex is multi-graded. That's some related work that I won't really get into. But there's a lot of these kind of related things. And so coming back down here, remember earlier when I said there was some reason to think that these betting numbers might be 50% bigger. And so that's this row of the table here. And the original paper. And the original paper in the 1990s, right here by R. Lumis and Evans, the way that they proved it, right here in the middle, they proved it by showing that the individual Betty numbers were kind of bigger than two different binomial coefficients. And when you sum them up, you get
