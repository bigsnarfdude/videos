Look at the main one, really, is acute respiratory distress syndrome. And this is an acute onset respiratory failure. It could be due to smoke inhalation, chemical exposure, or COVID. And it leads to fluid in the airspace, edema. That brings with it proteins that inactivate pulmonary sfactin, leads to high surface tension. This causes the little tiny bits in the lung to collapse. And that stiffens up the lung. So you can't breathe on your own. You need a mechanical ventilator. Ventilator. These physiologic changes bring with them a 30 to 40 percent mortality. Pre-COVID times, this was 60,000 deaths a year. So fairly substantial problem. And post-COVID, guessing about 1 million dead. If 80% of those had ARDS, and that's probably a conservative estimate, and there's 30% mortality from COVID-ARDs, then that's 2.6 million cases in the last couple of years. And this really explains why I spent all the spring of 2020 trying to design emergency ventilators. Trying to design emergency ventilators and operating in panic mode. Dave has some great memories from that point in time, too. So, you know, given this huge incidence of mortality, like any little bit we can claw back from that is going to be a huge benefit. Unfortunately, along with mechanical ventilation comes this huge risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. This doesn't happen in the same degree to everyone, but it injures the lung and impairs survival. Impaired survival. Just one quick second, because we've just got done with HCI. When you listen to Brad, think about the complexity of the decision-making process and the overall situation and how you'd have to translate some information he could get into something that, for example, Mary Rolina would present. And you'll get an idea of how brutally difficult it is and how naive it is when people look at this and they say, oh yeah, we can optimize the ventilation. And they say, oh, yeah, we can optimize the ventilator with machine learning very easily because we don't even know what to optimize. Yeah, it's a question of what to optimize and also a question of what information the clinician would want. I think from any of these simulations, we could come back with a huge body of information that would just confuse me for weeks. And the clinician is going to be sitting there like, I need to save this person in five minutes. What do I do? Okay, words. All right. So. Okay, words. Alright, so those kind of horrible-looking lungs on the side there. The difference between these two is just the ventilation pattern. This was kind of a novel lung protective ventilation strategy. This was the clinical standard of care at this point in time. These are from pigs with sepsis ARDS after two days of ventilation. You don't need to be a super expert in lung physiology to tell that if these were your lungs, you would want the nice pink top ones and not the horrible bloody mess. So for a long time, I viewed this as. So, for a long time, I viewed this as just like kind of a solid and fluid mechanics problem. And over the last couple of years, it's really become apparent that there's this huge interaction between the patient and the ventilator as well, and the respiratory efforts of the patient actually entering the lungs through the forces that those impart. So we'll touch on that a little bit. So, my background, engineering, and I really see this as like a positive feedback mechanism that we need to break. Mechanism that we need to break. We start off with some acute injury, COVID, smoke inhalation, whatever, near drowning, and this knocks out the surfactant system. I'll get into the importance of this in a bit. High surface tensions make the alveoli unstable. They collapse. You reopen them with the pressures of the ventilator. That causes damage. We'll refer to that as atelectrauma after atelectasis and reopening that atelectasis. There's also over-distension-induced lung injury, which is easy to understand. You stretch something too much. Easy to understand. You stretch something too much, it breaks. They call that voluntrauma. Both of those damage this delicate blood gas barrier, lead to inflammation. Both of those lead to more leak, surfactant and activation, and this perpetuates itself. So the question is, how do we break that? Is it with some decision support so that a clinician can make a decision and interrupt this cycle? Or is it my dream of turning control of the ventilator over to an algorithm? Probably the first one. All right, so first of all, Alright, so first of all, credits due on these beautiful SEM images. These are KEDs. And the point of this is that what we're looking at when we look at the data available, and really what's available is pressure and volume measurements from the mechanical ventilator. It's a characterization of these alveoli. Like this nice, healthy top one. We've got an intact epithelium. We've got our type 2 cells making surfactant. Everything's happy. We get a nice, normal-looking pressure volume loop. Looking pressure volume loop. This is compliant or distensible at low volumes, stiffens up at high volumes to keep you from overstretching your lung while you're breathing. This horribly mangled alveolus, just subjected to mechanical ventilation, full of junk in the air space, which is knocking out of surfactant. There's cracks in the epithelial surface. It's letting things in from the vasculature. And this leads to this really pathologic weight and pressure-volume relationship. It's super stiff at low pressures. Then the alveoli open up here at about a pressure. Open up here at about a pressure of 20 centimeters of water, and the lung becomes easier to stretch. We come back down in deflation, those alveoli collapse again. At the same time, it's a two-way street. We're not just using this ventilation to measure the properties of the lung, right? This is changing the properties of the lung by depending on what we do. We use a nice safe ventilation with a positive end expiratory pressure of a PEEP to keep things open. Low tidal volumes, we have low inspiratory pressure, we wind up with nice healthy alveoli. Healthy alveoli. We do something terrible like set PEEP to zero, you know, horribly high inspiratory pressure, we wind up with these. So I really did not have a good idea myself of like the hugely multi-scale complexity of the lung until we started getting into these SEM studies. This is just a slice through a mouse lung, and kind of starting from the mouth, we traveled down the airways into this like really highly branched airway. Like really highly branched airway tree until we get to the alveolar ducts, which are these little openings here. We go down into the duct, which is this space. The walls of that duct are lined with mouths of alveoli. And then in each of the alveoli is where the gas exchange is occurring. You've got this real thin barrier between blood and air. What's the scale of blood at the time you got? So this is about 100 microns on the alveolus. Yeah, so this, the whole point is. Yeah, so this the whole point is just to get a volume of air down to this huge huge area of gas exchange with a really thin blood gas barrier and if you folded the alveoli out in a human lung it'd be about the size of a tennis cord and the lung has managed to pack that into a volume of about an algine bottle if you suck the air out. It's an amazing feat packaging. Just because both of our experimental talks would be remiss without transmission electron microscopy, if we go in a little further If we go in a little further, this is an air space, one alveolus. This is another alveolus. And this super thin blood gas barrier is shown here. So we've got an epithelial cell, type 1 cell, an endothelial cell, a basement membrane. That whole thing is just 3, 4 microns. And it's super, super fragile because of that. So you may say, oh, 300 million alveoli. That's a very complex system. Alveoli. It's a very complex system. They're all interrelated. How can we overmodel that? It gets even better. If we look at the super thin layer of fluid that's lining these alveoli, it's got a surface temping just like any other liquid. And what that does in the lung is accounts for a huge portion of the stiffness. So if you inflate a lung with saline, it has about 20% of the stiffness of if you inflate it with air, because you've gotten rid of that air-liquid interface. Air-liquid interface. And if this lining fluid were to have the surface tension of water, you would be totally unable to breathe. And the striking case of this is premature infants. Prior to about 28 weeks of gestation, they have no functional surfactant system. And until the advent of surfactant replacement therapy, they had to go in a ventilator. Outcomes were terrible. Mortality was high. But then we figured out that we could rinse the lungs of a calf or a sheep and take them. Calf or a sheep, and take that surfactant, put it into the infant, and that's reduced mortality to basically zero. So, hugely important for lung function. And it's not just a constant either. It is an incredibly complex molecular dynamics problem to even solve one cycle of respiration at the scale of surfactant. It's a chemical where the surface concentration is proportional. Concentration is proportional to the surface tension. So, as we oscillate in area, we compress the air-liquid interface, increases the density of surfactant, lowers surface tension. It folds itself into these little layers under the surface for storage. As you breathe in and increase the size of your alveoli, it spreads back out, surface tension goes up, and that process repeats itself. And this has huge implications for the stability of the lung. For the stability of the lung and in injury, when surface tension goes up, those alveoli go shut, and you're on a ventilator. By the way, that was a beautiful slide. Thank you. That took me like a week to make fun of the steam over Adobe Creative Sweep for the win. Okay, so I think hopefully we've got a little handle on the healthy lung. It's really complex, you know, going down from these big airways into the tiny alveoli, surface tension forces, everything working. Surface tension forces, everything working in harmony, and you can exchange all sorts of gas in this huge surface area. When things go wrong and you're on the ventilator, let's look a little bit at these kinds of injury. So I think the idea of over-distention is like fairly easy to grasp. There's two subtleties to this that I think are really important when we're trying to reduce ventilator-induce lung injury. The first is this concept of baby lung, which you'll see in the literature, and you might say, What are they talking about? Baby lungs? We're talking about ventilating adults here. Baby lungs. We're talking about ventilating adults here. And what Seth's referring to is the effective size of the open lung that's left when you've collapsed a bunch of it. So you can imagine I'm taking a breath with a volume of tube into my healthy lung. Distension is fairly low in both of the compartments. You collapse half of it. All that gas goes into one compartment. You've double distension. So the second problem is that everything is deeply, deeply interconnected. So if we imagine this. So, if we imagine this alveolar duct surrounded by alveoli, if you injure a region of this, it collapses, that jacks up the strain everywhere else in the surrounding parenchyma, and all of a sudden, even small, low tidal volume breaths at low pressure are grossly over-distending the open alveoli that remain around that. Thinking in terms of atelectrona, this is going back to my PhD, this is fluid. This is fluid mechanical forces. So, everyone who's studied fluid mechanics at some time in the past, this is a free surface problem with dynamic surface tension and fluid structure interaction. Super easy to solve. And as you're pushing these bubbles of air into collapsed small airways or alveoli, there's a collection of stresses along the wall that act on the cells. And it's actually the normal stress gradient that's been implicated as rupturing cells. Rupturing cells, killing them, letting more junk into the airspace, and furthering that positive feedback of injury. And there's a delay in this one. It's not an instant reopening and closing. So as we try to model this from the scope of the whole lung, there's a latency. You can imagine pushing a bubble down a straw full of milkshake. It takes time to clear that milkshake out of the straw. So there's this latency both in the closure and the reopening. Reopening. Alright, so that all seems pretty simple, right? It's just fluid mechanics. It's like a complicated problem, but whatever. The additional challenge that stacks up on top of that is that during clinical ventilation, you're often not fully chemically paralyzed, deeply sedated, and you're taking small breaths that the ventilator then senses and gives you some pressure support on top of that, which is all well and good until you get out of phase with that ventilator. out of phase with that ventilator support and you might say try to take an inspiration while the ventilator is exhaling or taking a second breath on top of the first one and in some cases depending on the timing and magnitude this might be really injurious we don't know because it's really hard to even define the state of the sentry and then it's easy to prevent it And then it's easy to prevent it. You just like give them a bunch of chemical paralytic and they'll stop trying. But that has these hugely negative effects. Like, you'll never get them off the ventilator, which probably is the primary goal if you're not an experimentalist. So that's one of the big things that Dave and I have been working on together. Can you talk about desynchronies? What's desynchronies? So, in like a nice synchronous patient who's getting ventilator support, they would take a small breath. They would take a small breath, the ventilator senses that little dip in pressure, and then gives a ventilator breath on top of that to support that patient effort. If you're experiencing severe air hunger or for some other reason or out of sink, you would, as the ventilator is giving you a breath, for example, and then exhaling, you inhale again before the ventilator is done. So it's basically that your efforts are out of phase with the support. Are out of phase with the support that the penalty is giving. Or they'll try to protect you by keeping limiting the overall volume that goes into the lung. And your body might want more, and the ventilator limits that. So you're sitting there trying to suck, and the ventilator is keeping you from eating. Yeah, so it'd give you this increase in pressure and hold you at that plateau, and you would say, That wasn't enough. Try to take another breath on top of that. Top of that. The more you work on this, the more you start hyperventilating. Actually, you're like, don't try and visualize. Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's just. Oh, man. Yeah, everything that I've heard about being ventilated makes me really not want to be on a ventilator. I have a naive question about that. So are you aware of this when you're on a ventilator? Yeah, the incidence of PTSD is huge and it is apparently a really, really unpleasant experience. Really, really unpleasant experience. Why don't they just put me away from people? Well, you might be on there for like 30 days, and if they keep giving you like deep sedation and paralytics, then you get weakness in like all of your muscles, and particularly in the diaphragm. And when they go to wean you off the ventilator, you've got to slowly step down the support. And if your diaphragm is so weak that you can't breathe on your own, like you're in a you're in a dead end, you're not coming off. There's also the problem that they don't exactly understand why, but the more sedation they give you, Why, but the more sedation they give you, the more PTSD you seem to have. So, for example, the people with neuromuscular arcade are much more likely to have PTSD than people that are just lightly state. So there's also delirium as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So they don't, so in other words, they want a minimum. So the nurse generally sits there. I mean, Kenrick can tell you much better, but the nurse sits there and tunes, like, tries to keep this, minimizes sedation all the time on almost the minute. All the time, on almost a minute-by-minute basis. Because they're trying to minimize how sedated you are. Because the less sedated you are, also the stronger you are, and the more likely you are to be able to get off an earthwater soon. There's like a, when I talk about delirium, there's a psychological part of it too, where your brain is literally going crazy with the variance you're having with your lungs. And so there's a real balance there between protecting the brain, protecting. There between protecting the brain, protecting the diaphragm, and protecting the lung. Because what good is it to save somebody's lungs if the rest of them is ruined? And it's no good to protect their brain if they die of born injury. Are there also cases where they would have been better? At what point do they even put you on the mental data? Because from what you've been telling us, it kind of seems like let's just not do it at all. Like is there, I mean, I mean, no, it's cool, but but are there people like where they Are there people like where they maybe didn't have for example now and during corona there were not always the ventilators around? Did they look into it if some people actually got out of it like pulsier because there was no ventilator around? So they lately it seems like people have become more liberal about first doing high flow nasal cannula to like keep you oxygenated and then if you can't clear CO2, doing like a helmet ventilation or mask ventilation with a CPAP or a BIPAP. But at a certain point there's like not enough. Point, there's like not enough power in that to inflate these like horribly, horribly stiff lungs. I mean, and then it's not even the ventilation is not the end intervention. When they decide that you're too bad for the ventilator, there's something called ECMO, which is extracorpical membrane oxygenation, and they just take your blood out and do the gas exchange and then put it back in. That sounds somehow better or somehow. Yeah, it's kind of risky. Yeah, it's like the hardware bypass option, we have another word for it. Just saying, not from what we've been telling me, I will go away. But then you've got to be weaned from ECMO, and you're back in the ventilator, and then you've got to be weaned from the ventilator. So it's like it's a. I almost was moved to tears at a biomedical engineering society conference by a video of the spouse of a survivor of ours who was put on ECMO. They were like, your husband's going to die. But we're going to try this new thing. And he came out of it fine. And so, I mean, it's really hard to use in expensive and only in fancy institutions and everything. Institutions and it was designed for heart transplant surgery. So, yeah, it's yeah. Yeah, I think there's a yeah, there's a lot of risk membrane oxygenation oxygenation. Yeah. Not what you want. So Colombia is an ECMO center. I don't know how many there are in the world, but one of the things they started doing with ECMO to help with lungs is they actually wake people up. Wake people up and walking around with them. And it's a it's a big machine. And people are third, you know, it's it's a crazy thing to see. We've got like four holes with 26 ventica bags hanging. Quite something. That raises another question. If you're ventilating on somebody on ECMO, you don't need to exchange too much gas, but you still need to keep the lungs working. So you've got to give them some. So, you've got to give them some sort of breathing, and the surfactant release is mediated by stretch. So, if you give them no tidal volume, then you get no surfactant, and it's this like positive feedback into fibrosis. So, that's like a whole other open question. Do you feel like you have good measures of lung damage? Yeah, I think that's in my stating. Once they cut the lungs out, I'm gonna say both those pigs are dead. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Once they cut the lungs out, they got it now. Once they cut the lungs out, have they got it? So there's not great ways to identify a during fentylation. That was my first indication on its first slide. Yeah. Neither of those slots were in good shape. Actually, no, the top pink ones were good. Like, we did histology. It looked fine. Not for the animals. Well, I mean, at the point of euthanasia, the lungs were great. I'm bumping up on 20 minutes here, so I think I'm just going to fold this into tomorrow. I'm just going to fold this into tomorrow in the spirit of keeping us kind of somewhat on schedule because this is what I would like to do about the horribly complex problem. I think we understand that it's going to be hard. There you go. Awesome. Thanks. While Bruce is setting up, one of the things is it's not just, usually they put you on the machine when you're going to die without it, but it's more, it's gas exchange. It's not just. Exchange. It's not just like when I started working with Brad, I was thinking, oh, it's just oxygen. But it actually controls your blood pH and all of it, and because it's CO2 removal and oxygen. So it's always kind of both at once. Yeah, so the kind of there's a term minute ventilation, which is like a volume of gas per minute. You'll adjust that up and down to reduce the CO2 and keep pH normal and then add oxygen to the mix to like bring oxygen to the. Into the next like bring oxygenation for you. I think we should go on a hike now and turn on locks. I feel like I don't want to be able to do it. If you really want to make yourself nervous, horses actually can exercise smart enough to rupture the pulmonary capillaries, so don't work too hard. So I think between Brad and Artie, most of the ideas that I'm going to present, other than the fact that this is in brain, have already been described. But we'll see what we can get to. So I have a couple of So, I have a couple of things to note. The first is that I'm going to show you, there'll be at least two videos. No, there are two videos in this, both with slightly different kinds of disturbing results. So if you're squeamish, cover your eyes or something. To ramp into one of those, I'll just show, this is a very disturbing picture of me, but it's why I wear a beer. Why I wear a beer. And these are my kids, and they took me for a baby version of backcountry skiing a couple of days before we went skiing in a real snow. Anyway, so I'm going to tell you a little bit about brain and lead up to my big clinical-like challenge in brain dynamics. In brain dynamics, I've been working on aspects of understanding epilepsy for over a quarter of a century now. And so you might ask, what does a brain do? Or maybe you guys know what brains do. And they are everything. I think Dave said something earlier. Earlier, you know, in his introduction, about people having internal models. And not everybody has the same models. And in fact, that one of these functions of brains is to hold some model of what the outside world is because your brain is generating most of your dynamics, most of your locomotion through. Your locomotion through its environment, whether you're a person or you're a beast. And if we go into kind of strange meta understanding, brains mediate social interaction, so networks of brains are interesting. So this video is the interaction, I hope, between four different brains. Four different brains that would be clear. This is my wife's hand and my son's lizard, and there's a brain associated with that thing that's about to, you know, that's going to try and get away from it. Yes or no? Oh wait, she doesn't like this video thing. And there's my wife talking to me, so that's... Yes or no? What kind of bug? Yeah, it's a kind of cockroach. It's a kind of cockroach. And so she knows, this lizard knows my wife very well. Knows me if I walk by and it's the right time, she'll give me this look. Are you going to feed me? You're going to feed me? She knows how to communicate with me. So, anyway, we know, you guys all know what neurons are, right? So, I'll... So, I'll neurons, neurons are the things, the calculating little cells in a brain. And we know how neurons work. And so, here's like the core theory in neuroscience, the mathematical model, comes from Hotchkin and Huxley from the 1950s. But kind of they built that up over the seven or eight years. And what they built was this circuit. Was this circuit-like embodiment of the basic function of how a neuron works? And the neuron is being driven by concentration gradients between the inside and the outside. That drives, in electrical terms, currents of different kinds of ions through the membrane. And the conductances for those currents are Those currents are dependent on the transmembrane potential. So, if you have a, you know, so if you've got the inside to the outside of the neuron on that membrane, you can have a charge like on a capacitor. And so there's potential difference between the inside and the outside. And these conductances sense that potential as the primary way that this functions. And yeah, so this was all built, by the way, as models for these big long axons. So this is the mantle of a squid folded out and illustrated here were these big long axons that transmit signal from the putative. From the putative brain of this squid down to cause the mantle to contract to make the thing swim. Make sense? And so, by the way, those of you who've heard of this as the squid, giant, axon, giant is modifying axon, not squid. These guys are. Are little devices, not big devices. Alright, so the way this thing works, here I'm just writing, you know, electrical circuit version of this. And Brad had beautiful, beautiful illustration of how stuff works. I wrote one a couple of a decade or two describing how a neuron fires and And basically, my illustration works with these little multi-wool chamber channels or covered kind of cans, right? And so these things will open and close. The sodium channel's got two little closures on it. The calcium channel only has one. And so the way. One. And so the way this works is that this guy opens up quickly, this guy closes slowly, and this guy opens slowly. And so what happens, and these things open and close at different electrical potentials across the membrane. And so my illustration, you start at the rest of the neuron. Rest of the neuron. These guys are closed, this guy's open, this guy's your sodium channel, the other one's the potassium channel. And at some kind of baseline potential, nothing's happening. You sit there like that. But if this potential wanders up above some threshold, which I nominally describe here as 65, this guy opens up quick. This guy opens up quickly. And if this guy opens up quickly, then sodium flows into the cell. Sodium flows into the cell. The membrane goes from minus 65 millivolts up. And illustrate here. And then what happens is that at high potential, right, higher than minus 65. Higher than minus 65, one of these guys is going to close. I forgot which one, the lower one closes, but the potassium one opens up. And so then what's going to happen is potassium is also possibly charged, but it's high concentration on the inside. And with this open, potassium flows back out, the membrane potential drops way back down below the rest position, at which point Which point this guy closes, this guy stays closed because it opens and closes slowly. That gives this refractory period that we talk about. And then it stays negative. And then this guy can open up. And once this guy has opened again, it can go back and do the same thing. So that's this thing we call an action potential. You guys have all heard this before. You guys have all heard this before, so it's just a reminder. Of course, neurons don't just do this for their own sake. They're connected to other things, other neurons or to muscles, right? And so what happens is, just like with the squid, these things, these action potentials propagate along this thing we call the axon, right, as a pulse wave and And then, when they hit the end, they send signals to the next thing down the line. And so, if you look at the architecture of these things, the neurons, this is from ancient illustrations from Kahal. You see that neurons have this structure where the cell body, if I just hold it there, you can't see anything. There, you can't see anything. So, the neurons have a cell body here, they've got these long things sticking out, those are dendrites, and then they have other things that are long and thin that spread out, and those are the axons. The axons attach in networks to dendrites of other neurons, and this creates some gigantic network. So, if you look at this, and I wish I knew the number, but if you I knew the number, but if you, if, just like Brad said, if you unfold the lung, you get, you know, a human lung goes to the surface area of a tennis court. If you unwrap all of the axons, you probably get, I don't know, all the way to the sun. Some gigantic distance. I don't know if you take 10 to the 10th, right, and you multiply that by... And you multiply that by a centimeter. What's the distance? Yes, some long distance. All right, so brain's got somewhere between, you know, human brain's got 10 to the 10th, 10 to the 11th neurons. Typical neuron receives a whole bunch of inputs, somewhere between 1,000 and 10, 100,000 inputs from other neurons. And it sends out signals to a lot more. But then there are all these other kinds of neurons, support cells. Kinds of neurons, support cells, infrastructure. They do transport nutrition in and waste management and 850,000 kilometers. You look that up. 850,000. So I just used you, I used your math and I got 100,000 kilometers. The distance to the moon is 384,000 kilometers. I think I'm in the right distance, right? Yeah. To the moon and back. To the moon and back. Alright, that's great. Right, so you got these dendrites, you got the links between the dendrites, you got all this vasculature, and these are giant things. And as I describe, well, wait a second. We promised you TEN, right? Promised you TEM, right? So here's TEM. This is about a 300-micron slide, about 35 nanometers thick. TEM image, it's actually stitched together from brain. And you can see there are all these different cell types. Some of these are neurons, some of these are astrocytes, some of these are microglia. Some of the rounds are cellular. Microglia. Some of the round things are, and I don't really remember anymore. Some of these round things are blood vessels, big blood vessels, and some of them are really small capillaries. By the way, capillaries in human brain are somewhere around 20 microns from any other point in the brain. And then there's this stuff. Case. So if we look at, and I'm sorry, this got rotated by, you know, rotated around at some point, but this is that structure of cells around it. And if you look in here, you start blowing it up. Well, it looks like it's structured. And if you look Structured, and if you look even deeper, it really is structured, and that's all that spaghetti of axons and dendrites mixing together in the neuro, what we call neuropill. It's all this stuff that Kahal was beginning to describe. And so, in the sense that Brad was saying, brain is this giant Is this giant, very, very complicated, multi-scale system with these non-local elements, which we call neurons in one network. Non-local because a neuron will have connections in terms of axons and dendrites that can go very, very long distances. Typical excitatory output neurons will project other. Neurons will project to other parts of the brain, so almost the size of your brain. Things that go from your brainstem will, some of them go all the way down to your, almost your toes. And then there are these other ones, astrocytes. The vasculature is this other non-discrete system. And then there's extracellular space. And so when you start looking at it at every level. Looking at it at every level that you look at, at every length scale you look at, there are different organizational structures that start to appear, and they go from sub-micron structures all the way out to the size of the brain. And then Brad didn't really push on this in terms of lung, but brain evolves in very, very complicated ways over very long time scales. Long time scales, and you know, we remember things for very long times, and yet, and then the dynamics are really related. All right, so here's... I don't want to look at the camera. Sorry. So, you know, it's not so surprising that you could make this thing. I think of brain as the absolute most complicated device that we know. Device that we know of in the universe. It's far more complicated than most of the rest of the universe. And it's not so surprising that this giant network might be unstable and not function. What's really hard to understand is probably on this list, not... Not exactly what are seizures or why are there seizures. Why aren't there always seizures? Why, if this thing has these events, why isn't it always doing this? Then, what are the origins of these things and how to fix it? And then from the microscopic to the macroscopic version, can we get, you know, if we if we link to genetics? If we link to genetics, right, if you look at genetic mutations, could you predict what genetic mutations are going to lead to seizures or what kinds of seizures? And this is the kind of problem that's really, really challenging. I list the same kind of thing in Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, while we see these things. Wild, you know, we see these things. Alzheimer's disease is this funny thing where we know people get dementia after they die. If you look at them, they've got these amyloid plaques and these tautangles. It's got all this stuff in the brain and degradation in the brain. And that's the diagnosis. That's the definition of Alzheimer's disease. But if you look at a lot of post-mortem brains, a lot of them have this stuff and never had any dementia. Never had any dementia. So the definition isn't exactly these things of what led to the dementia itself. And then if you're starting to look at this, where did they get there? What do they cause the dementia? Again, how do you fix it? Can you get from the genetics to the physiology? And then can you build in the whole time scale, which is now an observable. Time scale, which is now an observation problem over the lifespan of the organism. So that's the big challenge, I think. How are we going to solve it? No problem. I think I saw you with your hand up first. Um so do you think actually the with the teachers can they uh have friends? Uh have a brain scan during or are they brain scanned during the scene share? Can you basically see what's going on? Or is there all right so I'm gonna talk a little bit about what people measure tomorrow. How about that? Is it a job? Wait, wait till tomorrow. What's that? I have a different opinion then. You said if you like cut up people after they're dead and you find little better plagues of the power tangles, is that only for people who are Is that only for people who are older, or do they also find that in younger people? It's a spectrum of that. People develop these over time. They're not born with them. It's not in early development. They don't have these kinds of structures. But the more we find ways to look for them, especially non-invasively, the more we see them. Invasively, the more we see them through non-invasive imaging techniques. So this is, I'm less the expert in this than they also have the names. Not as much. So we make model. Yeah. I'm going to talk about that word model tomorrow. Experimentalists have this word model, and biologists have a very And biologists have a very, very dirty version of that, of models. But yeah, there are animal models that incorporate some of the genetic mutations that then can express this and this or both. And they have some similarities to overall changes that we see in humans as they develop it. As they develop it. But typically, we don't develop models that last 60 to 100 years because none of us have the patience to watch them. All right. How do you evaluate dementia in maps? I'm going to wait till tomorrow because my question has something about it. All right. Okay. I think the article manager over beers has the rich system is more complex. I thought it was a good point. Of course, I saw this new points. Yeah, I think back then I could license these statements. I'm going to talk about 240 miles from that.
