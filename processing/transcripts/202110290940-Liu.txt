This is very nice meeting. So, I'm going to talk about some very recent work which I did with my student Sam Luther and which appeared just maybe one or two weeks ago. And this paper was a short summary of a longer paper to appear. Right. Good. Good. So the duality between internal black hole in ADS and the two copies of CFT, say in the thermal field double state, is one of the most universal features of ADS CFT. And there have been many, many results based on it and many, many self-consistency checks. But still, there are many puzzles. There are many puzzles left regarding this relation. First is that the boundary time stops at the horizon, so how do we understand the emergence of the Krushchev time or other kind of infalling time? And also, how do we understand the emergence of the horizons and also this future and the past region, this future and the past region of the black hole space-time, and also how do we interpret. Space-time, and also how do we interpret the singularities? And also, even though these two CFTs, they don't, they have no interaction with each other, but observers from left and the right regions of this black hole can actually fall into the black hole and actually interact behind the horizon. And so, yeah, all these issues actually highlight that if we want to That if we want to describe an infalling observer, you need a boundary theory, say, some informing observer from the R region to force through the horizon. And that math must involve a degree of freedom of both CFT right and CFT left. Okay, so Lampos also have made similar remarks earlier in the week. So yeah, the reason is simple because in the F region, and now you can Because in the F region, and now you can actually causally connect it with both L and right. Okay, so once you close the horizon, you must actually involve left in this field. And so in this talk, I will show, I will provide the description of such involving observers. I will show that actually they exist, say, evolution operators on the boundary, which you can construct intrinsically on the boundary, which have the following properties. Which have the following properties. Okay, so this is just some unitary operator generated by her machine, and this S can be some real parameter. And then this G, the generator have the following properties. Say it involves both R and L degree with freedom, as I emphasized. If you want to describe new phoning observers, you must have that. And the second is that this G is actually the spectrum is bounded from below. Okay, so must. Below okay, it must have a positive spectrum. So we elaborate on this point a little bit later, but so right now this is just a feature, okay. And now, if you act this evolution operator, so we call this evolution operate, say, on the field in the right region, say this X is a point in the right region. So this, say, this is a Bach field, say some scalar field in the right region. So if you act by this And then you can show that the result of this action is actually can take it inside Horizon for sufficiently large S. And in particular, the action of this US show sharp signatures of horizon. When you close the horizon, there's a sharp signature. And also, this US can be used to generate this future and past region. This future and past region, say from this right and left region, say in the black hole space-time. So let me be a little bit more, yeah, and with this feature, so this S parameter then can be interpreted as infon in time. Okay, interpreted info in time. So let me be a little bit more specific, give you an explicit example. So if you do this for BTZ, you can actually work out such a unitary transformation explicitly. And so suppose you, yeah, I will not write down this explicit form, but now suppose we act it, say, on the scalar field from the right region. And then you find, then say, say, start s equal to zero, you evolve. And you find that there's actually a non-zero, yeah, there's a s zero greater than zero, such that for s smaller than zero, this evolved operator remains, say, in the CFTR. Say in the CFTR. But then there's a critical value of this S0. So once you cross S0, and then this involved operate now involves both CFTR and CFT lines. Okay. So this is precisely what you want when you try to cross the horizon. Before you cross the horizon, you say, well, for S smaller than S0, and then you only involve the right degree of freedom. But once you cross the horizon, going to the future, we Horizon going to the future region, and you have both CFT R and CFTL. And the crossing the horizon is reflected in this sharp jump. Okay, essentially, there's a sharp jump in the operator in this evolved operator at S equal to S zero. And so we call this a signature of the Sharp right. And this is actually something you can define for general quantity. For general quantum systems without worrying about gravity, so take two quantum systems, and if you can construct such a US, and if such S0 exists, and then we can say actually such a series, no matter whether we know, say, a long gravity dual, and we can say such a series have a sharp emergent variety. And so we call these two series causally connected. And once you cause the connection, Okay. And once you close the fly, then the DC will become connected. Any questions? Yeah, can I ask a question? Can you hear me? Yeah. Does this sharpness, is that a large end thing or is it? Right, right. That's a very good question. I'm going to discuss that. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, this is a key question I'm going to discuss. Can I ask another question? Maybe related to it is in this. Maybe related to it is in this example here, are you talking about BTZ on the line or BTZ on at finite size on the circle? On the circle. On the circle. Okay. Okay. So then the finite end question is even more relevant. Okay. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, but even on the infinite nine, you still need infinite net. Yeah. Thanks. Okay, good. Good. Yeah. Just wait a little bit. I will talk about this issue of valid and infinite net. So this x0, actually, if you So, this S0 actually, if you really act on, say, for scalar fields in the BTZ geometry, and then actually have a simple geometric meaning. So, let's just consider the Krushka coordinates, say, for the block, for the black hole. Here, just draw the Kruska axis. And say, suppose your initial point have value u0 and v0 for the Kruska coordinates. Yeah, this zero should be subscript. And then it turns out this S0 is precisely the malice value. Is precisely the malice value of u0. So u0 is precise the null distance, the crucial log distance of this initial point to the even horizon, say along this u direction. And say in particular, if this initial point is close to the horizon, okay, say if this x is very close to the horizon, and then you actually find that this transformation is actually a local transformation. And the only thing it does is just And the only thing does is just does a crucial law translation, just translate this point by a value S along this U direction, okay, by value S. But if you have a general X, say it's some general point away from the horizon, actually transformation is non-local. But non-local, but in a way, we should respect the causal structure. Yeah, so it's a so what you get is a smeared operator, but this smeared operator actually respects the line. actually respect the lifecump of the original point and so respect the postal structure. So let me just give you an example. So you can consider, say if you start a field in the right with phi r at point x1, and then evolve by this operator, then take a consider the computator with another field, phi L in the in the left region. Okay, there are many lines here, but this UB axis should be understood as a horizon. Okay, this orange. Orange lines. And turns out that this combinator is zero as smaller than this u1 plus u2. Essentially, precisely, you have to enter the life quantum of x2 in order for this computator to belong to. Okay. Yeah. Anyway, so this is just to show that even the evolution is non-local, but actually it strict obeys. Obey the causality. And also, there's another regime. Actually, this transformation greatly simplifies. And this is in the regime which you can see that this scalar field to have very large mass. And then you can do WKB wave function in the bulk, etc. And then in the large mass minute, suppose we can see the zero momentum in the spatial direction, say for the BTZ, the boundary will be a CFT on. BTZ, the boundary will be a CFT on the circle. So let's consider the zero momentum section on the circle, okay, corresponding to average over the boundary spatial directions. So if you can see the such an average operator over spatial directions, it turns out the transformation is again local. So take this phi from point X to a new point phi Xs. And this Xs actually have a simple transformation in terms of Krushka coordinates. So again, U0 and the V. So again, U0 and V0 is the crucial coordinate for the original point. And then this new point corresponding to US and Vs, U just corresponding to U0 plus S, and the V corresponding to this transformation. Okay, so this is a flow diagram to tell you how this transformation acts. So if you take a point in the R region and move in the positive X direction, so eventually it will take you through the horizon and go into the future region. And go into the future region. Okay, if you're in the left region, and then if you evolve along the left side direction, and then we'll take you to the past, to the past through the past, right? Anyway, and this is a lot of diagram which shows the constant S constant S surface. Okay, so I choose S zero to be the T equal to zero surface. And then, yeah, then this is the, yeah. Anyway, yeah, so this is just Yeah, anyway, yeah, so this is just you clearly show that this is like some kind of infalling trajectory. So, what this unitary transformation does is the following. So, we just start with your standard ADS safety dictionary applied, say, to the right region and the left region. So, you have a bulk reconstruction. So, you write the bulk region operators in terms of ATR and the left. CFTR and the left region operator in terms of CFTL. So we start with this picture and then we add this US and then actually that give you the full, in some sense give you the full causal diagram for the black hole. And I should also mention that each such US actually is a really emergent informing time. Such an informal time is actually not unique. As I'm going to mention later, there are actually an infinite number of choices. Number of choices. I just discussed one of the simplest choices. So now let me tell you how do we actually construct such an operator. So before discussing actually how to construct such a US, let me just make some general remarks on the general descriptions of infony observers and the Horizon emergence. Okay. So earlier I say I introduced this unitary operator which have these two properties. So involve both R and L due to freedom. Say, you move both R and L degree to freedom, and the spectrum is unbounded. So, actually, I would like to argue these are the necessary conditions, yeah, minimal necessary conditions for any kind of description for infalling evolution. Okay, so this number one, I already mentioned that you need this R and L equals freedom. So, why do we need this operator to be bounded from V dot? It won't be long. So there are two considerations, two kinds of related considerations for it. So the first one is that if you interpret this G, say the eigenvalue of G as the say energy for some family of informing observers, and then we want such informing observers before they hit the singularity, they should have well-defined quantum mechanics. Okay, if they have well-defined quantum mechanics, then they're Hamiltonian better to be bounded from below. Better to be bounded from below. Okay. And so this is from the first consideration. And secondly, just purely from a geometric point of view, we want such an evolution to generate a time-like evolution. Okay, you want to learn some kind of time-like trajectory. And so we want to distinguish between some generators which generate, say, some space-like evolution. So we know that for space-like evolution, say, if you say a model. Say, if you say a momentum, the spectrum is unbounded on both sides. Okay, so in order to generate the time-like evolution, I think it's also important. We think it's also important for the G to be unbounded. Hong, can you clarify when you talk about this G? Yeah. Does it include the mass of the black hole, or is it something where if you're in the pure thermofield double, you think that it's zero? You think that it's zero? No, this is not zero. This is actually, yeah, I'm going to talk about this G a little bit, a little bit more specific. Here, I'm just saying, let's assume such a G exists, and this would be the condition we should impose on this. I mean, because it's certainly true that you can create a particle which locally has positive energy in the bulk and it lowers the ADM energy, right? That was in my talk. Yeah, yeah. So, but it doesn't look. But it doesn't lower it by something of order the mass of the black hole, right? So I would certainly believe it's positive on the scale of it shouldn't be bigger than, you know, on scales, you know, if you're just if you're talking about operators that decrease the mass of the black hole a little bit, sure, it's positive. Right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, let me just clarify. This is unrelated to the Hamiltonian. Yeah. Yeah, this is unrelated to the Hamiltonian. Yeah, this is unrelated to the Hamiltonian we use to measure the boundary image. So this is more like some kind of informal image. Infoning energy, so yeah, I just proper energy for infoning also, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, okay, good, and then I will not do it here, but then you can show just based on this minimal assumption, and then a sharp horizon, which I described earlier, this kind of sharp signature for horizon, that existence of such a non-zero, non-zero S0. Say before S0, you have just in the RB. You have just in the R region, but then cross S0, suddenly the next degree freedom jumps in. And the existence of this sharp S0 actually only exists in the Lagian image. Okay. And then there's no sharp horizon in fact. And so I will not give the proof here, even though the proof is very simple. But let me just give you a related example, which I think people are all familiar with, and intuition just can be understood. And the intuition just can be understood from this simple example. And so let's consider just a QFT in the Minkowski space-time. And then let's just imagine this Minkowski style separated by the Windeler, by the standard light column into these Winderler regions. Then it's the standard statement that the Minkowski vacuum, say, for this QFT, can be interpreted as a thermofield double state for the right and the left window patches. A window of patches. But actually, strictly speaking, this statement is only correct if you disquitize this QFT and put the theory on the lattice. And strictly speaking, this statement is incorrect for the continuum limits. But normally for our purpose, this distinction is not that important. But actually, for our purpose, actually, it is very important. It is very important. So, here I want to emphasize some fundamental differences between this discrete and the continuum case. So, let's just contrast them. So, in the discrete case, we have local Hilbert spaces associated with the left and the right region. So, if you have lattice, then of course you have local Hilbert spaces. But in the continuum case, there's not. This is the standard story for quantum field theory. And here, there's a finite in tangled entropy between Meo and Wright. Entropy between L and right because you have introduced the lattice cutoff, and here, of course, in the continuum limit, the entangled entropy becomes infinite. And here, the modular operator can be factorized in terms of the left and the right, but here you cannot factorize them. And most importantly for our purpose is that in the discrete case, there's no sharp light. Okay, so if you have a lattice, so if you evolve your infoing, evolve your mean cost. Involving, evolving, you mean costly Hamiltonian a little bit, and then there's always a tail which can take the commutator from two operators deep inside the nightcomb to be non-zero, even though that tail is tiny, but there's no strict light column in the discrete case. But there is a sharp light column in the continuum case. Yeah, of course, we know. And all these differences can be summarized. Can be summarized into one simple mathematical statement. All these differences, all these physical differences actually can be a bit attributed to a fundamental mathematical difference. It's that in the discrete case, if you look at the operated algebra in one of the window region, and that's a type I volume algebra. But in the continuum case, if you look at the operated algebra in one of the window regions, In one of the windowed region, that's actually a type 31 Molyman algebra. So, I will not go into detailed definition of the Molymer algebra or the classification of type 1, type 3, 1, and just emphasize this difference between them. And the type 1 is more like you have ordinary quantum mechanical situation. And the type 3 one comes from where you have a local region in the quantum field, in the continuum quantum fields. Continuum quantities. So now let's go back to this black hole example. So now, if you look at the bounded operator algebra in the boundary C of T, okay, over all space-time, here I'm set over all space-time, not only local region over all space-time, of bounded operator algebra in the boundary C of T, and that's type 1 at finite end. Okay, you have ordinary Hilbert space, and all the operated algebra is type 1. Operate algebra is type one. Okay. But we, yeah, as I mentioned earlier, you can show that the sharp bar horizon is actually not possible for a type one monument algebra. Okay, so we argue actually there is actually an emerging type III monument algebra in the Lagian image, and that is responsible for this emergence of a sharp prison under the interior. Okay. And with a sharp risen, then you of course you can talk about. Sharp resident in your course, you can talk about sharp material. Otherwise, you can not really talk about interior or exterior. So, there's a natural candidate for this emerging type 31 volume algebra. Let me just mention it. But unfortunately, I have to use a little bit of mathematical language, but I think it's still intuitive enough. So, in a large limit, you can define single trace operators in the CFT exactly. So, let's look at Directory. So let's look at the algebra generated by single choice operators, say, in the CFTR. And you can also define a similar algebra for the CFTL. And now you take the take your summer for your double state or just take your thermal density operator. And now let's construct using this algebra the G and S Hilbert space say for this algebra of respect to this thermal density object. Okay. So he reaches. Object okay, so heuristically, this Hilbert space is the Hilbert space of small excitations around these thermal states, okay, because of the single trace operators, so they corresponding to small excitations. And there's an iso vacuum in this GNS Hilbert space, which corresponds to your thermal density operator, but this vacuum in this GNS Hilbert is actually the pure space. And then, and then this original single trace operator added by our representation. Open algebra representation in this gene SQL space. And similarly, there's a similar ML corresponding to the representation of AL in this same gene SQL space. So the conjecture is that this ML and the MR, they're types of remote. Okay, so I emphasize here, both of them are defined for the full boundary space-time. Okay, if you look at the full CFT operators defined for the full space-time, they are type one. Are type one, but if you concentrate to the algebra for the single trace operator, we argue they shouldn't be type two, and there's a this is a very simple reason they should be type three just from the standard duality. So in the block, we have, if you can see the excitation around the black hole space-time, and then we can define the fork space with small excitations. So you have the hotter-Hawking vacuum, and then you have the operated algebra associated. Algebras associated with the right region and the left region, I call them F tilde R and M kilde R and M kilde R. And then the standard ADSQ around the internal black hole then can be formulated as the equivalence, say, between this GNS Hilbert space and the Fogg space and the Mark Hopper space and the Hart of Hawking vacuum and this GNS vacuum and the corresponding operating algorithms. Okay, of course, this identification, just the identification of Identification of the operated algebra is just the standard buck width construction for the right and left regions. And this MR and ML are corresponding to some quantum field theory in the block in the in the in the local space-time region, and they say they they should be type 3, they should be type 3, 1. So very like to this MR and ML, they also type 3. And M L they also catch. Okay. Good. So now we have this duality. So M tilde R is dual to M tilde M R M tilde L is M L. So we emphasized earlier, starting from this picture, if you want to generate a full black hole space-time, you did this US to take you behind the horizon, etc. And it turns out finding this US just boil your stun, finding appropriate. Finding appropriate volume sub edge of this of this boundary operated edge. Okay, so let me explain this why. So this uses this technique called half-sided modular translation. So yeah, so the detail is not important, but the general picture is very simple. So suppose that m is a volume algebra and you have a vector omega, which is cyclic. factor omega which is cyclic and separating for this algebra m okay and then suppose they also exist the volume sum algebra n of m say with the following properties say say this uh uh this vector is also cyclic for n and if you do a modular flow for n for one-sided uh for t smaller than zero so theta m is the modular uh operator for the for this algebra m For this algebra m and if you do the modular flow of n for t smaller than zero, so for half-sided, okay, and this still belongs to n, don't take you outside. Okay, suppose you have a sub-algebra satisfying this property, okay? And then you can show from a theorem, from a number of theorems by Botches and Westbrook, and then can we show that for type 3, one algebra, then there exists a unitary group US with the form. A unitary group US with the following properties, precisely what we want. US and this G is bounded from the okay. And in particular, this US leaves this vector invariant. And so for any such kind of sub-edge for n, so essentially you generate a new emergent time. Okay, because now you have a generator which, yeah, this is g is funded from below. So this is. From below, so this is qualified as a Hamiltonian, you say. Okay, and in particular, if you act this operator along the s smaller than zero direction, on this original algebra, it takes the algebra within itself and including take the algebra to any safe for particular. Yeah, anyway, this is not important, but if you take the evolution for s greater than zero, actually it takes m outside itself. So now I'll go into back to this internal black old case. Sorry, Hannah. Can you comment on how unique this is? Like, is there only one G that does this? Right, if you fix if you fix omega and if you fix omega and fix the n, then there's one g but but that's I mean yeah, I said we mentioned nature actually there's an infinite number of omega you can choose infinite number and you can choose and so actually they And you can choose, and it's actually the infinite number of G you can choose. Yeah. Good. So let's go back to the internal black hole. So one side of C of T is on, say, R times S T minus one. Here we can see the two dimensions, so just R times S1. And the full operator algebra is type one. But then we argue there's a single trace operator algebra is type three. So now we just take this M I mentioned earlier for this half-sided module flow to be the, say, the sided module flow to be the say the the operator a single-sided single trace operator associated with CFTR okay and so this we conjecture to be 31 and then in particular in the Lagian limit each single trace operator from the boundary point of view is a generalized free field and so this algebra is actually generated just by infinite number of generalized free fields okay you can Okay, you can also consider the perturbative corrections while open corrections. The story does not change. So, this generalized free field structure actually is very important. So, this makes it possible to actually find explicit Sawyer algebra, which also we can find explicitly US using this general electric field structure. Okay, so now let me just make one comment. So, if you have a standard So, if you have a standard quantum field theory, if you can see the coastal diamonds, and if you can see the, say, two Cauchy slice of this causal diamond, and I can see the operator algebra associated with these two Cauchy slices, and in the QFT, they're equivalent. Okay, just because of the evolution, the one of can be expressed in terms of the other. But this is not the case for generalized free field theory, because for the generalized free field theory, the Hamiltonian. Theory, the Hamiltonian which generates the evolution, is not part of the algebra. Okay, there's actually no equation of motion to take A1 to A2. So this two algebra is actually inequality. Okay, this two algebra are inequality. So this then gives rise to many, many more possibilities in the Lagerian limit. Again, this is only possible in the Lagerian limit than you would have at the finite. Okay, so this is precisely. Okay, so this is precisely we are going to take advantage of take the advantage of. So now let's consider: say, suppose this is a boundary space time, and this horizontal direction is the circular direction, it's a circle we identify on two sides, and the vertical direction is time, and then we can consider the operator algebra for the full space-time, so that's our M. So that's our M. And then we take N to be the operator algebra from the single trace operator defined up to some time. Okay, up to some time. Okay, not cover to infinite time, but cover all spatial directions, but after some time in your boundary time. So if you in the finite nQFT, then these two algebra x are equivalent. But as I mentioned, the Najan image because there will be a But as I mentioned, in La J n image, because you have this generalized free field three structure, and actually this n algebra and the full operated algebra, they are in equivalent. And now this n can be used to generate such a US. Okay, but actually if you find the such a US, if you work through this half-sided modular inclusion story, then you find actually this is a strongly carpet problem. You actually need to solve. Problem. You actually need to solve the quantum field responder theory at strong coupling at finite temperature. Yeah, this we can now solve, but then we can now still use the duality to do a Bach calculation. So we conjecture that the entanglement watch for this n sub-algebra, okay, is actually dual to the operator in this region of the box space-time. Bach space-time. Okay, so this n-tilde region of the box space-time is essentially the causal wedge associated with this n region. But we now conjecture this is also its entanglement watch. And in particular, this entanglement wedge is not defined by extremal surface. Okay, because of this generalized free field structure on the boundary. Anyway, with this block identification of the entire A block identification of the entanglement watch, then we can actually work out this US explicitly. And this US just determined by the phase shift of the fields near the horizon. Anyway, we're not going to details. And then you can just work out this US explicit. And then you get this kind of flow pattern destroyed. Okay, this corresponding to one choice, corresponding to you roughly translation by this crucial. Translation by this Kruska U. You can also consider, say, another algebra which you cover the full space-time until to some point in the active time direction. Okay. And cover all the future time. And then that can be conjectured to be dual to this part of the box space-time. And then that leads to a Khrushchev V flow. And then we leads to flow pattern, say, roughly along the V, the Krushka V direction. The Krushka V directions. Okay. Yeah. So let me just mention there are infinite number of, say, this kind of vector you can choose, and infinite number of n you can choose from. For example, here, I can here I can, I don't have to take the spatial dependence to be straight. I can consider some weaker lines here. Okay, I can see some weaker lines here. And that leads to a different subway algebra. And that should lead to some other type. And that should lead to some other kind of bulk evolution, some other kind of bulk evolution. And so, so they actually infinitely also many choices of this state. So you can act by ultra on the left. You can also act by uritary on the right, et cetera. You can do many things. Okay. So let me just conclude. So here we show this kind of flow structure. You can, there's a unitary operator. You can take a boundary observer. Observer can take you behind the horizon, essentially generate the future and past region. But this flow is finite because you will hit the singularity at some point. Okay, so now let's give a interpretation of this, a physical interpretation of the singularity. So the singularity essentially is the signal that this emerging type 31 structure cannot be extended arbitrary. Okay, somehow it shows that somehow this emerging large That somehow this emerging Magene structure. So, this is the semi-classical way to tell you actually this emergent type 31 structure, okay, is this singularity. And also, yeah, let me see what time. How much time do I have? You are running out of time. Oh, okay. Five minutes, yeah. Okay, okay, so sorry, let me just skip about this part. And also, there are many kinds of future directions you can talk about. Future directions you can talk about. Because I want to shamelessly advertise a lot of work which we just finished with two outstanding graduate students. By the way, I want to mention this work with Sam. Sam is on the market right now and he's really excellent. And I want to advertise a lot of paper which we finished recently with Which we finished recently with two other outstanding graduate students, and Shire Hang is my graduate student at MIT. And John Akuda Flam is the graduate student at the University of Chicago working with Shinsei Yu. Anyway, so the idea of this paper is very simple. I can summarize in five minutes. So if you consider the entanglement, so if you consider the evaporating black hole. So if you consider evaporating black hole and you consider the correlations among degrees freedom within the Hawking radiation. And normally we believe that before the page time, there's no entanglement among the different components of the Hawking radiation. But in this paper, we show that for phylactimatic black hole, actually there's a new time scale before the page time when they are actually already significant in time. When there are actually already significant entanglement correlations within the radiation, and so this carton diagram shows this. Say here, Tp is the page time. So at the page time, your mutual information, if you consider mutual information between different components of your radiation, and then you find that the mutual information starts to be non-zero only after the page time. But if you consider the entanglement of activity between different parts of the radiation, Part of the radiation. And then you find this will develop a volume contribution much earlier than the page time. Okay, and this entanglement activity signals there's a significant entanglement correlation already in the Hawking radiation. Okay, let me just stop here. Thank you. Thank you, Hong. So, questions for Hong? Hong, maybe you said. Maybe you said this, but let me just see if I understand. So, in the Rindler example, is your G is it equal to H minus P? No, no, it's not. So, it's not just a translation in the null? Because what's for the for the you're asking for the Windler? Yeah, in the Rindler example, is G equal to H minus B? I'm trying to think of a positive operator that preserves. This is the ADS Windler example or the Minkowski-Windler example. The Minkowski-Rindler example. Minkowski Rinlars. Yeah, we told it exactly just P plus. Okay, yeah, so H minus P. Yeah. Right, right, right. Yeah, P minus or P minus, yeah, whichever, yeah, H plus or minus P. Okay, right, right, right, right, right. Okay, and so then you're trying to set up the sort of the bulk analog of that near the near the bifurcate horizon, right? That's right. Yeah, so here the horizon is precisely also that, but away from the horizon is no longer that, something very complicated. Yeah, okay, thank you. Yeah, Dan? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I guess one question. So, if I understood correctly, your construction of sharp horizons relied on generalized free fields. So does that mean that if you did one over n corrections perturbatively, you'd lose the sharp horizon? Is that something you could even look for in the bulk? Right, no, no, actually we believe that if you look for one of the turfed corrections, the sharpest horizon should be there. The sharpest horizon should be there. Because when you do perturbative corrections, you don't actually destroy this generalized free field structure. Yeah, when you include one-off corrections in the boundary theory, then you get like generalized interacting field theory. It's actually not, you still don't have the ordinary quantum field theory structure. Yeah, this kind of statement is still true. Even when you include one-off corrections, still. When corrections, still, A1 will not be equal to B. Yeah, so this construction will still survive. Okay, thanks. Mark? Yeah, I guess I had a couple of questions, but combined into one question about sort of how this generalizes. So the first thing would be if you had something which is, I guess, back reaction. I guess back reacted or not close to the two-sided black hole. Does everything just go through? Are you using any particular features of the thermofield double type state specifically? Right. Yeah, yeah. So to work out this explicit transformation, you do need to use the thermal field double. The thermal field double because other more general examples are uncapable, but the general procedure does not depend on whether you work with a thermal field double. Okay. Yeah. And actually, maybe if do you have any comments about single-sided cases and what whether you could use this to learn something about behind horizons? Yeah, yeah, I think the single side. The single side should be similar. Say, if you buy this Raju and Pavadimus kind of story, and then you can do the similar construction for their mirror operator. Now, of course, this kind of mirror operator should be justified more precisely in their story. But I think actually there is a way to justify them using this genetic humbler space and this emerging natural. And this emerging nitrogen structure. I think that step can also be made more precise, and then one can actually give a rigorous construction, even for the single-sided black case. Alex? Could you comment a little bit on what happens with one over lambda corrections? So even if you're still at large n and you have GFFs, you know, maybe your gravity theory is not quite exact. Your gravity theory is not quite exactly GR. And then, well, I don't know, but you might expect that maybe this notion of sharpness disappears a little bit or gets smeared out. Are you using implicitly that you're saturating the bound on chaos somewhere? No, no, we are not using that. I think this structure itself only depends on logien. So, of course, it's yeah, so at least from the from the structure and from the constructing. Structure and from the construction itself, we don't use anywhere the weather the strong coupling is important. But you do need to use the structure that the series is chaotic enough that this emerging type 31 structure. Say, suppose you take the boundary, say take the input for Sobaya-Miel theory on S. Take the input for Subway and Miel Siri on S3, okay, on the sphere. And if you do that theory at a finite temperature for free theory for lambda equal to zero, you will not have this emergence at Type 31 structure. Because there you have a discrete spectrum. For free series, the spectrum remains discrete, etc. But if you have a fine, even finite small coupling, but if non-zero, okay, and then Non-zero, okay? And then we believe, it's generally believed that C will become chaotic when you get this sufficiently high energy. And then I believe this rewinds properly emerge. Yeah, so I don't think coupling is essential, but we do need to not to be too interglobal in order to have this structure. I see. Thanks. Is there any question from the room? Room, no, okay. If not, thank Hong again, and it's time for coffee.
