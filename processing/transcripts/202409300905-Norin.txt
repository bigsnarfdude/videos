Thank you very much for inviting me here. And I will speak about recent progress on various variations of Halpegger's conjecture. I don't have any amazing new results to report, or certainly not my or certainly not buy uh amazing results. But uh I want to kind of uh map out the landscape uh of uh various problems related to Harbour's conjecture that might be uh more approachable. And also it's mostly open problem based or present a bunch of open problems. So Heidegger's conjecture, right, it's one of the central conjectures. Central conjectures, which led to a lot of progress in graph coloring and graph structure. It says that if a graph cannot be properly colored with two colors, then it has a complete marina of simple signal versus and so it's very difficult in particular because it generalizes the Generalizes the four colour theorem, which is roughly equivalent to the case T equals four. And at the moment, I think the only reasonable hope of resolving eaten food is if it's false. But nonetheless, there is a lot of interesting things that can be done about it by trying to relax or modify various things Various things in the statement and see what happens. And pretty much every word in the statement can be changed that leads to a line of research. For example, right, I'm not going to change the literature. Instead of proving this for every graph, one can try proving. Every graph, one can try proving it for graph classes. For example, it's true for line graphs, which is a zero of red signal from 2004. And that's good strength. One can strengthen the conjecture by By thinking about analogues of this result for directed graphs and hypergraphs. And that's been done. And these are, I mean, they are pretty close, turns out, the problems, to the original conjecture. One can relax the condition. Can relax the condition that the graph that we want to find is complete. And that's one direction that I want to talk more about. So find some sparser graph on G plus 1 vertices. One can change the notion of minor. There, it seems like there is no, as far as I know, there are no very good meaningful relaxations. But there are a lot of strengthenings to consider. For most of them, the conjecture is false, but some are interesting, so one can see. Some are interesting, so one can think of subdivisions, odd minors. And there is a new notion by Swedenburg and David Wood of dominating models, which is again I want to mention. One can relax the notion of properly colored to talk about defective and And clustered colorings. And again, a lot of work has been done on this in the last decade that led to a lot of interest in theory. And finally, probably the most natural thing is one can use more colours. You want to ask, suppose we. You want to ask, suppose we everything else stays the same, we want to properly color a graph with no complete minutes. Whereas on t plus one vertices, you're allowed to use more colours. So f of t colours. A fractional colour. That's a way you could phrase. Put a line for it. Yeah. Yeah, uh, that is uh, you have a result with a factor of two, right? Oh, oh, yeah, that's true. Okay, so let me talk about some estimate as much as I have time of the variations indicated in red, starting with the last. I mean, the last most explored second pair, we changed up both colours. And somehow, I mean, this is the thing which will be repeated in other variations that I want to consider. Somehow the first most natural thing is to use details. is to use degeneracy. So let C of T be minimum such that every graph G with, I'm assuming non-null, I guess in case there is some awkwardness with null graphs with minimum degree at least C of T has K T. KT minus. Then, so if C of T is defined like this, it implies that if G has no KT minor, then kinetic number of G is at most C of T because you can find a vertex of degree at most. A vertex of degree at most C of T minus 1 deleted and go by induction. And so C of 2 is 1, C of 3 is 2, so 2 4 minus, it's enough to have meaning with 1. C of 4 is 3. So all the easy cases of Easy cases of Hardwicker conjecture just follow from this computation of meaning. CO5 is unfortunately six, so that's the case corresponding to focal ratio. So you cannot yeah. Here, just using this bound starts being insufficient. And in general, T of T is set of T, road log T which is so bounds in different direction and been done by various sources. The La Vega Costage Trank Thomas in early 1900s. And so for a while, this was the best bound on the number of colours that is needed to cover the rust with no KT minor. And then more recently, starting with Zisha and myself, and then Myself, and then with Luke and Luke and Michelle, Luke Posto and Michelle Tolkuch improve this bound. And I want to say a few words about the direction and the best result here. So the idea is the following. So let G be a minor minimum minimal graph with some kinetic number I don't know some function of T then I mean one thing that we know is that G is another good form of here it's G is principally connected and then what one can do is to try to Is to try to make cheap denser. So try to contract it to improve the density with the hope eventually to get to G root log T and getting T minor. So then either G has a denser minor or she can Or she contains a subgraph which is hard to compress and it's fairly small. So, or she contains H such that minimum degree of H, let's say minimum degree of G over minimum degree of H is not too big. And also, And also, H is pretty dense. So, the number of vertices of H over minimum degree of H are both not too large. Small. So, that's the general principle, and in this direction, the best theorem is by By Michel Del Guft and Luke Postel from three years ago. And somehow it, I mean, it has a lot of ideas beyond that, but it pushes this principle as far as it can go. I think it says the following. So let G be V a graph with no kT minor. So, yeah, let me get the parameters right. So, there exists some absolute constant C which will appear to be zero. So, I have a graph with no K T Mi and And there exists some path H of G and some number S such that H has no Ks minor number of vertices of H is not much bigger than. Bigger than S, so it's at most S log S where I have some power of log S. And the following holds. Basically, Hardwig in some sense for G reduces to H. So gravatic number. So chromatic number of G over T is at most C chromatic number of H over S plus 1 for shift in case S is much larger than krimatic number. So if you're interested, how much had we got Much a cadwiger fails, so the ratio of chromatic number of the graph to the biggest minor it doesn't contain, then up to a constant factor, it suffices to look at graphs which are pretty small compared to the minors that we want. I think you should have the condition that S is at most D, otherwise it does not say much. I thought I I mean I know they do, but I thought I'm okay with the result. If S is much smaller if S is huge, then it's by symbolism. I mean if there's no reason for S to be bigger than And if there's no reason for S to be bigger than T because H is a subgraph of G. But there is nothing forbidding you from thinking S huge at the moment. This is really huge energy. Well, Zenit will imply a lot. Then this will be just constant bond. Yeah. I mean, I think it's a meaningful ethics, but I mean, if I see huge, I don't know. It was a bit dangerous. I changed his now. Why is it an ICU? Well, it implies that if G has no KT minor, then chromatic number of G is at most people of. Pigo of G log log G. So, why does it imply? So, because of a theorem of Ducher and Maniel from about 82, which says that if If G, so let me repeat it. If G has no local minor, then kramatic number of G is at most log base two of number of vertices of G over T plus two. Let's say number of vertices of G is also at least T to avoid some things. Some things times t. So this ratio that we care about, kinematic number over t is at most logarithmic in the ratio of number of vertices over t. And if we reduce the conjecture to graphs where to pairs, a graph and epsilon, for which this ratio is. Mine for which this ratio is logarithmic in the size of the minor, we get a double log. Here I again come to adding here that this is a bonus t because otherwise you will get just double logarithmic. Okay, let me hide. I I mean to uh to apply it, I need to say that S is at most G, but I need to say that S is at most G, but I can always assume it might be just for everybody. So let me, so the first open problem, I think that Michelle looks at. I don't see any room for improvement here. Like it would. Like it would be nice to maybe reduce this bound, but I don't see how one can physically do that for reasons related to random graphs. Somehow some random deaths, random graphs cannot become crossed first. But maybe there is some hope. Maybe there is some hope, and I think the next direction would be in improving the balance for small gaps, improving the Shamania. In particular, here is a concrete problem, which I don't know how hard it is. Let G a very dense graph, let's say, completely size. Sites have a number of edges of G is at least half of all possible edges. That's a lot of edges. Prove linear Hadrigg, weak Hadriga for this G, that the Hadrig number and the So and chromatic number within a constant of each other. I mean, this might be too easy if I made a mistake, but one cannot just prove hard because the graphs with independence number two, which I think fall in this range. But within a context, But within a constant, I mean, it seems to be an extreme case of a protogenity. Okay, so what else can one do in terms of improving number of colours? Well, so what happens for small t? So let me think in the setting where there is no kt minor, so no k6 minor implies that kinetic number is at most five, so hardware is true. In this case, this is the famous result of Robert Sinsi of Thomas from 93. No case seven minor. Minor implies kramatic number at most 8, okay minor implies kramatic number at most 10. These are results of Albar and Gonsalves from 2013. We tried improving this eight to this 8 to 6 should be to 7 with Daniel and Jamie to call this screen. Seems very hard. But I mean this covers the range of large T where there are good results. The range of small t where there are good results. What about medium t? So, we attempted this this summer with students Edmund Gil Ashenbasu and Neil Rauffman. And we can prove it's computerized, so I don't have a Have a general formula, but I can give you a sample of numbers. So if we have no krainium minor, then we can prove that kinetic number is at most, and now unfortunately it will be extremely undeveloped, 107. No K4 kinetic number at most At most 410. So, this is a sample of what we can do in the medium range. And most of it is doing the extremal function, right? Figuring out the value of C of G. So, second open problem, and this took us a while. There are some kind of natural methods. There are some kind of natural methods which give about 100, I don't know if you're into this meteorology, give about 160 or 170, but written it down, it's not completely clear how one could do it. So an open problem I mean, if we understand small and large cases well, how come they I mean, it's use it's a poor understanding of uh middle cases. Uh middle cases. Uh maybe show that uh if G has no K20 minor, then kinetic number of G is at most. I don't want to set the goal too too low, otherwise, but let's say 60 I mean that seems hard. And what is leverage? What is Sergey? We better use white job. It's pretty hard to see. At least for me, I've got a lot of things. Oh, okay. Okay, I'll do that. I saw that. I'll highlight open problem. Okay. So here is an open problem. No K29 show. Show grammatic number of G is at mass 60. And another autonomous distraction approximate C training. So what is the minimum degree that the NC is K20 mine? Basically, I mean, most of our work is just in this medium. Is just in this minimum degree. The proof at minimum degree is about 110 grantees K20 minor, and from this you can bring it down a little bit. Okay, so that's what I wanted to say about first direction. First direction of variations, changing the number of colours. Now, what about changing the graph that we want? Suppose we don't want to get complete graph, what kind of graph we can get? What graphs are H? Yet gas H can be guaranteed as minus if samatic number of G is at least. And let me talk about this smallest case for which we don't know the optimal result. So the chromatic number is at least six. So the collective number is at least six, then this theorem says that we guarantee k6 minor, and one cannot do much better, right? The graph could be k6. So what happens if t equals 7? Then there is a result of Kavarabayash and Toft found. From 2005, then we can either get K7, which is a right thing to get, or K44, which is a kind of a natural graph. But I mean, it feels like it's bigger than K7, but it's quite a bit sparse. It only has 16 edges and compared. Now, Jacobson. I think in 71 proved that we can guarantee K7 minus 2, which means a minor on 7 vertices and 19 edges. So this two edges mission are Uh and that's I mean that's another thing that uh uh we tried okay so I mean this is from 1971. Can we do better? Can we just get one edge missing? I cannot but there is room for improvements here still. There are two graphs on seven vertices with 19 edges and Jacobson's proof only guarantees that one of Proof only guarantees that one of them is a minor. And I mean, it's if you try this type of things, like you know that I mean, actually, there is substantial difference. So, what we can prove with Agnes with Agnes Tozznik, who's uh my s student. Student, is that we can guarantee K7B so two mission agents share vectors. So a natural open problem here is to replace this minus two by minus one, but even this is hard. But even this is hard, at least the way we did it. Here is the reason. How, let me, I'm not going to write it, but let me explain how these proofs go. In both of these cases, you can prove that average degree is under 8. So, in particular, there are lots of vertices of degree 7, and in the close neighborhood of degree 7 vertics, you find a click of... You find a click of size 5, and if you have a bunch of clicks of size 5, you can find more or less a case 75. Here, it's not quite true that average degree has to be under 8. There are three connected counterexamples. So we prove that if a graph is full connected and doesn't have this as a minor, then average degree is under equality. Abolish degrees under 80. And that is difficult because, I mean, for various reasons, in particular, we use a lot of theorems such as Polvolen's extremal function of k2, 4 minus. So, I mean, it seems like even I mean even here And improvement is a bit cost. Let me mention another theorem which is joined with Jeremy Torcot, which explores the following problem. So as I mentioned in many of the previous examples, Mentioned in many of the previous results, somehow, and even here, mostly the minimum degree is what allows you to obtain a minor, like the first approximation, this results. So we wanted to understand for which graphs H if If you have so if you don't have graph H as a minor, possibly your chromatic number is number of vertices of H minus 1, because you could be a complete graph on number of vertices of H minus 1. Now, for which graphs H just having minimum Minimum degree, which is bigger, so number of h of h minus 1, guarantees presence of h as a minus. So somehow, for which graphs h the general symbols. And here is the theorem. So let F be a family with strongly sublinear separators. Let H be a graph in this family such that H is bipartite and number of vertices of H is large. Is large, so at least some function f of depending on the family and max degree of H. So H is very large compared to its maximum degree and particular families that I'm considering. What are strong subject separators? So I'll mention it, I guess, at that. Let me mention it now. So this just means that for For let me assume that, so in this definition, first I assume monotonicity, so it's monotone, and for every graph you can, there is a separator, so there exists a set of vertices of size strongly sublinear, so number of vertices to the one minus epsilon. Minus epsilon, so that if you delete it, each part is at most two-thirds each component of size and positive. This is, I mean, this is some structural, a nice structural sparsity condition. So it's not just, so not only it implies bounded average degree, but basically it means bounded average degree are nicely not expanded. Not expand. Plainly, I mean, perhaps in a minor closed class, certainly haven't, but it's lots of lots of claims. So if H is like this, then and let G be a graph such that meaning degree of G is at least a number of vertices of H minus one, then H is a minor of G. H is a mind model. So having minimum degree number of values of H minus 1 is enough to guarantee H as a minor for this family of graphs, which, I mean, it's a very, very sparse family compared to what we've been finding before. But I mean, one But I mean one thing about this theorem is that in some sense it's essentially tight. So you cannot drop the transition that F, that H belongs to a family of Stony sublinear separators. You cannot replace it by, say, bounded max degree or bounded h degree. You cannot remove the continuity. You cannot remove the condition that max degrees bounded completely. You cannot remove the condition that ages bipartite. It has to have... There are bad examples with chromatic number about 9. You cannot replace mean GB by average GB. So pretty much everything qualitatively is typically. Everything qualitatively is tight. But I mean, if I want to know, a problem related to this is something that we tried but couldn't decide if this true if H is a tripod, three colour. It might be true. So the class, I mean, centered this pseudo somehow but Theorem is somehow best optimal. It's not quite true. Maybe, and I think it's likely, that the class of graphs can be pushed a little bit further that if this graph H has chromatic number three or four, this is still true. And so that's kind of a second direction in the two regimes, where we can either try to get the minor best possible on this small kinetic number or with large when they're working with large curves. There is another direction. Direction where we similar to this, we are not trying to get a particular minor, but we are just trying to get some minor of human density. And there's been also work on this, and there you can get much more density. But let me, in the interest of time, not do this because I want to mention one more. Mention uh one topic uh uh which I think is uh very nice, but which has this uh uh dominated models of Elengros and Wood. So it's a definition by uh Fraser and David, but let me I kind of motion to explain where it comes from. To explain where it comes from, so I don't know. So let me just define what it means to have a complete graph as a line. So a KT model in T is a sequence of connected subgraphs. T1, T2, etc. T of these connected subcuffs of paramise this joint such that there is a niche between the two. There is an edge between any two of them. So for all i there is an for all i and j between 1 and 3 there is an edge from some vertex of t j to some vertex of t. So some vertex of g j Of G. J is adjacent to some vertex of T. So this is just a definition of what it means to have KT as a minor. I'm trying to act, right? I'm trying to. I'm trying to get KT model. This is a definition of a mine. You have a mine if and only if you have a KT model. Now, here is a nice way of relaxing the notion of a minor, for which Harvey is true. Let's say race connected. Right, that seems like a natural variation. But now, unfortunately, Harbig is trivial. You color your graph by gradient so that every vertex gets a color as small as possible. Then either you can do it with t minus one colors or you find Find the sets of first colour, etc., T colour, so that if a vertex belongs to Tj, then it couldn't have received smaller colour, so it has a neighbor in every Ti with smaller inputs. So that's trivially true. But more is true, right? It's true. Alright? It's true that every vertex of Tj is adjacent to some vertex of Tsar. This is still true. Well, let's bring connect it back. That's what dominating KT models of universe and mood are. And a natural question relating to these dominating models is dominating Hadweger's conjecture, which says don't state as a conjecture, but Something tempting is to say that if kinetic number of if G has no dominating kg plus one model than kinetic number of G is at most And a natural open problem, which I mean, please solve it, is disproof. I mean, how can this be true? Is it true for smaller things? Yeah, so I'll talk about it again. I mean, we know now. I mean, so we've got. Know now. I mean, so we worked with it for the last month with Antonio, Julia, and Jane. And we proved a bunch of small things, but all positive. Which is kind of hard. I mean, this is much stronger than hardware. I mean, why would that be true? Can you say the bunch of small thing? Yeah. Okay. So that would be the last thing I said. I just want to say. I just want to say one more thing. I mean, while, I mean, so this seems, I mean, that kind of naturally follows from colouring, right? One can also just play with words, right? Change things. One can also try to change. Now, we changed one sound to everything. What if we changed the other sound to everything? But then, just as a sanity check, then it's very false. I then just subcurve. So. So, okay, so now what's what's known about us. So here is let's look at the at the corresponding Minimum degree, right? So let CTG be the minimum be minimum such that every graph G with this minimum degree is at least the cis minimum degree contains dominating KT model. Contains domination takes you up. Then so CG two is one, CG three is two, CG four is three. That's Three that inversion would. In particular, Hadwegers holds all the easy cases of Hadwegas still true. C5G is still six, but that doesn't imply the for collection. The correspondent, I mean the very hand. It's a very active and in general what is the magnitude of C T D it's at least one minus little of one C log G base two, I guess so we So we, and that's one place of suspicion. The Habegas conjecture comfortably holds for random graphs. The dominating Habegas conjecture holds for random graphs not quite just, but within a factor of two. The biggest dominating model is only twice as big as a chromatic number for random cars. So there's not a lot of room there a late. Of who they are already. So there are random graphs which have on T log T vertices, just G and one half, they have a chromatic number of, I guess, about T over 2 and dominating models of size T. And at most, 2 to the T minus 2, that's a boundary. That's the bound that Fred and David had, and we can prove that it's a big O of T log squared C. So this is Antonia, me, you here. And Jane. So it's not that bad. Just by extremal function, it's not, it seems to be barely true, but it's also not outrageously false. It's within some logarithmic factor. And so let me finish this. I guess two more small things. So the next one One, the next open case of this, so it's true for t at most three again by the inverse, could be for t equals four. What we can prove, so this is proof is that if kramatric number of G is at least Is at least five. We want to have dominating K5 model. We can almost get it. I mean, it's not that far from being tall. We can get G contains dominating K5, but without one of the edges, I think the last H. The last h. But let me just write k5 minus. So we can get k5 minus an h. It kind of matters which h, but some h. And the final result that's related to relaxation of the notion of hapica, so there are these theorems that one can improperly call One can improperly color any graph with no creative plus one minor with two colors, where improperly means either bounded degree in the colour class, a bounded maximum degree, or bounded component size. Bounded component size, this is very hard, and that's who you would talk about that. But the last result, what I want to say is that the defective result is true for dominating GT models. So if G has no dominating KT model, then G is defectively Defectively T minus 1 colorable, which means the following. There exists some big number, let me call it f of t, such that Vg can be partitioned. Into 2 minus 1 part so that maximum degree of G induced on a part is bound. Is it most curved? So since Uh so this theorem uh if it's a uh theorem of uh uh for KT Minus it's a theorem of Katie Edwards, uh, Kang, uh, Sun Gil Paul I mean so it's been uh it's been proven uh and uh so it holds all So it holds also for dominating H models and one cannot improve T minus one is touch, even for minus. So yeah, so that's the last thing I wanted to show you. I mean, I think that's an outrageous conjecture, right? I mean, so far, everything we have points towards in the positive direction. I mean, and if it's not, I mean, and if it's not, I mean, if it's not false, that's a whole kind of new business. I can start proving things. You don't go into hardware existing. Okay, that's all I wanted to say. So we can continue maybe with some questions or thoughts or comments together in the tool that you shake in. Do you have any equivalent of two shaping yet for the minute? Yeah, it's just a proof goes. That's what it's better than linkages. Do you have any hope that compression style argument might also work? Well, I mean, I don't know how to make it. I mean, we need link, I mean, linkages don't work, right? You cannot just link a bit to a bit and have a dominate, I mean, dominating. I mean, the fact that, I mean, it's I mean it's much more awkward to work I mean it's a I mean I I I I mean I really I mean my I have strong feelings towards this being false I mean I feel like this being true I mean it spoils a bit hardware for me I mean it gives a I mean I don't I mean if this is true then that's the reason hardware is true that's a harder thing to work with. I can hear you or I cannot really see. There should be a button. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes, we can see a very small view. Okay. So one question was, you mentioned that theorem about the family with some lingerseparators and Separators, and you can get them as miners. Can you give a hint to the proof? Something about what sampling separators have to do with it? So, yeah. I mean, the main ingredient of the proof is a theorem of Kevin Henry, David, and myself: that if you have a bipartite graph in a class with Tony Sablini separators, then Only sublinear separators, then the extremal function is not much larger than what I wrote is true, but with one plus little of one factor. So that actually takes more work than the other half. So that's the biggest ingredient. So that you can do it with arrows smaller of one. Swallow of one. And that theorem uses strongly subliminal separators by breaking the mine into, by reducing the case more or less to bounded size components. So you want to solve the problem for a graph where maximum component size is bounded. And then. So that's the small graph or the big graph? The small graph. Okay. And that so actually that's independently done by us and another group, so Hon Leo, Hussellgraf and Montgomery. The same method is different, but our method at some point it reduces to dance graph and uses symmetric regularity to do lots. To do lots of copies, you know, as they do. So that's kind of how subnet separators are used. And also, it's... Did you get some brows or do you still get markups? When you use regularity, do you get some roughs or do you still get my cuffs? We get subcuffs. Yes. In that setting, we get subcuffs. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. It's also very not true if there are no subcups. It's also very not true if there are no sublinear subarras. So C5 is equal to 6, does it use the shortcut here? Oh no, no, this is just density, right? This is attached. It's basically, like, I mean, it uses, like, how do you prove that there's no K5 minor, then you have average degree under 6? There are many of them. Under six. There are many approaches, it's pretty easy. It's a bit harder for domination model, but I mean, not too hard, I mean to succeed. I mean, it's crazy. Is Doggy anyhow for mine maps? Have you tried? Yeah, we tried. We don't know. Has anybody been brave enough to make that actually as a concession? No. I mean I mean I think that I mean I think I think David and I will be happy to conjecture it if you want to put it in. I think we thought it was fast too. Okay, so everybody's keen to get coffee? Okay, thank you very much.
