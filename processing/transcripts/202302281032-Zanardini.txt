So before I start, I just want to thank the organizers. So thank you for the invitation and thank you for the opportunity to speak today. So my talk is about the construction of a moduli space for a class of surfaces which are called fractional elliptic surfaces of index 2. And everything that I will be saying today is joint work with Rick Miranda and also before I Miranda, and also before I forget, everything is already complex matrix. So, what is my plan for the talk? First, I will tell you what a rational elliptic surface is, and then what we mean by index, and in particular, index 2. So, I'll start very slowly with a definition, maybe some examples, and then after that, I will try to be a bit more precise on what exactly is the classification problem that I'm interested in. Problem that I'm interested in. And then after that, I will start with the details of our paper and try to explain a little bit about the approach that we decide to take to construct this model of space. So here's the definition. So what is a rational elliptic surface? So, I'm gonna try to always write R E as for any surface. So, it is a smooth projective rational surface. Say y. Same Y together with relatively minimal genus 1 vibration. So, this is the definition, and maybe I should automatically. So, by relatively minimal, I mean there are no minus one. I mean there are no minus one curves on the fibers. And by genus one vibration, I mean it's a vibration such that the generic fiber is a smooth curve of genus one. This is what I mean by a rational elliptic surface and what is a classical example of such objects. So let's think about pencil of cubics. That to the cubics in the plane. So take two cubics and look at the one-dimensional linear system generated by them. So let's say a cubic C1 and a cubic C2 and lambda mu are C1. So I'll try to draw. Try to draw a picture and then please tell me if you can see the colors. So, this is my C1, whenever we have such an Such an object, a pencil of cubics or a pencil of cards in general, this is going to define a rational map from P2 to P1, which is defined as follows. So essentially just it's just um evaluation and the fiber over lambda mu is just the curve lambda c point plus mu. curve lambda c1 plus mu c2. And this rational map fails to be defined precisely at the base points of my pencil. So at the nine points where the two cubics intersect. So how do I resolve this? Well I can blow up the plane at the nine base points and then I'm going to get a rational surface y that comes equipped with H. That comes equipped with a G1 figure. And in fact, it's going to be a rational elliptic surface with a section. So the picture here, here's my P1, and then I have my surface here. So the generic fiber, the smooth elliptic curve, and I'm going to have Have generically 12 nodal fibers. So if I start from pencil of Cobics, I blow up the nine base points, I get a rational elliptic surface with a section. And conversely, if I start with such an object, one can show that it comes from a pencil of cubics. So I have this classical one-to-one correspondence. Correspondence. Now it's also classical that somehow this spectral or this correspondence generalizes. So this is definition slash preposition. This is classical. So any rational ethic surface Of index M can be obtained from append to plane curves of the grid 3m with nine base points. Base point and then it of multiplicity m and it's all the same m so why is this a definition? So try let me try to explain what I'm trying to say. So I'm defining what the index is. So if I start with a rational elliptic surface, so something satisfying this definition, there's going to exist an M. An M such that my surface is obtained by blowing up the nine base points of a pencil like this. And conversely, if I start with a pencil like this and blow up the base points, I get a rational elliptic surface. Okay, so there is equivalent ways of defining the index, but for the purposes of the Index, but for the purposes of this talk, take it as this step. And maybe something that I want to mention that is going to be relevant is that, moreover, so first there exists a smooth rational M section Which I will always try to denote by capital M. And so a horizontal curve that intersects the fiber at n points. And there exists a unique multiple fiber that I'm going to denote by Me. And of course, this is if and only if M is bigger than 1. Than one. Otherwise, I'm back to the first example. So m equals one is the classical case of essence of cubics. Okay. So in this talk, I'm interested in the case m equals g. But in general, one can add. So one can ask the following questions. Something that I am interested in. Oh, sorry, this new question. So, how to construct a modelized base Y space prepares y, m. So I fix the index, the little m, and then I try to parametrize rationalistic surface of index m with a choice of a multisection. So this is a classical question. So this is a classical question and the first case that has been looked at is m equals 1. m equals 1. And this was studied by Miranda in previous one. So where he looked at Feinstein's equations. So and he constructed a moduli space parameterizing such objects. And then the next question. And then the next question is, okay, so what about other M? And as far as I know, no one had looked at it before. And in this talk, I will tell you something about the Kthn equals 2. And before I And before I explain how we did this, I want to give you a concrete example when m equals 2. Just to get an idea the objects we're parametrizing. So we're looking at surfaces that are obtained from pencils of sex sticks with nine nodes. Um, okay, now picture with colors. Um, sorry, I'll draw the picture first and then I'll try to explain.  Okay, so I take as generators of the pencil first this conic q and then two times this other conic q prime. I'm going to write that down in a second. And then the other generator of the pencil is this cubic, which is this triangle, and I take that with multiplicity 2. So the conic. So the conex C is tangent to Q, sorry, the cubic C is tangent to the conex C at this P1, P3, and P2. And then this Q prime is also tangent to C at the P3 and is tangent to Q. I hope it's clear from the picture, more or less. Okay, so I'm taking the pencil. B4 is intersection of Q prime with C. Force intersection of q prime with c. It's not this one. It's my picture, maybe, is not the best one. Yeah. So the pen, so it's lambda times q plus 2q prime, and then mu times lambda plus. Yeah. Okay. So in the surface that we get, so we blow up P1 and P2 just to B2 just two times and then we blow up three times and we blow up P4 and P5 just once. That should be nine. Then the kind of fibers we get, similar fibers, the following So, this in Codarian notation, the singular fiber that corresponds to this member in the pencil is of type I1 star. So, this is the dual graph of the fiber. And this curve corresponds to the twice Q prime. To the twice q prime, and this one corresponds to q. So these are the exceptional divisors over p3, and this is the ones over p1 and 2. And then I have this double fiber of 5 by 3. Okay, so this is just to give an idea of what kinds of things I'm interested in. And then are there other singular fibers in this family? Are those in the only family? No, no, no. There are. I think generically we have two more of type I1, but we could also have one of type II. Do these still have section? They don't have sections. No, they have a bisection. So the last exception divisor is going to be a bisection. But double fibers. Yeah, that's what you know that I was trying to see. Like the exceptional, but you just said it. Some of the exceptional curves are actually double sections. Have more than one, but the last one for sure is this one. Okay, so what is going to be our strategy? So, here's what I want to Um so here's what I want to do. Um so I want to parametrize pairs y m. So y a rational elliptic surface of index 2 and m a choice of a bisection. And what I'm going to do is to realize that I can actually construct, once I choose a bisection, I can construct this as a double bisection. Can construct this as a demo cover of Q1 cross Q1. The file covers of the one. And so, in other words, what I'm going to do is to parametrize the possible branch curves instead. And here is the construction. I'm going to erase this line for a bit because I need lots of space. Okay, so I start I start with a pair Y, M. So on the generic fiber, I have a natural involution. I have a natural involution because I'm choosing this bisection. So if you want something like this, and I'm calling this evolution telephone. Now, and then so I have this on the generic fiber, and the claim is that this extends to the whole fibration. So I have an involution on the genus 1 curve. So the fixed points. So the fixed points, the fixed point sets, four points, right? So in this vibration, in the fixed set, fixed locus, I have a four section of my vibration. But now I have this double fiber. But this four section can only meet this double fiber at two points. So it means that in the fixed locus, I'm going to have extra two isolated points. So the picture locally. picture locally is the following. So here's my double fiber. I have my fourth section and then I have two isolated points in the fixed focus and actually one of these points lies in the in the bi-direction. And the biceps are so what I'm going to do is to blow up this two points I guess is two separate occurs. Last section, and then here's the uh image of uh M. Okay. The next in here I still have an involution and then I'm gonna quotient by that. If you want, you can first take the quotient by tau, that's going to be something similar, and then you resolve the similarity. So I'm just doing the other way around first. So I'm just doing the other way around first. Okay, so then you coefficient by tau. What you get now, instead of twice in the genus 1 curve, you get twice P1. Have this few curves, four section, and then the image of the bisection. And the point is that this double And the point is that this double thing is a minus one curve. So we can contract it. And then we get something like this. Do they change colours? No. And now this And now these two curves, so this two, they meet the first section after we contract the double curve. And they're actually minus one curves at this point. So we can contract both of them, but I choose to contract this one, the one that intersects the mid the image of the bicep. So then when I do that, When I do that, get the following. Now I should use colors. And I claim that now at this stage. That now, at this stage, I'm now in P1 plus 2. And this is in this sense, so it's birationally, that my surface can be realized as a double cover of Q1 plus Q1. So the branching is this curve C, together with this fiber. And at this point P here, we have a technode. And the tangent to that technode is the fiber through the element. The fiber through the limit. And the horizontal curve that I drew here, that I'm calling H, is the image of the bisection. Everything at another point? Exactly. It also, yeah, that's another crucial point. The curve C meets H at another point. Yeah. So even before the dotted curves met your eye, I mean in your other diagram. I mean in in your other diagrams, the dotted curve method. Was the bisection the dotted curve in the previous? Yes, it was, so my picture is not very faithful. Yes, you're right. Yeah. The right set does not make sense, yeah. What is the by degree of this curve, the C? This C. Yes, very important. C is of by degree four three. 4, 3 4, 3, 4. If you take the linear system M plus details the elliptic fiber with large D, you get the same thing. This is to do out to some little surface. I'm not sure, I need to think a little bit. That's not how we did it. That's not how we did it, I think. So it gives you the evolution of those move pipes. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. We are only using somehow the bisection. So, and I was going to comment on that. So, this construction is giving me an analog of this. Me an analog of the Weierstras equation, let's say. So to come up with an equation of this form, so we pick a point on the fiber, generic fiber, right? And then we look at the space of sections of multiples of it. Then we go all the way to, I think, times the point or something like that, and then we find the relation like this. So there, the big So there, the picture there, we were picking a divisor of degree 2, and then we look at powers of it, and again we go up into some multiple which I don't remember, and then we find the relation. Also, thank you. Okay, um how am I doing with time? Yep, I'm gonna go ahead and do that. So now I what I want to do is to parametrize since this curve is C, right? So they have this tech node and it must have a tangent, a fiber to the point. So I impose this condition and I just parametrize this curved C. So what I want to do is to find equations for that. Equations for that, and that's what I'm going to do next. So, what we proved is the following. And P1 is P1 such that C is given by the following polynomial, zero polynomial. Okay, so it's bihomogeneous of the green. bi-homogeneous of degree 3 in UV and 4 in XY. So these are the coefficients. They are indexed by ij. Q is my index set. And then I'm going to tell you what the index set is. And I have this extra condition that these two coefficients, they cannot be zero. Okay, so if I think of A, so ij, as points in the plane, and I put my origin here, then the non-zero coefficients are the ones that I mark. Efficients are the ones that are marked in green. So this is 0, 4, this should be 1, 2, and so on. Is it clear what the equation is, more or less? This is like a normal form then. This is a normal form versus curve C. Exactly. Yeah, that's what I'm doing. Yeah. What was the by degree of C? By degree of 4 or something? Yeah, 3 in UV and 4 of this way. So the fiber I'm taking as U equals 0 and the horizontal as X equals 0. Okay. So with this in mind, then what we have to do is to parametrize equations of this form. This form. Okay? So at this point, so what's left? So what are the alphaborphisms of Q1 plus P1 that preserved at normal points? So it turns out that at this stage what we have is just an action of the torus, GM3. GM three. So this is acting on A12 and this defined space of tall dimensions. And the formats here are the i sub i j's. And the action is the following. It's diagonal. And then we show is that allowable, what I'm trying to say is that allowable curves C are in one-to-one correspondent with allowable orbits for this action. Are beds for this action? So the allowable here means I'm imposing these conditions, right? I have this cusp at the point P, sorry, this techno that the point P, the tangent has to be a fiber, the curve has to go to another point with the horizontal curve and so on. Outside P I only have A D singularities, otherwise I'm not gonna go Otherwise, I'm not going to get a rational data surface. So there are certain technical things that I'm hiding, but then we can make sense of this bijection. Okay. So essentially the orbits that correspond to the arrow. But it makes it work. So it um The upshot is that we have translated our problem to constructing just a torrent JT. So, what we do is to construct HOL mod gm3. And yeah, so of course. Exactly. Yeah, I was going to leave that to the end. Yeah, I was gonna leave that to the end, but yes, it's just a no consent of that. Yeah, and but maybe what I want to say at this point is: so there are hundreds of possible quotients, right? Because it depends on the choice of the character. Nonetheless, it's very explicit. So constructing Tauric GIT, like so when you have Taurus acting on a find space, it's very well understood. Yeah, so I'm gonna. Yeah, so I'm gonna do this because I don't know. So I'll just write just to point out how explicit this is. So note that we have the following. So I'm thinking of, if you want, I'm thinking of the specific embedding of GM3 in DM12 that's acting diagonally on A12. A12. So I have a map from DM3 to DM12, and then you can think at the level of character lattices. So I'm going to get a map from Z12 to Z3. So then I get some that sequence like this. We're here. We have some matrix that are. I have some matrix that I'm calling A. So the columns of this matrix are just this: 1 to ij. And then, well, B is just defined to be a matrix extends rows generating kernel of A. And the point is that to describe the quotient, all the information we need are encoded by the colon. But it's very explicit. Okay, so as Tan pointed out, I'm actually looking just at an open subset there. So at this moment, I'm going to take a step back. Right, so I told you that I have this condition here. Coefficients have to be at zero, for instance. Um so recall a to zero times e to the four is always zero. Um so I can um use my group to set them equal one. I reduced the dimension of the space of coefficient by 2. I'm now in A10. And what I need to do is to compute the stabilizer. And it turns out it's gm times C2. So after I do this, I set the two coefficients as one, so I normalize my equation further. What we're doing is actually What we're doing is actually constructing a quotient of apn by dm plus d2. And the action is the following. So my t is in dm and epsilon is plus minus 1. It acts as follows. So t to the 2i plus j minus 4 of epsilon to the i equal to j. Again, this is storage, but we get something that's not complete. Because A12 is going to have degree 0. And in fact, we showed that this invariant of degree 0 is related to the J invariant of the double fiber. There's some There's some um geometric mini um that. Okay. So we have this, I think, nice description of the classification space, let's say. So the last thing that I want to do in this talk is to reconcile, let's say, the two pictures. Um, I'm gonna leave this here. I'll need it. I'll stay there. So we approve the fault. So we prove the folding. So I'm looking now at the A12 mod GM3 quotient. And so this depends on the choice of a character. So let's pick a character. So given chi, this corresponds to a point in Z3. So say alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3. Given that, if the following point in the plane, which I'm calling DC, so if this point lies in the shaded region that I'm going to draw in a second. Then the quotient corresponding to this character compactifies this portion. So, the sh the shaded region is cleared. Sorry, it's not very efficient. Triangle here. So, this is the point in the plane one, three. This is the point 0, 4, and this is the point 2, 0, and then I draw the triangle formed by those three points. So whenever BC, this point that is determined by the character, lies in this region, then the corresponding quotient comes back to Pisces. This is one of the things that we proved in the paper. We proved in the paper, which I think is quite useful. And I'll stop here. Thank you very much for listening. Are there any questions? Yeah. Yep. What does the GIT chamber structure look like in that chain of region? In that chain of region. Yeah. So here, so what you have to do is What you have to do is to essentially connect all the dots. So there is something here, then there's a smaller one here. Well, I also have to connect here. So there are lots of, I think this isn't the same. So maybe one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven different chambers. We did describe this one and think this one. Yeah, two adjacent ones. And then we described also what is the birational map that you have to perform to go from this one to that one. Yeah, but there are lots and lots of possibilities, so we didn't go through all of all of that. Describe, I mean, the like what the surfaces are of the The surfaces are um yes, yeah. So you mentioned that for those two objects in the chain person, you can describe the what kind of bi-regional flux you have then. Could you describe it in terms of parametrizers? Not sure. So what we did, so we describe what the fan is in the two pictures, and then we tell, we say like what is the cone that is transformed and things like that. That's all I can say right now. Yeah, but we do have a description of what is the unstable locus on each case. So I guess if we stare at it for a while, then we have an answer to your question. Yeah. So is there a similar picture for other M? Like do you show that's the question. Yeah. So can we do that? Yeah, if they're always like. Yeah. And do M equal three? Because you have three. Three because you have three points on the general curve, so it would be like a relatively cubic I haven't thought about larger M in this approach. Looking at the pencils and running GIT for the pencils I have. I would be very interested in in doing that for other apps and see what kind of constructions show up. I mean you can also do K K moduli, I guess. You can also do K moduli while you're SPS if you were in the in the right room. So actually I think that there is some description of the KSP activation for these. Like in this paper with Alexeiov that I have, because like if you take a double cover of the rational elliptic surface branched over a fiber, it's a K3 with a non-sympactic conclusion. And when the fiber degenerates the double fiber, that's a type II degeneration of the. So in a toroidal sympactification, it's the closure of the type II boundary of the visor. It's this modulos space. So there's some, there's also a hodge theoretic way, that's all extensions, like there's like, yeah, there's a hodge theoretic impactification. And I guess that approach maybe would be similar. Maybe I'm saying something very stupid, but um there's this paper by Heckman and Lujenga for the case with a section, and I think they do Yeah, absolutely. It's like for there, you take a double cover branch over two fibers and then you let the two fibers collapse and it becomes the rational elliptic surface glued to itself along that fiber. But here you just take the single fiber and it generates the double one. Any other questions? Yeah, I'm sorry for media guess.
