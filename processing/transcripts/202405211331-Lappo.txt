And to go over the big picture first, we seek to understand how knowledge is acquired and transmitted among humans and other animals. And a huge part of that is acquiring information from your peers, from your teachers, from your parents and siblings. And we usually call it social. And we usually call it social transmission and social learning. And there are some strategies and mechanisms that have been proposed that we will call transmission bias. And they include, for example, anti-conformity. So for example, this is me. I can see that the majority of the people are going to hang out in the reading room. So I acquire that very preferentially and also go hang out in the reading room. Also, other things include prestige bias, in which high status and Bias in which a high status individual in the population having some variant leads to other people potentially acquiring it. And of course, success bias is a choice of behaviors that have been shown to lead to some sort of big payoff. You can call it the payoff bias. And I say that chess is a great system for measuring these and understanding these. And why is that? We have a huge community with lots of sort of domain knowledge and a lot of material. Of the main knowledge and a lot of materials created by the community for the community for learning and transmission. There is a lot of precise records of behavior, especially with the help of computer, which are discrete and sort of analyzable directly with the code. And they span for a long history. Like we have, we know about games from 1600 to 1800. If we want to do something qualitative, these are Lewis Chessmen found in Scotland in the 12th century. 12th century. I would not recap the rules, but I think it's important to know what the code the game consists of. We start with the opening in which people strive to quickly get into a good position. It proceeds towards the middle game in which sort of human memory is no longer capable of remembering positions, and you have to calculate here and now on the board. And finally, the game is finished with a few pieces in the endgame. And just we will use some notation. Just, we will use some notation, coordinates on the board are given to they denote the destination move of the piece. I think that opening is the optimal way to study cultural transmission because the role of calculation is small and at the same time there is a lot of specific books and materials and it's a separate field where you actually study for it before the game. And we thought a lot about it. I would categorize things that matter into these four broad bins. First is the objective strength. First is the objective strength, which is the sort of objective evaluation of how likely the movie is to lead to the win, especially if it's a player who studied it with a computer, they would be given this sort of evaluation. There is social context of the move, where people learn about the strengths of the move or choice through peers, teachers, mentors, and websites analysis. Meta-strategy, I use tend to use this word to refer to stylistic changes over large periods of time where Over large periods of time, where several centuries ago people considered the game to be about different things, maybe about chivalry or sort of being brave. And finally, each game has a psychological aspect. For example, current world champion Jiu-Jung, she knows that in six months she'll play a specific person. So there is a huge amount of opportunity to target and study specifically for a specific person. To analyze this, we use To analyze this, we use this data set, which is sort of made for people to study with Wellington HS, which aggregates professional games and sort of does some sort of pre-cleaning. We'll restrict to 3 billion games in the last 40 years of professional skill rating. We use ELO to measure this. And we find still a decent amount of unique players per year at a high level. And we focus on tracking what moves people choose through time. So in this plot, Time. So in this plot, the x-axis is the time, and the y-axis shows among all games in the year in that given position, what's going on with that, like what choices are people making in aggregate. And in the starting position, there is four more main preferred moves, and they all are pretty stable. As we go, suppose people made white player. Uh uh white player play D4, this blue thing. Uh, suddenly for the response, there is clearly some sort of trend that's been changing where at first NF6 was preferred, but then somehow DeFi got popular. And as we go very deep into the game, there is sort of magnificent sort of complexity with a lot of choices that people are making for a variety of reasons. And kind of my goal was to understand why is one, why is this purple thing? Why is this purple thing increasing and why is the drogue spin decreasing? So we'll use the standard sort of right fissure approach in which players observe the move, observe games in previous years, and choose for the move to play among those options. So during multinomial is a compound distribution that models this choice. So x, t plus 1 are choices in the current year. There's n plus n t of them. N plus N T of them, and AT is the literal counts of the games in the previous year. And the random choice setup here would be where these alphas are exactly the counts of games in the previous year. However, we can complicate this and say that people observe moves in the previous year, but they don't choose it randomly, they choose it with some adjustments. And the first adjustment, we can introduce the frequency-dependent device, which is adjustment based on the current frequency of the move. There would also be linear predictors where we Linear predictors, where we say that how well the strategy performed and how much it was played by the top players could also affect this choice. And this is a standard sort of fitness term that we added. We run this through some Markov chains. There's a lot of intricate details I will skip for now. And we will look at estimates of coefficients of my linear terms. But for frequency dependence, we need some more theory to analyze this properly. Theory to analyze this properly and go back to theory where people look at recurrences for frequency of a given variance over time. And usually, record it as on the x-axis frequency, the current generation, and on the y-axis it would be the difference between last year and the current. And obviously, if the variant is neutral, the frequency never changes. So no matter when we have a current generation, it's always the same in the next generation. A positively selected variant was always chosen with higher probability than chance. With higher probability than chance. However, whether it's conformity or anti-conformity, we see that for conformity, the majority variant is chosen preferentially over chance, and with anti-conformity, the rare variant is chosen variant with chance. And we can complicate this with multiple. That's sort of the situation we are in where we model both things together. And we can just compute this counterfactual sort of posterior prediction from our model. I'll look through a couple of positions that we analyzed. Positions that we analyzed in the paper that this talk relates to. First is the queen spawn opening that we already considered. An ITF-C is at high frequency, then somehow the standard dog movement risk, but then plants as significant fractions or decrease in frequency. So the signal actually is confirmed by this analysis of fitness, where DeFi was preferentially adopted more than chance at low frequencies and vice versa in high frequencies. And this is a very interesting. Frequencies. And this is a very interesting thing where you see that the natural range of data for NITF6 is only like something about 50%. So I actually will have interpreted this curve as the signal of anteconfooling T, because we never observed NITF6 be so rare. Another prediction is the Karakan, which is a bit for a gentleman game tree, and somehow E5 is increasing in frequency, and Ecaptures D5 is decreasing. And we found that this could be due to success by Sarlinear. This could be due to success by. So, our linear coefficient for the win rate in previous year is positively correlated. So, players who played this move were losing in the previous year and therefore started playing it less and less. And an interesting kind of compound effect is that there is still negative frequency dependence and ejection conformity. So, kind of both factors play a role in this dynamic. Whereas it's like not immediately being lost. Immediately being lost, it's just slightly decreasing. It's maybe maintained by the balance of these two effects. And some other things we can say nothing about. My signal about E5 just says it's just positive fitness. None of the social biases really play a role, so it could be something extraneous like we decide about objectives training, so stylistic preferences that decide to do this. And finally, there's a plot with a lot of stuff going on. Let's focus on this increase in the recent years of the morphism. On this increase in the recent years of the move HD. And the only coefficient that was significant is actually the win rate by the lead players. So we say that prestige bias determines this increase where people observe ultra-league tournaments that are the most widely announced and televised and commentated on Twitch and YouTube currently nowadays, maybe not but but yeah, but currently and this this sort of flow seems to be the driver. However, Seems to be the driver. However, even without frequency-dependent effects, sort of the effect of prestige bias, there is some other ideas. We think that a lot of new engine suggestions were kind of promoting this move on people studying this position with supercomputers. So there's still uniform positive fitness even after this prestige bias is sort of controlled for. So, to sum up, we can incorporate multiple biases for any specific. For any specific test strategy, and we get completely different results, even for different moves in the same position, which shows just how rich the system is to study and how complex it is. And a lot of these things, like all the results I covered, we first referenced them with chess literature or publications or blog posts. And there is some more work. We worked a little bit on the effective population size in this model. And we're looking into sort of my dream is to transition this to understanding learning rather than. To understanding learning rather than just transmission, and this will require both large-scale, bigger event studies, obviously, this is only pro players, and studying maybe how individuals and Adria change their behavior as they progress. I want to say thanks to Rosenberg, Mark Feldman, and all of the people on our set of big floor at Stanford for a great environment. And yeah, I invite you to read the paper and visit my website where I Be my website where I post some photos and times from this place. Thank you. Any questions? That's really cool. So you mentioned learning, and you have this great database, this type of base. Can you use your models plus this data plus those Plus, this data, plus those intakes, to ask: is chess actually getting harder with time? Like, if we put a current player against a professional player from 20 years ago, do we have some knowledge from this or otherwise that the current player is just likely to play? I think to answer this, like, I would not have, like, I probably could produce some answer, but without much confidence, because we're looking at the starting game and how good the player is would be measured. And how good the player is would be measured by the outcome of the game, which is sometimes not really connected. Yes, yes, but you really can make these comparisons by just looking at what individual players, and like sort of what, like, I can create a portrait of the best chess player today, and I can obviously sort of with their choices at this individual date is something that's very interesting. Yeah, that compared. And obviously, a lot of summary statistics could be done with that as well. Could be done with that as well, where we actually see an online chess like stable decrease, high-rated players keep losing more and more over time. Because chess, again, because there's a lot of dynamics, even one level of summary statistics, that would answer. I think such is finally a question about looking at individual players. I think you mentioned you are looking a little bit at how the engine score are different. Like the engine score, different moves. So, are you planning to actually seriously incorporate that? Yeah, so the problem here is like people, it's like a variable that's constant in time for modern engine, right? Like, it's sort of still for the sort of positions inside or not useful, sort of clear, so it was hard to incorporate into the time series model. What we're doing now, I have like a thousand positions rather than three, so you can actually do the sort of you have a whole other axis of like looking at all positions. Axis of like looking at all positions and looking at how they differ, how moves differ by position. The point of this model is dynamic, and here oh, but I was thinking that like so you treat the heavy engine scores as constant, but then you say the coefficients, the coefficient that goes in front of that, like how much that matters to the playables, is dynamic. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we're planning to do that. That's like, I think. Planning to do that, that's like. I think originally this was like a violent idea. Now we will have more positions where like it would be hard to say for like 15 moves and three positions to do this. And now we're actually doing something like that. So, really cool project. If a player reads your paper and then starts looking at the moves and saying, okay, I'm not going to take this one because this is only prestige, but this is prestige and selection. But this is prestigious action. So I thought that what type of learning would that be? That would actually, I would say, now the social context of the booth includes looking at a database of what's been played in the last year. Were they aware of the biases? That's very meta. Yeah, that would be. But now it's out there. Yeah, now it's out there. Now some Bay Area parents are messaging Mark saying their kid plays the child. Messaging Mark saying their kid plays the chest. Can you please use your paper to train it? One day, one day I came to the level. He said, I just had a meeting with his parents who want to use this to improve their kids, so we should play just what they're going to achieve. So I have a question about the comparison with the game Go. Alpha Go started beating players a few years ago, and what I found very interesting is that it turns out that it actually Out that it actually did change the game of future players. Players started adapting their game and learning from strategies that they noticed from the artificial intelligence. So it actually contributed new strategies to the game. So I wonder if, since computers, since people, a lot of people play with computers now, has that actually given rise to new strategies? That definitely did, and that's kind of partly the point where it's Point where it's, I don't know, you can argue how it effective maybe just sped up our ability to individually learn. Maybe it's sped up our kind of, it could have sped up various different knobs in the learning process. But definitely like this HP move, like I course references to the book about LTZero's play where it's like they have a chapter on this move and error, which was suggested by these AI players. I mean they have a pattern which is representative of, but definitely. I think chess players were like very receptive. Players were like very receptive. Oh, do you want to start with me? Oh, you should start at least. Oh, okay. I was going to make this. But just to finish it, chess players were much more receptive to this, and it's much easier. It's now a type of professionals, whereas some gold people, I think, were originally less eager to adopt it as a daily training thing. I think just our space is much smaller here. But this was inspired by April on Go, so yeah. By Apron Ball, so yeah, there's not some way of G4 and G5 needs to be playing now. Yeah, never used to be. Yeah, there is a lot of that. Okay, thank you very much. I think we should probably stop there.
