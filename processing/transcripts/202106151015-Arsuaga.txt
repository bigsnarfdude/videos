All right, there might be a little bit of a network delay. So, if you can, just let me know. Okay. All right. So, first of all, thank you very much for the invitation. I'm really enjoying the talks. It's a pleasure to be here. Again, a pity that we are not in Banff, but hopefully, we'll be able to have one in Banff soon. All right, so I'm going to talk about some work that we've done recently. About some work that we've done recently trying to merge what we learned from notch extracted from bacteriophages and the models of liquid crystals. This research is funded by the National Science Foundation. And this is the list of collaborators. The work that I'm going to be talking about today, the experimental work that I will present is mainly Is mainly done by Tamara Cristiani here at UC Davis, and the theory work by Lindsay, who was a PhD student of Carmen Scalderer. And the simulations that you will see on the liquid crystal simulations are done by Sean, who is also attending this meeting. And there will be an extension of this work by Pei that he. By pay, that he will talk later in the meeting as well. And yeah, and also GJ is a student who did the last simulations trying to connect the theory of liquid crystals with nodes. All right, so you've heard me talk many times about bacteriophages. These are some new pictures that Tamara got. The structure of The structure of bacteriophage is illustrated in the cartoon at the center. The bacteriophage has what is called a icosahedral capsid. It is a capsid with icosahedral symmetry. And the capsid contains the nucleic acid. In this particular case, it's double-stranded DNA. There is no histones or any other structural proteins except perhaps at the neck. So therefore, And so, therefore, when we study the problem of DNA confined inside the capsule, we are just looking at the raw interaction, I would say, between the capsule, the spatial confinement, and the DNA molecule. The bacteriophages have a very interesting structure here at this apex where the capsid meets. Capsid meets this tail, and that's during phage morphogenesis. That's a place where the motor that tacks the DNA inside the capsid is located. Then that motor is removed and there is a protein or a set of proteins that allow the matching between the capsid symmetry and the tail symmetry. So you have here the tail that is. The tail that is during phage morphogenesis in the very last stages of the virus. And at the bottom, you have what are called the tail fibers. And these are the structure or structure that is used to recognize the cell wall. So not all bacterial phages will infect all bacteria. And which bacteria they infect is mainly determined by these little legs that you see here. Determined by these little legs that you see here. Those are hard to catch on Cryo EM, but somehow you can get some of this signature in these figures. Now, it's important to highlight here that when you look at these viruses, you see a wide variety of geometries, and that depends mainly on the maturation stage of the virus. Like in some particular cases, you see viruses that are more round. See viruses that are more round, while others are more icosahedral in shape. Some of them can contain DNA, and some others are empty. So, basically, when you look, and I'll show a few more pictures, when you look at bacterial phages under CRIVM, you start seeing quite a zoo of geometries and structures of the virus. Let me see if I can move forward. I'm gonna see if I can move forward. Hold on, this thing froze. All right, so during phage morphogenesis, I was mentioning earlier, the capsid is assembled first and then the DNA is packed afterwards. As you see here, the DNA, I'm going to show a movie, a grounding dynamics movie that was done by By Cruz at all, well, by our group, but the student cruise was the one leading the work and by Marielle of course. And what you are going to see here is the DNA getting in the capsid and trying to accommodate itself in this restricted volume. And as you see, it will try to minimize the bending energy. energy and as once the uh once the uh outer layer is uh is filled then it starts packing in and i'm going to play it again so you can see you can see the whole process but uh but what you saw is basically the dna tries to minimize the bending energy so it kind of clusters to the uh outside of the or to the to the capsid and then starts try to stress Then it starts trying to feel or starts feeling interior layers, and then it depends, it's an interplay between the repulsion of the DNA and the bending, basically. So let me show it again. And I also, you should also pay attention to the bottom of the capsid where the DMA is being packed and where the motor is. So you see how So you see how the DNA is twisting or is turning as it's being packed. And you see how it's forced to accommodate according to the repulsion and the bending constraints. All right, so these simulations that I showed represent only about a packing of the 50% of the genome in real life. In real life, the DNA inside the bacteriophage, as is shown, the bacteriophage is shown in here, and the DNA is all these strands that kind of emanate from this little structure. It's a very high concentration between 200 and 800 micr per mil. The pressure has been estimated by the Gilbar group at UCLA to be about 50 atmospheres. And as I was mentioning before, what you have to take when you start thinking about the To take when you start thinking about the problem from a physics point of view, you have to think that there's a competition between DNA bending and the DNA repulsion due to the electrostatic charges that David was mentioning earlier, and also the entropy reduction. The DNA doesn't want to be in such a confined space. So in these conditions, what it's been proposed already for a number of years is that the DNA should undergo some sort of phase transition into a leaf. Goes and sort of phase transition into a liquid crystalline phase. Initially, it was studied by Riel et al. just outside DNA capsis, just by increasing the DNA concentration. And then by Dubushed and Kellenberger in viruses and also the pioneer work by the Forester and Livoland show that bacteriophages will have regions. Have regions of order combined with regions of an order or disorder material. And therefore, that was what drove the idea of thinking on the DNA inside the viruses as a liquid crystal structure. All right, we use this bacteriophage. It's called bacteriophage P4 and is shown here a picture and the illustration already from the 70. illustration already from the 70s already known from the since the 70s is a bacteriophage that infects E. coli. What is interesting about this particular virus is that it's what is called a satellite of another virus called P2. And what a satellite means is that it uses the proteins of bacteria of HP2 to make its capsid and its tail. So it's in principle a very short virus in terms of the A very short virus in terms of the DNA, or the DNA length or molecular weight, because it's actually using all the structures, from another virus. The structure of the capsid, as you see here, has icosahedral assembly, and icosahedral viruses are classified by school the triangulation number T. And this is T equal 4, which has specific arrangements. Specific arrangements of the proteins in the capsid. And what is key for us is the diameter of the virus, as you see here, is 455 Armstrong, that is less than the persistent length of the DNA. So that really emphasizes the level of pressure and confinement that the DNA undergoes when inside the capsule. In the lab, we work with. In the lab, we work with this particular mutant called P40122 that is shown in here, which is a deletion of the wild-type virus. And what is important about this particular virus is that it has complementary ends called cosites. And these complementary ends allow the DNA molecule to become cyclic, to become a circle. When we extract the DNA from these viruses, DNA from these viruses, what we observed follow the work of Liu et al. is that the DNA is noted. And that has driven basically all our research in this area. Notes can be identified in the lab. This is on the left, you have what is called a gel electrophoresis. So you create an agaros. You create an agarose gel, you build an agarose gel where you put your samples. And because DNA is a negatively charged molecule, you would expect it to migrate away from the negative pole, let's say on the top of this screen, and migrate to a positive pole at the bottom of the screen. The agaros will allow you to separate the different populations of nodes that you see here. That you see here, and these are the ones that are going to be more relevant to us. Although, today I'll be talking about basically how much nodes we have, what's the noting probability rather than specific populations. Notes can also be observed through microscopy. And this is one example where you code the DNA with a specific enzyme called Recay, which is a DNA repair enzyme, and allows you to measure over-crossing. And allows you to measure over-crossings and under-crossings. All right, so this is one example on how the nodes look like when you extract them from bacteriophages. These are a couple of three different runs. And what it shows is instead of those beautiful bands that I showed earlier, you see just a smear. And there's a couple of reasons why you see a smear. One is because the DNA is too long to run on a jet. To run on a gel, and so it's hard to separate those particular bands, and also because you have a large heterogeneity, a large different type of nodes in just one specific analysis. The bands that you see here, those correspond to linear and circular DNA, and the linears are basically created when you manipulate. Basically, it's created when you manipulate the samples. So, what you see here is that the DNA molecules migrate way down here, indicating that these are very complex nodes. Although you see nodes that are of less complexity, like three crossing nodes, four crossing nodes and so on. Most of them are, the key message here is that most of the nodes are not, most of the notes. Most of the nodes are not most of the particles that you extract from this population of viruses are noted, and the nodes tend to be very complex. So, then what is the goal of this project? The goal of this project is whether we can marry these two ideas together. On one hand, we have these liquid crystal models that explain the biophysical state of the DNA in such a confined condition. Confined confined condition and then these DNA nodes. So there have been works trying to address these or similar questions. The work by Marianduzzo and Micheletti showed that if you impose a cholesteric term in the energy of the DNA molecule, then you can get node distributions that are similar. Not distributions that are similar to those found in the experiments. There was previous work by Clock et al. that they used continuous mechanical models to study the DNA liquid crystal structure, although they did not address specifically the problems of NAS. All right, so to build this model, we base our work on experimental data that Experimental data that is obtained through the virus, the green envelope is the capsid, the purple structure at the center is the DNA that you see is organized in layers in the periphery and kind of more disorganized at the center. And then you have all these other protein structures at the structures at the at the center that correspond to that packing well packing machinery and also the the connector between the capsule and the tail when you analyze the these images what you have is you obtain the graphs that you have here at the bottom here you have the distance from the center um of the of the capsid and Of the capsid, and you are going to have this line, these peaks over here represent how much DNA you have, and then you see that the DNA is organized in these layers. And the outside layer here is the capsule. All right, so what we observe is, first of all, when we look at these images, is that there is this, well, what it looks like a disorder phase on isotropic phase. Disorder phase or anisotropic phase at the center of the virus. And what we thought is that, well, if you pack this structure on regular soil conditions, you would expect, when you pack the DNA under regular soil conditions, you would expect it to penalize anything that is isotropic. So we basically, in this part of the energy, what we are going to do is penalize both the area and the volume of such an Of such a structure. Now, on the outside, we think that the DNA is organized in layers. And what you see on the right is an illustration of what might look like. Even though you see the DNA here kind of going in circles around the center, you should think about it about this image of the DNA strands coming out at you and And showing kind of more like the figure that is here on the right. Now, our approach to or our implementation of a model using liquid crystals is to think of these strands that are parallel to each other as the molecules of a liquid crystal. So instead of thinking as a continuum DNA molecule, we are going to think DNA molecule, we are going to think locally that these molecules are ordered locally, as is shown with this little illustration here. So the liquid crystal energy is defined by the Ossian Frank and is shown by this formula here at the bottom. It has a couple of terms. We are not going to discuss them that we assume are going to be zero. And what we care about is this last term. care about is this last term that accounts for the bending the bending penalty so the energy uh in the end it's uh it's simple the initial energy that we are proposing in which we account for a term of pending as is shown here and with a k3 coefficient and then these two extra terms accounting for the isotropic phase of course here we have the first two terms of the energy equal to zero and we allow equal to zero and we allow this this basically represents the boundary condition telling us how they have to the DNA has to move or has to organize according to the CAPSI now here they are they are written as a strong boundary conditions but in reality we put them as we implement them as weak boundary conditions. Right so we what can we do with this model? Well first thing What can we do with this model? Well, first thing we can do is try to see if we can predict the size of the isotropic phase or disorder space at the center of the capsid. So the question is the following. If we know the length of the DNA and we know the volume of the capsid, can we estimate the size of the isotropic phase at the center? And also, there has been a lot of measurements of the internal pressure, the osmotic pressure inside the capsule. Can we estimate it? The capsule. Can we estimate it? So we went through different viruses, data and different viruses. So here, each row represents one different one virus, T4, T5, T7, epsilon 15. Those are different viruses. And here, what we see in the red, highlighted in red, is the size of the disorder region. The first column represents The first column represents the experimentally observed disorder of the region, and this is what the model predicts. So, overall, we have a good agreement. T5 seems to be kind of an oddball. We need to look at it more carefully. Of course, all these viruses have their own little intricacies. So, not always the theory is going to work as well as you would like because of these details. But overall, I would say that we can predict. Overall, I would say that we can predict fairly well the size of the isotropic core. Now, when we look at the pressure, then the pressure is way down. As I mentioned initially, the pressure should be 50 atmospheres and we are down to just less than one atmosphere. So this was telling us that there was something missing in the energy. So we look at the references, and Carme came up with this idea. Carme came up with this idea looking at Dijance and the work of Clemen and Piransky and Oswald that tells you how to incorporate the osmotic pressure through the bulk modulus and the shear modulus. And those are the two terms that are shown in here. In the calculations, we are going to be assuming that K3, the bending term, is of the same order as B and C. As B and C. So, when we incorporate this new condition or the new terms to the energy, then we see that the osmotic pressure seems more like what is being reported in the experimental literature. All right, so with this, we did some theoretical calculations, but then we talked to Sean Walker to do a To do a more refined numerical studies. And he used what is called the Erickson model that basically allows you to overcome issues with the Aussie-Frank model that I described earlier because there are defects where the energy terms will go to infinity and then the system will work. And so what you do in this particular What you do in this particular model is you include this parameter S, which is a scalar field that represents the degree of orientation of the molecules. I'm not going to get into this today, but basically what you are going to, the energy term is going to have the OSIM Frank term that I mentioned earlier, together with this cradle for S, then this second part over here that corresponds to the Corresponds to the bulk and share modulus. And then we add this extra term here at the end that corresponds to the penalty that you pay to go from isotropic to matrices. So when we do this analysis, we obtain a vector field that tells you the orientation of the DNA. Orientation of the DNA, of the trajectory of the DNA inside the capsule. And there are some predictions. The prediction is that for specifically for P4, we would expect that the isotropic core is about 18.9 nanometers, which is basically a little bit less than half of the radius. And there is a pressure of 25 atmosphere. Then the question is, well, now is this consistent? Then the question is: well, now is this consistent with nothing? So then we went back to the lab, and Tamara Christiani, a student of Mario's, did this experiment where we look at cryo EM analysis of these particular viruses. So basically you grow viruses, you purify them, you concentrate them as much as you can, then you pitrify. You kind of freeze the samples, collect the data. There's going to be some shifting in between different images, so what you need to do is align them. Then you look through these images and select the particles that are more or less good to be used for reconstruction. Once you select those particles, you can start producing 3D models and eventually you can Eventually, you can come up with your own structure. So, as I was saying earlier, this is the kind of zoo that you would see when you look at these images. There are methods that automatic methods that come with CryoSpark, another analysis method, that would detect automatically these images. But what Tamara did was actually go one by one, selecting the ones that were ones selecting the ones that were actually very have the definition of the quality. Something that sometimes you get into surprises and what you are seeing here is one, two, three, four bacterial phages that are somehow bound to this maybe like a cell wall and maybe they think that this is all they their tail fibers are telling them. Their tail fibers are telling them that this might be acal. So they are trying to infect this, just this blob of acal, perhaps. All right, so this is the type of an example or examples of the different types of images that you see once you average over many projections. And we thought this was very exciting to see so much detail. We didn't think we would be able to see it so clearly. But here, for instance, at the center, For instance, at the center, you see the capsid on the outside, you see the tail, the connector region here, and the tail would come down there or up here, sorry. And here at the center, you see what the DNA looks like. Here you have other examples. And in this one at the bottom with 323 particles, you can see very clearly the structure of the connector and the tail. And here on the left, you see the different layers. Here on the left, you see the different layers of DNA. All right, so when you analyze these images in the same way that I mentioned earlier, we see that the internal radius is about 21.94. So it's a little bit smaller than what you should, what people have reported in the literature, but this is the inside of the radius. Small inside of the radius rather than the outside. We see a first layer at 18.60 nanometers and another layer at 14.68. And these are shown here in this figure on the left, where you see in blue the capsid, and then you see a first layer in green and a second layer in yellow. And what the theory tells us, based on the separation in between strands, is that we should see still one more layer here. Still, one more layer here. So, we need to refine our analysis and kind of identify this layer. And we know that there is another layer because, again, the theory is telling us that this particular vertical bar, this is the position where the isotropic phase will start. So, we have a prediction, and again, from the model, and the prediction is the isotropic phase will start at this particular point, at this 9.5. Particular point at this 9.48 nanometers. These are the two observations that we have through CryOM, then we should have at least one more layer at the center. Now, if you notice, the distance in between layers is a little bit larger than what you would expect. And this is consistent with the literature and consistent also with the idea that what we have here is a deletion mutant. Deletion mutant. So when you have a deletion in your DNA, then the DNA has a little bit more wiggle room to move and to spread. Okay, so I think I'm finishing now. So what we've done with GJ is to start with the liquid crystal model, then we generate what are called the micro vectors, basically the vectors that would produce the average vector that we detect through the liquid crystal model. Vectors that we detect through the liquid crystal model. We sample these vectors and we generate trajectories and then we compute the node probability. And what we observe here is the length and what we observe is that the noting probability increases rapidly with the length of the DNA. And we get almost 100% consist for 1500 vectors of points that we pick from those observations. All right. P for those observations. All right, so this is the end. So, what we've done, what we have presented is a formulation that kind of tries to marry the idea of liquid crystals with the nodes that we observe. Our model can predict the size of the isotropic nucleus, of the isotropic center, and the pressure inside the capsid. And the model is also consistent with observations in P4 that we were trying to evaluate. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Very interesting.
