Okay, so thank you everyone for being on time again here. So we continue with a talk by Andres Fatinho, who is always a PhD student at University of Los Angeles in Bogota, and he will talk about non-proportive extensions of operators with a bounded imaginary part. Hi, everyone. Hi, everyone. Thank you for being here, and thank you for allowing me to give this talk. The most part of this talk is based on works of Christopher Fitzbacker. And the plan for the talk is show a characterization of dissipative extension, extension of dissipative operator. Give an example with the Schringer operator on the half line with two. With two different perturbations and talk about some ideas on the interval-bounded case. Let's start with a definition. An operator A defined on a hilt by space H is called discipline. If for all f in the domain of the operator, we have that such imaginary part is greater than zero. I mean by imaginary. I mean by imaginary part of an operator, the quadratic form Q, which is defined in the domain of A with the same expression than here. And notice that if we have an operator, if A is an operator equal to S plus A times B, where S is symmetric and B is greater than zero. B is greater than zero and non-negative and bounded. We have that A is dissipative, and this quadratic form in this case is bounded. Conversely, if we have a dissipative operator with which Q quadratic form is bounded, we can define S and V such that A is equal to S plus I times V. This is like set that study operators with bounded imaginary power anticipatory. With bonded imaginary power and dissipative is the same as the study operators with this form s plus it and c I'm interested in calculate explicitly the extensions a dissipative extension of operators with this form as before so this proposition says that any dissipative extension of operator with this form has domain contained in the domain of SSR this is good because This is good because we have a nice representation of all possible dissipative extensions, and we only have to study that representation. The representation is in the form, it depends on the two parameters, W and L. And it's equal to S W L plus A times B. W is a subspace of the domain of S star and has no information of the domain of S. The domain of s and l is an arbitrary operator defined on w. Swl it's has domain equal to the domain of s plus plus w and the image of an element here is just the image of ssr plus l in omega. I call this extension non-proper because of that term. If that term doesn't exist or if If that term doesn't exist or if L is equal to zero, the extension is proper. Okay, this is the theorem that characterizes all dissipative extensions of an operator with bounded imaginary part. Let A be an operator as before, and then all possible dissipative extensions are actually dissipative extensions and only if I have these two conditions. I have these two conditions. This condition depends on the depend on the subspace W, depend on L, and depend on the perturbation B here. So the first one is the range of L has to be contained in the domain, in the range of the square root of V, which is well defined because V is a non-negative operator modeled. And this is an inequality depending on the elements. Depending on the elements of W. Okay, here I have an example. This is the Schroinger, the free Schrodinger operator defined on H2 in R plus with homogeneous condition at zero. The formula of the operator is just minus f double prime. This denotes the weak derivative of f and And there is well-known facts about that operator. The first one is that S is closed, S is symmetric, the adjoint of S is just defined in the whole H2 space with the same formula. And the index defects are both equals to one. I'm going to construct. I'm going to construct such SWL for this operator. And with all of this, with all of these facts, we have that we only have to consider subspaces W with dimension one. Okay, because the dimension is one, the W is just the span of omega, and I choose an operator L arbitrary over on. L arbitrary over on omega on w and here the thing here is that we can reparametrize this l as s h k when h is an element on c and k in the complex plane and k is an arbitrary function in l2. The domain of such s h k are the function in the solf space h two such that H2 such that we have this linear relationship between the conditions at zero, between F prime and zero and F and zero, and the action of the operator is minus F double prime plus F and zero k. Here, k is the image of the basis element of W and H is equal to W prime in zero, and without loss of generality, I suppose that W in zero is one. One. The important thing here is these zoom are all possible dissipative extensions of this Schrodinger operator. We don't matter who is V, provided that V is non-negative and bounded. Yeah, I'm going to consider those two kinds different perturbations. The first one is a random perturbation, as Rafael de Rio defined. As Rafael de Rio defined, this is a random perturbation, but in this case, I took alpha greater than zero, and this function can be selected without loss of generality unit. In this case, we can prove that the range of the square root of V is just the span of B and V minus one over half applied to V is. A applied to phi is equal to alpha to minus one by phi. Therefore, the two conditions that I need for a dissipative, for an operator to be dissipative, are equivalent to this. I need that the element k in L2 is a multiply of v in this case, and the modulus of lambda is small enough depending on alpha and the imaginary part of h. In conclusion, this means that all this epithet. This means that all dissipative extensions of S plus I times Z are sorry, all possible dissipative extensions of S plus I times Z are actually dissipative if we have these two conditions. So I brought here that summarized that we have obtained. This is the Schrodinger operator with a random perturbation. The round-white perturbation, and this is all the dissipative extension of this operator. Observe that the interesting things thing here is that even though this operator, this extension is non-proper extension, still the extension depends on the initial data of the functions. I can do something similar for a multiplication. For a multiplication operator, bounded and positive function v. Observe that this is the same domain, the same formula, except for the perturbation. And all dissipative extension has the same formula. K is just here. And for this extension to be dissipative, we only need to guarantee that K is a positive function in L2, and we have that relationship. And we have that relationship relationship with an integral which is similar to that one. Okay, and finally, in the interval bounded case, I'm going now to consider a sharing operator, but not in the half line, but in the But in the interval bounded case, we have the function, the domain of s are function in h2 with homogeneous condition at zero. And I put one selected condition in the right side on the interval. And the action of the operator is the same. And we have very similar facts about that operator. And the facts are that S is closed, S is symmetric, S star deletes the control. Deletes the condition at zero, but maintains the condition at one. And the index defects are both equal to one. So because of the things here are very similar, we also have to consider subspaces W, such that the dimension of the subspaces is one. And I did the calculations in that case, and I obtained basically the same things. Basically, the same things. Here, you notice that the domain of this possible dissipative extension has the same relationship at zero, but they maintains the condition at one. I'm exploring this. I'm exploring what happened when the dimension of this kernel is greater and the. And the the the calculations are more challenging in that cases, but this is where I'm working. And yeah, this is the reference. Thank you, everyone, for your attention. Well, thank you very much. Are there any questions or comments? Thank you, Andres, for your nice talk. My question is the following: you have some application in mind that where to use the examples and the results you are showing us? Okay, what happens here is that it can be seen as a generalization of voin-neuman theory because. Boy Neumann theory because when we have a sellab join extension, we look for operators sorry, okay, we look for operators where this imaginary part is equal to zero. So in this theory, you can notice that all sell of unusation depends on the initial data. And in this case, happens the same thing. So maybe it could be an application. So, maybe it could be an application of that. But physics, no. So, you by non-proper dissipative extensions, you are considering only maximal dissipative extensions. And what happened in the case where the deficiency index is greater than one? In this example, or positive, maybe I can write. Okay, the thing is that if we want to consider dissipative extensions. Okay, no, no, I remember. Sorry. In this case, the effect indexes are one. So Indexes are one, so the dimension of w is one, and we only have to consider okay, maximally dissipative extension concites or is the same as dissipative extension, but what the coefficient is wrought is greater, sorry. There are possibly different dimensions of the space as I said, admit. Uh, as I said, I'm exploring that. I think we can do something at least, for example, in the interval bounded case, we could put f1 and zero equal to f prime in zero equal to zero, and the dimension here grows to two. And in that case, my starting point could be sink in sell-a few instations and see what's happened with the conditions and. And with the conditions, and try to do the problem is the calculation of these two conditions become difficult, these two conditions. But it can be, I don't know. So yeah, I mean, this is actually one of the things. So in the case that Fischboha was considering as an example, is the half-line, and then you only have one-dimensional extensions, and they are maximal. Extensions and they are maximal. Now, Andres is starting to work on the interval. So, probably the next step that he has to explore is separated boundary conditions, because then at least maybe calculations really get messy. That's the thing. But the idea is, yeah, to extend this to the moment, maximum, because any distributive extension, because it's just Because it's just computationally much easier because then, but it's a future, it's, I mean, Andres just started, so we will see where this leads to. Okay, any more questions or comments? Clara, can you see if there's anything in the chat? Okay, then we thank Andres again.
