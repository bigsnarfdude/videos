All right, cool. So um you can think of the input data here as being a little bit of geometry and a little bit of representation theory. And the output is going to be a vector space. So the geometry is going to be, I'm going to draw it like a Riemann surface. It's going to be a smooth It's going to be a smooth projective curve with n marked points. Right. So, you know, we mark these points and we label them and so on. And so, in other words, you know, after we've fixed the genus, say, of genus G. Say of genus G, you know, a point, an algebraic geometer would think of this as a point on mgn, moduli space of n-pointed genus G curves. All right? So we have this nice curve and there's points on it. And this is sort of the geometric side. On the representation theory side, we choose beforehand a simple Lie algebra. A simple Lie algebra. Simple complex Lie algebra. I'm just going to write it G. So like, for example, you know, little SLN, little S omicron N, symplectic group, or symplectic G algebra, et cetera. And we're going to pick some data for the representation theory of this. Data for the representation theory of this Lie algebra. So I'm going to let lambda be the weight lattice of G. And I'm going to let lambda plus be the dominant weights. And what we're going to pick from here are n dominant weights, which I'll write is lambda 1 through lambda n, or maybe lambda bar. Lambda bar. And we think of these as being in correspondence with these mark points. So I guess the idea is like we want to study physics on a space-time, which is a surface. And we want to think of like n particles doing what they do on that surface. And these representations are telling us the Hilbert space. us the Hilbert space that controls the states of those particles. We have gauge group, the Lie group of G. And one more piece of information we'll fix is a non-negative integer called the level. And I think we're supposed to think about this as like the energy level of the whole thing. Alright, so we have a curve and points on the curve. And points on the curve. The points are labeled by specific dominant weights which correspond to specific irreducible representations of this Lie algebra G. And then we have one more number, the level. And out of all of this, we get a vector space. I'm going to write this vector space like that. So by this, I mean smooth curve C, mark points B, dominant weights. B, dominantly it's lambda, level L. And this is called a conformal blocks vector space or a space of conformal blocks. Or I don't know the right, I've never known the right nomenclature. But that's what a conformal blocks are, is this vector space. So let me say really quickly some words about how one actually constructs this. So here's the idea. So for each For each dominant weight lambda, and for this choice of level L, we get a representation of the affine Katz-Moody algebra. Associated to G, which is often denoted G hat. And this is called the integrable highest weight representation associated to this data. So it's a highest weight representation, which means it has a highest weight vector, like the irreducible representation for g associated to lambda, but that highest vector is vector. Associated to lambda. But that highest weight vector you think of is labeled as by lambda and L. And this word integrable means that this infinite-dimensional Lie algebra, this Katz-Moody algebra, acts on this representation in a nil-potent way. So every operator, as soon as you take a high enough power, it vanishes. All right, so this is like, you should think about this as like an infinite-dimensional analog of the irreducible representation. It's like an irreducible representation of G with some like. Representation of G with some like power series stuff going on. All right. Now we're going to take these integrable highest weight representations and tensor them together. And then we're going to do something truly horrifying. We're going to take the dual. So we started out, we started out with. We started out with countable dimensional vector spaces here, and now we're taking the dual. So we get an uncountable, uncountably dimensioned vector space. So this is a big... Well, even the tensor product is a problem. Excuse me? Even the tensor product is a problem in the terminal vector space. That's why I cheated and put the dual out here. Because I'm scared of writing the little hat that you do for completed tensor product. But anyway. What do you mean by dual? Excuse me? What do you mean by dual? Like, are these topological vector spaces? You take linear functions from this vector space to C. Algebraic. Algebraic. No topology on these vector spaces? I don't think so, no. So there's not like a category they're working in in which these make better sense than. Well, I mean, like, if you're doing analysis, you can't complete a test of product because you're working in category finance bases or something. I think. I think, I don't know. I'm just going to say, I don't know. I know that this is how you make the space that we're about to get the quota blocks from, but I don't know the right, you know, infinite dimensional vector space stuff to stay there. All right, so using some stuff I am going to brush under the rug, you can create an action of another infinite-dimensional Lie group. Lie group on this guy. And that other infinite dimensional Lie group is a little bit more pleasant because the way you get it, or Lie algebra, because the way you get it is you take the coordinate ring of the affine variety that you get when you remove the points from this curve C. And you tensor it with Billie algebra G. And then there's a sort of a two-step thing you do where you take power series expansion around these points P, and then you do a certain central extension. Points P, and then you do a certain central extension to define an action here. And the space of conformal blocks is the invariance for this action. So I want to say a few things about this. So, invariance meaning that they're the vectors that everything in here annihilates. So, notice that this big horrifying thing doesn't depend on the curve at all. If you thought about it, like a geometer might want to think about it as something happening over Mgn, we have like a constant vector bundle over Mgn with the same fiber, this terrifying thing. And what's changing is what the algebra we're taking invariance by over each curve. That's where the That's where the curved data enters the picture. All right. So now that I've introduced sort of how you make these things, or at least some of the words you Google to figure out how you make these things, let me tell you some nice properties that this construction, that these control blocks end up having. Nice properties. Okay, first nice property, which I'm going to call correlation. If you take a conformal blocks space over a point at P1, then that space Then that space ends up being a subspace of the tensor product invariant space that you get from those dominant weights and the original Lie algebra G. This is super neat. Everything's finite dimensional. Everything's finite dimensional. Exactly. So over P1, not only is everything finite dimensional, but you can realize it in a very Realize it in a very classical space from representation theory. So, you know, these spaces have been studied by people in representation theory and also like cluster algebra theory a lot more recently. You know, a fair amount is known about these tensor product invariant spaces, and this is some subspace of it. So, in particular, you know, for a pointed T1, the conformal blocks vector space is finite-dimensional. Formal block vector space is finite dimensional, but even better, it's actually always finite dimensional. So, and this image of the map is increasing with L? And does it, am I remembering right, that when L goes to infinity, then it's an equality? Yes. So, in fact, I'm kind of jumping the gun a little bit here, but the L's formula. But the L's form a filtration. If you fix the dominant weights and you increase L's, it forms a filtration of this guy. And the Reese algebra you get from that filtration, I'm going to tell you, is super cool. But yeah. So, sorry, so this is the vector bundle on the model space of curves. Like, Dumbledore gets killed by Snape, that's my punchline. That's my punchline. Sorry, but maybe. Yes, yes. So it's in fact always finite-dimensional. So I first read this in a paper of Sitchi and Iloeno and Yaman, where they prove a lot of these properties I'm telling you about. And so yes, so number three, as the curve varies. As the curve varies, these spaces form a vector bundle on Mgn. All right. Which is great, right? It means if you know the dimension at one place, you can compute it anywhere. An algebraic vector bundle? It's an algebraic vector bundle on MGN. Bundle on MGN. Algebraic vector bundle on Mgn. And even better, they form an algebraic vector bundle on MgN bar. So you can extend the definition of conformable blocks vector space from a smooth curve to a semi-stable curve. And this is also done by Sejiya Yeleno Yamada. Situia Yueno Yumada to get a vector bundle on MgN bar, the Deline-Mumford compactification. So these conformal blocks, vector bundles, have been used to, you know, nice effect to study birational geometry of MgN-bar, and in particular M0N bar. So there's some very nice work by actually Gidney. I mentioned Neil and Juden Sirakuza. Noah Andreen Sirakuza and Hadi Jensen and many others have used these vector bundles and their turn classes to say things about the birational geometry of MgN bar. So this is like the first selling point for conformal blocks is they can tell you something about a cool moduli space, the moduli of semi-stable curves. So there is sorry, the chair classes of this background Classes of this vector numbers, what would they count? Would they count something? The degree of these transclasses? I am not a good person to ask that. So I should also mention Flak Rudin. And I believe he has a paper where he interprets these turn classes and their their various intersection numbers. So yeah. I think the answer is yes, but I'm not prepared to say any more. Prepared to say any more. All right. So let me say a little bit about MGN bar. So, you know, these are, you know, you take smooth pointed curves and you throw in certain nice curves at the boundary. And the nice curves you throw in at the boundary are smaller genus curves that have been stuck together at nodes such that the automorphism group is finite. So, in particular, the type of curves like In particular, the type of curves like this that I'm going to be interested in telling you about today are the curves that you get from graphs. So trivalent graphs. I'll say what all these things mean. With first Betty number equal to G, this G, and Li. So this, I mean, I Leaves. So, this by I mean, I mean this to mean the set of leaves of the graph. So, trivalent graphs that you can draw where it's got G loops and n beams. So, you know, here is going to be a quasi-running example of such a graph. In this case, the first Betty number is 2, and there are three leaves, so this is a point of M23 bar. Of M23 bar. And the way you get a curve from this is at every internal vertex, you go in and you replace it with a T1. So I'm going to try to draw this. Oh, wait, okay. I'm going to try to draw all the diagrams you get from this sort of picture. So here's a P1, or a union of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Or a union of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 P1s. And for every leaf, you put in a marked point. And then you also think of the nodes as being sort of marked points that are hanging around there. If you're an algebraic geometer that likes to draw lines, you can think about this as this curve right here. You can see that each one of these lines has. That each one of these lines has three special points on it. And then one more diagram. You know, for a graph like this, you can also think of going in and replacing each vertex with a triangle. And so you can get a triangulated surface, which is dual to this. Did you have a question, Alan? So, this is, there's no particular reason your curves here should end up having P1 components, right? This is only some curves. These are some curves. These are like my favorite kinds. Some curves. These are like my favorite kind of curves for the day. Some curves. But you can, yeah, some curves. These are the ones that you can code completely tomosquarily and multiply. So yeah, you could go in here and there's sort of a way you could take a graph where the vertices are labeled by genus information and there's a certain numerical criterion that says it's going to be stable correctly. All right. Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't make that clear. Sorry, I didn't make that clear. So, you know, we can also go in and replace each triangle here, or each trinode, with a triangle. And then we get a triangulated surface. Here would be the triangulated surface, if that's the sort of discrete data you're interested in. So I'm going to call the conformal blocks vector space that you get from a graph gamma like this. I'm just going to call it V gamma of lambda L. Of lambda L. So this gamma encodes both the marked point data and the curve. Okay. So let's the story here is now kind of one of the stories that you frequently hear told about things that have something to do with the moduli of curves. If you want to know something. If you want to know something that's going on over a general smooth curve, you pass to one of the combinatorial curves, and you hope that you do so in a locally free way. So I'm going to tell you some examples now of ways that you can count the dimension of the space of conformal blocks with points and polyhedra built from a curve or a graph like this. A graph like this. So, examples. So, now we're heading towards polyhedra, and that's like getting near toric stuff. So, the best case to start with is SL2. So, here is, if we want to, so in this case, I should say that the dominant weights are just, you know. Are just, you know, non-negative integers. So if we want to compute the dimension of one of these spaces, you know, what we're choosing, I'll say in the other graph gamma, what we're choosing are n non-negative integers, which I'll just write r1 through rn, and then this level l. So that's what we want to compute. So that's what we want to compute. We're going to compute this dimension. And here's the rule. This is going to be equal to the ways of labeling the edge set of gamma with non-negative integers such that some conditions are satisfied. I'll tell you those conditions. Those conditions. If L is a leaf edge, that is, it's an edge attached to a leaf, let's say it's Li, because it's in bijection with one of these entries. Then the labeling of Li has gotta be the integer Ri. This is what you would call the conditions at the boundary. The conditions at the boundary. And now we're going to have conditions that are, you know, going to be on the interior of the graph. This is the first condition. Next condition is for every trivalent vertex, say that the edges here are I, J, and K. Some conditions need to be satisfied for the labelings on those edges. So the first is that the labeling at i plus the labeling at j plus the labeling at k has to be an even integer. But people in representation theory should start recognizing what's going on here. The second condition is this sum needs to be less than or equal to twice the level. All right. And then the third condition, and I'm just going to draw it, is that these labelings should form the That these labelings should form the sides of a triangle. So, those are inequalities called triangle inequalities. In particular, each of these labels is less than or equal to the sum of the other two. And those conditions need to hold at every single internal vertex. So, to review, if we want to compute the dimension of this vector space, we count labelings of the edges within it. Of the edges with integers. And those labelings satisfy inequalities, they have to be non-negative, some equalities, more inequalities, and then a condition that says you're actually looking at points in a certain lattice of integer labelings of the edges of the graph. So what you're looking at here are exactly the integral points in a convex polytone. Only integral means with respect to this even parity lattice. A convex polytope. I'll call it P gamma of R and L. So for every choice of R and L, there is a convex polytope that you can cook up. And when you count the integer points inside of it in the right way, you get the dimension. In the right way, you get the dimension of the space of conformal blocks. So, what is going on there is the question. And I can do like a quick example. Darth Vader is Luke's dad. Name is a quick guy. He was a quick guy. So here's an example of some things that would be. Things that would be here's an example of a conformal block in V gamma 1102, where two is the level and these ones are the weightings of the edges. So let's say So let's say that's how we've identified the leaves with these slots. And then we could fill in the interior like this. That'd be perfectly reasonable. And the reason I need to make that level 2 for this to work is, you know, if you look at this vertex right here, 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4, which is 2 times 2. I think everywhere else the level 1 would work. One would work. This is an example of what these things look like. Okay. So I want to say, I was going to explain what happens with SL3, but I think I'm just going to state the general gist. So something similar happens for For SL3 and SL4. So the rule for SL3, at least I found it in a paper of Kirilov, Mityu, Sinshaw, and Walton. And the rule for SL4 I found in a paper of Rasmussen and Walton. And Walton. And then something seems to be difficult above SL4 in the type A series and in all the other types. But when I say something similar happens, what I mean is there is a rule to label these graphs in some way with non-negative integers that satisfy inequalities such that when you count them Such that when you count the lattice points in the corresponding polyhedra, you get the dimensions of the spaces of conformal blocks. Right. Are you labeling them just by integers or by tuples of the integration? Tuples. So yeah, in particular, the boundary data has to give you dominant weights of SL3 and SL4. So like, I can just draw what the SL3 diagram, one of the ways to do an SL3 diagram, and I can maybe just sort of wave my hands at what you do with. Maybe just sort of wave my hands at what you do with it. So, first of all, you have to pick an order, an cyclic ordinary of the edges. And then you put two integers on the interior. And you require that when you sum these numbers together, you get something that satisfies these conditions. And then to compute what these boundary weights are, you have to add A to all the X's and B to all the Y's, and then those are. And then those are the contributions of the two fundamental weights of SL3 that happen at the boundary. And so, what I mean by that is: if you had a triangle here, whatever your boundary weight there was, it would need to be obtained from that corresponding edge. And whenever you're gluing two triangles together, the corresponding boundary weights need to agree. So, similar type of rule, though. If you could do the three points in P1 case, would that be enough to get a general boundary? Yeah, it's just like. Too like the journal point? Okay, it's just like spoiler all of the. Yes. And that's exactly where we're going. So if you can do the three-point case, you win. We're about smart people. All right. So, maybe I can spend the rest of the talk sort of explaining what doing the three-point case kind of means, or how you get to that point. So, some similarities here with these cases, or some things to observe. First of all, we're doing Erhard theory with some polyhedra that you can write down, counting lattice points and polytropes. And another cool thing that maybe isn't immediately obvious is if you union all of these sets together disjointly, they form an affine symb group. So if you add a, you know, You add a weighting for, as long as you fix the graph, if you add a weighting for 1, 1, 0, 2 and a weighting for 1, 1, 0, 1 together, you get a weighting for two, whatever I said, adding the weights and adding the level. So you can add them together, and they form an affine semigroup, and you can take the spectrum of that affine semigroup, and you would get a toric variety. So somehow there's a toric variety living over each of these special points in MgN bar. Points in Mg and R that you get from these seven groups and these counting rules. All right, so to sort of flesh that picture out a little bit more, you know, now we want to know what this toric variety is and what is it a degeneration of. And to sort of point some evidence towards that, of what we might expect, let me tell you about where these polyhedra have come up before. So the So, the SL2 case polyhedra have appeared in a lot of places, and it's pretty cool. So, the first I want to tell you about is for the genus zero case, they appear in a paper by Stromfels and Shu on saggy bases of Cox-Nagata rings. So, these are the Cox rings that blow up. So these are the Cox rings of blow-ups of projective space at arrangements of points. In particular, if you take projective n space and blow it up at n plus 3 points, I want to say, you get all of the 0n degenerations appearing as coxnogata degenerations of those coxnagata wings. This is interesting because prior result of Stefan Bauer. These are Cox rings of moduli of rank II vector bundles. And you have to say quasi-parabolic here. So Stefan Bauer showed that the coarse moduli of quasi-parabolic rank-to-vector bundles are Bundles are related by small modifications to these blow-ups that Sterm Phils and Hsu studied. So here's another moduli space rearing its head in the story of conformal blocks. For the symplectic geometers in the room, these polyhedra in the SL2 case also show up in a paper of Rec Debizer and Jeffrey as As moment images of a moment polyhedra of completely integrable systems on the moduli of SU2, of flat SU2 models on the surface, which is, you know, by a theorem of Theorem of Nora-Simmons-Heshadri homeomorphic, or some, I don't know the right morphic to the moduli of rank two-vector bundles. So we have a symplectic story where there's a completely integrable system producing a polyhedron which arises from a torque degeneration of the same space. And this sounds a whole lot like what Susan told us about. Told us about. And I don't know for sure Modulo 1 technical detail. I'm pretty sure you get these integrable systems by doing what's called the TIM trick to these spaces for SL2, which Alan will tell us more about. Like all the toxic. Yeah, you guys, like, once again, hello, but I have a couple questions. If I take it to a valid graph, there is this. Valid graph, there is this sort of transformation where I do this sort of thing and that kind of thing. Would that mean that that's a mutation of those? This is my other. So I have questions for symplectic geometers. How do I fill in my technical detail and Tim trick this torque degeneration? And I have questions for cluster algebras, which is what is the cluster story here? But so, I mean, the other thing is, so is this the So, is this the other thing that comes to my mind is that, you know, if I have this modular space of rank two vector bundles on a curve, that's a sort of final variety that then as the curve becomes degenerate, will degenerate and use a tonic fun variety. I'll say some words about how you use that in a second. What this tends to say is something kind of weird, namely that the moduli space of curves is a cluster variety. I don't know if that's quite where he was going with that, but I will mention what you get from this in a second. I want to say one more thing, though, before we move on to introducing this moduli properly. These polyhedra also appear in a paper of Puchinska and Vizhnevsky on phylogenetic statistical models. So there are these things called group-based phylogenetic statistical modules, better descent, varieties, that tell you how to like. That tell you how to build the tree of life. And you get one of these rules for different hidden Markov processes on a graph. And when you do that rule for a certain type of process called a group-based model, you exactly get these polyhedrons. Also super cool. Okay. Yeah, if I remember that second work, the polyhedra that you get, because there's a bunch of torus fixed points in the moduli space, are quite. Of the moduli space are quite different. They're different, but they have the same volume. No, they're the same, they're the same plateau. But the torque varieties are different. That might be the case in one of the higher group-based models. Yeah, there's something unusual about that. Okay. Here's it. For 0n, it's the same polytope. What do you mean it's the same polytope? It's the same polytope as. It's the same polytope as the informal box thing. Yeah, it's the same polytope with the same lattice. Yes, yes. It's all the same. It's the same torque for it. And they all have the same hiltered polygon. Yeah, the same hilt polygon. And the issue. And guess. Which was a surprise. And guess what? They're all, they're in a locally free family over Mg, or Mg and bar, or M0 and Bar. Okay, so let me just say really quickly how you spell out this relationship. To spell out this relationship with another moduli problem. So I'm going to write M CPG. So here, this is the simply connected simple group whose Lie algebra is G. Simply connect. And what this guy is, is the modules. And what this guy is, is the moduli of G principal bundles, polar bundles on C with quasi-parabolic structure, parabolic structure, my arm is getting tired, at the P. P. Okay. So, what is this one? One of these guys. It's a principal bundle over C, C, curve. So that means, you know, it's a scheme with a map down to C. If you look at the pre-image of the complement of any point, it actually trivializes. It has an action by G, which identifies each fiber with a copy of G. And then this quasi-parabolic structure means. This quasi-parabolic structure means that we choose, it amounts to choosing an element in the fiber over each mark point, modulo, affixed Porel. You don't need to worry too much about this stuff. The reason it's thrown in there is to get this weighting data in the conformable box. But this is a nice moduli stack. It's an Artin stack. Stack, it's an Artin stack. It has a nice coarse moduli, and those are the moduli spaces that appear here to geometrize the conformal blocks. And so there's a theorem then by a lot of people. So Kumar, Madame Simon. Marisimon, Ramanathan, Olling, Ovil, Maslow, Sorger, many, many others, in many different cases and different levels of generality, to the following that says the following. You take the Picard group. You take the Picard group of this moduli. This is the weight lattice to the number of markings cross Z. So you see, this is like where our conformal blocks data lives. Here's the curve, here's the weighting data, and then the section space over this guy. And I, oh, I can see something in the board, and this is smooth when we say this. So when you take the global sections of the line bundle associated to your favorite dominant weights and your favorite level, this is the conformable block spectrum space. And so a way you can say this is that if I take the following direct sum, you know, over all the You know, over all the dominant weight data and levels, this is the coxring of this moduli stack. And because it's a moduli stack and cox rings are usually associated to divisors and not line levels, I'm going to put this in quotes, but it's sort of morally the case, and it is the cocksring of the course moduli. Yep. Do you need L big enough, depending on the landings? If you don't, it's zero. So then in that case, the line bundle exists, but it has no global segment. Case the line bundle exists, but it has no global sections. Will there be other terminology? That's a great question, and I don't know off the top of my head, but the place to look would be here. I think Showang Kumar has a book, a big book. Yeah. Okay. So this is the connection with the moduli problem. There's an algebra over, you know, whenever you have a smooth curve. Whenever you have a smooth curve, there's a nice algebra you can put above that curve, the Cox ring of this moduli problem over the curve. But then you can show that, you know, if we take that there's a locally free sheaf, and it is actually locally free. It's just quasi-coherent. A locally free sheaf, MgM. Sheaf MgN where the fibers at a particular smooth point are this guy. So you can knit all these things together pretty easily. And this extends critically to a locally free sheaf of algebras on the Delete-Mumford compactification. The Deli-Mumford compactification, basically by the same arguments. So, to put all this together, if you think of these guys over the smooth curves, they're the fibers of a locally free sheaf of algebras over Mgn. But then that extends in the same way the conformable box vector bundles extend to the boundary. And so we get a ring at each boundary curve, at each semi-stable curve table. In particular, you can make sense of, you know, Of you know the ring v gamma g, which is the fiber of this locally free sheaf of algebras over you know your curve associated to gamma. All right, and here is where the toric degenerations come from, right? You think of like gamma living at the boundary and Cp living here, and then you have a degeneration, that curve, and you follow what happens to the algebra, and then pull nice properties back. And then all my properties back. Um how am I doing for time? Oh, great. Okay. Wonderful. All right. So I want to explain in a second how what I just said is sort of a lie, but first I want to tell you about some consequences of this idea. So once again, the idea is you take the Cox ring over the smooth curve, you degenerate it to this ring over the semi-stable curve, study the ring. Over the semi-stable curve, study the ring over the semi-stable curve, and it gives you information. So, consequences of this kind of programming. So, first, I want to mention some nice results of Balkali and Gibney, and also Woon Yu, and then also a very recent paper by Avery Wilson. Recent paper by Avery Wilson, who's a student of Balkali's, that these guys are finitely generated in types A and C. So, as far as I understand it, Belcali and Gidney did it without marked points in type A. Moon Yu extended that to the parabolic case in type A, and Wilson has done it in type C. And Wilson has done it in type C as well. Wilson has also got some interesting interpretations about what this ring means, which I'll tell you about in a moment. Second consequence, these rules I told you about, so this is in a pair of papers by me, like 009 and maybe 12 or something. In the cases SL2 and SL3, you can use this to get torque degenerations. Of you know these cox rings. And the torque degenerations realize the counting rules I mentioned earlier as examples. There's actually many more than those, which is weird for SL3, but those are examples. So from this, you can get like presentation data. So V CP. VCPSL2 is generated in levels one and two and presented quadratically in those generators. And this is valid for CP in a dense open subset of Mgm bar. The idea is you prove it over one of the gammas, you choose a very good gamma. Of the gammas, you choose a very good gamma. In this case, the gamma is the so-called chain of loops. And you get these results there, and then you can show using arguments about locally free sheaves that these hold in a fence open subset, the same bounds hold in a defense open subset. A similar conclusion is when you do this for SL3. Is when you do this for SL3, for a point at P1, it's generated in degrees, in levels one, in just level one, and has cubic generators. Same kind of argument. Right, okay. And now another cool fact, this is very recent work. It's in process. This is very recent work. It's in preparation still. It's due to Jacob Keller, who I've been working with recently. He's a graduate student at UC San Diego. If gamma, well, if n is zero, it shows that the toric degeneration you get from this From this is k-polystable. So, this is a term from moduli of Fanos. So, this is a fantastic result. And what a consequence of this is that the moduli of staple fanovarieties contains a component Component by rational to mg, which is really interesting because mg is known to be of general type for g sufficiency high by the work of Eisenbud and Harris. More recently, some improvements by Sam Payne and Dave Jensen and Gebruk Harkis. So there's an application of these torque degenerations to Generations to moduli of Thanos. In particular, he shows that there's a dense open subset of coarse moduli of rank two vector bundles on the genus G curve, which are family stable by a very intricate argument. So this is all work of Jacob Keller. Okay. So now I want to say some words about how I was lying. To say some words about how I was lying earlier. When you start with a general smooth curve, pointed curve, you can follow this locally flat family as the curve degenerates to the boundary. And this is not a Grodner degeneration. And then this guy is actually, in the cases that I mentioned, that end up having torque. That I mentioned that end up having torque generations, this is not toric. It's a T-variety, but it's not Tauric for SL2, SL3. But it is the Cox ring of another moduli on the nodal curve called the moduli of singular principal bundles. So, singular principle bundles are objects that were defined by Schmidt, and this is a result of Wilson, that Avery Wilson Bill College student earlier. But this is not the toric guy. One has to do something further here to get something sufficiently combinatorial. And so you do a Tim trick is what it ends up being. You degenerate it to a sub-algebra of the tensor. To generate it to a sub-algebra of the tensor product of the V03G case over the internal vertices of the graph. And this subalgebra is a subalgebra of torus invariance. So there's a T-variety structure here that I can answer questions about if people are interested afterwards. But this guy is what Alan called a Vinberg degeneration. It's a consequence of one. You play around with a Vinberg degeneration. So, this is a Grosvenery thing. This is not a Grosvenery thing. All right. But that's still enough to prove these nice results. All right. How much time do I have left? Seven minutes. Seven minutes. Okay. I'll just say out loud that. That in the SL2 case, these algebras are really interesting. So, in general, V gamma G is a Ries algebra of the coordinate ring of a nice variety called the free group character variety of G. So, this is the moduli of representations of. Of free group representations in the group G. This is a really neat object. It's known to have a close relationship with cluster algebra theory. And so I guess one of my questions points is that this V gamma G should have some kind of clustery interpretation. And maybe as you mutate gamma, that could be given a clustery interpretation, at least in the SL2 case. And I'm happy to tell you. Two case. And I'm happy to talk about that afterwards. But this is also a really beautiful picture. What it says is like: if you take these moduli of singular principal bundles, there's a dense open subset where all you're really remembering is how you glue two trivial bundles on P1s together at a nodal curve. You just have to specify an element, the group on each node that does the gluing. And as you polonomy around the different components, you end up exactly with this. Components, you end up exactly with this. The fundamental group of the graph is F2. So that's a dense open component of the moduli over here. And this Ries algebra relationship exactly sees that dense openness. All right. So now to Alan's point, everything is determined, roughly speaking, by V03. So I want to finish by telling you some V03s. All right? So, the best V03, or maybe the boringest, best and boringest, most reliable, like the V03 that you marry, is V03SF2. So, this guy is just a polynomial ring on four generators. It's generated by these. It's generated by these informal blocks. So each of those tensor product, SL2 tensor product spaces, has one invariant, and at level one it's a conformed block, and those are the generators. State the polynomials on these diagrams, and that's V03 dsL3. All right. So as soon as you do. Alright, so as soon as you do that, in other words, as soon as you do that Vinberg degeneration, you are toric at that point. That is not the case, however, with V03. You have to then further toric degenerate what you get after the Vinberg degeneration. So this is a hypersurface. Hopefully writing all these out. Write all these out quickly. It's a quotient of a polynomial ring on nine generators subject to one relation. And so this guy is what you would call a rational normal affine T variety. Well, it has the most torque degenerations. The most torque degenerations it could have, which is three in this presentation. So the idea is if you want to count SL3 conformal blocks with points in a polyhedron, you just torque to generate this guy and glue together the result up over the graph. And so there are three choices. You can drop one of these three monomials. And if you drop one of these two monomials, what you get are induced from clustery torque. Are induced from cluster retork degenerations of the moduli of SL3 flags, triples of SL3 flags. What you get when you drop this guy doesn't seem to come from there. And that was the rule that I alluded to earlier when I talked about the SL3 rule. So there's three rules, the three torque of generations of this 0,3 algebra. All right, and now I'll finish by saying some new stuff that a student of mine, so this is work of Casey Hill. Work of Casey Hill and me on what V03SL4 is. So let me, I'm just going to sketch what the algebra looks like. This has 20 generators. These generators actually have an action on them by what's called the Heke group of the month, July. So we're pretty sure this is the right presentation. This does too. Oh, I should also mention that none of the torque did. Oh, I should also mention that none of the torque generations here are K-poly stable, like in the SL2 case, but the T variety is. Oh, that's going to be cool. So there's 20 generators, there are 40 relations, and we've computed the tropical variety. So the tropical variety has 544 maximal cones and And 528 of them are what people in the torque degeneration community, but call prime and cones. So there's 528 counting rules for the conformal blocks for SL4. And what's really neat is that these numbers are both divisible by the order of the Hecke group. So we're pretty sure that up to the Heke transformations, there's That up to the Hecca transformations, there's like one bad degeneration, and then tons of really good ones. So, in particular, we can actually recover Rasmussen and Walton's counting rule as one of these degenerations. And we have an approach. I'm not going to call it a theorem yet. We have like a sequence of constructions which we're pretty sure does type A, gives a torque degeneration of type A. But that is perhaps for another time. That is perhaps for another time. So I think I'll finish there. How many orbits do you have up to date? I don't know that one.
