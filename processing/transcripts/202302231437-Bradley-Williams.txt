To all of the organisers for organising this wonderful meeting and also to all of the speakers so far. I found it a very inspiring meeting. The first time I've been to a dedicated neosebility conference, so yeah, really learned a lot. Okay, so yeah, and thanks to the previous speaker, it helped learn. I've chosen exactly the right notation, apparently, so I was already introduced. And right, okay, so this is in fact maybe it's a kind of a small side project with a, where we needed, we needed to build some storage-complete, yeah, well, we need to define some elementary extensions in the pencil minimal context. And so, yeah, I thought we decided to also maybe break this off and maybe advertise where these exist, because I mean, as we saw, they also come up. Okay, so okay, so I could complete just to go over this. Okay, so we'll completeness, just to go over this. So, this is saying that the, I mean, so we've got a valued field K, and the intersection of any non-empty chain of variative non-empty balls has a non-empty intersection. Good, and so maybe from outside, I mean, but analytically it's well behaved. So, for example, yeah, every strict I mean you're gonna a bank strict point theorem works. Yeah, and this is why they're better than just something else complete. Somehow are complete. Okay. And as we saw in the previous talk, they also in model theoretic theoretical context might want to find maximal for domination basis or something. Okay, so okay, yeah, so oh yeah, to fit with these the language from the previous talk was a large field is maximal if no proper third extension is immediate. And Kaplanski proved in the way he named these notions. Where you name these notions, that a field is maximum, I mean, it's a very field is maximal if only it's very complete. And so, yeah, easy facts. I mean, it's a photo field is Hence Helian. I mean, yeah, especially easy to see if you take the definition of Hencelian that we also just saw in the last talk. Okay, so, okay, so. So, okay, so for some examples, so it's classical ones. So, yeah, Harm fields, I mean, the value group gamma and the residue field K, and you take a generalized power series with order, with the support coming from gamma. So, these are maximal the piadics. And yeah, maybe something, so well, here, if we look at the And so, well, here, if we look at the algebraic closure of Qp, this is not even complete. So, this is a non-example. And even if you take the incompletion of the algebraic closure of Qp, this is not very good complete. So, this is an awkward situation. Because maybe you want to work on CP. So, okay, analysts also construct spherical completions of CP, yeah. And okay, but what we have in general, I mean, this goes back to the early theory of valued fields. Yeah, I mean, every value field omits some, sorry, to complete extension. Okay, but with model theorists, we like elementary extensions. You know, there's no reason, for example, I mean, here, for example, if k is not Hencelio, For example, if k is not Hencelian, the maximum immediate ascension is not going to be Hencedian, so it's certainly not going to be elementary. Yeah? So, good, okay, so, and well, another problem for us as model theorists is this, I mean, the notion of spherical completeness is, I mean, is certainly not an elementary property. Okay, so we want an elementary property, and which is often used, of definables very complex. Of definable spherical completeness. The natural, the natural, choose a natural thing, the intersection of a definable chain of value to pause is not empty. Okay, and well, I mean, fairly curiously, I mean, the easier way to usually to see that the theory is definably fairly complete is usually to point out that it has a fairly complete model. Yeah, so for A C V F. By definable you mean that the the the radiuses are from from a definable set or what? From a definable set, or by a definable set? A definable family of balls. Okay. Yeah, so, yeah, yeah. However, yeah, yeah, so maybe you can pick points and radii, but you can also just see as a definable family of sets. Okay, yeah, so the Hahn field C with a value group Q is a model of ACF00, so yeah, ACF00 is very complete. And again, so the Very complete. And again, so the motivating of the whole point is that sometimes people work in preso series. I've seen this in geometry. But I mean, maybe it seems much more nice to actually just work in the completion. Again, on a similar vein, RCVF is defined to be storied, because it has, I mean, the the tower the if you generalize tower series field field there is important. Okay, so okay, this is going into leading to the provocative question, so I'll be happy to hear if there are by the end of this, I'll put this at the beginning. So, if anyone has, by the end of this talk, any example, I would be happy to hear about it. Because maybe I'm slightly suspicious that maybe there is just some example, so I'd be very happy to hear about this. But maybe this is what's behind this short short paper with I mean oh yes, yes, this is all joint work with Emmanuel Hope Top. Joint work with the manual at the loop top, just a draw. And yeah, it's based on a short paper we have pulled this together. Okay, so does it go the other way? So does every definably spheric-complete expansion of a valued field have an actually spheric-complete elementary extension? This seems to be open, and yeah, and so far no one's giving me an example, even though I'm kind of suspicious that there should be one. I mean, a well-count example, right? Counter example, right? And okay, once you ask this question, you might also want the elementary immediate, but elementary, sorry, complete extension to be immediate. There's so many adjectives here. I keep on trying to catch them all. Okay, that's why it's good on road slides. Okay, good. So these are, yeah, so please, yeah, please, I'd like to have a dice question. Yeah, yeah. But the second bullet implies the first one. The second one is just yeah, exactly. The second one is just the second one in detail. What about the first one? Yeah, it's also an interesting, yeah, it's also an interesting question. I guess for applications, it's somehow nice to be able to move up. So, in this, I mean, okay, I guess the philosophy I've got here is that I want to move, when I want to prove something, it's something which is not a. something is something which is not a I want to move up to an elementary expansion I want to I want to make basically make my monster model also actually surface complete fully surrogate so yeah okay good point I would also be happy to do this so okay classical cases yeah okay so ACPF equipment is to zero while the residue field is algebraically closed and the boundary group is divisible then well as I keep saying the harm theory the harm Well, as I keep saying, the Hahn series field is very complete. And it's an immediate, but it's immediate. And it's an elementary extension by Robinson exponentization of ASICF. Similarly, for real closed value field, again, you take this same answer and for similar reasons, it's actually an elementary exception as well. And well, Hencelian valued fields are the model theory we like to do the ex-characterian Joseph. I mean, allows us to say if you've got a, so if you've got a Hencelian value, exocharotistic value field, again, this has the same residue field and the same value group, and so again, yeah, it's the answer. So, okay, very classical. Now, these are positions for answers to the second question, obviously. Yeah, these are positive cases. Yeah, all of these very classical cases. I mean, this was maybe before you even thought of asking this as a question. Yeah, I mean, these are, because, I mean, they already answered the strong situation. I mean, the reality is, we're what we're I mean, the question that's really coming up is really about the expansions. I mean, when you're working in some ex very sort of extrastructure. Valued field of extrastructure. Okay, in order to get onto, this is where the Hensel minimality comes in. This is a tamer's notion for expansions of Hencelian valid fields. And so, I'm going to be into Calfies and definitions. So, yeah, we haven't seen these yet already in this conference. So, yeah, the Rv sorts. So, this is a quotient of the valued field by the one plus the maximal ideal. Then you have the R V map, which is the natural canonical map there. RV fits into a short exact sequence of multiple groups here. Oh, well, maybe this is a written arrow piece. Yeah. Okay, and okay, I particularly like power series fields because, I mean, here, we can see this even more explicitly, this short X. Even more explicitly, the Schottky accepted sequence splits. So the Rv is then isomorphic to the direct product of the residue field of the value group. And so if you really want to be explicit, you really can say the Rv is encoding the value field, so the residue field information and the value group information. You can see it very explicitly there. Um good. Okay for to work in mixed characteristic we also need to do these these higher R V sorts. Oh, but I put I put zero I put zero into R V. Oh, I see. So I put zero here and I put zero there. So if I yeah, yeah, th I I get I sneak zero in all the places, yeah. I called this one, so I call this one. I'll be cross, yeah, yeah. And yeah, okay, yeah, okay, so it's been speak to the left and get the new version of it. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Okay, so yes, okay, so there's also higher R V sorts, so M M lamb a lambda is a is a, I mean, is Is the ideal of elements which are greater than, which have valuation greater than lambda. So it's also an ideal, so we can also quote them phi 1 plus this generalized ideal. And then we get an Rv lambda map, which is pushing up there. Okay, so this allows us to state the abstract definition here. So this is a. So, this is the Henson Minimality introduced by Raf Tuckers, Emmanuel Hooktok, and Sylvan Riedo. Yeah, well, published last year. It's been around for a while. Maybe with small changes in the definitions, converging, and now it has converged. And it's published. So, yeah. And, well, so there it is. So, there is this to read for when, but okay, maybe, maybe in order to, before you, yeah, if you haven't seen it before. If you haven't seen it before, maybe it's good to make an analogy with O-minimality, which is also how they like to motivate it. So of course, O-minimality is about expansions of the reals, not about value fields. But we could, I mean, and we all know that the expansion of the reals is o-minimal if and only if every definable set is a union of finitely many intervals and points. Intervals and points. Okay, so on the in one dimension. And the point is: okay, hence, so minimality is also a condition on definable subsets of one dimension. And well, usually we just say that, right? But what's appearing is, there's, I mean, in this definition, is a special finite definable set which allows you to control the interval, well, these, there are rather. The interval, well, these animals of intervals, which are variant balls that are appearing. Okay, so if you were to do this with our minimality, you could say that the, well, your structure is unminimal if, okay, so if this was a, so here is my, this is kind of R, this is my R squared, I mean, I'm defining my set via, I mean, so a typical set of. I mean, so typical setting looking like a polynomial here. And in one dimension, I've got, I'm just taking the stuff which is less than zero up to here, well, up to here, just this one point. Okay, so and instead of just saying it's the union of these intervals, I could say, okay, so this is a definable subset of R squared here, this graph here, this graph of g. G. And maybe it's definable with some parameters, which are the coefficients in the polynomial. So this is definable over A. And well, if I take these endpoints here, which are the roots of this polynomial, and C4, with just this finite information here, this finite set C here. These finite sets C here, which are definable with the same parameters. So C, which is definable also over the same parameters A, it's finite, and I just now say, well, the definable set X in one dimension is completely controlled by knowing, yeah, I mean, the interval between, whether the interval between two of these, well, whether each point is in the set X, and Is in the set X and whether the interval between the two points is either in the set or without the set. But each interval, just the information about where you lie in the interval, the whole interval, the open interval is either in the set X or out of the set X. And then you just have the endpoints. So this is maybe a curious way to define a minimality that the existence of this finite A definable set C, but See, but uh, can I maybe just suggest something that to me at least was clear when I was thinking about this? So, please. So, if just you look at the set in the original setting, if you look at the definite subset of the interval, and you then take the endpoints and you take an interval that is disjoint from this finite set of points, then either this set is contained in your definable Is contained in your definable set, or it is disjoint from your definable set. And this is precisely the analogy that you want to have, to keep in mind when defining Hanson minimality. This is precisely the definition. The only difference is that there's a very delicate issue about which parameters you're allowed to use in this definition. But this is the precise analogy. Once you have a definable subset of the field, you can follow. subset of the field, you can find a defined set of defined over well-controlled parameters such that every definable role that you have that is destroyed from this set is either contained in the set or in the original set you are in. To clarify, either contained in it or contains it. Okay, thanks. Yeah, very eloquently put. Exactly, yeah, and exactly this. Exactly, yeah. And exactly, this finite set C is exactly the one that Asap was talking about there. And that is really what I see as a critical point. And so, this is, I'm, I'm here, this is the, maybe the, this is the weakest version of Hensel minimality, which is defined by Dr. Totrup and Benrideau, and that's because what we proved only requires the the weakest condition, which is called zero H minimal. So I guess we'll hear more about the the stronger the stronger versions. There are stronger versions in the next talk. Yeah, so here for any parameter set A, if you have a definable subset X, which is allowed to use A, but also arbitrary parameters from Rv, there exists this finite A-definable controlling set C, playing the role of the set C from the unminimality analog there, such that whether a point in one dimension lies in the definable set A. lies in the triangle set X depends only on the tuple of images with I mean the different the R V coordinates with respect to those finitely many points C yeah the point is fibers of the R V map are valuative balls yeah it is a property of the theory and I yeah it's probably a property And now, yeah, it's actually a property of the theory, and yeah, yeah, you can make a definition and you define it. So, actually, yeah, I've made it in a slightly lattice definition here. Okay, so this is actually characteristic zero. Maybe we'll go through this quickly. I mean, so you can see it is there. There's also a version in mixed characteristic, yeah, in the Henson minimality 2 with a further author Bremehlen here, and this is what. And this is what which requires using the higher using higher RV sorts there. But again, this is the same thing. So it's not published yet, like this. It's not published yet. No, this is still on the archive. So it should be 4023 plus? Well, this isn't. No, yeah, good. So yeah, so examples, interesting examples exist. So NCD and valued fields of, well, so in epic characteristic zero examples. So in the echo characteristic zero examples, pure value fields, they are zeroh minimal. Even stronger, there's something, even better version, but we're not going to define that. But also, interesting expansions by analytic structure. And in the mixed characteristic situation, again, Enceladian pure value fields are 0h minimal in a sense. Distance and allowing expansion by analytic structure and finite field extensions of Qp with sub-analytic structure. So these are nice expansions. There's also some other examples that I sit in later. Good. Okay, and hence, in the first paper, they proved that hence minimality has good properties up to expansions and things. So any echo characteristic zero field which is zero field, which is Henzel minimal, is Hencelian, so that's nice. And something that's good to know all the way along here is that Henzominality is stable under expansions either by constants from the valued field K or by arbitrary expansion of structure from any of the R B sorts. So it's kind of quite flexible. I mean, this is also allowing you to, I mean, any handillion filled with arbitrary. I mean, any Hantidian field with arbitrary structure when it's going from the RV source. And just as a remark, although I didn't define them, zero H minimality is the weakest in notion that they define in the excharacteristic setting. And zero H mixed minimality is, again, the weak it was, well, the weakest almost yeah, the weakest yeah in a hierarchy of the of the of these of these. Of the of the of these properties in the mixed vector, it's per se. Okay. Okay, and uh just to point out, there's an open problem here in the paper published last year, is while it's expected that these implications can't be reversed, actually any examples are being requested. It's actually not actually known that they are actually separated. Okay, so looking at the time, oh good, I put the theorem in early enough. Okay, so our theorem here is. Okay, so our theorem here is a positive answer to the provocative question. If we have an expansion of a characteristic zero-valued field, which is either mixed characteristic with zero H minimal theory, or mixed characteristic and finitely runified, which is essential in our proof, and in the zip zero here. 0H mixed minimal. Then, yeah, we have a positive answer. We have an n-liter extension which is immediate and storative complete. Any questions? Yeah? Yeah, okay, just yeah. Yeah, um any yeah, zero age minimality. Any, yeah, zero-H minimality. Zero-H minimality in the characteristic equity characteristic zero setting is already proven to imply definable storical completeness as a theory. And yeah, I mean, in our paper, we also proved... So in the mixed characteristic setting, it's turned out not to be true. We have an example which is not finitely ramified, 08 mix minimal, but not definitely straight to complete. So this is actually saying that we need to impose something. This is why we. That we need to impose something. This is why we impose finite ramification. Okay, but if you impose finite ramification, you do prove the final spectral continuum. I have a question. So in the is the second theorem proven by corresponding trick to reduce the first theorem? No, it's actually no, it's actually it's actually yeah. I mean totally different. It's not really totally different. I mean it the as as the the definition is is in analogy with the definition here. Definition here, we could end up, we could, we could uh alter the same proof and uh be a bit more technical and keep track of some indices to you know to prove it. So kind of we run the proof twice. I wouldn't run, yeah. I think it might not be possible to do it just by course settings because of, I mean, especially because of this situation in the Catalan, like the country example. I would, yeah, okay. Okay. So, ah, yeah, okay, so, yeah. I've can sketch out the proof if you believe this lemma. So, what we do is we've got so I'm writing the proof in the characteristic zero context. We've got k, which we assume to be zero eight minimal. We are going to work inside an elementary extension, and uh the big tool here is. The big tool here is if we take a pseudo-Cauchy limit over k, this means it's an element which is, say it's an element of n, which doesn't lie in k, but gets arbitrarily closed in evaluation to element in k. And if you take the algebraic closure in the model theoretic sense in the field sort of k together with this any pseudo-coach, any one particular pseudo-cauchy limit, alpha. Particular pseudo-Cauchy limit alpha, then it turns out it's actually equal to definable closure. I mean, under hence the minimality, it turns out to be the definable closure. And it turns out that L is, well, an elementary extension of K and also inside M and without it changing the Rv, which is another way of saying it's a medium. And so in particular, L, this L, which In particular, L, this L which we construct here, is a proper immediate elementary extension of K. And that's exactly what we need to run our argument. So except this lemma, which is where we also use hence the minimality condition directly in this, particularly for proving the elementary extension here, for checking. Okay, good. So what do we do? We take a saturated enough. Saturated enough elementary extension N. We're working inside this M. We take N to be a maximal elementary submodel of M, which is just an electronic extension of K and a medium over K, having the same Rv. And so by Zorn, there's a maximal one, subject to being. Being subject to these conditions. And then we can run a contradiction. And assuming if n were not very complete, it'll have a chain of balls which has empty intersection. But being a chain of balls, so in n, let's say it has empty intersection, but being a chain of balls, which you could actually spell out by some elements and some. Elements and some radii. So that determines, so it's consistent, it's partially consistent, it determines a partial type over n. So it's not realized in n, but, yeah, but n is saturated enough that it is realized in n. Okay? And it is a pseudo-Cauchy limit by, you know, by construction. By construction here, by the shrinking radii here of the B. And so the applying now the lemma, we have an L, which is a proper immediate elementary extension of N in M. Okay, and that's a contradiction to the maximality of N. Okay, so I squeezed in my proof. Any questions there? Okay. Okay. Oh, yes, yeah. Thanks. So, yeah, just to, yeah. Yeah, just to, yeah, we can also preserve kappa saturation in this construction with an addendum. And I just wanted to make sure to point out there was also Elliot Kaplan, who is here. In fact, yeah, I mean, already knew this. So T power-bounded T complex expansions of K are also tensor-minimal in this setting. So they fall within the scope of the theorem. The scope of the theorem. Elect Katvan already knew this, and in fact, something stronger, they have a unique, there is then a unique story-complete immediate elementary extension. Okay, so that gives rise to the uniqueness question, can we indeed in this just under Hennon's minimality conditions can we uh yeah get to uniqueness? And here's the the questions I mainly wanted to advertise with the talk. Mainly wanted to advertise with the talk. Yeah, so what's also there remaining is we impose this finite ramification, but one can just ask actually, it's still open then, whether with just imposing defined rules very called completeness, you would get a positive answer. So, thank you very much. Questions for Debbie? Yeah, in a structured way, yeah, depending on the expansion. My question is, why would you want to think that uh there might be a spherically why would you think that in the topic at this question we can have one another? Well okay, well there's a there's a there's a so because there's a potential yeah, I mean everything I know I have two and then everything I really know I have two as well as one but then this example that I was hinting at where of um you know where you take the the completion of the The completion of the algebraic closure of QP, at least where I've seen, so actually maybe someone can inform me here, but when I've seen it, when it's done by the analysts, they take some ultra power and construct inside an ultra power the spherical completion, but a spherical completion there. But that certainly has a, they're certainly not immediate because they really fill up with this with a super. Because they really fill up with this with the super with the larger ultra power that they take, they fill up the value group. Like, for example, you've got a value value group of q before and they fill it up really to the whole part, to like half. So, yeah. Are we learning algebra to draft? So I don't know, yeah, but it could be that yeah. In the coffee break, we'll meet again at 3:30.
