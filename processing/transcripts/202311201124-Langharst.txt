That this is a joint work with Matthew Fredelisi, Bakshi Manaman, and Arim Savovic. Okay, so we know what convexity is, blah blah, we know what convex bodies are, we know what Mukowski summation is, here's nice pictures. I want to jump ahead. Okay, so our story starts here. So, my co-authors, they showed this following result. So, I skipped the notation, but volume subscript n will denote for me the Lebesgue measure on Rn. They showed that volume is super modular. Is super modular. You can kind of think of it as like a triangle inequality. So I take three convex bodies, and then I look at the volume of A plus the volume of the Minkowski sum of A plus B plus C. And it turns out this is greater than or equal to the volume of A plus B plus the volume of A plus C. So our story kind of starts with this result by my co-authors. So I want to first mention: how would you go about proving this result? This result. So, first we recall for an arbitrary Borel set k, if I multiply k by some non-negative number t, then the volume is n homogeneous, so the t pops out to the power n. But if I restrict volume as a functional to convex bodies, we learn much more. So Minkowski tells us that if I look at, say, three convex bodies, k1, k2, and k3, and then I look at the Minkowski sum of T1, K1 plus T2, K2 plus T2, T3, K3. I can actually expand this as a homogeneous polynomial. So I sum over all the different ways to pick the different bodies. And we denote the coefficients of this polynomial as the mixed volume. So some quick properties of the mixed volume. If all of the arguments are the same, then you get the volume of k. And also the mixed volume is symmetric. By symmetric, I mean if I switch like ki1 and ki2, it's the same number. And also its translation. Same number. And also, it's translation invariant. So I can move any of the bodies in the argument. And also, it has this nice monotonicity principle that if K is a subset of L, and then what I have here, I have, I should have mentioned that, you know, or emphasized here there are n bodies in the argument. And so say I fix bodies 2 through n, and then I have my body K. If K is inside L, then the mixed volume gets bigger. It's monotonic with respect to set inclusion. With respect to set inclusion. Now, this notation in our context is a pretty bad notation, so I want to introduce a nice cleaner notation. Say I have these m dummy bodies, and then I have a fixed body k that has to appear n minus m times. We'll use this notation, so the dummy bodies are still there. And then next to the k that appears more than once, I write n minus m. So under this notation, plus using these properties, whatever I switch them, it's the These properties, order, if I switch them, it's the same number. This awful polynomial, or hard to digest in this form, becomes much prettier. You get these binomial coefficients, the number of ways I can arrange the bodies. And then I have, for example, next to k, the number of times k1, the number of times it appears, is the same as the exponent on t1. And similarly for k2 and k3. So I sum over all the ways to pick k2 and k3, which says j and k, and that means k1 has to appear n minus. And that means k1 has to appear n minus j minus k times. So the total number of bodies in the argument of the mixed volume is always n. I want to even focus on more special cases. If one body appears n minus one times and another body just appears once, I'm just going to write VKL. And similarly, if one body appears n minus two times and a second body appears once and a third body appears once, I write V of ABC. Okay, so to establish the supermodularity result, what you simply do is you expand each of these as a polynomial, and you compare coefficient by coefficient, and it essentially reduces down to known inequalities after a little bit of work on those binomials about the mixed volume. So, what is our main question? Our main question was: we want to replace volume with some Borel measure mu. Specifically, we'll pick a Radon measure, so I should remind you. We'll pick a radon measure, so I should remind you that means it's locally finite. If we allow compact sets of infinite size, it's kind of not interesting. And we also want it to be interregular, so I can approximate from within by cubes. So we want to establish which radon measures on our end are super modular. And it turns out this is actually connected to a completely different story point, because it's not completely different, but it seems a little bit tangential. So I remind you of surface area. You a surface area. If I have a convex body K and I add to it a dilate of B2N, and I have my new convex body K plus TB2N, and say I wanted to look at the volume of this guy. Well, I see my original convex body K is inside of it, so definitely the volume of K will contribute. Now, I have this annulus here. We see at the corners of the vertices of the K, because K here is a polygon, I get kind of a T squared error, which actually Of a t squared error, which actually you can see it's emphasized, the error will sum up to be the volume of the ball, which then leaves just these rectangles. Now, I don't know the area of the individual rectangles, but I know that they have width t and the sums of their lengths is the surface area or the perimeter of our polytope. So, in general, we see that the volume of k plus t v 2 2, so v2m for me will be the ball, and here we're in the plane, is the volume of k plus the volume of the primary. Is the volume of k plus the volume of the perimeter of k times t plus some error? And this is true for every t. So I can rearrange, and I get this nice pretty formula. And then this is true, nothing special about the plane here. This is true in Rn. And in fact, you can actually take this, in the case of convex bodies, as the definition of the volume of the surface here. It's precisely this kind of variation on the volume of k. On the other hand, On the other hand, we know from Minkowski's polynomial that the volume of k plus the dilate of the ball is precisely this pretty formula. If I combine the two, we see everything except the linear term in the polynomial is going to go away. We are left with that the surface area of k is nothing more than n times the mixed volume of k with the ball. In fact, in general, in some literature, you'll see the mixed volumes as called like You see the mixed volumes as called the surface area of K with respect to L. I want to remind you that we showed that the mixed volumes are monotonic with respect to set inclusion. If K is a subset of L, then that means using this formula that the surface area of K is less than the surface area of L. So I need to set up some background to show how this surface area story is. To show how the surface area story is going to be related to the supermodularity story. So, first, we have this classical definition from kind of the theory of metric measure spaces. So, I have some Borel measure mu on our n, and I have some Borel set K, which for us will be a convex one. Then we can define the Minkowski content of K with respect to mu, which we're going to call the weighted surface area measure, as we simply take that formula for surface area in the volume case and replace volume by mu. And replace volume by μ. But we're not so bold to claim that for an arbitrary Borel set K, the limit exists, so you put limit. So this is a very classical formula. Every time in the talk, I try to give a list of names of people that have studied this in the case of convex bodies. Almost always I miss a name and then someone in the audience says, you didn't mention my favorite person. So I decided to be egotistical and mention no one but myself. Mention no one but myself. And also, as far as I am aware, in the context of convex bodies, this is the most general result. So I showed with Lumina Kribanos that if K is a convex body, the mu is a density phi that contains the boundary of K in its Borel set, then the lim is a limit, and you precisely get that you're just integrating over the boundary of K with respect to the density. This is the Hausdorff measure. So this extends the result by Lipschitz, who had done it previously for continued. The result by Lipschitz, who had done it previously for continuous densities. So, with this kind of setup, I want to introduce a result that came out very, very recently, just like two, three months ago on the archive. So, these two Italian mathematicians, okay, there's no Italians in the audience, I want to write, what are the names? Don't we know? Sarcucho and Stefani, they showed the following: Let mu be a Borel measure. Let μ be a Borel measure on Rn with continuous density that has the following property. If K is a subset of L, then that the weighted surface area of K is less than the weighted surface area of L. So mu has this property. They show then mu must be the Lebesgue measure. So this property, this monotonicity of surface area with respect to set inclusion actually characterizes Lebesgue. Actually, it characterizes Lebesgue. So, how is this connected to the story of supermodular? Okay, so just a terminology. I'm going to use the word class. So, for me, I say a collection of browse sets is a class if it's closed under summation and dilation. So, we saw in the proof of supermodularity, we had these mixed volumes. And we would sure like to reuse mixed volumes and the Mixed volumes and the weighted version of those are the mixed measures. So, as far as I'm aware, they first appear in quistoline a paper by Emmanuel Millman and Ron Rotum, and they were first formally defined this way by Lena Lipschitz. So, mu is a braw measure, a support on a class of brau sets, the NCC. Then we define the mixed measure of K and L with respect to mu as just, again, you take the formula for mixed volume, replace volume with mu, and then we're not so bold to say the limit exists. Exist. And for us, fancy C will always be a class of convex sets, maybe sometimes symmetric, maybe sometimes zonoids. If you don't know what those are, don't worry about it. Just in general, C will be a class of convex sets. And it turns out the lim if in this case always exists. So again, this was shown by Lifshitz whenever the density was continuous. And if the boundary of k is in the Lebesgue set of the density, the limit exists. But then you can flip this. But then you can flip this and say that you can remove this condition as long as you understand that by phi, you mean the Lebesgue differentiation representative of phi. The limit always exists for every cat. As long as phi is understood the correct phi. Just to connect this story, we have the weighted surface area of k is nothing but the mixed measure of k with the ball. Okay, so here's finally the connection. So ignore the words for a moment. Ignore the words for a moment. So, here's the formula for supermodularity. And I'm going to, as you can probably see from the setup, I'm going to show it's equivalent to something. So, first, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my three convex bodies, A, B, and C, and we're going to be very general. We're going to say A comes from some class fancy A, and B comes from some class fancy B, and C comes from some class fancy C. And all we require is that fancy B and fancy C are a subset of And fancy C are a subset of fancy A. So, for example, maybe fancy A is all convex bodies, and fancy B and C are only symmetric convex bodies. So, we show that supermodularity, written in this way, where we can take the bodies from different classes, is equivalent to this monotonicity of mixed measures. So, is equivalent to the mixed measure of A plus C mixed with B is greater than or equal to the mixed measure of A mixed with B. And if I take the fancy class. If I take the fancy class B to be dilates of the Euclidean ball, now it looks very similar to what the Italian guys did. Because now it becomes the weighted surface area of A plus C is greater than or equal to the weighted surface area of A. So this is kind of the local form because you take a derivative and it's kind of the first coefficient in the Taylor series expansion instead of a McCasky polynomial. So we're going to look So, we're going to look at this state version of the problem here, and we're not going to work on this inequality, we're going to work at this one. So our main theorem is let mu be a radon measure on Rn such that for every k in compact convex set L you have this multinicity. Then mu must be a multiple of the Lebesgue measure. Now you might stop, maybe this result stop an Maybe this result is actually implied by the Italian guys. But if you open up their proof and you look at the bodies they constructed that forced their measure to be Lebesgue, it was not of the form K plus L and K. So they're disjoint. Now maybe you might ask, okay, maybe this result improves on theirs. Well no, because the L we took did not contain the origin, which means k plus L doesn't contain Origin, which means k plus L doesn't contain A. So it's not nested. So this theorem is destroyed from what the Italian guides did. However, in spirit, I do want to mention just a hint towards the proof, that what we did was we took L and we showed that we could shift it. It's an arbitrary compact-convex set. And so you can move it around, in which case you're showing to use some curse words, it's a continuous translation invariant valuation. Valuation. So, therefore, I mean, we didn't write it that way, but like in spirit, we looked at it and we're like, ah, I see what we did. So, you show it must be the surface area. Now, using the fact that, remember there's a hidden mixed with the ball here, you know, we can then use the fact that dilates of the ball is the subset of all convex bodies to then go from here to here. So, like, I can take this class, this fancy B, which Class this fancy B, which is just dilutes of the Euclidean ball, and say it's a subset of this fancy B, which is, say, all convex bodies. And then now we're in this one, and then I can go from two to one, and we get precisely what we wanted. If mu is a random measure that is super modular of the class of all convex bodies, then it must be a multiple of the Lebesgue measure. So this property characterizes Lebesgue. But now we would like. But now we would like to bridge the gap between us and the two Italian mathematicians. Essentially, we want to pin L, so it has to contain the origin. So this is my open question to all of you. If I add this extra requirement to L, that it has to contain the origin, do we still get the characterization of the Lebesgue measure? And if that's true, this would both prove our main theorem and the main theorem from the two Italian mathematicians. The main theorem from the two Italian mathematicians. So it generalizes both. Because under this assumption, k plus L contains k, so it's nested, and it's obviously of the form of the main theorem. But something's very, very peculiar. So it's an open question, which means we couldn't solve it. So then we said, okay, what if L is also symmetric? Then believe it or not, we were able to construct a measure that satisfies the inequality. So it wasn't looking. And it was the easiest measure possible. And it was the easiest measure possible. It was just, you're in the plane, keep life easy, keep it in the plane. And we just took the measure whose density is the norm of x squared. Then it's true, I can take an arbitrary convex body k and a symmetric convex compact set L, and the inequality will hold. And it only has to contain the origin, it doesn't have to be symmetric about the origin. So another way to write it is it's a zoonoid, but it's a zoonoid. It's a zoanoid, but it's a zoanoid that doesn't centered at the origin. It has to contain the origin, but unnecessarily centered. So a hint towards the proof, it suffices to show it just for a line segment, because every spectral convex party in a plane is a zone. I gave this talk at Manchester Ferdinand University a month ago, and at this point I was done. But then someone in the audience asked, here there is a hidden mixed There's a hidden mixed with the b the B2N. If I switch to the notation of mixed measures, there's a mixed with B2N here. Can I replace that B2N with an arbitrary symmetric convex plot? And maybe this theorem would still hold, which would maybe suggest the open question is false. So we were like, that's a good idea. Let's try it. And the most amazing thing happened. When we did that, we got the characterization of the big bag. Back. So if we take B to be, so we're in our end, so it's a centered zonoid, and C to be a zonoid between the origin, and then we realized in our proof A wasn't any convex body, it only had to be symmetric, then we get mu as a constant of the Lebesgue measure. So this opening question is very delicate. It seems like it wants to be Lebesgue, but there are a few counterexamples. And finally, I just wrote this in. And finally, I just wrote this in a different way. So if μ has the supermodularity where A is B and C are from the classes I just mentioned, then μ is lucky. Anyway, that's all I have. Thank you so much. Any initial questions? So, the Italian guys, I think, they also constructed counter-examples to this. If you can see their anisotropic perimeter as a period, right? They did, it would show that there exist measures that they, yeah, so it's very instead of the volume take something else. So, do you have some result in your notion of rig? Will we have this one, you mean? No, no, but this is the opposite. This is an organization that it has to be the bad point. Maybe you have interesting examples of measures where which satisfy Where which satisfy for me that's this one? This is a measure that satisfies the anisotropic perimeter. Oh no, I didn't we didn't look in the other. So I'm saying is that maybe for anisotropic perimeter case we get some pitch family of some we didn't look at. That's a good idea. I would like to see the sliding M or the question. Thank you for asking. I wanted to talk about it, but it was a bit tangential. So I wanted to. So I just wanted a hint towards how we prove this is you write. This is you write k, it can be written as a set of xt such that g of x is less than t left of f of x, where g is some concave function, or convex function f is some concave function. And then what you do is you can rotate, so we don't care about g per se. So we are essentially looking at our concave function f, and we're on the boundary of our convex body that's parametrized by our concave function f. Now, in this formula, Now in this formula, I wrote it over the where here. In this formula, what happens if I push it to the sphere? Then the Gauss map is going to appear. That's what I'm trying to get towards. So in the proof, the Gauss map appears. And when you parameterize your convex body with a function f, then the Gauss map is related to the derivative, if you're in the plane, of your one-dimensional. If you're in the plane, of your one-dimensional function f. So it became an inequality just about concave functions and their derivatives. That's what we proved. In the higher dimension, the derivative gets replaced by the gradients squared of your concave function. And you can do something interesting. I can take a concave function where the gradient squared behaves very differently than, say, the partial derivative in the x1 direction. They behave very differently. In the x1 direction. They behave very differently. And then I take a convex body that's focused mostly in the x1 direction, like 0, 1 with just other stuff, 0, epsilon stuff. So then since the gradient behaves very differently than the partial derivative, you can show that the inequality will be. Other questions? Oh, let's go. Okay, on the schedule we have a guided tour of the Banner Center. It's canceled.
