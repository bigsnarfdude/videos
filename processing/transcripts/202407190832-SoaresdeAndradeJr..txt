First of all, I'd like to thank all the organizers who invited me. I really regret that I couldn't do this trip. I'm very sorry for that, but I hope that I'll be able to do it. If it happens again very soon, that would be very nice. Well, I have a lot of sponsors, as you can see here, but this one is the most important at the moment. The Research Council of Norway, Poor Lab, they do this inter-part. Do this inter-part project that we have together with Alex and Taulo. So, I'm going to talk about flow through three-dimensional self-affined structures. And I have a lot of motivation to talk about here. So, of course, this is important for the oil industry. Fracture networks and carbonates are very important and they influence a lot of the efficiency and the effectiveness. Efficiency and the effectiveness of the recovery of hydrocarbons of oil. So it's important to understand how fluid navigates through these complex structured systems. The most important thing is, of course, people are still wondering how to upscale. First of all, how to introduce the network, the hybrid network in a poor network model. This is not an easy task. So it's important to understand factors in the sense of that. Unfortunately, I could not introduce the name no neutral. Introduce the name no-Newtonian in my talk. Although I have a lot of work on that, but this is one of the perspectives of our work to introduce non-Newtonian fluids on the top of the things that we have already made. So just to make this very short, the important thing of our seminar here is, as far as I understand, is that we are working with self-affined structures which are somehow present in nature and can be even qualified and quantified. Even qualified and quantified. We want to introduce inertial effects. This is not original. Some people in the audience already did that. So we would like to see different features of this phenomenon and how this interplays with the geometry of the system that we want to study, to investigate. Okay? So I will go. I have to go point by point. I hope you don't mind. So, first of all, this problem is divided. So, first of all, this problem is divided in three parts. The first one is the morphology or the geometry, if you want, and the flow properties in fractal rocks. So, I will speak about that generally. So, it is generally accepted that the morphology of fractures, they follow self-affined scattering laws. What does it mean? It means that by rescaling the in-plane vector in a fracture like that, in a structure like that, the out-of-plane coordinate needs to be rescaled like we do in homogeneous. Like we do in homogeneous functions of a given order in thermodynamics, for the surface to remain statistically invariant in terms of its geometrical properties. So the homogenization factor here is the scaling exponent age, which is called the Hearst exponent point. Most of you already know about that. So from the practical point of view, there was this idea that rock fractures would have a unique exponent. Exponent and this unique exponent, which could be perhaps universal, it's not recent, very recent, and also less recent work indicate already that some natural fracture systems exhibit values which range from, for instance, 0.45, 0.85. It depends very much on the material as well as the fracturing process at which it has been subjected. So now I go a little bit for generality. Now I go a little bit for generalities on the phase flow that you also know, but it's important that we remember it. So in a single phase flow in a fractured rock, it's usually, and it can be characterized like we do in flow in Poros Media in terms of Darcy's law, which simply defines this linear relationship between the mean flow velocity u and the pressure drop across the system. So this is only valid when you don't have inertial effects, which means that you must be in. That you must be in the Stokes law, in which inertial effects are not important at vection or inertial, if you may. So, Darcy's law can also be used as a macroscopic measure for a fracture in terms of its flow at low, very low Reynolds number. So, it's a good approximation, as I said, when the Reynolds number is smaller than one, and when the aperture of the fracture, the distance between the Of the fracture, the distance between its surfaces, for instance, if we talk about three-dimensional ones, is usually taken as the aperture of the fracture and HO is the density of the fluid. Sorry. So it's important to understand the interplay between the geometry, as I already said, and the flow inside the fracture. So if this is important, we have to examine local aspects of the surface roughness with the relevant mechanisms of moment and v-scope and inertial forces. Viscouse and inertial forces. So, basically, this is, if I could say, the novel part of the work in the sense that many people have done a lot of things as I'm going to show you to you now. Okay. So, for instance, Stefan Wu and Alex Hansen in 93, they studied some, they put this title some physical properties of self-affined rough surfaces. They published that in Europhysic Letters. And they found that they. Physical letters, and they found that the influence of surface roughness on the flow inside a fracture can be predicted that the permeability, if it's a self-affined, should scale with the length of the system, a sc which is the permeability of the system, to the size of the system up to the power 2h. So this result is based on a very interesting assumption that the fracture behaves like a system of parallel plates and it has an effective aperture w which can vary. An aperture W which can vary and the self-affinity implies that this aperture should be a function of L to the power h and the permeability itself should go with the aperture to the square following the solution of the Stokes equation. So Alex is also present in this one. So together with Sketne and Gudmundson, they studied already the role of inertial. They studied already the role of inertial fluid flow through, in this case, two-dimensional self-ho-finite function. And their numerical simulations showed that when the radius number is small, but not so small, you can already identify, describe the system in terms of weak inertia. But if you increase the radius from small to moderate, you can already detect inertial effects, which could be described at the time in 1998 by the Forsheimer equation, about which I will talk about. About which I will talk about in a minute. And finally, there is a work by Lohan, Tallon, Arodot, and Alex again that they conjecture that the permeability in this paper, of physical review, is controlled by the minimum aperture of the fracture. And found that in two-dimensional flows, the permeability should follow a power law relation in which the exponent, with the aperture of the fracture itself, with an exponent which should be equal to theoretically. Which should be equal to theoretically 3 minus 1 over h. So they did numerical simulations to find out that this exponent is indeed close for h equals 0.8 and for h equal to 0.3. So somehow they could prove their theory for Stokes flow. So now we come with this work. We published that during the pandemics the flow through three-dimensional self-affined. I could not find photographs of everybody of the paper. Photographs of everybody of the paper, but my main collaborators are Umberto Carmona, Hans-JÃ¶rg Siebold. I could not find pictures of Francisco Leandro nor Francisco Nepon Luceno and Astranio Arau, but they are all friends and they have worked equally in this paper that I'm going to follow to show you. So if I may start describing the geometry, as I said to you, we start by describing the geometry, the surface generation of our problem. So what do we do? We have three-dimensional numerical domains. We do we have a three-dimensional numerical domain, which is a volume identified by two identical self-affined surfaces, and they represent the fracture. The surfaces have been displaced perpendicular to the mean surface plane. So there is no displacement with these two. So the fracture aperture in our fracture, for simplification, of course, is constant throughout the numerical domain. So it doesn't fall in the class of problems that Talon and Alex and Aurora. And our old studied when they found out that everything can be controlled for the minimum aperture of the system. So, what do we do in order to generate self-affine structures? We use a scaling relation so that we can recover it. In this scaling relation here, sigma z to the square is the mean square increment for points separated by distance L in the system that you are analyzing. The system that you are analyzing. Z of R defines the elevation of the wall surface. So we are simply generating one of the walls, and then we will duplicate that and separate them by an aperture W. And R is the vector in the XY plane. So if you know about self-affine structures, you may understand that surfaces which age is smaller than 0.5 are spatially anti-correlated, while for age larger than 0.5, they are longer age, spatially positive. They are long-range, positively spatial correlated. They are present this type of correlations. For the case of age equal to 0, 5, we obtain the ordinary Brownian motion surfaces formed by successive uncorrelated increments. So this is how we generate our surface. And the discrete fractional Brownian surfaces with a given exponent, we generate them using a Fourier filtering method in which we induce the correlations. Induce the correlations spatially and we then deconvolute them to generate the surface in real space. Just for you to have an idea, all the fractures realizations, because we did averages, have an aperture equal to 40. The system size is square, a large L of the system is 500. And we wanted to compare different values of age in our simulation. So, in order to do that, we fixed the sigma z, which is the amplitude. Sigma z, which is the amplitude of the surfaces in relation with their roughness, by making, for instance, sigma z equal to five. Everything is in dimensionless units. So in this way, we are working with a ratio between the amplitude of the surfaces and the aperture of the fractures equal to of the order of one eighth for all simulations independent of age. And then we expect that that would make them comparable in our. Make them comparable in a way. So now I go for the flow dynamics. So, what we do here, we have to solve the Navier-Stokes equation under isothermal and steady state conditions. The momentum and mass conservations are those that I put here in red, and where U is the velocity vector, P is the pressure scar, and O is the density of the fluid, respectively. So, we applied known slip boundary conditions at the top and bottom. Boundary conditions at the top and bottom walls, which are the surfaces themselves. The fluid is injected in the x direction at the inlet. Using, for that, we use a uniform velocity profile with amplitude u. And we impose a constant pressure, defines the outlet boundary condition at x equal to L. So we also use laterally symmetrical boundary conditions to minimize finite size effects on the lateral dash distance. Effects on the lateral distance. So we did simulations using an open source code, the open form, which uses finite element volumes. And the meshes have to be, in order to understand the interplay between the surface, the roughness of the interface, and the bulk, we had to use very large meshes. I mean, not so large compared to what computers can do nowadays. But for instance, for Asia, what is 0.8, which is a less rough surface, we had to use an amount. Phase, we had to use an amount of 8 million cells, while for age equals 3, which is a very rough surface, we had to go up to 15 million cells. And finally, for each value of age, we went from the range of 0.3 to 0.9 in terms of age. We had to use at least five realizations to see if the ensemble would generate availabilities which were reasonable. And also, we could go from Reynolds numbers very small, 0.01. Very small, 0.01, basically in the Stokes regime, to Reynolds number which were moderate and large, for instance, 500. So these are typical examples of a fracture joint calculated for Reynolds equal to 100 and an exponent which is equal to 0.8 in figure A and equal to 0.5 in figure B. So as you can see, we also put the string lines on the top of the left and we colored them according. And we color them according to the local velocity magnitude. So, as you can see, when the situation is rough, you have much more deviations from the average of the velocity field. This is a normalized magnitude of the velocity as compared to the less rough surfaces, which are h equal to 0.8. So, it's interesting to see what happens in a cross-section of these two fractures. The cross-section is indicated here. The cross section is indicated here, as you can see, this shadowed cross section. So, when you do that, you see that for h equal to 0.8, the cross section is exactly in the middle of the system in the direction of the flow. You can see that for h equal to 0.8, the fluctuations in the local velocity are smoother, as you can see. Okay, but remember that the amplitude of the fluctuations is equals to the same in both situations and the maximum. In both situations, and the maximum velocity near the center of the channel approximately goes to the 3u divided by 2, which is the limiting case for parallel plates when you calculate that analytically. So the surface is smooth, but you see some shadow close the surface. So the effect of the roughness already becomes transparent. So it is very different from what you see for low. For low values of age or rougher. So, due to continuity, you have regions of higher velocities, which are clearly more confined at the center. And these zones of all those stagnated flow close to the walls, they broaden compared to the figure that I showed at h equal to 0.8. So, the velocity magnitudes, as a consequence, go up to 2.5 U, going a little bit far away from the expected value. Bit far away from the expected value for parallel plates, of course. So, now what do we do? We did some we did simulations for different values of age, as I said, and different Reynolds number up to 500, and we calculated up to cubic order corrections what we call the Forschimer equation for all of them. So, it can be written like that. So, instead of Darcy's law, which is the first term here, which only The first term here, which only includes the first term, you also add corrections to second and third orders in terms of the amplitude of the macroscopic velocity of the system. So alpha in the system is equal to one over the permeability. So it corresponds to the reciprocal of the permeability. And beta and gamma, beta and gamma are the coefficients of the second and third order corrections, respectively. As you can see, as you can see, up to a certain point, Up to a certain point, Reynolds number equals 10 or something like that, or 50, you see that there is a you go from a regime of which is typically Darcy's law to a regime in which inertia becomes important in all of them. In all of them. So the roughness somehow has a very important role played to induce inertial effects, which corresponds to the path in which the hydraulic conductance is not. The hydraulic conductance is not constant. The hydraulic conductance can be written in terms of this way. So I have to rewrite it. If I may, write G, which is the hydraulic conductance, is a dimensional measure for the hydraulic conductance. You can rewrite them in terms of these values in which you have G equal to alpha W to the power 2, and then the Reynolds number comes in a first order correction in a second. A first order correction in a second order correction. Okay, so as you can see here, when you do that, so you can also calculate G in terms of Reynolds and see the effect of inertia in the system, the breakdown of Darcy's law. So, now what do we do? We go for the low regime of Reynolds number. Let's try to analyze this regime here in which the Reynolds number is small and in Reynolds number is small, and in which Darcy's law or Stokes flow can be still whole. Okay, so when you do that for low Reynolds number, the hydraulic conductance is dominated by the viscous terms. In other words, the permeability as itself. So which decreases monotonically with the Hearst exponent. So as you increase the Hearst exponent, the system becomes less rough. So it approaches the value of alpha equal to 12 divided by W squared. Divided by the w squared for large values of alpha, which means that systems which are very, very low, have very, very low roughness. And this is consistent with the Piezel flow between two parallel plates, which is exactly this dashed line here on the bottom. So, but the system, as you increase age, would, and this corroborates our numerical simulations in a sense, go to the system of a parallel plates as the roughness decreases. But it's interesting to see that at this point, But it's interesting to see that at this point, okay, we can perhaps try to do some geometrical model to understand what's going on. For instance, if we use the very same assumption that Alex and other people used in terms of the system observed as a set of parallel plates with varying angles. And then in this case, it's possible to calculate. I will not go into the details of that, only if you ask, but if it's That only, if you ask, but if it's possible to calculate for a self-affined fractured surface, a tortuosity factor can be defined in this way. This is a local and purely geometrical parameter, where Lp is the parameter in the flow direction, and delta x, much smaller than L, it is the smallest length scale of the rough surface. So, as you can see from here, this, as I already said, is the case with age. But when you do that for alpha omega square, w square, you can see. Square W square, you can see that the system can be described by a very simple straight line, alpha omega squared equal to alpha A tau plus B. So you can have a linear behavior here. So if this is true, we can perhaps generalize in terms of this torque velocity different elements of the previous system. Okay, so again, to be consistent with the limiting value of the hydraulic conductor, so we did test. Of the hydraulic conductor. So we did tests to assure that the system was going to the correct minimum value that our A plus B would have. And this minimum value would be when the roughness would be equal to infinity or when you would have parallel plates, which means that alpha A plus B would have to be larger or equal to 12 in the case of this infinite roughness. So So the results show that indeed it follows very closely these equations for age is more than 0.7. So we have some deviations for small values of age 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7. But indeed, we found that A plus B is equal to 16.5 according to our estimations, which is in accordance with the minimum value that we stipulated in the regime of parallel plates. In the regime of parallel plates for low Reynolds, very low Reynolds numbers. So, for large values of the Hearst exponent, so it's important to explain that. So, we use the entire curve to calculate this dependence on the alpha omega squared to tau in terms of A. So, in terms of the self-affine geometry of the flow, it is less strong because the local globes in the channel are not so high as compared. Channel are not so high as compared to those presented in the channel with smaller values of A. So we are using values of the tortuosity from very large, from very small A, very rough fractures to calculate the tortuosity at very high A or very less rough fractures. So this is what happens when you do. So you have some deviations for close to. Close to the system when you are at age larger than 0.7. So, okay, so this was the part in which we were working at very low Reynolds numbers. So, in agreement with previous experiments, this has been experimentally observed. We also observed that there is a transition from a linear constant J, which is associated with the Darcy's law behavior, to a non-linear regime. And it occurs at very low and lower Reynolds for rougher surfaces compared to the Rougher surfaces compared to the less rough surfaces. So, although the absolute value of G depends on the tortuosity, as we have already seen, our results shows that the general increasing trend of the non-linear corrections as a function of Reynolds is independent of the Hearst exponent. So, they look very similar. So, what we found empirically was that when you plot all the j's divided by the permeable The j's divided by the permeability of the system. I mean, you rescale the hydraulic perm uh perm hydraulic conductance in terms of the first term of the extended Forscheimer equation. You see that all curves collapse onto a single master curve. And this indicates that the onset of the nonlinear contributions to the hydraulic resistance increases in a very linear fashion with the parameter A. This was. With the parameter A. This was kind of surprising for us. So, if this is true, all the corrections should increase in the same way. It's very easy to show that according to the Kubic Forsheimer equation, not only the second order correction, but also the third order correction should go in the same way. So, indeed, the second order terms follow the proposed scaling behavior here, as you can see in this graph here. This is for the second-order correction. This is the This is the if the first one is linear, the second one should be inversely proportional to age, and the third one should be inversely proportional to the age to the squared. So we see that it corroborates the results for the second order, but we have deviations which are significant for the third order corrections, especially when age is smaller than 0.4, or if you want, this ratio between a This ratio between a alpha w to the square by h to the square is larger than 120 and 10. Sorry, so this deviation can be can be explained due to the roughness of the system. So the rough is too high for this, for even this third order and this geometrical model combined to grasp the capture. But we can see that there is some sort of agreement for Reynolds is model for for ratios of For ratios for age is smaller than values 0 to larger than values 0.4. Okay, I'm sorry. So if it's not too rough, but for age, larger than 0.4, even the third-order corrections can follow our data collapsing set. So now I go to the, I'm penalizing, but I would like to talk about something else just to show you why I did use this type of measure to understand a little bit flow. Of measure to understand a little bit flow in three-dimensional structure, self-affined structure. So, in 1999, back in 1999, we studied Apollo's median, which was percolation-like, and which I've seen already in some of the presentations of this conference, in the videos that I could watch. A percolation-like, the disorder is binary. So, it's so sites are present on a square lattice with probability p equal to one minus epsilon, where epsilon is simply the positive. Where epsilon is simply the policy. So, in the same way, but long time ago, 25 years ago, we solved the continuity and aviary Stokes equations at steady state and isothermal conditions and changed the Reynolds number to see the natural effects. So, what we saw was things which were very different. For instance, for low Reynolds number, you see that for incompressible fluid flows, you can calculate the streamlines very easily. You see that the streamlines are much more tortuous and much more, in a way, local. And much more in a way localized than when you see the streamlines for high Raynor's number. But still, under laminar flow, we are not talking about turbulent flow here. So this is what I called at that time stronger channeling. And what we did was to try to quantify that in terms of a measure which has been used in condensed matter physics for localization in materials. So we used a measure called participation. The participation here, Participation. The participation here, in this case, is very simple to calculate the participation. It is simply a measure of the partition of the heterogeneity of the energy of the system, which in this case was calculated in two dimensions, in terms of the kinetic energy for each square cell of the lattice that we had. And it's simply the ratio between the average square to the square of the average of the energy in the system, which end up in a system in this. Which end up in a system in dispute system with a number of cells equal to this expression here. This participation number is very interesting because when you have equal partition of energy, it should go to one, while when you have energy confined to a single cell, which would be an extreme limit, in the sense that if you have a system going to the thermodynamic limit, this participation should go to zero. You would see that the energy is confined to a single cell and P should go to zero. P should go to zero. So that's what we saw when we plotted this participation number to against the Reynolds number. We saw the localized flow, which again agrees with Darcy's law. So the permeability in this particular region of Reynolds makes sense. But when you increase the Reynolds number sufficiently for inertial effects to take place, you see a zone of non-linearity, which will end up eventually with turbulent effects. Turbulent effects and that have not been calculated here because we limited ourselves at that point to laminar flow. So in the same way, we try to understand the flow at heterogeneity here, quantifying it in terms of the participation ratio, which in this case, which is not as easily discretible as it was in the previous one, is simply the ratio of the square to the average of the log. Square to the average of the local energy of a cell divided by the average of the energy to the square. And this energy is simply this: this colour of the U scalar U. It's a measure of some sort of kinetic energy in terms of the velocity magnitude. The integral, one over v over the integral of u is color u to n, and n is an eczemal moment of the kinetic energy where while v is the Energy where while V is the entire volume of the system. So if the kind, again, in the same way as we did for Poros media, if the kinetic energy is uniformly distributed, pi would go to one, whereas in the flow field, if it is strongly localized, it should tend to one over V and would approach zero in the limit of an infinitely large system. Okay, so that's what we see here. When we do, sorry. Sorry. So I just want to see that we've hit kind of our 30 minutes on there. So if you could wrap up. I'm almost in. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. So for the bulk, we see here, it shows the variation of pi as a function of age of the first exponent. For Reynolds equal to 100. If you decrease age, the system becomes more rough. The participation ratio decreases monotonically. The ratio decreases monotonically, as you can see here, as you go for low values of age. While for age going close to one, when you increase it and go close to one, the participation approaches a value p equal to 0.7, which can be calculated again using the parallel plates model under a Stokes flow. So, as you can see here, this is a dashed line for the. So, we can also do that for the W2 level surface, which we define here as the surface for which. We define here as the surface for which all points are at the vertical half distance between the lower and upper boundary of the structure. As you can see, compared to the bulk flow, the kinetic energy in this particular surface is distributed much, much more homogeneously. Why? Because the effect of the wall roughness is minimal in the sense that it's far away from this surface. But in this case, you also see a trend in terms of the pi exponent. A trend in terms of the pi exponent reflecting the formation of flow channels in fractures which are generated with low values of h. So, these are the conclusions and perspectives that I would like to leave for you. I will leave them for you, and I will say thank you very much for your attention and your tolerance. We'll go ahead and switch your presentations, and there's a question asked of Jose.
