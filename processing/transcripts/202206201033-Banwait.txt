Thank everyone for being present there. Thank you. So I'm going to be speaking about some recent work with Philip Nyman and Awada Padaranu, both of whom are in the audience there. So yeah, it concerns quadratic analogues of Kenku's theorem. So before we start talking about quadratic analogues of this, probably it makes sense to start with Kenku's theorem. So to motivate that, I'm going to start with Maeser's isogeny theorem. So So I'll put this into two parts. So if we have a rational elliptic curve, that mits a rational p isogene from p prime. Then P has to be one of 125, well, it has to be one of 125 numbers. So the primes up to 19 and four other primes, 37, 43, 67, and 163. So that's part A, and part B, if in addition E is semi-stable. Then, in fact, P is almost 11. So, this kind of, so this is, so since this conference has the word diaphragmite in the title, probably there should be a diaphragmide equation somewhere in the talk. So, I'll just say, I'm not going to write this down too much, but this is used in the modular method. So, for example, if there's some p if for some p larger than 11 there is a solution to the Fermat equation, then by this construction of Fry and Helengois, one associates an elliptic curve to this. And modularity would say that the mod P Galois representation of this is modular. Galois representation of this is modular. It arises from a modular form of level, the conductor of this. And then one wants to apply ribbon level lowering, so to get the level of that as small as possible. In order to apply ribbon level lowering, you need that the mod P representation is irreducible. And that comes from, well, part B here. So this spine curve is semi-stable. So mazes zero. Theorem gives irreducibility of this mod P representation, which is an ingredient required for rivets level lowering. Okay, so that's kind of the motivation. I'll say, so this fact that if phi is a k rational, so k is going to be an. K rational, so K is going to be a number field. So if we have a rational isogeny, any rational isogeny between elliptic curves, then it can be decomposed as multiplication by n and A cyclic isogeny. So this is this is psi. A cyclic k-rational isogeny. So by this I mean i.e. the kernel is Galois stable and is cyclic. So somehow cyclical So, somehow cyclic isogenies build up all isogenies. So, understanding them is kind of crucial. And so, a subset of these cyclic isogenies are isogenies of prime degree. I'm going to stop writing rational all the time, just assume everything is rational and that's otherwise specified. So, what about classifying these cyclogens? So, yeah, question. What about What about psychic experience? So Mesa actually studied the, so he considered this in the introduction of his paper. And so I'll just briefly outline here his method, so Mesa's strategy. I'll say more about this as the talk goes on. So having determined And having determined which primes can arise, the prime degree rise, I should use, determining all of them, determining all the cyclotisogenes comes down to determining The rational point on the k-rational point on a finite collection of modular curves for a handful of integers n. So as I said, I'll explain what this method is in the next session. For now, I'll just say for k equals q, so in Maze's case, So in Maze's case, this was seventeen values of n and of which five, namely 39, 65, 91, 125, 169. So for these five values of n, the q rational points on the module curve had not been determined. So that's what Kenku did in a series of four papers. He determined, so it doesn't turn and the last paper appeared in 1982. So for N in this one only has the custom One only has the cuspidal points on x0n. And hence, this table that Mesa has at the beginning of his rational isogenies of prime degree paper is complete. And in particular, the degrees of cyclic isogenies that you get as you vary over all elliptic curves over Q is precisely the set of integers up to 19. Finishes up to 19 and 7 other values. 21, 25, and 27. Okay, so that was Kenku's theorem. It was a determination of the cytokisogeny degrees over Q. And so this was in 1982, 40 years ago, and it's natural to ask: can you do this for any other number field? So that's the motivation for our project. Motivation for our project. So with Philip and Joanna, so we find a determination for one other number field under the generalized Riemann paralysis. Yeah, so it's for one other field, which is a quadratic field. Which is a quadratic field and wait for it, it is q join the square root of 213. So for this, you're always going to get, so by base change, you're always going to have these associated twenty-four, thirty-two, and thirty-six. So, yeah, the rest of the talk will be explaining this result, but also major strategy here. But maybe most importantly, like, why this field? Like, where is that coming from? That may not be the first quadratic field that one might consider. I should also say that the paper for this has appeared on the archive today. I've always wanted to say that in a talk. I heard Drew say it once in a talk, and that's why I've got the idea from. Okay, so let's talk about maze of strategy. So the key observation is: so if you have an elliptic curve, it's a Kaiser number field with rational, which I'm not going to write, cyclist. To write cyclic, whoops, okay, well, we write cyclic cyclic M times N isogeny. Well, then one is immediately going to get M and N isogenies. Then it also has M and N isogenies. Like you can think of this as that one has these natural maps between these modular curves. Between these modular curves. But also, so if this is this MN isogeny, then one can factor these isogenies. So the kernel of this will be isogen of Z mod M N Z, and so this will have Z mod M Z inside it, so we can factor that, and we will have cyclop isogeny of order M and then N hair. So this key observation continues. Yeah, this key observation continues under this picture. And moreover, this ML isogeny arises in the isogeny graph in isogeny class of epileptic curve. Admitting a cyclic M-isogeny. So, namely, if you consider just this, if you only know that you have an M-isogeny, then you construct the graph and then you want to get these higher-degree isogenies. So one is reduced to, I'm going to put this in quotes for now, determining x naught m and computing that subject into classes. Now, this second part, determining the isogeny class, there are well-known methods for doing this, and this is moreover essentially implemented in Sage. So I'll say a few more things about this afterwards. This is the determining the rational points, sorry, I should say x1 and k there, the k rational points on this. That's the much harder thing. But firstly, yeah, like what does the theme mean? Because this could be an infinite thing. Because this could be an infinite set. So you need one wants a notion of the smallest integers for which this admits finitely many points. So that leads to this definition. We say that an integer m is made. M is minimally finite for k if this admits only finitely many points but for every proper divisor of M Of M, X and all D admits infinitely many points. So there are two ways that this can happen. Sorry, I didn't finish this infinite. Yes, n is minimally finite if this has finite at many points, but for every divisor, it is infinite. So there's two ways that this can happen. Either the genus of this Of S is zero, or the genus is one, and so so it is a particular elliptic curve of Q, and so I'll say the rank is positive. So if k is q, then it turns then it turns out that x0 m admits it is finite if and only if the genus of x0 m is positive. In other words, B doesn't happen. So for Q, this comes down to saying minimally binary for Q means that the genus of X0M is positive, but the genus of every divisor is zero. So for Maser, who is in this case, Maser Call this minimal of positive genus. But in general, because some of these elliptic, these genus one modular curves might have positive rank, then this set of integers might be larger. And so part of this project was to determine what these integers exactly. To determine what these integers exactly are. So let's call this set MFA. So then basic strategy in a bit more detail is so for every M in this set. Determine the k point on this modular curve, that's part A, and then B, for every non-cospital point found, determine the graph of I rationalize social media. Of rational isogenies to determine any of these possibly larger, what Meser calls unrecorded isogenies So, as I mentioned earlier, B is essentially implemented in the Sage. So for So for elliptic curves over Q, this is done by David Rowe. And for general number fields, this is done by John Comona. So it is literally just e.hisogeny class.matrix, and then you unpack the degrees of that. So I'm not going to say anything more about B, but so I'll focus for the rest of the talk on A. So so I'll focus for the rest of the talk on A. Okay, so so first observe so MF so what happens if M is prime? If M is prime, then well but there are no proper divisors. So th th this becomes empty essentially. So if M is prime, m min minimally finite just means that the Limitably definite just means that the genus well so it would mean that the genus okay so So for any crime larger than or equal to 23 the genus of x dot p is 2 or higher so in particular that's going to be true so every prime 23 or higher is going to be in this set and also observe that if you have any integer that has a integer that has a prime that is supported at a prime 23 or higher, then it will in particular dominate x1 p. And this will be so and this is finite, so in particular that integer, so if n is supported at p, for p, so p divides n p larger than 23, so then this will map to x normal p and this is finite, so in particular this is not minimally finite. Finite. So that means that once we've observed that all of the primes larger than or 23 is in this set, then the other integers have to be supported by primes up to 19. 19 smooth integers. Yes, yeah. Well, 2, 3, 5, 7, yeah. Yeah, the prime's up to 19. That's perfect. And so we have an algorithm. So I'll talk about this part after I speak about this part. It's the algorithm to determine. So you first, well I said first identify the genus one values. So the genus of X0M is 1, so there's only 12 values. The smallest is 11, and the largest is 49. So you just go through those and pick out the ones that have rank 0. So get the D such that x naught d is genus 1 and the rank of x naught d is positive. Is positive. Sorry, sorry, it's equal to zero. Because then it's finite. And can you cite this in general? Well, we have. Yeah, so in Magma, we would call rank, for example. Or analytic rank. Yeah, okay. At least for quadratic fields, this can be done. I mean, okay, for binary fields you can look at the twist, but I mean if they rank is 2 or higher or something, large shar or something, then. Yeah, okay. Yeah, this is not entirely trivial for a general number field. But yeah, so in a bit, are these restricted to quadratic fields, and there we just look at the twist. Okay, so for the genus tool higher values, well, so again, two ways. So either I'll call this M so either the genus X naught B has So X0B has genus zero for all divisors of M or there exists some divisor of M with the genus of X or D 1 and the rank positive. So having identified these rank 0 values, Having identified these rank zero values, I'll let BK be the complementary set. So these are the genus one modular curves that have positive rank over K. So for A, so these must be supported. Only at the primes for which the genus of this is zero. And then, so at this point, it's a sort of straightforward exercise to generate all of them. So, for example, one is not going to have 13 cubed, because that will dominate 13 squared, and that is finite. But for 13 squared, well, it's going But for 13 squared, well th the the devices of this are just 13, and that's j um but that's going to be infinite. So you have 13 squared, 13 times 7, 13 times 5, 13 times 3, 13 times 2. And yes, I'm running a bit out of time, so I'll just list the others now. So 7. You're not going to have 7 in square because that's an elliptic curve, and you're not going to have higher powers of that because then that's going to map. Higher powers of that, because then that's going to map to this, because then we're not going to have genus zero in all the divisors. But we do have seven times five. And then we have, so powers of five, five squared is not going to work because that's genus zero, but five cubed, yeah, then the only divisor there is five and twenty-five and they have genus zero. So five cubed, and five squared times two. Okay, so there's eight values that. Okay, so there's eight values that are minimally finite for k. And these arise in a geometric way, so actually, these will be minimally finite for every number field and for B okay yeah, so these must have a divisor where the genus of the genus of one in the rank is five. With the genus of one and the rank is positive. In other words, it must be a multiple of something in the set BK that we identified from step one. So for this, we just compute the multiples for, so B in BK and P in primes up to 19. Now, this might be larger than That this might be larger than, so that not all of the values here are minimally finite. For example, you could have 49 in there. So, so x049 might have positive rank. And so, one of these values you'll be computing would be 49 times 17. But this is not minimally finite because this seven times x0, 7 times 19 is finite. So, something you filter. And once you have. And once you have a candidate value, it's easy to determine. Okay, so this determines this part. What about for the primes? So this is then primes p such that x0 p k has non-customable point. Has non-customer points. So, for this, we use work that I have with Martin Dereks. So, in particular, we have an algorithm which has an input number field, and it will output a, not necessarily the set of these primes exactly, but a superset of them. Superset of them. So we determine a superset of these what we call isogeny of variants. And from that, one can often determine the exact set itself. So I'll show you an example in about five minutes. But because of Bayes' theorem, One will always have the primes 37, 43, 67, and 163 in the output. So whenever you want to carry out step A, you are always going to have to determine the k points of these modular curves. And these ones. These A. So So so I'll just list all these together now So for these values 26 35 37 39 43 50 65 67 91 125 163 169. 163, 169. These are always minimally finite over every number field and they require determination and you need to determine takeaways. Okay, so now I'm gonna um reduce to Kenya's quadratic field. So having an understanding of the quadratic points on these levels becomes important and for so for the last so for So, for the last five values there, so 67, 91, 125, 163, 169. There are only finitely many quadratic points. So I can say, oh, I can't. So I can say, oh, we'll isolate it. Or sporadic, actually. Okay, so can one determine these? So Yoshi Bach, who is a Semen student, he determined 67. Um, Orna Ukorepa Michael Ripper, who is uh who is a Phillips student, determined in 1991 and part of our work and this builds on the uh um the relative symmetric Chaboty method developed by Sixec and then built upon by Bach and then uh Nieman Bukarepa. Um Naimon Vukareba. So we determine one two five one six nine. So these are listed in section eight of the paper. Okay, so that raises the obvious question: why not 163? So the genus of these values is 8. The genus of 163 is 13. That makes it really, really hard. And beyond current methods, more specifically. But in view of determining all of the quadratic points on that, we have a method, so proposition. So, well, I suppose this method is already existing in this work of Oswald and Six Educ. So, if there's no growth at the plus part of the Jacobian of X0N, then any k-point on x0 n-n-n-n-n-n On X0 n must arise as a pullback of a cue point on X0 plus of n as pullback off Q point on X or 1. So in the language of Brown and Meiner, this is non-exceptional, but I guess these are the non-isolated. Then non-isolated from the finitely family. So if it comes from the pullback of a cue point, then this is in an infinite family. And so it's not sporadic. Yeah. So as a corollary for n equals 163, so in this particular case, so if you have no growth hair, then any K-point must be either cuspidal or CM. And that follows from work of From work of Adzaga. I was going to write here Adzaga at R, but I will say the mix. So this is Adzaga, Anul, Banesh, Chen, Chidambaram, Kera, Ven. So they determine, among many other things in their paper, that the Q point on XNOR plus 163 is the cusp or CM points. And so the pullbacks of these will be cuspid or CL. Okay, so that's this is the method that we will use to detect 163D. So, but we weren't, so okay, now we're going to switch over to this multimedia stuff. So, yeah, the code for this is publicly available on the GitHub that is linked to in the introduction to paper. So, we were first trying for small discriminant quadratic fields, like q in the square root of 5. And we were getting quite large values, like 2, 8, 9. And this has quite large this has quite large genus. It was, yeah. So it was more than we were able to do. One can determine the isogeny primes for Q joint square refired. So running this code on the left here, this is. This code, so on the left here, this is the algorithm I have with Martin Derex. So the superset you get, you will additionally only get frames 23 and 47. And then one can check it in magma, for example, that x0, 23, and 47 do admit k points that are not q points. So these are isogenic primes there. But yeah, we were getting stuck on doing this and 221. And what about QH1? What about minus 5? So here we were getting 343. So this is 7 cubed. And that arises because x049 has rank 1 over Q is in the square root of minus 5. So yeah, we were getting stuck. And somehow the idea arose, if we can't do these, is there a quadratic thing that we can do? Can we kind of search for one? So then we started searching. So one of So, one of the search parameters here is that any values larger than 100 should only be the unavoidable ones. So, like, we don't want 221, we don't want 343. So, this should we should definitely have this. And then we also want to use this method for J0 plus 163, no growth. So, you want to check that the model of A group does not grow. Does not grow. So then, yeah, we package that into a search convenience function. So search. And then, so this is just searching for in the range q adjoin root D for square free values of D between minus 500 and 500. And then searching that, we get these values. And then searching that, we get these values. And so these hard values are doing some post-processing to determine what are the actual hard values that we need to consider. And 2.13 had the smallest list there. So that's how QA join group 213 arose. And so what are these values for 213? It's these ones. So the ones corresponding to elliptic curve. So, the ones corresponding to elliptic curves, which one can determine, are those ones we can do that. For the hyper-elliptic values, we used so Brown and Nyman determined the exceptional quadratic points or the sporadic quadratic points. And so, one needs to rule out elliptic curves coming from pullbacks of Q points on X0, which is just P1. So, for that, we used this work of This work of Philip with his student Antonilo Kikovich. And so this lists primes that have to be unramified. If you do have a quadratic point, then, like, for example, on XNOM 26, if there is a quadratic point, then this says that 3 has to unramify in the quadratic field. But we go to L quadratic field, you would join 213. And so what primes ramify in that? 213 is one. 213 is 1.4. Okay, so it's the primes, what are the prime divisors of? Okay, yeah, so three ramifiers, but according to Braman Nyman Treborovich, three is unramified. So that rules out 26. And that method rules out all of them, apart from 37, which is a special case. So there, I think, you have these two elliptic curve factors of x0, j0, 37, and one of them. 2137, and one of them, I think 37b1, does not increase in rank. So we can do that one. And for the non-hyperliptic values, well, so for these larger ones, we've already determined that by this kind of result. For most of the others, we have this earlier work on OS16. So, yeah, so for most of these other values, J0N has ranked zero. So some are with Eken did. Samila with I can determine many of these. And that leaves 43. Okay, there's the bell. And for 43, so you do have growth in the rank of the plus part. So for 43, you can look at the minus part. So J0 minus 43 K is J0 minus 43Q for this particular K. So this allows us to rule out 43. So, this allows us to rule out 43. So, that's fine. So, that gives us our result for Q join Q13. We were trying it also for 438, but this method of the minus part does not work. The minus part increases in rank. So, that, for example, is in the appendix of a paper of mine. So, the appendix is written with Martin Derrick. So the method is here. But that fails at 43. So that raises then a question that I will end with. So we got stuff on this value. So let's just do it here. So question. The Q adjoin square root 438 point of X143, we reckon this is just. We reckon this is just the queue point. So that's what we think. We can't prove it. If someone can prove it, that would be great, because everyone will have a quite better category theorem of a QB joint 438. Okay, sorry if we're going over time. Thank you. Time for one quick question. Quick question. Can I just make a comment about the last question? Have you tried kind of like some model-based SID? Because if you're looking over specific quadratic field, this type of question, then you can sit and use the fact that you're working over a specific field. So I've determined precisely this question for a bunch of projected fields, using a certain saying, okay, we know that there are infinitely many podetic points as you go through all the project fields. Can you fix the project? If you fix the project field, you use some type of model that you said that you can get extra information. So it might be worth kind of, but yeah, it sounds like we should. It might not work, but it might be worth looking. Okay. Get started with setting up next Peter. Let us thank Barender again.
