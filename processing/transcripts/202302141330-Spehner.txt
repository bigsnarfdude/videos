So this conference is a wonderful place. Um well, in geodesics uh play a crucial role in classical physics. You know, a free particle follow a geodesic in space. Also in general relativity, light follows geodesic in space-time. So the question I want to address in my talk is: what is the role of geodesic? Talk is what is the role of geodesics in quantum meeting. I will show that this geodesics, so I will introduce a bit geodesics. This is the plan of my talk. In the first part, I will introduce the geodesics in quantum mechanics. So, the first thing that in unlike in classical theory, in classical theory, you have trajectory in In classical theory of trajectory in space, in quantum mechanics, you know that there is no such notion of trajectory. So, where to live the geodesics? Geodesics will live in the... So in quantum mechanics, you have evolution in Hilbert space. And if you, more generally, if you think of mixed states, there is a set of mixed states, a set of quantum states, a set of density matters, if you want, and there is a revolution. There is a revolution on this set. And so the G-Z will live on this high-dimensional space. And if you have a bigger space of dimension N, this will be N square minus one dimension space. And here you have some theories. And what I want to show is that these theories are not only mathematical objects, but they can be realized at the physical evolution. But they will not be unitary evolutions. There will be evolution of open quantum systems. Of open quantum system, and there will be no macro. But this is the second part of my talk where I will explain this part. So let me start with more basic things. What are the set of quantum states? It's n by n density matrix. This state I will always think of finite dimensional interstates. They are phase one, and I will call it with this E. Call it with this E and B inversible, only the invertible density matrix. But if you take the boundary of these states, the non-invertible density matrix, which are density matrix with at least one eigenvalue which is equal to zero, and in particular, pure states belong to the boundary. Okay? So now if I want to speak about geodesic, I must introduce the distance. And there is a natural distance on this side, which is called uh your set which is called your distance, which your arch distance, which is relied on the fidelity. So what is the fidelity? It's something that Ullmann introduced in the 70s, which generalized the scalar product T phi between two states modulus group. That's called naturally a fidelity. And you can fidelity here, written in the last formula, is a generalization of this for the It's a generalization of these four density matrices. So it's given by one norm of, yeah, I think I forgot square root of sigma and square root of 4, sorry. But it's given by explicitly by this trace. So you can check its symmetric and if you take the arcos of this, the square root of this, it's defined a good distance. Distance are very nice properties and particle is contractive with respect to completely positive. Trace magic maps. And it's so it's it's actually the smallest contracting disk. Okay, so instead of going to general, well yes, sorry. I let me refresh to mine about about reminiscent geometry. So uh you have you think this uh in green, I represent the set of quantum states. I represent the set of quantum states. Okay? Um and then when you have a quar uh this is a manifold actually and you can define uh the metric which is associated to the distance in the following way. You take a state rho and a state rho plus t rho dot, which is infinitely very close to rho. T is a small. And you take the distance between rho and t and rho ma rho and t and rho plus t rho dot. Okay, the distance square. And this defines what is called ds2, what is written ds2 in geometry, and this is proportional to t squared, the term proportion to t vanish here. And this define, actually you can extend by polarization this, and this gives you a scalar product, which depends on where you sit, on the stage floor. A straightforward. And so it is allowed to associate to a distance a metric. A metric is a colour product which depends on the point where you have. And in the case of the Bureau distance, you can compute it explicitly as given by this. The research formula is not important in what follows, but just to tell you that it's computable in terms of the eigenvectors of rho. Okay? So what are geodesis? What are geodesis occurs in the space which minimize between two states, two world and sigma, which minimize the distance locally? It's important, there are many confusions, sometimes people think is to minimize the distance globally, but it's not true. It can be, the minimization is local. Okay, so instead of work, now I will for the second So, now I will, for the sake of time, in simplicity, I will restrict, illustrate what has a pure geodesic in the case of a qubit. So, as you know, if you have a qubit, a state are parametrized by a vector, which is a block vector, by this formula. And so you can represent any state, pure or mixed, by this vector which is inside the unit ball. Okay? Okay? Yeah, and and to obtain the state you just use the formula by sigma tape polymatic. And then you can compute using the explicit form of the pure metric and you can compute this in the case of a qubit. And this is what you obtain after a few lines of calculations. Here theta is the angle, theta and phi are the as a angling spherical co coordinate for the vector R, for the block vector R. R, for the block vector. And t is related to the model roots of r by the arc size. Okay? T is between 0 and π over 2. And so when you apply this formula, people that know a little bit about it immediately recognize, oh, I know this metric. This is the metric of the sphere. But you have three parameters. So it's a sphere of dimension three, which is embedded in R4. Embedded in L4. So this means that you can view the set, the manifold of quantum state of a qubit as a half epistle of dimension C. And this is a very convenient way for learning geometry to think like this. But this has two consequences. The first one is that this manifold has constant coverage. Because S V has constant coverage, positive coverage. Sphere is contained, positive coverage. The second consequence is that the geodesics are immediately defined because we know that the geodesic and the sphere are the big circle. Exactly the one that you use, you plan from your own place to go to Banf, or to Calgary. You took arc of geodesics to minimize the distance. So here it's exactly the same. Exactly the same. Expect that we are in dimension four, or the sphere is three-dimensional, so you have to think in dimension four. And we have to project to get the parameterization with a R vector, with a block vector, we have to project. So, how does it work? Here I try to represent it as this sphere of dimensions 3. Of dimensions 3. So in L3, of course, you have to use your imagination. But so, what is the plane which is here, the horizontal plane? It's a three-dimensional space, okay? And what is this disk, which is the intersection of this ball with this plane? It's exactly the blow sphere. So this is the vector R inside this intersection of the ball with the Pole with the horizontal plate. And what is the equator of the sphere? Do you think? It's the border of the block sphere. So it's pure state. Okay, so pure state light on the equation. And how do you, here are the explicit form of the coordinates, the four coordinates of the sphere of dimensions 3 in terms of the In terms of the coordinate T theta and phi. So if you, in our draw, for example, you have S and R, which are two qubit states, and you have this arc of geodesy between this. You will have to project it to get it for the coordinate x, y, and z. Okay? And what do you obtain is an ellipse if you project that. Project by this. So the pure geodesics are actually ellipse. And they are parametrized by this formula. And here I show the ellipse are center of the origin. And they are in the plane, because we are, remember that this original plane actually is three-dimensional. So they are in the plane span by R, the two vector R and S, which are two block vectors. So this is like So, this is like you want a section of the block ball in this plane spanned by these two vectors or S. And here you see the different geodesics. There is a black curve, which is the arc of geodesics, which is the smallest, the shorter geodesic between the two states. And and there is a yellow one, which is uh the time reverse of it, which is which would be the longer way which is which would be the longer way. Uh I don't know if if you have into place uh from your from your uh hometown to to Calgary, you could have done one way or you could have done it in the other way around the earth. Okay, so this is exactly the same here. But interestingly, since the qubit is the Arctic hypersphere, it's not the world hypersphere, you could you can go from You can go from here to the symmetric point here. This symmetric point of this point here with respect to this deeper plane is identified to this one. So this is another geodesics which go from here to here and it's going here but actually you can think of it as a reflected here. And this gives you the blue arc of Big Scarf which touches the boundary. So it's going to It's going to intersect in the boundary of quantum state. So this is not a shortest, but it is also a jurisdiction. And there is also in sign on this one is a time reverse of function. Okay? So this basically what's happening. Yes? There is some questions. The longer path that you consider will always reach a period. Yes. Yes, and this is actually something which happens always for qubits. For in higher dimension, it will also be true, but it will go to the border of quantum states, but not necessarily a pure state. It can be any non-inductive state. So now something particular happens when R and S are proportional. Proportional. What means R and S plus proportional is this is the parameterization in terms of the block vector R of rho and S of sigma. And if R and S are proportional, these two operators here commutes. And this means that these two states were on and sigma commutes. So in the case of two commuting states, R and S are proportional. And in this way, when you project, you do not obtain an ellipse. You do not obtain an ellipse, but just a geometer. Okay, so this is a degenerated end. This geometer is a geometer which goes through the origin. What is the origin? As a quantum state, it's a maximally mixed state. And more, it's all vector here, all block vectors are proportional. This means that all states in the geodesics commute with one sigma. So this is a geodesics very very peculiar because it's Very peculiar because it's made of state commuting with rho and s at all times. So it's and the block sphere it's a geometry. It's going from here to here, but if you prolongate it, it's going here and back and forth. And there is a special case of this is when you have R which is a minus S which means that the two it's Two, if r is equal to minus f, the rho and sigma are the same eigenvalues, but associated to interactions in eigenvectors. And in this case, something very strange happens, is that you have R and S, you have a geometer which is a geodesics, but you have infinitely many other geodesics, which are these ellipses. And this is exactly what's happened because what happened on the on the previous uh On the previous here, it's happening that the two states on the hypersphere are geometrically opposite. And you know that when you have geometrically opposite points, you have an infinitely many geodesics on the hypersphere. So there can be a situation where sorry, I'm going wrong way, where you have infinitely many geodesy to quite a state. Okay. So Now, what's how the geodesics was going through a pure state, which was not well? Well, this means that one of the states here is on the border. Maybe I'll just go here. One of the states is on the border and and the other is inside. Yes? So sorry, I'm a bit confused. You you were talking about times in the next slide, the previous slide. Um The previous one. So, how does the evolution come into play? Yes, this I will explain, but for the moment, time is a parameter of the geodesics. Because a geodesic is a curve, so it's a I call it tau, but I will interpret it later at the time, but it's just a parameter of the curve. So, time reversal is in this way. You inverse the parameter. Math. You inverse the parameter. You find that there is a unique geodesics which goes through a pure state and an invertible density matrix. For example, if the pure state is this zero, which is on the north pole of the block sphere, I try to point it. This is an ellipse which goes like this, which is inside the block hole. Okay? What do you mean? Okay, sorry, I have to speed up a little bit. But you can find an explicit form of this density matrix. So now the question, why are just this interesting? Because at first sight are just mathematical objects and so it's our application. Here I don't have I'm sorry I don't have time to this would be another talks. To this will be another talk to explain in detail of this application, but I will just mention them. There are applications to quantum meteorology, which is based on the fact, and I'm working currently on that, based on the fact that Bureau matrix actually is related to what is called the quantum future information. And the quantum future information gives you the best possible precision you can have when you want to estimate a parameter from a quantum. Parameter from a quantum parameter-dependent evolution. The application to quantum control, which is something I'm doing currently with one student, so if you have, for example, a qubit, this is a block sphere, you want to steer an initial state to a target state, okay? And for this, you imagine that you have a different setup where you have some given control fields, and so you have some Hamiltonian. So, you have some Hamiltonian which is given by the experiment, which can be modified by modifying the control fields. What is the best way to go from here to here? So, one way to look at this problem is to try to follow the judges. And there are relations to the quantum speed limit which are something at which is not which is c clear for me that there are some relations that I have not that there were still many open questions. Still, many of them question where to design. So, here I will skip this because of time, but just to mention you that it's possible to derive an explicit form for the geodesic in higher dimension. This was basically done by these people, Ericsson, but their work was restricted to the shorter geodesis. And actually, as we saw, projectes are more than one geodesis between two points. And actually, we find that there are two. And actually we find that there are two ele two power n uh geodesics related. In some special case, I think the qubit case are infinitely many, but in general there are two power n. So it's decreasing exponentially with the number in the dimension. And then the prop the properties are very similar, so I will skip this to the case of the qubit. So now let's go to CF Geodesica's quantum evolution. So now we will interpret the We will interpret the time or the parameter in the geodesic as time. So, first, let me introduce what is a purification. Probably many of you already know that. If you have a system and you couple to another system, auxiliary system, which is called ancilla, you can represent any density matrix of the system by a pure state on the system copy to. On the system copy to system on L C on the L plus base the transfer product of H by H. And the relation is by taking the perfect case. This can always be done, but prefications are not unique. There are infinitely many of them. And given one qualification, you can obtain the other one by applying a unitary operator acting on the case. And so if you look Okay, and so if you look at all these sets, you can interpret it as an orbit. This is a row is a state of state, and in spi uh and for each row there is a line, like the red line, which corresponds to the orbit of purification. And if a row is not at a pure state, the system and ancilla in this side are entangled. If you want to measure the entanglement, you can do it by the by measuring the outro. Motions are true. So far, so good. No question. Okay, let's. But is there a physical meaning to the ancilla? The ancilla is environs. This is anything you can think of on an environment. Okay, so what is the main result that we have? That we find that there is always an Hamiltonian on the system. An Hamiltonian on the system in Ancilla, which implements the geodesic as a physical evolution of an Hamilton quantum system. So, this is, as usual, you take the initial state, which is here plurification of war, and you evolve with the Hamiltonian. Hamiltonian evolution and take the possible place. This Hamiltonian is always you have the explicit form of it, okay, given by this. Epsi is a purification of four, epsi dots. Purification of four and psi dot is a state which is orthogonal to psi that it should satisfy this horizontality condition which means that it's related to psi by this way. K is a self-adjunct operator that which acts on the system. And the main message of this is that geodesics corresponds to a physical evolution of the system cooperative and axis. Okay? Yeah, fine. What happens if What happens if war is going to a pure state? If you have a pure state, psi, and you want to purify it, well, the purification is just a tensor product of psi by a state of uncertainty, whatever the state is doing the job. And so there is no entanglement. This is only a case where when you have two states, there is no entanglement between the Two states, there is no entanglement between that. And now we can use the fact that, for example, for a qubit, it's always the geodesics will always intersect the boundary at a pure state. And so the geodesic doesn't depend where you are. So I will take the freedom to choose rho at the point exactly at the intersection of the geosynchronous point. So this simplifies the analysis because then the initial Simplify the analysis because then the initial state is a product state. Otherwise, I have to work with initial state, which are not product state, which, as you know, in a component system, complicate a lot. So now I can generalize and instead of taking the psi at the initial state, I can take any state of the system and define an evolution which is given by T. An evolution which is going by this. This is the Hamiltonian of the geodesics, which I showed before. And this is a system ancillary. And μ is any state of the system. So this defines me an evolution. This is a completely positive transparent map. And if you take μ equal to this pure state xi, which is a state of intersection of the system with the boundary, you obtain back the joint. So, well, this just tells you that you can compute by using the formula and the geosis in any dimension exactly the dynamics. So, since this is completely positive tricepium map, you can use the cross-decomposition and you can have uh uh explicit uh expression for this cross-operation, okay? Whatever it is, uh it's not not really relevant to the It's not really relevant to this talk. But there are some, of course, it depends on the state psi, the initial state, the state sigma, which is the second state on the geodesic. And there are some functions, which what is important are given by this. Theta is actually the and it's given like like this, it's a expectation value of sigma, which is actually the the the length between psi, the initial state and the final state. The initial state and the final state zero. Okay, but since there are always geographic functions, this is two piper. So we have an evolution which is two pi periodicity two. Okay, and so now we have an evolution which is two pi per which has its periodicity. So um now I asked the question uh about Macovianity or non Markovianity. Uh it's clear that it's not Markovian. It's clear that it's not muffled. Because if you have an evolution which is periodic, this means that in physical terms, you may have some loss of information from the system in the ancilla, but after some time, all this information is a tree. So in your timer, Eric, we told yesterday, this would correspond to an infinite memory time. So this is certainly non-Markovian behavior. So the main question that I want to raise here is what is the most non-Markovian evolution I can obtain? So which kind of geodesics lead to the most non-Markovian evolution? So first to to to think about this problem, one can first study the the evolution of the entanglement, entanglement between the system and the ancillary. Between the system and the ancillary. So, as I told you, it's given if I'm following, I take the initial state, which is my state psi, which is the intersection of the geodesic with the border. This means I'm looking at the geodesic itself. I can follow the entanglement between the ancilla by taking, computing the entropy of the geodesic state. And this is shown here. So, and in this case. Here. So, in this case, the evolution is actually asperio C pi instead of 2π. But you see that it increased, decreased, it increased, decreased. And well, this different curve corresponds to different S, which S is the block vector of the second state on the TR6. Okay? So, what is the HI6? Well, as zero. This means that the state sigma is diagonal. And my initial state here, I take it to be 0, 0, the North Pole. So this means that this is exactly the case of the two-commuting state. And in this two-commuting state, as we have seen, the geodesic is a diameter and it will go through the maximally mixed state. The maximally mixed state has a Stays at the highest central, equal to one. So the blue curve, in the blue curve, you can go from zero. Zero is corresponding to the initial time where you are in the pure state. And you go to the maximally mixed, and then you go back to zero. This means that this is where you go from to the opposite side, you will meet again the border in a pure state. So this is again. So, this is again zero entropy because you are again a pure state and then you go and move. Okay, so from this and this, when you increase eta, you will have curves which are which go at the same behavior, which are the amount of entanglement is always low. But of course, this is a first thought about non-microglobal energy. It's not the first. It's not the end of the story. So, if we want to go really to speak about seriously about non-macrobionity, one has to, I will, this is my last slide, please. We want to use the kind of measures that were introduced this morning, which are based on the trace one distance. So, this is a measure which was defined by people lying pillow and broad. By these people lying pillow and barrier. And it's when it's zero, it's a signature of divisibility. But I learned this morning that actually I should use not one distance, but the extra matrix. But never mind, this is a measure which is introduced. And now we compute this measure. And this this is my very last. So I compute it. This is a computation which is analytical and numerical also, because at the end we have to maximize overall pair of states. And what is the surprise here is that, okay, as we have thought with entropy, when eta is equal to zero, which are commuting states, the number of unity is very high, which is something, by the way, that I don't really, I'm just on physically why commuting states. Physically, why commuting states, which are most classical, lead to the highest normal probability. But interestingly, there is another point here, which I don't know. I have no physical interpretation, which are the same amount of non-profits. So it's not only the non-Macarity never is never higher than what for cognitive states, but there is a state which has what is the least to normalian average. Well, with that, my time is over. With that, my time is over, that's why it's actually nice talk. We're a little bit behind, but we might be able to fit in a couple of quick questions. Are there any questions from people listening in remotely? Yes, go first. Yes, I'm Drushkin from Moscow. My question is about um the application of uh the notion Of the notion of geodesics to quantum control. The notion, as far as I understand, the notion of geodesics assumes that we minimize all possible paths from one quantum state to another. But in quantum control, we often deal with the situation where our control resources are limited, so not every uh path can be realized by uh Can be implemented by our Hamiltonian, our Hamiltonian with driving. So, probably in such a case, some generalization of geodesics is required. So, minimization over not all possible ways, but or over all o all paths that are are accessible to us. What do you think about this? Yeah, it's uh a a nice nice question, nice comment. Nice question, nice comment. Actually, what we do is represent the geodesics, but as you said, you cannot exactly follow the geodesics. Even if I showed you that this is the risk-Hamiltonian, which can reproduce this geodesics, but it's not accessible in the experiments in general. So, what we do is we minimize the angle between where you can go and the geodes. This is why. This is why this curve, which you see here, is obtained like this. At each time step, we discretize the evolution, and at each time step, we minimize the angle between the trajectory, which is accessible in the experiment, and the true geodesy. And the advantage of this is that you don't need to do a global minimization which takes all steps into account as a world. account as a wall we can do it step by step so at step at step k we minimize the angle with the geodesics and then we go to step k plus one and we have to optimize over a very few few amount of parameters. And does minimization of the angle guarantee at least local optimum of such control? This is also a good question, not necessarily It's a good question, not necessarily. We have found some case. This is why what we are now doing to avoid this problem is that instead of going directly to the target state, we introduce a new target state which are on the geodesis. And so which are very close. And so we go from step by step to the next point on the geodesis until reaching the highest point. There are a lot of questions, but looking at the clock, I'm afraid we need to move on. I I've got some myself. I'll suggest we second for the coffee break. Apologies for repeatment from Marketing. Let's thank Dominic again.
