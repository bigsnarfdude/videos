This is Kia Rigoni from Unidarcité TBN, and she's going to speak on the convergence of metric measure spaces satisfying CD condition for negative values of the dimensional parameter. Thank you very much. So, first of all, I would like to thank the organizers for the opportunity to present this result here. So, in this talk, we are going to introduce the class of metric measure spaces, which in which we can Spaces in which we can introduce the curvature dimension condition for negative values of the dimensional parameter. And in particular, we are going to see the stability of this notion under a suitable convergence notion of topology. So this is a joint work with Matthias Mana Bosco and Gerardo Soza. So let's start with a motivation. So why it's important, it's meaningful to introduce this notion of. Use this notion of a negative dimension. And the reason goes back to the case of weighted Riemannian manifolds. So we take a Riemannian manifold in which the reference measure is given in terms of the volume measure associated with the Riemannian metric. But we have also a weight which is formulated in terms of this function ψ, which is a C2 function. We know that in this setting, We know that in this setting, also the Ricci curvature tensor is going to be modified. So we end up with a weighted Ricci curvature tensor, which takes the form that involves the part of the Ricci curvature tensor of the unweighted Riemannian manifold. Then we have this term which involves the Hessian of our function psi. And the last term in which we have the gradient of psi and the And at the denominator, we have also the possibility to introduce a parameter capital L. In the standard theory, this capital N is taken to be greater or equal than the topological dimension of the manifold. And in particular, the case of the equality is obtained just in the case in which our weight is nothing but a constant. So we know that already this term is equal to zero. term is equal to zero. So let's say that typically the case considered like most of the time is the one in which capital N is greater than the topological dimension of the manifold. The reason why it's important, it's meaningful to consider also the case in which n is negative goes back to a result proved by Hot and Takatso in 2013, in which they proved that. In which they prove that it's meaningful to study the geometry of the space to consider this relative entropy, which depends on our parameter M. And the fact that this M relative entropy is K-convex in the vast tense space is related to the fact that the N-weighted rich equator tensor is greater or equal than zero. And this capital N depends on the parameter M that On the parameter m that we chose in the study of the entropy. In particular, m can be any real number different from one, and when m is greater than one, this capital N is less than zero. So here it's how this dimension, the negative dimension, appears. So in the study of the n-weighted rich curvature tensor. Sorry, can I ask a question? Ask a question? Of course. What is x sub m of psi? This is exactly, it's a so let's say that in all this theory of the study of the relative the m relative entropy, also the reference measure that is considering the entropy is not the one of the weighted Riemannian manifold, but we have to consider another weighted measure. And this weighted measure is given in terms of this. Measure is given in terms of this M exponential, which is a little bit technical, but again, it's like the standard exponential, but also the parameter M is playing a role, let's say. So it's just like a way to define this new function, which is an exponential which depends also on n. Can you write the definition or is it too technical? Too too technical, it's a little bit technical, yeah. So it's uh, it's a little bit involving, it's just like, yeah, uh, it's uh, let's say it's a yeah, it's not also so necessary from my point of view, it's not so meaningful in the understanding of the theory. It's just the fact that they study, they managed to prove some geometric property of the manifold, studying the vast tone space, and using this relative entropy, which has also this. Which has also this parameter, and for which it's meaningful to consider this entropy with respect to the reference measure, which is again given in terms of this M exponential. So, yeah, it's uh okay, fine. So, um, in so using this bound on the n-rich ecoverto tensor, uh, we can prove that. We can prove that already in the Euclidean setting, we can find some nice examples and also very, let's say, simple examples of C V spaces for negative dimension, which are, for example, already the Euclidean space endowed with the Euclidean distance, and for which we consider this family of probability measures, which are called heavily tailed measures, which were already introduced by Borel in the 70s and then studied by Bob Cook. And then studied by Bob Kov in 2007. And yeah, so it's this family of measures depends on a parameter alpha and when which is a positive and in a very high individual alpha we obtain spaces which are C D 0 minus alpha. This C and alpha is just a renormalization parameter in such a way that this family of measures is actually a family of probability measures. Of probability measures. So this example was generalized by Milman in 2016-17 in the case of the sphere, the n-dimensional sphere, equipped with the heating distribution, which is a probability measure whose density is proportional to this function. And Milman proved that this family of measures on the sphere are such that the resulting manifold The resulting manifold is a C D, something which is a positive minus alpha space. So again, we have something which has a negative dimension. And again, all this definition relies on the fact that the n-weighted rich equator tensor is bounded from below by a constant k. And indeed, this is just to recall that in the literature before these results that we obtained with Mattia and Gerardo, there were Mattia and Gerardo. There were already some results in the case of weighted Riemannian manifolds, and they were obtained by Nilman, Kolesnikov, and Hot and Takazu indeed. While for the case of metric measure spaces, the only paper was the one of Hota that now we are going to see a little bit more in detail, in which he's introducing a lot of the definitions that we are going to use. So, let's see what it means for a metric measure space. It means for a metric measure space to satisfy this C D condition for negative values of the dimensional parameter. So, our starting point is the definition of C D spaces from the Lagrangian point of view. So, using the theory of optimal transport. So, we take a complete and separable metric space and we endow it with a Radon measure and we take a parameter n which is greater or equal. Take a parameter n which is greater or equal than one. So, this is just to recall how we define these C D spaces in the standard theory. We take we define a real value functional, which is called the Reni entropy, which takes value, which takes values from the set of probability measures with finite second moment, and it's such that if the probability measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the reference measure and it has a density. measure and it has a density where the entropy is defined like minus the integral of this density to the power n minus n over n and integrated with respect to the reference measure. If the measure is not absolutely continuous, we define the functional to be plus infinity. An important point is that the metric space has to be complete and separable because we want also the vastest space to be complete and separable. To be complete and separable. So, this is an hypothesis that we are always using. So, what Sturm did in 2006 is to introduce the class of CDKN spaces via the study of this entropy. And so, we say that a metric measure space satisfies the CDKN condition if, for any pair of probability measures, so in P2, there exists an optimal plan. There exists an optimal plan between them and a vassal-stan geodesic, such that the entropy functional evaluated along the geodesic is bounded from above by this integral in which we have these distortion coefficients that depends on k and n. And in particular, when k is equal to zero, this distortion coefficient is equal to one minus t, this is equal to t. minus t this is equal to t and what we obtain is exactly the convexity of the standard definition of convexity for the for the entropy so um the same approach is used to define the cdk n spaces when n is negative and again we define a suitable rhini entropy functional and which has again a real real value functional takes taking um so as having as an argument As having as an argument measure simply, and it has exactly the same form, except from the fact that here we drop the minus sign. The reason being that when n is negative, this functional is already convex. And since we want the entropy to be the integral of a convex functional, here there is no need of the minus anymore. And what Hota proved introduced in 2015 is the definition of CDKN spaces, which is Kenyan spaces, which is exactly as the one introduced by Schum. So, for any couple of probability measures, we can find the optimal coupling and the geodesic in the Varsistan space, such that this inequality holds true. And again, here the geosciental coefficients are exactly the same as the case of n greater than zero. And so, here we have just remembered that the behavior that we have. The behavior that we had in the case of the CDKN spaces with n positive and k positive. Now we have it when k is negative because the signs are going to be inverted. So as our first list of properties, so now we have, at least in the case of the weighted Riemannian manifolds, we have two different notions. So or better. We have the notion of the C D condition introduced in terms C D condition introduced in terms of optimal transport, and we have also the study, so the more classical study using the n-weighted rich curvature tensor. And what it's known in the literature when n is greater or equal than the topological dimension is the fact that these two approaches are actually equivalent. So, the fact that the space satisfies the CDKN condition and the fact that the n reach curvature. Fact that the n-rich curvature tensor is bounded from below by a constant k. Hota, in his paper from 2015, proved that also when n is less than zero, the two approaches are equivalent for weighted Riemannian manifolds. And so this is already an important point that the actually the two theories coincide. Another observation always due to ALCA is the fact that this class of Is the fact that this class of CDKN spaces with the n which is negative includes all the standard CDKN spaces for n positive and also the class of CDK infinity spaces. So in a certain sense, we are enlarging our theory. So another important result that Houghton introduced is the definition of the result is the notion of Kn convexity. K and convexity for a function defined on a metric space. So we say that a function, a real-valued function defined on a metric space, is a Kn convex if for any couple of points which are in the domain of the function. And we have to assume also that the distance of the points is bounded from above by this parameter when k when by this constant when k is negative. k is negative. This always due to the behavior of the coefficient, the distortion coefficients. So we say that this function is Kn convex if there exists a geodesic gamma such that the function fn evaluated on the intermediate points of this geodesic is bounded from above by this expression, where again we have these distortion coefficients. coefficients and this Fn is the exponential of minus F over N. So with this definition at disposal, what Horta proved is the fact that if we have a weighted Riemannian manifold which satisfies the C D, let's call K2 N2 condition, where N2 is greater or equal than the topological dimension of the manifold. Of the manifold. Then, and we have also a capital psi, which is a C2 function, which is k1 and 1 convex. Then, if we consider a double, so weighted another weight on the measure, which is given in terms of this capital psi, then the resulting weighted manifold is a C D K one plus K two N one plus N two condi space. Space and this n1 we chose it in such a way that n1 plus n2 is still less than zero. So, what we have is exactly that once we have a weighted Riemannian manifold satisfying the Cd condition and we weight it again with a C2 function, which satisfy another K1 plus and one condition of convexity, the resulting weighted manifold is a C D some Is a C D something which is negative so in the parameter of the dimensional space. This is very important because using this result of the on weighted manifolds, what we did together with Mattia and Gerardo is to produce some new class of examples. And already in the case in the one-dimensional case, we can find some nice examples, some let's say, some. Example, some let's say some particular examples. So we take a parameter capital N, which is less than minus one. And so we consider the real line equipped with the Euclidean distance and the Lebesgue measure. So what we proved is that the R in so this space, which is again the real line, the Euclidean distance, and this weight on the Lebesgue measure, the weight. On the Lebesgue measure, the weight is formulated in terms of this function. This is a C D K n plus one space. So n plus one is going to be always negative. And so here we have something which has a positive curvature. And so this function, this weight is the hyperbolic cosine to the power n. So this is a nice example, but it's not, let's say, so interesting. Interesting. But another interesting example, still when k is greater than zero, is the fact that the half-line is equipped always with the Euclidean distance, and this weight on the back measure is again a CD space. And this weight is the hyperbolic sign to the power n with n negative. In particular, this function is exploding close by zero. But since we said that we But since we said that we want a metric space which is complete and separable, because for the study of the optimal transport, we want also the vastest space to be complete and separable. We have to include zero in our space. And so this is even more clear in the case in which we are treating RCD zero and plus one space, because again, we have the half-line and as. Half-line, and as a weight, we have the function x to the power n. Since n is strictly less than minus one, and we are in dimension one, this function is never integrable around zero. So it means that every ball center in zero is such that the measure of the ball is equal to plus infinity. So already we it's clear that our setting cannot be. Setting cannot be the one of Radon of just the setting of Radon measures. And this is also clear, another similar behavior. We have it when k is less than zero, because we have that the compact interval, which is given by minus pi over two and pi over two, so let's suppose that k is equal to n, and the weight is given by the cosine to the power n with n is negative. n with n is negative. So this function is exploding close by these two points minus pi over 2, pi over 2. And so in particular, the measure of this compact interval is equal to plus infinity. And again, we have that around these points, every ball centering these two points is equal to mass, which is equal to plus infinity. So these are the first set of examples that we found. And as We found. And as we were saying, what we do is to introduce a larger class of measures. So we take again the matrix space to be complete and separable, and we say that a sigma finite measure is quasiradon if there exists a set, the singular set we denote it by Sm which is closed, it has measure equal to zero and it has empty. To zero, and it has an empty interior, but is such that for any point in this SM, and if we take a neighborhood of this point x, then the measure of the neighborhood is always equal to plus infinity, which is the thing that we were saying before about the balls centered in zero or minus pi over two, pi over two. But we have still a nice property on the measure, which is the fact that. Property on the measure, which is the fact that if we restricted it to the complement of the set of these nasty points in SM, then which is an open set, then the restricted measure is actually a radon measure. So from now on, our setting is the one of metric measure spaces where the measure M is actually quasi-radon. In the following, we are going to consider a pointed metric measure space. Pointed metric measure spaces, so in which the point P is in the support of the measure. And another terminology that we are going to use is the one of math BBX, which are the equivalence class of pointed metric measure spaces, in which we also select a closed set with empty interior, and the measure of this closed set is equal to zero. Is equal to zero. So, as you can expect, this set C in general will be taken to be of the set SM, so the singular set for the measure, but some of the definition we are going to introduce it when this C is more general. So, let's keep it like this for now. So, going back to our set of examples, the first one in which we had the real The first one in which we had the real line with this very nice weighted measure in which this function is never exploding. So, this function V times the Lebesgue measure is actually a Radon measure. And so, the set of singular points is equal to the empty set. So, the class of Radon measure is actually contained in our class of quasi-Radon measures. And the Radon measures are the one for which the singular set is equal. One for which the singular set is equal to the empty set. As for the second and third example, Sm is exactly equal to the point zero. And as for the last example, the set of this singular set is equal to minus the two boundary points, so minus pi over two and pi over two. So at the beginning, actually, we were expecting that. We were expecting that this kind of behavior on the measure was appearing just on the boundary of the boundary points of our manifold, let's say, because the way that we built these examples is just taking a manifold and then weighted it with a function that it happens to explode close to the boundary points. And so we were hoping that this kind of nasty behavior of the measure was just something which was a confirmation. Something which was confined in the boundary points of the manifold. But we discovered that this was not the case because if we take the second and the third example, which were so they are defined on the half-line, and we reflect the behavior for positive values of x to negative value to the negative values of x, what we obtain is the space, which is the role real line, and the functions. And the functions are the these weighted functions are such that so they are still the same, so they are exploding in zero. And the point zero can be obviously a middle point of geodesics in our space. Moreover, we can produce a space with as many as these nasty points as we want, just taking the compact interval, translating it. interval, translating it and gluing together J copies of this space, and this is still acid K negative n space. And so in particular, all these intermediate, all these points in which we are gluing to copies are actually can be intermedient points of geodesics in the space. So I don't know if there is some questions. Can I ask you a question, Jan? Because Can I ask you a question because I'm not understanding a small thing. So the idea is not going to infinity, right? So abolish signing zero is zero, right? Sorry, I lost the first graph. The weight is vanishing in zero, right? But we have here, so it's vanishing in zero, but we have this. vanishing in zero but we have this thing the negative value ah so n okay because my okay because my say n yeah and n is negative right right right right right right which is very important because this is the reason that we have these weights which are when without the end they are all nice because they are vanishing in zero but since we have the negative n everything I get to get them a cast onto the negative n. A cast onto the negative end, thank you. Um, so what we uh we wanted to, we were the result that we were expecting or we were hoping for was the stability of this condition. And so we assume that our sequence of metric measure space satisfied the C D K N condition for negative n, and that this sequence is converging to a limit structure. To a limit structure, this is in our suitable topology with respect to a suitable distance. And we would like to say that also the structure which is at the limit is still a CDKN space. But as you can expect, already the first major difficulty is to understand in which sense these metric measure spaces, in which the measure is so nasty, that is expensive. Is so nasty that is exploding in some points can be how we can define a suitable notion of distance between these structures. And the second difficulty in the proof of this result is given by the fact that the proof for the condition C D for positive M relies on the fact that the Renee entropy is lower semi-continuous on the Vasis. Continuous on the vastest time space, so on P2. But in this situation, the only thing that we can prove is that a weakly lower semi-continuous continuity in the set of measures in P2, which are not charging mass on the set of our nesty points, so on our singular set. So let's start with the first problem. So the one of defining the distance between Defining the distance between these structures. In any case, if there are questions, just interrupt me because now we go in a bit on technical things. So it's not okay. So let's go on. So we fix a cutoff function, a Lipschitz function, which is defined on zero plus infinity and takes value in zero, one. Value in 0, 1 and is such that this function is equal to 1 in the interval 0, 1 and is equal to 0 outside when x is greater or equal than 2. So using this cutoff function, we define the function fk, which is such that when the measure is radon, so when the set of points of singular points is equal to Singular points is equal to the empty set. Then this function is equal to zero outside a ball around the point P. So we are in a setting of pointed metric measure spaces. So we have this point P and we have the ball which has radius 2 to the power k plus 1. This function is equal to zero outside this decall. While when the measure is When the measure is a quasi-radon, so the set of singular points is non-empty, we have again this term which ensures that the function is zero outside the big ball. But we have also this term in which is saying that our function is equal to zero on a small neighborhood of Sm, and this small neighborhood has the size of two to the power minus k plus one. k plus one so we take this we use this function fk to define a kth cut of the measure this measure mk which is nothing but the our reference measure m multiplied by the function fk so now we obtain a metric measure space which is given a pointed metric measure space which is uh given by exactly the same space as before as before but the measure As before, but the measure now that we are going to consider is the measure MK. An important point to notice is that we are not cutting the space, but we are just cutting somehow the measure in such a way that we are excluding the set of nasty points and we are localizing our measure on the big holes. So now we want also some other regularity. Also, some other regularity in order to make sense a bit of this set of nesting measures. We require a bit of regularity on them. And so, in particular, we assume that the measure of the world space with respect to this mk of the world space is always finite for any k, which so it's saying us that the measure is always finite on the Always finite on big walls. And plus, another thing is the existence of this regularity parameter, which is given by this k bar. And it's such that for any k which is greater or equal than this bar k, it holds that the measure of the space is also greater than zero. So this means that we are not when we exclude the When we exclude the neighborhood of around the set of singular points, we are not throwing away too much of the mass. So there is always a little bit of mass which is conserved. Moreover, we define the set of a K regular point, so the K regular set, which is, as we expect, is given by the big ball minus the neighborhood of these points. And the important point is. The important point is that when we restrict our reference measure to this K regular set, we find a finite measure, and the support of this Mk is exactly given by this K regular set. So with this notion at this puzzle, we can now proceed in define the distance between these metric measure spaces. An important point is that the An important point is that the ideas to introduce this distance really rely on the paper of Gilly, Mondino and Sabare, in which they prove the stability of the R C D K infinity condition. But in their situation, the measure is radon. So in our situation, we have to deal also on the set of in which the measure is exploding. When this our quasi-radon measure is actually radon, our measure is actually radon, our construction is going back to is actually equivalent, is exactly the same as their construction. So first of all, we fix a cost function, which is a continuous function, which is non-constant and is concave, and it's such that is a zero in zero. And when the parameter is going to plus infinity, the cost function is going to be finite. An example is the hyperbolic tunnel. Is the hyperbolic tangent, or we cut the distance with one, and these are two examples of these cost functions. Then we can define the intrinsic Antorovich-Rubis time distance between two probability measures defined on a complete and separable metric space. And here we set it to be, so we take the integral of the So, we take the integral of the cost function on evaluated on the distance of points, and we integrate it with respect to an admissible coupling between m and n. And then we take the infimum among all these admissible couplings. What we gain in considering this cost function is the fact that here we don't have to consider the set of probability measures with finite second moment, but we can consider any cost function. But we can consider any couple of probability measures. Now, using this WC, we can introduce the distance between two metric measure spaces with finite mass. So now M1 of X1 is finite and M2 of X2 is finite. So we define, and moreover, as we said before, we have these two sets C1 and C2, which are closed sets. Which are closed sets with empty integer and measure equal to zero. How we define this distance is taking the, so we take this term which measures how far are the two measures from being, let's say, a probability measure. So you have this the logarithm of this fraction. And then we have a second term, which is a Second term, which is an infimon, over all the isometric embeddings of our two metric spaces into a complete and separable metric space Xd. And what we do is to see the distance of the images of our two reference points. Then we see the Hausdorff distance of the images of the two closed sets, C1 and C2. And last, And last term is the WC, distance of the push forwards of the two renormalized measures M1 and M2. And this gives us a distance between two metric measure spaces with finite mass. Very well. Now we use this distance as we can expect when the metric measure spaces are defined. Metric measure spaces are defined with our cut on the measure. And so we say that a couple of metric measure spaces, so we define the intrinsic atorabits-Ruby stand-lasting distance, just taking this sum over all the, so the sum is taken for k, which is greater or equal than k bar, which is the Than k bar, which is the common regularity parameter. We said that the regularity parameter before was the one ensuring us that even if we take away a bit of the neighborhood around the set SN, we have still mass on the space. Since here we have just two spaces, we have a common regularity parameter, which is just the maximum between the two regularity parameters for the measures. And we can definitely And we can define the distance between the two metric measure spaces using this mass, in which we have this term, which is rely on the fact that here we have the measures which are finite on our, the measures on Mk are finite. So this distance allows us to talk also about convergence. And so we say that a sequence of metric measure states is a R. metric measure space is a I K R W converging to a metric measure space. So if there is a common regularity parameter, now we have a sequence, so we have to require the existence of this parameter, and the limit of the distances between xn and x infinity is going to zero when n is going to infinity. Variables, so now this is the intrinsic distrust. Intrinsic distance, and we see as first properties that the fact that this convert this distance is going to zero is equivalent to the fact that also the distance of the spaces with finite mass is going to zero. And here, the cut of the measure is taken for any k which is greater or equal than the regularity parameter associated to the convolution. Parameter associated to the convergent sequence. Moreover, the fact that this distance is going to zero is equivalent to the existence of this effective realization for the convergence, meaning that there exists a complete and separable metric space and a sequence of isometric embeddings from Xn to the common metric space for which we metric space for which we have that this so the one that where it was defining the the distance is going to zero and here all the distance are taken with respect to the the distance in the metric space in which we are embedding everything this is very important this second characterization because it allows us to talk about also extrinsic convergence Extrinsic convergence. And we say that a sequence of pointed metric measure spaces converts extrinsically to a metric measure space if there exists a common regularity parameter and there exists a complete and separable metric space and a sequence of isometric embeddings for which this quantity is going to zero. And now we notice that here the term involving the Hausdorver distance of the Of the singular, the embedding of the singular sets has actually disappeared. So we have just the term measuring the distance of the two measures from being a probability measure. This is the distance of the embedded points in the sequence of spaces. And this is the WC distance of the push forward of the measures. Forward of the measures. So, paying the price of having from the beginning an effective realization for the convergence, we can get rid of the fact that we have to consider the distance on the household distance on the closed sets. The reason why we were interested also in this kind of convergence was due to the fact that we were hoping to find also a way to approximate. A way to approximate our half-line, which was given by zero included plus infinity, with, for example, let's think about our measure, which is x to the power n. We would like to approximate this example by a sequence of spaces which are 1 over n plus infinity. So we are cutting our half-line close by to zero. But what happens that in a cut? But what happens that in cutting our space, we are also cutting the set of points in which the measure is actually exploding. So along the sequence, we would have actually a sequence of C D spaces for which the measure is radon. And what we obtain at the limit is a measure which is quasi-radon. But in this particular example, is covered by this extrinsic convergence because we know that everything can be. We know that everything can be embedded again in the half-line, and there is no more need to talk about the house of distance between these singular sets. So, with these notions, this definition at our dispose, we have also to introduce another definition, which is the one of the approximate CD condition, which is so we say that a metric measure space satisfy the approximate. Space satisfy the approximate curvature dimension condition if the CD condition holds when we require that the two measures mu0 and mu1 are such that their support is actually contained in the regularity in the case regularity set. This is important because as you can expect we have we need some approximation in order to To get our result. And another important observation is the fact that our kth regularity set, so Rk, in general, is not geodesically convex. So it can happen that actually we start with two measures, mu0 and mu1, which are the support is contained in Rk, but we take the W2 geodesic, we evaluate, we see at the map. We evaluate we see at the measure we see the measure of mu t and what we have that is that the support of mu t is not not contained entirely on an RK, but it has a bit of mass which is going outside. This is important because again we introduce this definition of omega uniformly convexity and so we say that a metric measure space is omega uniformly Measure space is omega uniformly convex if there exists a function omega which has the following properties. So, once we take two probability measures, measures with finite second moment and the entropy, which is bounded from above by a constant M. And they are such that so that our these two probability measures are have the support which is included in the K. Which is included in the case regularity set. Then we have that the middle point mu t is such that it gives as the mass of mu t of the h, so another parameter regularity set is bounded from below by the one minus some constant. What does this mean? So this constant is. So this constant is exactly the one this function omega is exactly a bound on how much of mass we can lose outside Rh. And the important point is that, as you can expect from this thing, when Rk is actually geodesically convex, the function The function omega kkm is equal to zero because being geodetically convex, nothing is going outside. Instead, if the support of mu T is a subset of the complementary of Rh, this omega is exactly equal to one. So again, is exactly how much of the mass we are losing. And we would We are losing, and we would like to have it a control which is uniform. That's why we need this definition. This second property is very natural once we set this thing that this omega k H M gives us a way to measure the mass which is going outside the H cut. Because when H is going to go to plus infinity, these regularity set R H are going to invade our space. Are going to invade our space, and since the support of MOTI is contained in the space, this function is going to zero. So this is important because as we said, in our stability, we would like to have a uniform control along the sequence of this quantity. So we take a sequence of metric measure spaces which is converging in a IK. Converging in a IKRW distance to a metric measure space, and we assume that in each step, so the metric measure space is a CDKN space with n which is negative. We assume that there exists an omega for which each metric measure space along the sequence, so each at each step n, this is a omega uniformly convex set. Convex set, the space. And plus, we need some bound on the diameter of the metric space once the curvature is less than zero. And this is again just a matter of the distortion coefficients that they are going to explore. So what we have, if we have these conditions which are satisfying, is the fact that at the limit we have acidic KN space. Moreover, this is. Moreover, this is also true if we have a sequence of spaces which is extrinsically converging to a metric measure space and these three conditions are satisfied, then what we have at the limit again is a CDKN space. So this is the result. I would like just to show you a bit of the ideas of how we can prove it. So first of all, So, first of all, just a matter of terminology. We want to prove that Sn the entropy is less or equal than this integral that we call it T T of K N. And so we have the important point is that here we have the pi, the optimal coupling between the two measures, and here we have the reference measure. So, this is the thing that are actually entering into this. Are actually entering to this function. So we want to prove that for any couple of probability measures with finite second moment in X infinity, there exists a vassel standard ASIC and an optimal plan for which the curvature dimension is satisfied. And in order to do it, we will use two kinds of approximations. We call the horizontal approximation. The horizontal approximation, the one which is done at the level of the single space, so Xn X infinity, these are horizontal approximations. While we call vertical approximations, the one that are approximating our finite measures in terms of the single spaces Xn. So, how we argued was like, first of all, Was like, first of all, assuming that the support of the two measures, mu0 and mu1, were actually included in the kth regular set of x infinity. And then what we do is to consider this map P and K, which is an optimal coupling between the k-th measure, the k-cut of the measure in M infinity and the k-cut of the measure at the level of Cut of the measure at the level of xn. So we take this map, which is the optimal coupling between these two probability measures, and making use of it, we can project the measures, the measure mu0 and mu1, which are in p2 of the limit space, to the single layers of xn. And we find these approximating sequence made of these. Made of this mu ni, and this is our vertical approximation. Then, what we do is we know that actually at in each single X Xn, in each single metric measure space in the sequence of Xn, Dn, Mn, we have that the CD condition holds. And so, what we can find is a pair of W2 geodesics in each single. Physics in each single space and the optimal couplings for which the CD condition is actually satisfied. Passing to the limit in this vertical limit we refer to this from xn to x infinity. Then we can find that there exists a limit multi pi that T pi that so far we cannot say that is a the right couple satisfying the CD condition. But once we prove the lower semi-continuity of the entropy functional and the upper semi-continuity of the functional T along so the sequence of Xn, then we can conclude that actually the approximate C D inequality holds for the limit space X infinity. For the limit space x infinity. Approximate because we have said that our the support of the two measures is contained in the k-the regularity set of the space x-infinity. So far we have obtained this partial, so far, just partial result. What we want to do is to extend also the case in which the measures mu0 and mu1 are actually in a p2. actually in a p2 of the of x infinity and in order to do it so now we we we apply an horizontal approximation so we start with these two measures and using this horizontal approximation we can find a suitable sequence of measures which are converging w2 converging to to mu 0 and mu 1 respectively and they are such that at each single step k That at each single step, K, the support of the measure is contained in the K F regularity set. Then, again, the approximate C D condition ensures the existence of the geodesic in P2 between the two measures and the optimal coupling such that the C D condition is satisfied. And again, the lower semicontinuity of the entropy and the upper semi-continuity. Entropy and the upper semicontinuity of the functional t allows us to conclude that the C D condition holds also for this metric measure space at the limit. And this is what I wanted to tell you, and I thank you for your attention. Thanks for the nice talk. Are there any questions? Questions? Okay, can I ask a question? So are there any for this distance that you define under your assumptions on CDKN with negative K, will you have any sort of pre-compactness statements or maybe under some? Or maybe under some extra assumptions, like away from the singular set, do you have any kind of local doubling on these regular parts? This is a very good question because we are, yeah. So the pre-compactness in general is something that we cannot expect. Because we cannot expect that the set of all the closed subsets, so is a singular set is a. That so is a single set is a yes, I can, but this is pretty clear, right? But I'm not sure if you can do something to yeah, this is a uh yeah, it's very um it's a very natural and very nice question. Also, this thing of the doubling condition, because uh it would be nice to have some doubling, like at least in some region of the space, right? Right, yes. But it's yeah, it's not so trivial because the C D condition is actually going in the wrong direction. Condition is actually going in the wrong direction. Yes, so you will have some bound from below on the growth of the balls instead of above. And so this is something that is not clear. So it's nice, but we don't know so far. Can you ask me a question also? I mean, just uh just uh I mean, just a booster. So, right, because so this CDKN with negative n includes also CDK infinity. And CDK infinity, I think we don't expect it to be locally doubling. No. Right, so maybe this is probably. Oh, or it includes CDK infinity somehow? I see. Yeah. Right, so I think this is kind of an abstraction. At least, like, let's say in a, say, okay, in some models or some. In some models or with some additional assumptions. Yeah, under some additional assumptions somewhere away from the singular set. I don't know. It's impose some natural conditions because this is. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, right. One has to add. Yeah. At least like say, okay, in the class of CDKN spaces with negative n, if you have locally doubling, then you have to be automatically. Then you have to be automatically a CDKN space with n finite and positive, would be, however, a good result. But sure, sure, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then kind of on the same steroid question, what kind of say geometric inequalities or geometric estimates properties can we expect on CDKN spaces with n negative? So you mentioned some lower bound of volume of bolts. Bolts. So, of which kind? So, it's kind of a reverse Bishop Gromo? I don't know. What kind of? Yeah, so like it's a bound of, let's say, the ball. So, let's say you have two balls and you can estimate the volume in the small ball with respect to the volume in the big ball. In a quantified sense, okay. So, with okay, with estimate. With uh okay with estimates i see then there are some yeah like uh ota introduced some uh talagrand inequality or so we have some inequality on the entropy and yeah this kind of of inequalities but for many of them it's not also clear uh if you which kind of conditions you have to put on the on the explosion of the measure, let's say. Explosion of the measure, let's say. I see. Already, like, we have these models, but it's, let's say, already it's not so easy to formalize how fast is the measure exploding, because if you want to be just in the setting of a metric measure space, it's not clear to give a formulation of these things. Yeah, right. But is it the CDKN condition giving some bound on how fast the weight can explode? Because you are getting some. Explode because you are getting some inequality. No, is it going in the wrong direction? Okay, it's going the wrong direction. I see. So I can read. Okay, just I see, I see. Yeah, because exactly you can estimate the volume of the big wall with the one of the small walls. Right, right, right, right, right, got it, got it, got it. Yeah, and plus, like, this volume has to be when you don't intersect the singular set, otherwise, everything is plus infinity. Okay, right. And can you define the Chigar energy on these kind of spaces? We are working on it with Mattia, Verenzo de Los Cabo, and Kuhai Sutuki. Okay, because then the natural question would be, is there an Eulerian formulation using the Chigara energy and etc. And yeah, the standard theory seems to be a little bit like far, in a sense, we are very far in the. Far, in a sense, we are very far in the second long-term project, yeah. So, let's see what the formulation seems to be quite natural, then the equivalence with the Lagrangian approach is not so straightforward, especially because you need like some stochastical completeness that in the paper in the work of Ambrose Gili Sabare is formulated in terms of the growth of poles and in our situation we don't. And in our situation, we don't have it. Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, thank you. Very nice talk and problem. Yeah, I have a very basic question. So the examples you presented at the beginning with the lines and concentrated measure, can you say something in those? Like, can you construct examples where somehow the measures are getting nicer in the limits? Or it's something. Or it's something that you would in general expect because somehow you're cutting off where the measure is blowing up, right? So, these examples. Yeah. So, sorry, you mean that so something that along the sequence is a quasi-radon measure, but at the end you have something which is radon, you mean? Yes, something like that. This is something that we could not. This is something that we could not expect. Let's say that when things are going to be like they are going to not improve, but making worse, it can be, not like the fact that you are regularizing along the sequence, we don't expect it to be true. Especially because let's say when the intrinsic convergence, you have always this term which involves the fact that you have the The fact that you have the distance, the absolute distance of the singular set with the one of the limit. So it's not so plausible that at the limit you have something which has a singular set which is empty, while along the sequence you had something which was quasi-adon. Yeah, I see. Thanks. Are there any more questions? Maybe one. Sorry, is it just One, sorry, this is just a curious thing. So, the so you mentioned some examples entering into this class. So, what and say this example, where do they come from? The CDKN condition for N positive is kind of some geometric, say, usually this weight comes from collapsing, and so they have some geometric motivation. And say these weights that show up in negative N, they show up for improbability. So, what is the probability web so what is the so this is just like the construction based on the result of auta which is the one that i was mentioning the one of k n convex functions so we know that the logarithm of this function is a k n convex function you can prove it by hand with n which is a negative okay but the one by bobkov meal But the one by Bobkov, Millman, etc. They so basically was basically solve an differential inequality and produce a weight or this kind of weights were kind of natural from other fields and no probability or other motivations? Yeah, exactly. These are already like something which was already clear. Let's say there are models. So these ones, they are this class of Of measures, and you can prove that actually there are C D z or minus alpha spaces. But these are examples in which the set of measures are probability measures. And yeah, and these are for sure interesting, but it's something which is a more or less standard and as you said, is a classical in the theory. Yeah, right. But see, these ones were sort of. Say these ones were so they constructed these examples, or they were kind of so. My question is: say, is basically: so, what is the real motivation for this theory of negative n? Is it geometric? Is it analytic? It is incomparability. So, yeah, okay. So, the thing goes back to this paper by Hota and Takatsu. Yes. So this the reason why they started studying the this Milman, okay, so these papers come from after this paper by Hot and Takatsu, in which so the this M-relative entropy is studied. And this is it's a so it has an approach which is based on actually the porous medium equation and all these fast diffusion equations. So let's say that these are, if I'm not wrong, when M is greater than Not wrong, when m is greater than one, it's the fast fast diffusion of the equation over the so it has for sure a base on the PDE approach. And here, so yeah, the fact that this relative entropy is a k-convex in the vast distance space was studied by Hot and Dakatu, and it has also this geometric application in the theory of rich equivalent tensors. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Maybe I can ask one question. Yes, so is there any example of space that would satisfy this for all negative n, which is not C D K infinite? Um already our examples are not C D K infinite. Examples are not CDK infinity spaces. Our class of examples are C D K infinity C D K so for example this space the half line is a C D zero minus something space but is not a C D K infinity space C D 0 infinity space right but this I mean so when you fix Right, but this I mean so when you fix uh n this satisfies it uh only for some n not for l not for any right I mean it the space you mean for any negative n no yeah this no I am not aware of it okay also because actually there is like the monotonicity goes in the wrong dire in the Goes in the other direction, let's say. So you know that when, let's say, when you have positive n, a C D K n space is also C D K infinity space. And what Hota suggests is that plus infinity is equivalent to minus infinity, meaning that the entropy, when you let n go into minus infinity in our Renier entropy, you obtain the integraph of rho log rho. The integral of rho log rho. So now when something is a C D k minus infinity is a C D k minus n, so n negative. So it's going from minus infinity up. Let's see. I don't know. Okay, more questions to originate discussion. To a reach. If not, we thank Chiara again for the talk and for the discussion.
