So the title is New Lincoln's Estimates in Nonlinear Diffusion. So please. Okay, thanks. The blackboard is yours. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the introduction. Thanks to the organizer for organizing this beautiful meeting and inviting me. Thanks to everybody for being here. So this will be really a talk on nonlinear diffusion and in particular I will concentrate on the two probably most classical examples of non-linear diffusion. Classical example of non-linear diffusion that is the porous medium equation and the fast diffusion equation. Possibly with a drift, with a potential. So the equation that I will look is something like this. dt so we use a mixture of notation so n is density dtn is divergence of n grab p where p will be a function of n but not an odd reference otherwise it would be linear diffusion so let's say p will be So let's say P will be n to the gamma, maybe times the sine of gamma in the sense that I can use either gamma positive. So if you have gamma positive, it means that this is more than power one globally. So it is the essentially this is up to a coefficient depending on gamma is the Laplacian of m to the gamma plus one. And this is the force medium equation or gamma negative. But of course you have to keep that good monotonicity. Gamma negative is the fast diffusion equation. Sometimes I could I could put the potential here, a given potential here. And so, what I will be discussing about this equation, I will be mainly interested in Lipschitz estimates. And I try to start from the motivation which motivated me. So, I'm studying a lot this equation and other equations in the form of gradient flows in the Bastan space. So, this well known that when you have P, which is a function of N, let's write. Is a function of n. Let's write it as the derivative of something at n. This is the gradient flow of the energy f of n equals integral of f of n l in, so gradient flow of this energy in the vastness space W two. So it means that a possible way to attack and solve this equation is to use, for instance, the JKO scheme and iteratively solve mean To resolve mean of f of n plus w2 squared between n and the previous step divided by two power. Now, suppose that I enable, okay, let's talk for a while, suppose that I'm able to prove some leap shifts bound on p. It means that this quantity is bounded, but graph P is the velocity which appears as a velocity in the continuity equation. So, if you have an infinity bound on the velocity, So, if you have an L infinity bound on the velocity, with discretizing time, it means that every particle will move not more than constant times tau. Now, this is useful, for instance, if you want to use a numerical method on this, in the sense that this problem where the unknown is n, contains, in the definition of w2 another minimization problem because w2 is defined as the minimum minimization of the transport cost. So, this can also be written as minimization among transport plumps. Among transport plumes, so omega could be the whole space or whatever you want, of f of the second marginal, the fourth maybe here, the fourth marginal of gamma plus the integral of x minus y squared d gamma divided by two power with the condition that the second marginal of gamma is entering. So you can say that you have an optimization problem where the unknown is a transport. Unknown is a transport line. Now, if you do, besides discretization in time, also discretization in space, it means that your unknown is a measure on couples of points, and the number of unknowns is the square of the number of points in the discretization. So it can be very, very large. But if you are able to prove that particles do not go farther than a certain distance, then you can restrict, and instead of considering all the possible pairs, you just have to consider a certain neighbor of the diagonal. And this can reduce a lot the number of unknowns. So, this was the original motivation. Unknowns. So, this was the original motivation to obtain Lipschitz estimates in order to apply them to this kind of, let's say, numerical approximation strategy for the Guardian flow. If one wants to really be precise, it would be better. Instead of having Lipschitz estimate on the equation, to have Lipschitz estimate at the JQO level, that is, prove that the pressure which will appear here, but for the one which appears here in this optimization problem. Here in this optimization problem, as some ellipsis bound. For instance, for the Fokker-Planck case, the case of linear diffusion, this is possible. You can essentially mimic in the discrete in time level, so in the JKO scheme, mimic some of the estimates that you can have in the computer level. And if one wants even to be more precise, it would even be better to prove this kind of bounds on the fully discrete scheme. Because if the goal was to approximate with a finite grid, then you should prove that on the problem where you minimize this among gamma. Minimize this among gamma, which is the probabilities of pairs of points on a grid to prove that you actually don't use pairs of points which are out of a neighborhood of the diagonal. But anyway, even for this numerical approximation, if you have a result at the continuous level, this could be useful because you could decide that in this optimization problem, you add the constraint that you don't use points which are out of the diagonal. You're not able, maybe, maybe you're not able to prove that the solutions are besides this, but you add the constraint. Solution satisfies this, but you add the constraint which at the limit will be satisfied. So you expect that if you have an optimization problem, it's a sequence of optimization problems, and you add the constraint which maybe it's binding at the finite level. So you add an extra constraint, but at the limit you don't see it, so you expect that you converge to the same limit. So this is the original motivation. So I tried to look at some Lipschitz estimate on B. This actually, at first, I did something about the At first, I did something about the Pok√©mon case in the JKO case. Then, the interest for the Poros Medium case came out of some discussion in Paris a little bit more than one year ago with Marcus, who is here, and Noemi David, who was a PhD student in Paris at the time, and now she's postdoc with me in Lyon. And essentially, the results that we'll present in the rest of the talk are in collaboration with Noimi. So, let's try to see what we can say about See what we can say about the maximum of grad P out of this equation. So, the key tool is very well known for those who know or for those who study the PowerSimed equation is to write an equation for the pressure. Because P is a certain function of N, you have an equation for N, you can write the equation of the pressure. This is well known as DTP equals gamma P La Tashan P plus gamma P squared. You can see you just write P as a function of N and you differentiate. Yes, I'm sorry. This gamma will never appear again. And there will be. You're right, you're perfectly right. So this probably will become pi. But this, yeah, I would talk about the letter which doesn't appear anymore. This was just the motivation at the beginning of the talk. At all. So we have this equation for p. Now, let us look at max of grad p square over 2. I call this, you know, u of p, it's a max over x, and I want to compute the derivative of u. And of course, you know, you just have to compute the derivative of this term in the maximum power. So this will be grad p dot dp grad p. So I have to take the gradient of this equation. Take the gradient of this equation. So I have grad p dot grad p this is when I differentiate this, plus gamma p grad p dot grad Laplacian plus gradient of this. But then of course I use the fected term on the maximum point. So since I'm maximizing this, its gradient will vanish. And also the Laplace and And also the Laplacian of grav p squared over 2 will be negative. But this guy is exactly grav p dot degrees of the Laplacian plus the second order term. So I get this. And so I get that this is smaller than gamma p squared p minus gamma p squared. And then I'm a little bit annoyed by the presence of second-order derivatives, but here it appears to be a square and a good sign because gamma p is positive. Gamma P, by the way, is positive both in the porous medium and in the fast diffusion case in the sense that gamma can be negative, but then P is negative. So gamma P in all the form could be positive. In case I change the sign, but the product, it's okay. So this is a good sign, and then you just do a A young gimmick call to get something. So, what can you get? Then, probably it's better to distinguish the two cases: dimension one and dimension agent one. Because actually, in dimension one, you can say much more. In dimension one, I said that this gradient should vanish, but this gradient is H and figure P. So it means that in dimension one, this means Pxx, Px. And of course, Px doesn't vanish because I'm maximizing the derivative. So, the secondary, the only second derivative. So the second derivative, the only second derivative which exists in dimension one is zero. So dimension one here is zero. So in dimension one is clear. This point decreases in time. And this is well known. In higher dimension, I could do a simple inequality which says that the Laplace of the typical arithmetic quadratic mean. The Laplace over D is greater than the square root of this over D. So this is the sum of the any values and this is the sum of the eigenvalue squares. So this can be combined with. Can be combined with it. I could even do more vector. In my case, I can put the g minus one. Why? Because I already know that one of the entries on the diagonal is zero. So if I choose a basis where to write the H matrix, where the gradient of p is the first element of the width, this eigenvector will make a value zero. So I can do the same in the code of p minus one. So in the end, what I get here is by using the good result, it's something like gamma p. Got P to the 4, and then if I'm not wrong, I have 4 D minus 4 something or D minus something like this. So what do I get? And there is P, sorry. There is a P here because I have to compensate the P to the F. So this result is a little bit disappointing for two reasons. The first is that you have this P and the dominator. So I was quite naive. Usually when I Quite naive. Usually, when I study the JKO schemes, I very often put myself on compact domains. So you have Neumann boundary conditions. And you can say that if you start from the initial datum which is bounded from below, this is preserved by the equation. So just on the assumption that P0 is bounded from below, and this will be true forever. So this is a constant. It's okay, it's true, but just that it's not an interesting case for the non-linear diffusion because if you study the case of what the borrow. Because if you study the case of the Born-Median case, where the density is bound from below, the equation becomes uniformly parabolic. So essentially, it's not an interesting case. And the other fact is that, okay, even if this is a constant, then here you have the square of u. So this is smaller than constant u squared. So it means that the estimate that you get explodes in finite time. You can even adapt this proof in the JKOK. So in the discrete, in time discrete. So you get something which explodes in finite time and you need these assumptions. Floats in spin and time, and you need this assumption. So, this is somehow disappointing. Now, then you can try to change a little bit what you do in order to insert some other coefficients which help a little bit. And then, what we will do is to look at this. U of t will be now equal to the maximum of graph p square over 2 times something, and this something will be a certain power of p. Of p. And now, and actually, for the computation, it's better to write it in the form of an exponential, it's an exponential of a function of p. You do the computation, then I will choose the alpha, the telescope is fine. And it happens that in some cases, the computation is better. Now, I will not do all the computations here. The blackboard, but I will give you the tools to do this. So, the first thing is that what is U prime? U prime of sh of of course will be exponential alpha times. course will be exponential alpha times and then you have to differentiate all the time all the terms so it will be alpha prime dtp times dead p squared over two plus p dt dot p. So essentially, this is the same term as we had before, but of course you also have to differentiate this. And then these two terms, you take them from the equation of the pressure. Then what else was I doing? I was using the optimal. I was using the optimized condition for the maximization, which changed a little bit. So it will not be true anymore that the gradient of this term should vanish because there is also this one. So the other tools are that Hn of P grad P will not be anymore equal to zero, but will be equal to minus alpha prime, I mean alpha prime of P grad P grad P square over P which is anyway good, it means that grad P is still an eigenvector of the H with another eigenvector. Of the etchel with another eigenvalue, which is not zero, but it's something that you can compute. And then you have more complicated condition of the Laplacian. It's the Laplacian of the product, which should be negative. But you can write it in terms of the Laplacian of this term. And this should be equal to HN squared over two, so smaller than. And then here you have a grad alpha of p squared. Alpha of p squared minus the Laplacian of alpha of p. And then, of course, this is just by computing what happens when you maximize exponential alpha times f. So it's easier if you look at, so that's why alpha appears, because writing the Laplace of a product is annoying, but the writing the Laplace of a sum is easier, so you pass to the logarithm. And that's why you have this term which appears because you pass to the logarithm. So you have the log rate of the eighth of the log rate of the of the of the ratio and you also use the first order optimizing condition to write this and this can be rewritten as grad p square over two and then you have something like alpha alpha prime square minus alpha second grad p square minus alpha prime La Vash if you expand on the terms so what do you do you replace So, what do you do? You replace this with the equation. You replace this with the gradient of the equation. You get, you replace every time that you see this term, you replace this, and actually, what happens is that you're lucky, you always see this term dot graph P. So, you have a graph P4. And in the end, let's say that what you get is using this inequality, you get exponential alpha, and then you have some kind of term. Some terms are of the four graph P to the four. form of grad p to the four for instance when you have this times grad p it becomes a grad p to the four grad p to the four times some going to reach it with a prime second and so on then you have sometimes we have grad p squared times label p for instance this one again times some coefficients alpha prime alpha second and so on and then we have a good term which is essentially that A good term, which is essentially the same that you had before, gamma p h and p squared, because actually in the equation you never get these. So you'd like to have this Laplacian here, but you only have the other part, one of the two parts. You only have grab p, grab gradient, yes, grab p, grab Laplacian. And this is the term that we'll have. Then I try to do the same as I did before in this way. I will write what is In this way, I rewrite what is Laplacian P. Laplacian P. I know one of the coefficients on the diagonal. So Laplacian P will be minus alpha prime grad p square over 2. In the sense that one of the eigenvalues is minus alpha prime grad p square over 2 plus epsilon. I call epsilon the sum of all the other eigenvalues. And what about h of p squared? This will be at least, so there will be this on. So there will be this on the diagonal. So you have alpha prime square grabbed by 4 over 4. And the sum of the squares of all the other eigenvalues for the same inequality as before would be at least epsilon square over p minus 1. Now, you insert all these terms here, and in the end, you get something like this. Exponential alpha, you only get in the end the graph P4. In the end, grab p4 because all of the terms in the end, even these will be comparable. So, this term will let another graph p square appear, and there is an epsilon. So, your graph p square epsilon, essentially, do the same thing as before with the young equals. So, in the end, you have just repeat with again some coefficients, alpha prime, alpha second, p, and so on. And these are sticky to the population. Then I do my choice. I take alpha of p, which is Which is B times of this is for the forest medium case. For the fast diffusion case, the case where gamma is negative, I just put the modules here. And I promise that I will always choose B gamma positive. So B and gamma will have the same. So essentially you see that there are some coefficients which appear, but when they could have the wrong sign, they are always coupled together with the good. They are always coupled together with the good with the sign as it happens for the Poros medium case. And in this case, in the end, you have exponential, sorry, in the exponential P to the B, so to be modulus of P to the B if you are in the other case, you have P4. And here, if you see, so we have this alpha prime is a constant of Fp. Of course, you have to track all the terms. And in the end, you have all these terms of the form constant of Fp. So, and this constant P, so I have. So, and this constant p, so I have I subtract the p because it's constant. I have a very precise constant, which is, I'm not wrong, p minus one gamma over four. It was over there. Because I want to show you that I get, if I put b equals zero, I get the same result, but if I'm wrong, when I'm right, b minus one gamma over four plus. four plus it's a b square gamma b square of gamma b square over four minus b over you have a second coefficient which depends on gamma b and they now if you put b equals zero you come back to what you had before and what is the description so you have a u prime smaller than something which more or less is u square not Or less it's u square, not exactly, but with a positive coefficient, you have slot infinite part. But maybe you can choose B so that it becomes negative. Now you can even see that the optimal B, the one which minimizes, is B equals one over gamma. And this is quite nice because it's one over gamma. It means that here you have P to the one over gamma, so the B, P to the one over gamma, which is A. Gamma, which is n. So it's quite funny because the quantity n gravity squared is exactly the energy which appears as a slope, but I'm not looking at it integrated in space. I'm looking at the maximum. So it's an interesting quantity, the n gravity, the maximum of n gravity squared. Now, if choosing the optimal b is not enough to make this negative, it depends on gamma. And the answer is this is negative, gamma is small. You can see that if you didn't have this, you can. You can see that if you didn't have this, you can make this negative because you have this squared here a minus b. So, unfortunately, this result only applies if you have an equation which is non-linear, but with a non-linearity gamma, which is more. So, essentially, it says to be almost linear. So, for the Poros medium equation, it's quite restricted as a result. I think the condition is that you need gamma square smaller than one over square over three minus one. Again, in dimension one, there is no problem, but in the other dimension, There's no problem, but in the other dimension, you so you can arrive in dimension two up to the case that we saw in many talks today, that is the quadratic case, gamma equals one. The interesting point is that for the fast diffusion, for other reasons, you usually assume gamma larger than minus two over three. And this is compatible. And there will be maybe in the rest of the talk other conditions that they should put on gamma. All the talk will be, I have some conditions will depend on gamma, B and D. Will depend on gamma, b and d and i want to choose b such that the coefficient has the good sign. So, and this imposes condition on gamma, but it will always be compatible with this. So, for the fast diffusion equation, I can always do this in the case in the regime where gamma is less than minus 2 over d, which is the regime that is usually used to have mass conservation and some estimates and other estimates. So, in terms of small, I can make this negative. So, first of all, I get that this one. First of all, I get that this quantity decreases in time. This is the Lipschitz constant of a certain power of P. Not P, Johnson percent power of N, not exactly the one that I need. But I can make it better because now I can make it strictly negative and see how the quantity decreases. So I can write my inequality that I get. My inequality that I get as so u of t I said it's max p to the b grad p squared over 2 and what I'm proving is that u prime is, so I had p to the b minus 1 grad p 4 with a certain constant which I assume that I make it negative. Now this I write it as b to the 2b, p to the 2b p to the minus b plus 1. And so in the end I have And so, in the end, I have minus constant p to something u squared. So, for instance, an assumption: suppose that p is an infinity. So, what does g essentially? Suppose that you start from an infinite initial data. Then you know that this is preserved in time. For the porous medium case, L infinity for P implies L infinity for N and L infinity for P is the same. For the fast diffusion case, it's a little bit trickier. So, for the fast diffusion, I will also choose, and it's possible. I will also choose, and it's possible, B, which is, so if gamma is positive, then I take, then good B. If gamma is negative, take B smaller than minus one. So that this B plus one will be negative. So this will be positive. So now what I want to do is that this coefficient, I like this coefficient to be bounded from below, to say that this really gives a dissipation. So bounded from below, if this is a positive exponent, it means that they want. Positive exponent, it means that they want p bounded from below, and in the end for the fast diffusion, it means n bound from above, which again is something which is preserved. So suppose that I start from an infinite initial data, then this would be bounded by a constant, so I will have. And so you get that u of t is more than c over t. This is a consequence of u prime is less than minus u squared. If you want to be rigorous, you start the approximate initial data with. You start, you approximate the initial datum with something for which this quantity is finite. You look at the words. You see this inequality backward. Backward is inequality explodes in finite time, but you do not explode before time zero. So it means that you cannot be too large. And then this too large only depends on the fact that you were finite, but not how much finite in time zero. So this is general. So this is for pinal infinity. So this is an immediate regularization. So, this is an immediate regularization. So, if you start from a lymph field initial datum, you immediately become not exactly Lipschitz. A certain power is Lipschitz. And this compared to other results which are known for classical results in the porous medium, does so for porous medium, there are many Lipschitz results which are known even on the pressure itself, but it's after a certain time. Because in porous medium, there is a problem with the holes. If you start from an initial ditum, which has hole, everything works well after the first time. Well, at the first time, where the support of the ST covers the smallest ball, which includes all the initial support. So, this is immediate. But on the other hand, it's not lip sheets for P, it's Lipschitz for a certain power of P. So it's easier that P squared is Lipschitz. Now, this was an assumption, Pinelique. But you can also get something using, for instance, the Aronson-Benilan inequality. This is another very classical technique in both Parosmeters and Pass Diffusion. It is well. Problems and passive fusion, it is well known that you have that Laplacian of P is larger than minus one over gamma plus two over D, another reason to choose gamma larger than minus over D, times one over P. So at each instant of this, how do you get this equation? You take the equation for the pressure and you take the Laplacian. And then you have again a principle like the derivative compared to the square and instantaneous finiteness. Now, it means that for fixed time t, you have a lower bound on the Laplacian of T. Have a lower bound on the Laplacian of P. So if P is very large in a point, on average, on balls around this point, it should still be very large because if you have a lower bound on the Laplacian, the average cannot go down too much. If P is large, N is large. By the way, in all my settings, I'm obliged to choose gamma small. Think of the power of medium notation, gamma small. It means n is p to the one over gamma. One over gamma is large. So n is a convex function of p. And by a n say inequality, if the average An inequality if the average of p is large, the average of n is large. So, in the end, if p is very large in a point, you find the ball where the average of p and the average of n are very large, but the mass is one, or let's say the mass is preserved, it's fixed. So it's not possible, so you get an infinity bound on p out of the arons of any line and the mass conservation. Of course, it will be something which depends on t. So, let's say that you get that p is smaller than t to a certain power. You can insert it here in here. You can insert it here, and you get again a u prime less than u square, but instead of having a constant, you have a power of t. You compute what you get. You get a u of t smaller than t to a certain power that I don't want to compute here at the blackboard. So that's an information. This does not depend on. So this requires an assumption on the initial data because it requires P0 to be electricity. This does require nothing. And actually, this bound that you get is sharp on the bar and black zone. This bound that you get is sharp on the barren-blood solution. So the baryon-blood solution are the family of self-similar solution of these equations, which are of the form n of tx, if I'm not wrong, should be something like t to the minus alpha d constant minus cap k x square over t to the alpha. that T to the alpha the two alpha X over the alpha host start so for bound medium equation these are compactly supported two to the one of the gamma yes so it means that you also have expression for P so this is the bar block and P will be something like if you remove the one over gamma this for Polyzungi equations these are compactive For Porosumidium equations, these are compactly supported self-singular solution. K gamma, so alpha is a certain coefficient, which, if I'm not wrong, is something like d gamma plus two, something like this. And K is a certain coefficient which you can compute out of alpha, but there's the same sign of gamma. So parus medium is compactly supported. For the fast diffusion cave, this is a plus sign, so it means that you are strictly positive everywhere. Are strictly positive everywhere, so you know this. And if you compute this exact quantity for any b, but under assumption that b satisfies the negativity of the coefficient that I have, this is sharp for the Barylaut solution. So you get a certain rate of decrease of the Lipschitz constant of a certain function of the pressure, a certain power of the pressure. So as I was saying, compared to this, it was also known that. It was also known that there were already a sharp leap shift rate for the limit. So the gamma cannot be very different. The limit is the same in the sense that the extra condition that I had by chance, but that's why it was important, for instance, not to waste, not to use D instead of D minus one. I really needed to use as much as possible the best constant so that by chance in the end. Best constant so that by chance, in the end, gamma lambda minus poverty, poverty is okay, is enough. And so there were already sharp results about the Lipschitz behavior of the pressure, even without using P to the P, but they were typically done for compactly supported solutions because very often you have bounds which are bound that you bound the gradient of P with X and then you use. With X and then use, but X is in the support, and the support grows at a certain speed. Here also works for non-compacting supported solutions, which are maybe not so interesting, but it's possible to use this. And then I want to tell you a few words about what happens if you do with the potential. So with potential, the equation that I look is dtn is divergence of n graph q and q is p, the same thing as before, plus a potential d. Same thing as before, plus a potential. Now we have to do the same computation, and they are annoying. And what you get is dt to the b, and here I put grab q square over q. From the point of view of the J-clayer scheme, which is not important here, but it's my starting point, this is natural because it's q, which is related to the gantropic potential. This is smaller than, and then you have p to the d, and then you have some quality, some some terms which are written this way. Some terms which I write in this way: C1, grad Q square, grad P square. So I used to have a grad P to the 4, but now Q and P are not the same unless V is 0. And they combine. Plus C2, grad Q dot grad P square. Again, this would be grad P to the 4 if V was 0, but they are not the same. Plus, plus F the term where V appears, which is, if you're not wrong, gamma V over 2 Laplacian V grad Q square. Grad q square minus H and V grad Q. So you recognize the term which says that everything is nice, if the potential is convex. Not so, not at all, not completely, because here on the other hand, you have something, I said that gamma v will always be positive, which on the other hand is banged if the Laplace is positive. So what I, and of course we see, so see what. We see so C1 and C2 are functions of gamma, B and B. So again, my goal will be to choose B such that C1 is negative. If C1 is negative, this term is more negative than having the scalar product. So I put them together. Under condition, C1 plus C2 is negative. So essentially, under these two conditions, this term disappears. Then, Disappears, then disappears when it has the right sign. Maybe it's even better if you add strictly negative. And then, for instance, a force consideration that you can do is what happens if I'm doing the porous medium or fast diffusion equation with an arbitrary potential, but with some bounds on the derivatives. So, imagine even a periodic potential, a potential on which you have bounds on the first and second derivatives. Now, what happens at graph P and graph Q, so if you That graph P and graph Q, so if you want to have a bound on these, of course, if you don't have a nice assumption, you can only have some rough bounds. So, suppose that you want to say that this quantity cannot be too large. If it is large, then graph Q should be large, but grav Q should be large means that since graph P is fixed, graph P is fixed, graph Q and graph P are almost the same. So, if this is large, essentially you can pretend that grad Q and grab P are the same. So, you get your negative term with power 4. And here you can get the same. Power four, and here it's a correction of order two. But if they are large, this is more important. So, if you are able to make this coefficient strictly negative, essentially, you come back to the same estimate as before up to some allower-order correction. So, for instance, you get the instantaneous regularization because you get this u prime smaller than constant u squared. So, you get something like this for in albitary potential under, of course, strong assumption on how much derivatives are large. So, typical example is the Nautic potential. The other interesting case. The other interesting case is V of X equals X squared. Why this is interesting? This is interesting, not only because it is natural as an equation, but also because you can transform the initial equation without the potential into an equation with this potential, with this change of variable. So if you take n hat of dx to be something like phi of t to the d n of psi of t phi of t x, if Phi of Px, if M solves the equation of the other potential, and HAP, if you choose Phi M Psi correctly, NHAP solves the equation with this potential. And it's a typical technique to study properties of the solution of the equation without the potential by doing the signature variable and by exploiting the potential. Essentially, you could translate the same computation back to the equation without the potential, but it would be much more ugly, much uglier. And it's a typical technique to deduce results. Typical technique to deduce results from results on an and have results on it. Now, what happens if you have this? This is a multiple of identity. This is essentially the good you would like to have gamma B over 2 Laplacian B times the identity minus B action B. You'd like this matrix to be negative 8, but there are both multiple of the identity and you just need to choose this one. Of course, compatible with all the other assumptions. With all the other assumptions, but luckily it works. So, luckily, you can find a B in the intersection of all the conditions that you have. And what you can get is that if we're able to make this negative, this negative, and this negative, this goes away. And now you have that, ah, sorry. Yep, there was a P. I did this term exactly as I had before. They have this P, which changes the exponent. But if I make them negative, I don't care. So in the end, I really have B B grad Q square. Grad q square over 2, and here I am PB grad q square with the negative coefficient. So here, exponential decay. So, what do I get? I get exponential decay of this quantity under the assumption. This is particularly interesting. I think it's more interesting for the fast diffusion equation than for the porous medium. But first of all, because for the fast diffusion, the condition on gamma do not add other restrictions because. not add other restrictions because gamma larger than minus 2 over t is fine 2 over t is fine but so I get something like this p to the b grad q it's grad p plus x squared decrease exponentially this is for the p and the n with the potential now the change of variables pi and psi which are wrote here Variables psi and psi, which are not here, if you want them to work, are exponential densities. So if you translate this back to the equation without the potential, you just get the polynomial decay, which is natural. But what is interesting is that this X here is the opposite of the gradient of the potential of the Barren-Black solution. Because you see that so if you come, if you look at the case of the potential, in this case, this equation has a stationary solution, the stationary solution. The stationary solution is the one such that minus n to the gamma plus x squared over 2 is constant. And so this is exactly the pressure. So you get exactly the gradient of the parameter pressure is minus x. And of course, you can translate it back to the case without the potential. So here I'm saying that you have a convergence weighted by this p. Weighted by this P to the B of the gradient of the pressure to the gradient of the Barremblat or the corresponding Baron-Remblat solution. Now, this reminds the kind of results that Nikita presented yesterday, but with a great idea. Nikita presented results of the long-term convergence of the solution to the barium blood in the form of solution minus barium black normalized in a certain way. By the way, they required an assumption on the Q. Under this assumption, you know that this would be asymptotically the same as replacing this with people. Isyantotically the same as replacing this with Pb. Under this assumption, you know that the ratio between the solution and the corresponding bargain map tends to one. So essentially, you get an L infinity. So if you come back to the case without potential, it's not anymore exponential. It's polynomial decay of the Lipschitz norm of the difference. So it's sort of C1 convergence result with a quantified rate. Of course, weighted with something. If you want this weight to be interesting, you should, for instance, you can look at what happens in a certain cylinder far from. Happens in a certain cylinder far from the origin and from infinity, where you exactly know what are the rate, what are the order of magnitude of all the terms. And what you get is essentially, you know that in the case without the potential, all these terms tend to zero, but the difference that you get tends to zero faster. So you really get a significant convergence result. Or you can just see them on the case with the potential. Well, it's easy. They all tend to stationary solution, so they all have a Solution: So, they all have an order of magnitude of one in a given point, and here you get a certain rate of conversions. So, this is essentially what I wanted to present compared to what is known. It improves a little bit in the sense that there are estimates which were known of the convergence of the variable, but they pass to higher-order derivatives. And also on the porous medium, I have the impression that this kind of results since the technique is quite different. It's really, you take something from the very You take something from the very beginning. You don't need to wait for some time. You are able to handle some cases from the very beginning and independently of the compact support. Essentially, all these estimates are many cases independent on the initial data. So they are a priori estimate which work in the market. And I thank you for your attention. Thank you for your lively talk. It's open for questions, discussion. You had a question, I will give the first question to John. I never tried. So, one could try in this continuous setting, one could try. For instance, coming from the JKO setting, so it was really. From the JKO setting, so it was really a big jump arriving at the first-order derivative. And I never tried to do on the second order in particular because usually, so one of the difficulties, for instance, is to guarantee this maximum that I'm writing exists. So you should, so possibility is to, it's not necessarily what you do, a possibility is to approximate what happens on a bounded domain. But then you have to exclude the boundary. And you can use the Neumann condition to exclude the boundary for the first order. To exclude the boundary for the first order, but for the second, I would not be able to do this. Another possibility, instead of using bounded domain, is to use some a priori properties for the solution of the porous medium. So this works for porous medium without drift or with the well-known x squared, because essentially they are the same if you know how do they decrease. And this can be done under extra assumption on initial data. So you're free to assume to add assumption on the initial data market, which are in some sense dense. So for instance, you can assume the initial data. So, for instance, you can assume the initial datum is a. For the force medium to make it rigorous, is suppose that the initial datum is supported on a ball, strictly positive on the ball, strictly positive normal derivative on the boundary of the ball, and then you know that in this case, from the very beginning, the equation is moved inside the domain, and so all the computations are rigorous. If you want to have a higher order equation, higher order condition, despite the computation, it should be more much more annoying. You also have to guarantee this existing. also have to to guarantee this existence of the of the of the maximum which usually requires a little bit of handling the boundary and it can be more complicated second question uh so if you think is there a way that caches faster than uh polynomial is there a hope of getting larger values of gamma so is it to use uh ah instead of so if i you mean So you mean if I replace this guy with another penalization? But the fact is that quite naturally for the estimates to work nice, you need a log in the function that they call alpha, because you have some one over p everywhere. So you need these derivatives of alpha, alpha prime, alpha second, so on, compensate this one over p if you want them to be of the same order. So you are almost obliged to take an alpha of a of a logarithm. It's possible that if you take another alpha, then they don't compensate exactly, but what remains as a sign, so I didn't try. Just a remark. The testing is the gradient for the first diffusion under some assumption on the decay of the solution. Well, we did it that actually solutions are C-infinitic in the original variable, and we get convergence for. Variable that we get converges for all derivatives, also for the two, three, four. Okay, okay, to be okay under some assumption on the Q, and you're right that you have always to wait a bit because the goal is the long time convergence. Waiting a bit is not a problem, it's just that the result is less quantified. And it was the paper that was given the visual DGB that we did with Ruby Shang 2010 because we prove actually that solutions are still infinity. Prove actually the solution of C infinity once positive, and then by the entropy rate, you can deduce by interpolation. It's not a direct proof, no, no, but I really like. Here, you don't need us, essentially, you don't need us. Typically, to prove the results, what we do is first I assume that I have an assumption on the Q, so that this maximum will exist because things decay for fixed time, decay faster than infinity to zero. This is just to justify the computation. This is just to justify the computation. Then, by approximation, you don't need any more anything about the initial question there. You said there they always have to wait until the holes are filled. Would you expect that here, your maximum for you is actually if you start with contact with all the data contained at the boundary? So, usually. So, usually we try to avoid in the approximation in order to avoid this. So, we start from essentially, we start from our approximation with something which has no hole. So, the maximum will not be attained on the boundary. But it's possible that if you start from initial data which has a hole and you see where this maximum is attained, it will be, I think, for each positive T, will be not beyond the boundary, but maybe close. So, probably if you track the position of the. So, probably if you track the position of the maximum point, it's possible that for t tending to zero, you converge to a point which is on the boundary of a whole, maybe. But I have no idea. But the idea of this focusing solutions and the answer that I asked was that the worst case was with moderate faults. Yes. And it's difficult to know what is the right power. So it's very interesting in the case. For the porous medium, it's only if gamma is smaller. So, yeah, it actually gamma is and for the fast diffusion, you don't have this whole problem. So, it means that if you want to apply this for the case of the Porozoom equation, it's interesting, but only for small gamma, which in dimension two means up to the quadratic case, gamma one, and in higher dimension it decreases. For instance, there are many. For instance, there are many interesting questions of gamma tending to infinity. Marcus also worked on this, but of course, this cannot be applied because your gamma is more than something depending on the okay. There was a last question here, maybe. Then there is time for questions later. I was wondering whether you think that the same estimate can be also in case of systems or specific choices. So you for instance you think a system where there is a cross diffusion so there is a common pressure you should write no I'm not very confident you should write an equation on the pressure and this equation of the pressure most likely so you sum up the equation as most likely it will involve a combination so of course you have to have some A combination, so of course, you need to have something which differentiates the two species like different potentials v1 and v2. And this the part where the pressure will not be anymore autonomous in the sense that you will have an equation on p which involves the two densities, and one and then two, or p1 and p2, probably, and sorry, and one and the two. And I'm not very confident you can have results on this. Okay, there are lots of questions, but maybe it's Lots of questions, but maybe it's good to close now the uplift discussion and we can have a little discussion later on. Thank you very much.
