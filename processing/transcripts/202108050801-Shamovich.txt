Give a talk about something that I was planning to read anyway, but as Mike Drew already pointed out, we all have this backlog of things to read and we don't get to most of them to this one I got now. So that's a nice opportunity. And so I'll be talking about joint work of Rafael Cloto and Adam Doron about RFD operator algorithms. So let me just The operator algebra. So let me just briefly sketch what an operator algebra is. So, an operator algebra, you can view them in two ways. Well, one way is that it's a closed sub-algebra, norm-closed sub-algebra of B of H. And the other way is that it's abstract, so it's an operator space. So it's a Banach algebra, let's say, with an operator space structure. So we have several titles that it gets automatically. So it's a Banach algebra plus an operator space plus we require that the operator space structure, so the matrix multiplication will behave nicely. That's a theorem of Letcher, Ruan, and Sinclair: that if so. Sinclair that, um, if so, for every a and b, say and let's not call them a and b really um say t and s m n of a the norm of the product is less than or equal to the product of the norms. That's something you would expect, and that's enough of that holds for every n. So that's um That's an operator algebra. Now, natural maps in this category, since we are in the category of algebra, so they should be homomorphisms. Since we are in valid spaces, that should be contractive, let's say. And since we're in operator spaces, they should be completely contractive. So natural maps are completely contractive. I will abbreviate this CC sometimes, so completely contractive. Completely contracted homomorphisms. You can also use completely bounded. You get well, but it's like I'm not going to use those this time. So, okay, some examples to keep in mind that we will get back to quite a lot. So, first of all, this is the generalization of function algebra. So, functions of, well, let's go even example zero, so sister algebra, which in the commutative case is. Which in the commutative case is just C of X, I will implicitly assume that all of my algebras are unital. The paper doesn't require this, and many results don't require this, but it's for my personal convenience. I prefer things to be unital and spaces to be compact in some sense. So the sister algebras, C of X, so we have then function algebras. Which are sub-algebras of C of X with the induced norms such that let's say one is in A and they separate points. That's of course an operator algebra just because it sits inside a sister algebra and sister algebra we know we can put inside V of H. So that we will get back to this point soon. So now So now, what else is there? Well, in the non-commutative setting, this was mentioned by Adam yesterday, not yesterday, the day before yesterday. So, AD is the non-commutative disk algebra of Popesco. And that is just the norm closure. So, it's in the algebra. It's the algebra generated by the left creation operators, unital algebra generated by the left creation operators on the full Fox space. So that's a non-commutative analog of the disk algebra, which is a function algebra. And it is also a function algebra, but a non-commutative one. And of course, another example is multiplayer algebras. Multiplayer algebras of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and one can take them to be classical or non-commutative. That's up to you, so they can look at left multipliers, and that will still be a nice thing. Now, I want to give another example which somehow generalizes two, and that's the example. Um, the example of a semi-group algebra. So, P, so I'm going to fix the declarations of P. So P is going to be a semi-group, which is countable, discrete, and cancellative. I will take on more adjectives to it later on, but that's But that's the minimal requirement. I will always assume it. So, a semi-group, of course, is just a thing with a product, which is associative. And that's it. If you throw in an identity, you get a monoid. And for most things, if you like, you may assume it's a monoid, but you don't have to. And cancellative simply means that if we have x, y is xz, if and only if. If and only if y is z in the semi-group and similarly on the right, so you can cancel things, right? So for example, if you are sitting inside a group, if you this semi-group is contained in a group, then this obviously happens. Okay, so now we can, of course, define Um, the representation of this thing, in a sense, and the representation is: well, we take L2 of P, that's a nice Hilbert space, and it is generated, so it has an orthonormal basis, which is just EP for P and P. Okay, so that's this thing, and we can act, so we can define a map lambda from P. define a map lambda from p to the bounded operators on l2 by um lambda of lambda p let's say pq it's just as you might guess it acts as a shift so it's e pq okay and since everything is cancellative so we we never um So, the maps are injective, and this is an orthonormal basis. So, we get that this isometries. So, the reduced algebra of the semi-group analogously to the reduced sister algebra of a group is just the algebra generated by these lambda p's. Norm closed algebra. Of course, no stars involved because these are just isometry. Because these are just isometries and not unitaries. So, okay. So, in fact, we already seen one example of these guys, and that's the non-commutative disk algebra, because if we take the free monoid, so then the full Fox space is just L2 on the free monoid. And this algebra is essentially this algebra for the free monoid. For the free monoid, because the creation operators are precisely the ones that ship that. So if let's call it WD is the free monoid monoid on D letters then um LP is simply eight. Okay, so now as already mentioned, I'm going to talk about residual finite dimensionality RFD. And as or mentioned, so we can view like abstractly algebras, say, our operator algebras as functions. Algebras as functions, some non-commutative functions on their spectrum. Okay, what is a spectrum? I have to say, and I have to say in what sense are they functions and whether they take values, but that can be that has already been done. So, in fact, the first person was Takisaki with some help from Victor, but well, Victor's result, Takisaki did it in the separable case and Victor did the non-separable case. The non-separable case, but the idea is the following. They did it for C-star algebras, but we will do something similar for operators. So we have A, which is a C-star algebra, and we fix a Hilbert space big enough with your quotation marks. Quotation marks. The thing is that big enough means that we have all the like we can represent A, all the representations of A can be realized on this space, perhaps as the general representations. Okay, so rep AH is just all representations of A on H, perhaps degenerative, And of course, we want so the idea of Takisaki was to do some sort of Kempen duality, and we want to give it some topology. The topology is point-wise strong convergence. Point strong. Now, it's not really crucial whether it's point strong or points strong stars as we're talking about. Strong stars, since we're talking about emperor algebra, so I'll take on a star, the sister algebras, but that it will be crucial later on. So then, and then Takisaki showed that actually we can recover A as a collection of functions with values in B of H, which satisfy certain properties akin to the NC functions. And they respect direct sums, they respect unitary similarities, direct sums in some concrete sense. Concrete sense and they res and they're continuous in some way. And the bidual, which is the universal enveloping phenomenon algebra, is the bounded ones. The result of Excel and Loring and Archibald who extended the result a bit. This is not for the precise statement, so I'll. This is not a precise statement, so we put here a theorem. So, sister algebra is residually finite-dimensional, so we have enough finite-dimensional representations to separate points if and only if there exists an injective representation. Representation with a finite dimensional approximation, which I'll describe in a second. So we can essentially think about it as having some fine-dimensional representations just put onto this big space H, and we just inflate them in a sense until we get to this objective representation. And that's essentially if and only if the finite dimensional representation. So the finite dimensional representations are dense in repair. Okay, so that's the result. And the thing is that so I need to define a couple of things here. What is a fine-dimensional approximation and what are fine-dimensional representations in this setting? Setting, let me do this. So, first of all, let me give a definition. So, A now is an operator algebra from now on, not necessarily a sister algebra, but for sister algebra, these things simplify. So, representation, say, pi from A to B of H, it might be degenerate. It might be degenerate, is finite dimensional if the space C starÏ€ of A applied to H is finite dimensional. So essentially, they have finite dimensional essential space, not essentially, but they do have a fine-dimensional essential space. And in the case of C-star algebra, that's what you have. Don't need to take the C-star, simply, it's just the presentation has a fine-dimensional space. Has a fine-dimensional essential space. Okay, and now we say that the representational approximation if There exists a net sorry net pi lambda finite dimensional representations such that pi lambda converges to pi point strong. Of course, if again, if A is a C star algebra, point strong and point strong star are the same, but if A is not a non-self adjoint thing, these might be different, and hence the following definition introduced. So again, we have pi from A to B of H. So we say that it has an axel-lowering approximation that I will abbreviate later on as E L. If same thing, we have pi lambda from representations. such that pi lambda converges to pi point strong star okay so that's so of course these two things coincide in the case of sister algebras but um um they don't coincide in the case of operator algebra. Now what is an RFD operator algebra? An RFD operator algebra. So I will give a definition. So the first paper I saw with residual dependencies operator algebras was by Vitalian Paulson. Maybe there were earlier papers which I'm not aware of, but this definition comes from a paper by Claude and Ramsey. And essentially, A is RFD if A if it admits A collection of finite-dimensional completely norming representations. Okay, so now, okay, so what does it mean completely norming? It means that for every f in mn of a. f in m n of a for every n we have these representations phi lambda so the norm of f as a matrix over a is just a supram of the norms of the phi lambda f over lambda well these pi lambda or finite dimensional some capital lambda is finite dimensional x okay So the thing is that, well, we know some residually fine-dimensional operator algebras, which are not C-star algebras. For C-star algebra, as I said, you can see that they separate points. In the case of operator algebra, it's a bit more subtle. And so this is the definition I'm going to use. And the idea is that you can. The idea is that you can, well, essentially, so my examples would be, of course, function algebras, residually fine-dimensional, sister algebras, but also, for example, AD. AD is residually fine-dimensional. And one way to see it is that essentially it is a collection of Continuous differently just a bit. Fancy functions analytic on the robo that Adam introduced on Monday. And continuous to the boundary in some sense. The continuous part is less important, but the most important part is that actually it's the subnorm. So we have our finite dimensional family, which is just these representations. These representations, okay, which corresponds to the row contractions or fine-dimensional row contractions inside this model. Okay, so that's an example. Another example that we will use later on is that, so if we take a semi-group P, and I remind you, this is cancellative and discrete and countable and all these nice things. So we say that it has FDP if for every If for every P in P, the set R P, which is the set of essentially right divisors of P, so the set of all R such that there exists an X with P equals X R, this set is finite. So that's a property, and in this case. And in this case, one can construct, so then you have basically, so if we think for a second about the free monoid, that's clearly the case because let's just have a word and you can just look at the suffix of the word and look at the bigger, bigger suffixes. And that would be then the only thing you can do is get to the length of the word. So that's definitely going to happen. And then you can define for HP the. You can define for each p the subspace which will be co-invariant for our algebra and will be finite-dimensional. So, the compression will give us a fine-dimensional representation which will converge to the identity representation. So, in this case, so that's a theorem from the paper. So, So in this case ARP is a okay, so that's that generalized essentially the example I gave you. And if you if you look at it closely, you can you can essentially give the same reasoning. Okay, good. So now Another example that you can keep in mind is, for example, the multiplier algebra of the Druid-Arvison space. It is residually finite-dimensional, but the norm is not the sub-norm on the ball, so that's slightly different, but it is the sub-norm of on commuting row contractions, all sizes. Okay, so now good. Now for the first, so now we want to, so we have our Want to so we have our so we have a lot of RFD algebras we can obtain them actually from NC functions in a very concrete way. So take an NC domain, take the functions, let's say the polynomials, take the closure with respect to the subnorm. If your domain is uniformly bounded, you will get such an algebra. You want to say something about these algebras, and one of the things you want to say is you want to treat the sister covers. Okay, so we have the sister colour. So we have a sister cover is two things. It's a sister algebra with a complete embedding of A inside B. So this is a completely isometric embedding such that A generates B. It's a system algebra. So in this case, you can, so the idea. You can so the idea to look at, say, for example, you have a function algebra on the compact set in Cn, right? But there can be many covers. So, for example, if your algebra is just the norm closure of the polynomials on the compact set, the compact set in Cn can be not polynomially convex. So, you can, for example, extend these functions so they automatically. So, there is the polynomially convex hull, which will be a bigger algebra, which will contain. Algebra which will contain our A completely isometrically. So, but somehow there is the biggest and the smallest sister common. Now, here the so the biggest one is slightly easier to define and or already did. So, there is the sister max of A, which has the following nice property. So, if you have any sister algebra, P, any sister algebra. And you have a completely contractive homomorphism here. This is a C-star cover, so A embeds into it. You can close this, it's called Phi, so you have Phi Twiddle, which is a star homomorphism. This is a completely contractive homomorphism. This is a star homomorphism. First of all, the fact that it extends is not entirely clear, but it always does. So it always does. And essentially, you can use sister max of A as a sort of a free object, free algebra on A, in a sense. This is the biggest sister cover. And there is also the smallest sister cover, which is the sister envelope of A, which has, let me write it slightly differently, which has the following nice property. So it is also a cover. So A embeds into A embeds into it, but the picture is different. So if you have another sister cover, it's the minimal sister cover in the following sense that you have a quotient there. It closes this picture. And the quotient, the kernel of the quotient is called the Sheila. The kernel of the quotient is called the Shield of ideal. So, the way to think about it is somehow these are continuous functions on the Shield of boundary of A. Now, these are factorial in A, and we want to understand how they behave. I'll be talking a lot about sister max, but there are a few things to say about sister animals. So, first of all, and that's a very nice result, in my opinion, it's a theorem. It's a theorem. Let me just abbreviate them as so you so the result is essentially saying that you can see residual finite dimensionality in the extremal representations of your operator algebra. Extremal being dilation extremal. I don't want to go into the details, I'll sweep it under the rug, but think of it as you can check it on the boundary in a sense. Okay, and to see that you can check it on the boundary is so the theorem says the following thing. So A, maybe I should at least write it. A is so the following are equivalent. A is residually finite-dimensional, so we have this kind of family of norming, completely norming finite dimensional representations. Every strammel representation of A admits a finite-dimensional approximation. Or alternatively, it might admit an X, so it is equivalent to admitting an X Lauren representation, X Lauren, sorry, approximation now, and that's a nice. And that's a nice thing because the corollary of this is that if you look at the sister envelope, so we have I from A into the sister envelope of A, the canonical embedding. So for every star representation, let's call it pi from C star A. A B over H. So if we restrict it essentially to A, so we can write it like this, so we can look at phi restricted to the image of A. And then of course with this, so this thing has a finite dimensional approximation. Okay, or an axel-lowering approximation. That's clear in this case. Okay, so it has an axel-lowering approximation. Now, why is it nice? It means that you can check residual finite dimensionality. If you think of these representations as points in the shield of boundary, then you can check finite dimensionality as on the shield of boundary, such as residual point dimensionality on the shield of boundary. However, it doesn't mean the envelope. The envelope is residually finite dimensional. So, here is an example, which is a simple example. So, A D, this is multimutative disk algebra. So, it is residually finite dimensional, as we saw, but the sister envelope of this algebra is the Kuntz algebra OD. And this is simple. Not only is it Not only is it doesn't, it's not RFD, it doesn't have any fine-dimensional representations at all. So it's as far from being an RFD as an algebra can possibly be. So hoping for sister envelope to be an RFD is kind of a dim hope. But there are things to say. And there is a paper by Fred Clutter and Thompson about Thompson about this. So, I'm not going to go into this because this is not what I was going to talk about. But if you're interested, please check it out. So, now, okay, so for the sister, so the sister envelope knows whether the algebra is RFD. What about sister max? Can we say something about sister max? And that's a very nice also. So, this is like a very nice result. This is like a very nice result. So we abstract result. So sister max of A is RFD if and only if every representation of A has an accelerant approximation so it's very elegant so it says that okay if you want so you have an a has to be rfd for the system x to be r of d that's also seen in this in this result so you have an rfd algebra you can hope for system x of a to be rfd and that happens if and only if every representation has an Has an accelerating approximation. So, in fact, in a sense, it is a density result. You can view it as a dense result. So, every presentation can be approximated point strong star by finite dimensional ones. So, that's a very nice result. The problem, of course, is that, well, if you want to go and see whether sister max is R D, that's Um, that's very hard to check from this remote. You can't go over all representations of A and try and look for an accelering approximation. Of course, you can do this, but that's probably going to be quite hard. So what I'm sweeping on the right, that there is another more useful characterization in this result that gives a certain, it can use one representation of Cister Max, and show that it has an X-Lowing approximation. Okay, so well, one example that doesn't come from this paper, so this is a theorem that we are going to use it later on of and Ramsey, which said that if A is a finite dimensional operator algebra, so A itself is finite dimensional. A itself is finite dimensional, then sister max of A is RFD. So just keep in mind that sister max of A is a very big object. It has a lot of representations. Even for operator algebras that we have a good feeling about, like disk algebra, at least I have a slightly good feeling about it. But the sister max can be huge. The sister max can be huge. So, for example, the just the representation on the Hardy space of the Teplitz algebra that the shift generates on the Hardy space is non-commutative. So it means the sister max of A of D, this nice algebra, is non-commutative. It's not continuous functions on the closed disk, and it's a very big object. So this is not a simple statement. Okay, so even if A. Okay, so even if A is finite dimensional sister max of A is pretty big, it encodes all of the possible representations of A. Moreover, the sister envelope might not be. Again, so there is an easy way to construct an example of a finite dimensional operator algebra which doesn't have an RFD system anymore. And it essentially goes through the same. So, same it somehow is encoded in the previous example, but I'm not going to go into this. So, this so this is something, okay? So, if a knowledge A is fine-dimensional, then the sister max of A is. And now we are going to look for a way to somehow extend this result to a bigger class of algebras because eventually we're interested. Eventually, we're interested not only in these algebras, but also in other algebra which are not finite dimension. And to this end, I'm going to introduce a certain new notion for me at least. So this is coactions of the So, collections of semi-groups. So, we have again, so what is a collection of a group? So, the way I learned it is that essentially it's you want to encode the action of a dual group, or if you are like me and you the first time you saw a collection was algebraic groups, so then it's just essentially a dual picture to the twin action. So, if g acts on geometric objects. So if g acts on a geometric object, then the functions on g co-act on the functions on this geometric object. So we have our operator algebra and we have our semi-group that is going to co-act on this. And I remind you again that this is discrete, countable, cancellative, and usually we'll have a to the property where we have. To the property where we have finite so the AR of P itself is residually finite dimension. Okay, so what is a coaction? So, as you would expect, so a coaction of PMA is a completely isometric homomorphism delta from A. Delta from A to A tensor mean with the reduced algebra of the semi-group with an additional property. With an additional property, so with so one. So we have, let's not write it as one, so we have the following spaces. The following spaces. A P delta is the space of all elements of A such that delta takes them to A tensor lambda P and we want so these spaces they might be zero okay so these spaces they need not be non-zero but Not be non-zero, but we want them to be non-zero. And moreover, so we want so that if we take the sum of all these spaces over all p and take the norm closure, we get big A. So what does it mean? So the way the way I look at it. I look at it in the following way. Think of these things as homogeneous pieces, homogeneous pieces with exponent p. So essentially, this hides a grading on this sub-algebra. So if you look closely at this condition, delta of A is A tensor lambda P, then it's quite easy to see that this object, this space, is actually a sub-algebra. Sub-algebra. It's a sub-algebra and it's a dense sub-algebra, and it's graded by P. That's what this says. So we have this grading because it's quite easy to see that if you take the product of AP delta with AQ delta, you end up with something in AP times Q delta. So we have a grading. So we have a grading, but it's a slightly more because at least I'm not sure that I actually don't believe that if we have a dense graded sub-algebra, that's enough to get a coaction because the coax is it feels like the correct thing to have in the category of operator algebra. So this encodes a bit more and it allows you to work with representations. But remember this, I'm specifically emphasizing this because once we get to applications, we will hopefully see again where this grading comes up. So we have this coaction. And what can we do with it? So if we have a coaction, we want to have a nice collection. In what sense is it a nice collection? So this is the following definition because we are talking about Because we are talking about residual finite dimensionality, we want to encode somehow this, so we want to try and use action, these quantum symmetries to read off residual fine-dimensionality. Okay, so that's what we are going to do. So we have P, which is a semi-group with all the nice adjectives with With FDP. So each right divisor set is fine. And we can look at all these. So as I said already, so we have a collection of representations. Now I'm going to say a bit more. So for every F P finite, we have a finite dimension. Finite dimensional representation pi f, which takes us from AR of p to the operators null to p. Okay, so and the and these are just compressions to finite dimensional co-invariant subspaces. And we use here this property of FDP to find these. To find this up. This is essentially the subspaces of divisors of certain elements, the elements in F. Since F is finite, there are finitely many right divisors that we can find. So we have this fine-dimensional representation, and they are our approximation of the identity representation of this operating object. So we say, so assume we have a coaction. assume we have a connect coaxion that we have a coaction of P on some operator algebra A we say that it is RFD and the proaction is residually finite dimensional if If so, we look at the following thing. We look at the ideal. So the ideal generated by the sum of all P in the well, I'm writing it like this. So essentially, So essentially, all the p's such that lambda p is annihilated by pi f a p delta and then we look at the algebra qf which is the quotient of a but by if and then we want sister max of this algebra to be residual defined in the middle. Be residually finite in dimension. Okay, so that's a residual definite dimensional action. So I'll repeat. So we have a semi-group, we have these finite dimensional representations. They have kernels, and the way we construct them by compressing to certain spaces spanned by these unit vectors, there will be a lot of there will be a lot of p's in this object. Now we take the ideal generated by all these. Now we take the ideal generated by all these things. So think about all the homogeneous polynomials. So you basically trim off a chunk of your rating. Okay, that's what happens here. A big chunk of your rating. And you hope that the sister max of the resulting quotient is residually finite dimension. For example, it will happen if this QF is finite dimension. Okay, that's the way to look at it. way to look at it. So here is a so here is the technical result that allows to do a lot of things in this paper. And so again we are in the setting that we have our semi-group. So A is an operator algebra. P is a semi-group. Is a semi-group, so again, discrete countable cancel theories when I add on FDP. Okay, and assume so if there exists a character chi P to C such that it sends every lambda p to one. If we have such a character, so let me just ignore this aces for example for a second. I will add it here. So if A is a separable, that's important. Operator algebra with an RFD coaction by P, then the sister max of A is okay. Okay, so we can essence. So, what does this character do for us? It allows us to transfer, in a sense, define it. So, we have the RFD action with all these RFD quotients, plus we know that we have that AR of P is R of T, and this character allows us to construct. us to construct an injective representation of the system x say with a restricted to such that the restriction of it to a has an x-lowering approximation and that's enough for system x okay that's a part that they kind of hid in the original theory okay so but but the character is important and um and here is so i um So, I um I don't know to Adam about this, but there it is not trivial to know when such a character exists. There are conditions which will yield such a character, but for example, the free monoid has such a character. And so, this theorem can be applied to our favorite non-commutative disk algebra to get the sister max of A is R. Well, we know it without, but if we have a co-action of the free monoid on any operator algebra, then the resulting, which is RFD, then the resulting system X of this A is going to be residually fine-dimensional. Okay, so how much time do I have? So it's 50 minutes, right? So Minutes, right? So, yes, that's correct. So, I'm essentially over. So, my time is essentially over. Okay, allow me just to steal a moment because just to state a corollary from this, which is relevant to the function, algebraic operator, algebras of functions. So, if we have omega, which is a domain in Cn, which is balanced, so it's in variable. Which is balanced, so it's invariant under multiplication by elements of the unit circle. And we have an A, which is an operator algebra of functions on omega with two properties. So T acts on A by complete isometries, in the usual way you can imagine. So basically multiplication. You can imagine so basically multiplication of the argument by complete isometries and A has enough homogeneous polynomials, so has a dense subspace spanned by homogeneous polynomials. Homogeneous polynomials. Okay, so if these two conditions hold, then A has a coaction by the natural numbers and sister max of A is earthquake. And that captures a lot actually quite a lot of algebras. For example, the The poly disc algebra or multipliers of unitarily invariant of unitarily invariant kernel, like this producing kernel Hilbert space on the ball or the Shuragla class, multivariable Shuragla class. So that's a very nice consequence of this work. So I'll stop here. I apologize for it. I'll stop here. I apologize for stealing parts of your coffee break. Well, thank you very much, Ellie. Any questions for our speaker? Maybe I'll ask one. So you mentioned earlier in passing that the separability assumption is crucial above here. So maybe I asked Adam this before, but do you know if C star max of H infinity on the disk is RFD? Or maybe Rafael knows, or Adam knows? I don't. Okay. Okay. It's a slightly I think it's a slightly different object. I think that it's a dual things, maybe. But you need to use somehow the fact that maybe you can somehow leverage it, but it has a separable pre-dual. I don't know. The issue, I think, is that we use Bojkulescu's theorem, which is only sort of working in the separable situation. Sort of working in the separable situation. We don't have something like that in the non-separable case. Right, so that's an artifact of the proof, you might say. But I don't know if there's a genuine obstruction to non-separable things. In terms of the problem itself, I'm not exactly sure. I don't know the answer to Michael's question off the top of my head either. Neither do I. In the last In the last result that you had, what is the semi-group? Is it the natural numbers? Yes, it's natural numbers. Further questions? If not, let's thank Ellie again.
