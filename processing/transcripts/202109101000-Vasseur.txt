Giving me the opportunity to give a talk today. I put this class in the title, right? I mean, for obvious reasons, to try to relate as much as I can to the topic of this conference. But I should warn you right away that actually what I'm interested in this Actually, what I'm interested in in this talk is about structure of the inviscid limits, right? So it would be for compressible Navi-Stokes, it would be the Euler, actually the Euler equation, right? But I want to use the viscos counterpart, the Navier-Stokes equation, in order to give more information on the leads. So that's basically the main idea there, the general idea. Um, and so I need to talk a bit about the MVC model, the which will be here, the compressible Euler equation. So, there's actually several possible compressible Euler equations. Let me just take one here, the simplest one, I put it yet in multi-D, just to explain the motivation of all the work I consider here. So, consider finding So consider, for instance, this model, right? So the unknown are the density and the velocity, and it's just two equations. The first one is a continuity equation, just say that the density is transported by the velocity u, right? And the second one is a momentum equation, the evolution of u, and here is basically transported a force, which is a pressure, and which is like what is a. And which is like over the power gamma. I like especially the case gamma equal 2, because in the case gamma equals 2, dimension 2, it corresponds also to the shallow water equation. When then, so shallow equation, the equation of river, 2D, right, saying in 2D or ocean, in this situation, the u is the velocity, the 2D velocity of your river, and rho is the height. And rho is the height of water. And I will actually show a picture in this case. And here, just a reminder that when you work with conservation laws, it's always important also to consider the entropy condition. Otherwise, even in 1D, you have solutions which are not physical at all, right? And you cannot have equal to zero when you talk about weak solution because even you have. solution because even you have you can have in finite time uh the you can have in finite time uh blow up right and especially singularities forming and then you get inequality okay so that's very simple stuff of conservation laws um and just for notation sometimes i will use my uh a big uh i mean the capital value big The capital value big U here to talk about the vector density momentum. So, this is unknown, right? So, I mean, just to fix the notation. Okay, so with this in mind, it's pretty well known that working with this kind of equation, especially multi-D, is even 1D actually. There is a lot of things which is not known, right? Is really a problem, especially with respect to the notion of weak solution. If you want to go where solution becomes discussed. Becomes discontinuous. Well, first, there's a kind of a construction, right? It's not completely clear, especially in multi-diff, you can always construct one. And even worse, not even unique, right? And this is one of the application of the convex integration. Convex integration is very well known in the incompressible setting, but actually these also results in the compressible one. The compressible one, by the same group of people also related to the lelis and others, right? And you have the same kind of funny stuff happening here that you have non-uniqueness, right? And basically, everything which is behind that is to say, well, can you say something about those solutions? Are they physical? Do you really want to work with them? All of them? Some of them, certainly, right? Because it's also something I'm talking very generally here. Generally, here, but it's known that those models are very good for turbulence. Just look at all the work on Sager conjecture, for instance, for the incompressible setting, right? So, certainly, some of them you want to keep them, right? I mean, you know that you can construct them even with increasing energy. So, this means that, well, you have to make more specific. But if you say, well, I only take the one with decreasing entropy, I mean, do we want to keep them all? want to keep them all and there is a very general idea to try to to a very long uh very whole idea to try to um to get only the one which are physically important is to say well we should keep them the ones that we we we get only through indicate limits or the navier stocks equation right and that's where i will introduce some viscosity some diffusion right and and introducing the the navier-stocks equation right Equation, right? Yeah, and especially, I mean, this is a question that we won't touch much in this talk. We begin to work on this kind of question, but of course, is can you obtain the solution by indicating right? But that's a super hot question. But let's go back to then to the Navier-Stokes equation, right? So I will consider the Navier-Stokes equation associated to the model, all the models that I approximated before, so you can check that actually this part of the equation. That actually, this part of the equation is the same, right? It's just a polar, but now I add all. Yeah, I add a double, double, a new, one is enough, right? I just make my point that it's about viscosity, right? So I add a small viscosity mu, right? And this is, uh, I should put back the blue, I think I want to write something, okay? But I add this viscosity here, right? Right. Good. But now, and this is a big point. I mean, it is one thing that I like for people who are here to remember this talk, is that if you want to say something meaningful about the limit of this in this model and comparing to the wide familiar solution, then it is important to consider what I will call double limits in this data center taking. What I mean by double limits, I will explain it precisely right in the next slide, but is basically by allowing also the initial value to fluctuate. So you want to have a double limit, viscosity converges to zero, with evanescent fluctuation on the initial value. And basically, I claim that you want this because otherwise you cannot expect to see all the richness that you Richness that you can expect for the Euler model that can come from small perturbation, limit of small perturbation. So let me explain precisely what I mean by double limit. So this means that I will consider here a solution of navigation stokes, right? But there's two things here. There's a new, which is a viscosity, but also another Also, another small parameter epsilon, which is perturbation of the initial value. So, basically, what I want is to consider any weak limit, and weak is fine because they are bounded energy, so you can always extract after extraction of some sequence, you can always find weak limits at that, is any weak limit of, well, fix the perturbation initial value, pass into the limit in the viscosity, and then go to the limit of the object that you want to see. And I will say, You want to see, and I will say in some way, what I would like to claim is that when you want to say, Well, do we have turbulence? Let's use big name here, turbulence associated to this specific solution of Euler, right? Which basically you would expect turbulence means that you have this non-uniqueness result. If you want to say that those non-uniqueness results are meaningful, what you need is what you want to say that you will obtain something else, something else that the object. Else, something else that the obvious solution should double limit that way when you allow also a perturbation initial value. And I claim that this is a natural object to compare with the weak solution. And why? Because if you don't tag this double limit, I mean, in some way, physically, the model is too much simplified. As you can see, for instance, for a single shock. So what is here? So single shock, what I mean by that, it means that you have a solution. mean that you have a solution. So this is x1, x2, right? And here you have a discontinuity. You have a fixed value on the left, another one on the right. So it's a discontinuous solution, it's a traveling wave, a font like this, right? This is a solution. For this one, we know that you convex integrated. It was proved by Chodaroli, Cremole, and Lewis, right? But if you just take this But if you just take this as an initial value, make the solution of Navier-Stokes pass into the limit, it's trivial to see that actually we converge to the same one. You won't see anything. But in some way, it doesn't say much about the richness of things that you can expect. And especially now, if you consider double limits, well, this is completely unknown. So I claim that you need to do this if you want to have some richness, physical richness. Some richness, physical richness. I don't say that it's always trivial to make this. Actually, if you consider general initial value, it's very complicated already in order just to fix the initial value, passing your limit nu equal to zero and see if you can estimate the solution. Mathematically, it's so complicated that even if you take a 1D problem, small BV, this is a famous conjecture which has been stated by Bianchini and Resan. Bianchini and Reison 20 years ago, and which is completely open, right? It's completely open. I just say that this is not the right problem if you want to compare to this family of wide-width solution. If you want to do this, then you need to consider actually a model which is even more complicated. That's my point here. Okay, so shocks, I wanted to show you a specific example here. Shallow water equation is actually the Water equation is actually the ocean here. The picture is taken in England. Reminds me of my very nice time when I was in Oxford. And so it's a tidal bore. So what is a tidal bore is what happens when you have the ocean getting into a river, right? So you have the tide up and you have a wave, a wave of singularities, the waves going into the river. And this is an object which is actually pretty stable. I mean, you can really see them. I've seen them on the Seine. On the Seine in the river which goes to Paris, I mean closer to the ocean. And you see, I mean, it's a singularity which is pretty flat, right? And at least in the middle of the river. So it's really something which looks really like just a shock going in. And basically, so now the program in some ways that we're trying to put in place here is to try. Put in place here is to try to study this kind of double limits in this center take, right, for a large family of discontinuous initial value, but fixed, right? So basically, you take a discontinuous initial value, think about the shock here, this is your target for Euler, and now you're trying to get a double invisible limit to say that, well, can you expect to have more physical solutions than the trivial one, right? The trivial one, right? So, you know, that if you don't take anything discontinuous, right, if you take an initial value, target initial value, which is smooth, then actually using just relative entropy methods, so energy method, right, by Daffy Psycho-Diberna, it can be shown that actually, even with this double-limit framework, you will always converge to the smooth solution of Euler asymmetric. Of Euler as long as it is most, right? I mean, this is a general weak-strong result of the effects of the perna, right? But of course, it's not known for, I mean, it's more complicated for discontinuous. And this explains also why I'm working with a compressible model. I mean, what everything I said up to now is also extremely important for incompressible flow, right? This is important in all the situations. Is important in all the situations. But in some ways, a compressible model, what they give is they give a large family of discontinuous solutions, of nice discontinuous solution, simple discontinuous solution. So in some way, it gives a very nice framework in order to begin to try to tackle this kind of question. And so I don't do it to make things more complicated. I do it, I consider the comprehensible model to make things simpler. It's really, really the main idea here. Really, the main idea here. And the first result I will show you, I will present today is a work for a 1D model. But as I said, even in 1D, those problems are very complicated, right? I mean, even if you actually take, again, a small LV solution, initial value, and see the initial value, even without double limits. This is a completely open problem. But here we change a bit the problem. So we take. A bit the problem, so we take a double limit, but we fix one shot, not any solution. Okay, so here it is. This is 1D, this is the exact same Navier-Stokes model that we had before. It looks different, but it's because I'm writing it in the Lagrangian coordinates. It's because when you're in 1D, usually it's simpler to work that way, but it's equivalent, right? It's the same. So in this coordinate, the conitini equation is written like this. So the V is actually the Like this, so the v is actually the specific volume, is one over rho, and the second equation is well, the evolution of the velocity. You have your pressure here, because it's rho at the power gamma, here's one over V at the power gamma, and you add here, you can see the Nagi-Stokes part, right? So the viscous part, right? So this is the new here. And so double derivative nu, this is Nagi-Stokes, you have the one over V, which comes from the change variable. comes from the the change variable going from oil to naviestopes very natural on top of it we put an extra mu here so this means that the the viscous the the viscosity that we take is not constant we use this for mathematical reason just to be able to use the breach design entropy but they are physical right and especially for the shallow water equation the equation that showed you i mean with with this uh tiger bore this is alpha equal one right so they are physical they are here but They are here, but to be honest, we don't take because they're physical, but because we need them, and in some way, on paper, I can claim that I'm in the subject of this cantrans because then my viscosity is nonlinear. Okay, it's a bit lame, but okay. Okay, so that's the model. And now, well, I want to have a double limit. So basically, first I fix my Basically, first, I fix my initial value, which is rho epsilon. I take a wide one, just banded energy, right? I pass into the limit in mu, and this gives me a wide family of weak invisibility limits nu cannot use u. So it's maybe for an initial value, it may be not unique, but it's a large family of everything that you can obtain by inviscid limit fixing the initial value. And then the result that we have, so it's with Moon Jing Kong, so it's Kong, so it's Moonjing Kong and it's from KAIST, right, in South Korea. And basically, what we showed is that if you fix a shock, so you fix the shock, so the initial value, so it's in 1D, right? So it's really fixing a discontinuous solution here, u lu on. I remind you that this is a vector, right? It's a system, but you fix it. The system, but you fix that UL, you fix what you want, you have discontinuity, the kind of 1D model that is corresponding to the picture that I showed you for the title Bohr. Now, you take a little perturbation of this shock, right? So, I mean, little or not little, actually, right? You take, so you perturb the initial value here, you pass into the limits, and you consider all those invisible limits associated to this initial value. I claim that if your initial value now converges after passing into the limiting. Converge after passing into the limit in Dally Stokes, if your initial value converge to the shock, then all indices limits, even if they are not unique, but all of them will go converge to the shock. So basically, what I claim is that in this situation, a small shock for small shock is actually there's a small shock condition in the theorem, right? So for for for this, so under a smallest condition. For this, so under a smallest condition, those double limits work, and you show that actually the shock solution is the only possible initial double limit. So, another way, a cute way to frame this would be to say, well, there is no those shock, you cannot have for those shock turbulence in water. Another way to frame this is to say that if you restrict the solution, if you consider not Treat the solution, if you consider not every weak solution of Euler, but only the one which are reached by indicative limits, then those shocks are stable in this family. They are stable in the family of Euler solutions, which are just reached by indicative limits. And this result of this stability result was known for weak solution of Euler, right? I mean, when you don't claim that they come from illicit, but only with an additional accurate. Only with an additional a priori strong choice property. So it's a mild condition, but a condition which is not known for, I mean, to be a priori true, right? And so this is a small thing. But basically what we show here is that if you consider indicat limit, you don't need this kind of condition. So this is one of the very rare situations considering double limit where you have really something, at least in terms of mass of here, really something better for limit, inviscid limit. For limits, invisible limits of Navy source compared to just being a weak solution of earlier. And I'm not sure I will have much time, but basically the result is also pretty different from everything that was done before. It's a stability result, but it's stability uniform with respect to mu, right? And usually, stability of shock, what you do, you fix mu and you say for small perturbation, you're stable, right? And here, what you want is you. And here, what you want is you fix the perturbation and you make new conversion to zero. And I mean, I really think that this is the first result of this kind. And it has to be very different because you cannot rely on linearization. You cannot work on the linear problem because the linear problem would blow up when you pass this new condition theory. You have to work directly with non-linear tools. What about the What about the multi-decase? Multi-decays, of course, is more important. Well, here I just remind you that things are pretty hard for convex, I mean, for the general multi-decays, because we know that even for simple shocks, so again, here this means that on the left you have a certain value, on the right, you have another one. Again, things about the tidal bore. Then, even for this situation, we know that. For this situation, we know that if you work very only on the weak solution, then you have non-uniqueness, right? So, and those solutions that not verify the strong trace property, for instance, so it's not clear, but I mean, this is a very hard problem, right? To try to say something from double limit in this case. But we can say something on another kind of discontinuity. And so, here I change a bit the system. Actually, it's a bigger, bigger. Actually, it's a bigger system. You have and it's multi-D, 3D. So you can say the continuity on rho, continuity on the momentum. You add also the energy, right? So if you don't have the red term is called the full Euler equation, when you add on top of it the temperature, right? And now you add the viscosity, this is a viscous term, and Fouge. So this full system is a Navi-Sox-Fugi system. And in the same spirit, And in the same spirit, you want to see what's happening when you pass into the limit in the viscous and Fourier. So actually, for mathematical reasons, you need to pass Fourier first converges to zero, then viscosity converge to zero. And so you take those inviscid limits, weak limit, because here, I mean, we really don't know if we can converge. I mean, strong convergence is not nodes. It's really weak limit or to subsequence. And you want to say, well, I take. Sequence, and you want to say, Well, I take all of them, and this is the object I want to study, right? And I want to study them close to a specific target discontinuity solution for the full Euler. And the one that we consider here is contact discontinuity without shear, right? So, what is that? This is a situation where it's completely steady, no velocity, right? And the pressure are in balance, right? But still, Imbalance, right? But still, you have a difference of temperature and density. So, this is typically the situation that you have, the situation that you have in Texas here, right? I mean, the sun, so it's very hot, but you have shade with hawk, right? So, you have a tree. And if you are just at the shade here, right, well, at the limit of the shade, right? So, here it's sunny, so it's very hot. Here it's sunny, so it's very hot, but diluted. And the other one is cold, but more dense, right? And it's stable, but still discontinuous, right? It's discontinuity in row and temperature. And what we can show here, so is a result with Moon Jing Kong and He Wang from the Chinese Academy of Science in Beijing. And what we can show is the And what we can show is the same, the double limit always converges to this share flow. So if you consider all the immediate limits now with a fixed initial value, but the perturbation, then you make this perturbation converge to your share flow, then anything that you obtain by a weak limit will also converge to this share flow. So basically, it's to say that this share flow is stable in this system. This is especially unique. In this system, this is especially unique, right? Even if the U, the limit that you tag after the limit of the Fourier Navier-Stokes in VC limit, may not be solution of the full Euler. So we are really talking about another class. The class of inviscid may be different from the class of solution of Euler. And here is something that we can say for the limit of inviscid, it is not known what's happening if you work with just weak solution of full Euler. This is in the last. This is the last case when of very simple discontinuity, 1D discontinuity that you look in multi-D, where it's not known that you can convex integrate. There is basically three very simple family. Shock, you can convex integrate, rarefaction, you can't. And this one is one that you don't know. And I think it's a very interesting question here, right? Because if you can convex integrate, it means that, well, sometimes there's some solutions that you can mix integrate that are not physically relevant. Integrates that are not physically relevant. If you can't, well, it was the other way around, right? That's this is a situation where actually double limits and weak solution coincide. Okay, I'm don't have much time. So I won't say much here, but of idea. Well, the first thing to say is that To say is that if you want results which are uniform scarcity, you need to understand a bit of the limit model equal to zero, right? So, basically, the first thing is to understand this, and the main tool was to have to extend the notion of weak-strong principle of diaphragm. But when the strong is replaced by discontinuous, right? And when you do this, well, it was very well known that things. Well, it was very well known that things go very, very wrong for shocks, right? It was known for a very long time for conservation laws. I won't spend much time on that. But basically, it's to say that the L2 norm is very bad. So if you're trying to get, to say, a perturbation in L2, a perturbation in L1, which is just due to the fact that you perturb the velocity here, will go like epsilon t, which is very, very big. And the first idea is to say that you can retrieve this kind of stability. Of stability, if you take into account the shift, the fact that actually your shock here can move, right? But the profile is okay. And so, this is the notion of shift here, is stability up to shift. And even that for system is not that simple, you have on top of it to put to weight, weight on the way you see the way you weight the difference on the left of the singularity on the right. But if you do this, But if you do this and you say this is okay, then now you can work on the viscous case. And the manner is to say, okay, well, you cannot get better than what you have for the inviscid, right? So what you are trying to do is to have, so it's all the theorem of A contraction that we put in place with Magin, is to say that you will be able to have, so this is a difference weighted, right? You will be able to have a contraction to say that this temperature is equal, but it will have to be up to shift. But it will have to be up to shift. And when you do this, then the idea is this is what you want, right, for new small, right? But it will be enough to have for new equal one, right, as long as you are able to consider very big, very big perturbation. So basically the idea, you work with new equal one, you take, but no smallness on the perturbation. What you want to show is that you have a contraction without smallness. And why you want to do this? Because you are interested in the model for smallness. Are you interested in the model for small, but if you have small perturbation here, when you go back on new here, your perturbation becomes peak like one of a mu squared, right? But contraction means contraction. So if you work with new equal one, just nu equal one, but without a smallness on the initial perturbation, then this is something that will pass uniform the spectrum. But of course, you cannot use linearization, right? Because your perturbations are very, very big. So you need to use a complex. Need to use a completely different class of methods. And there was a last slide to explain how you can extend the thing in multi-D and the limit of it. But you know, I think I will keep it just if there's questions because I think my time is up. And I would just thank you all for listening to me. Thank you, Lexis, for a very beautiful talk.
