I'd like to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to talk about my work and present it to you. So, this day's back a couple of years ago, but there's still the work in progress. So, I would like to present to you what kind of progress has been achieved in this concerning polynomial maps. Concerning polynomial maps. So I'm interested in maps, so from a Euclidean space, an n-dimensional Euclidean space to itself, and this would be over either the reals or the complex numbers. And map is said to be dominant if its Jacobian is not identically zero everywhere on the domain. So look at the determinant of the Jacobian matrix, and we don't want this to be zero everywhere. Want this to be zero everywhere, and this map is set to be polynomial if it's exactly what you think. If each coordinate in the target space is written as a polynomial in the coordinates of the source space. So this talk is going to be about dominant polynomial maps. So, for example, this is a polynomial map and two variables uv, so we can see that. So we can see that. And it's dominant because if we compute the Jacobian, then it's a polynomial and V2 that is non-zero. So it's dominant. And an example of a non-dominant polynomial map would be something like this. So it's in the variables uv, but if we derivate with respect to v, each member, then it's zero. So the Jacobian is singular everywhere. Okay, so I'm interested in dominant polynomial maps. So, it's and a particular property about those is that it can be non-proper. So, a dominant polynomial map is non-proper at the point y inside the target space if there exists a sequence of points in the source space that converge to infinity, but its image converges to the point Y. So, one would expect. So, one would expect that if given a sequence converging to infinity, then its image would converge to infinity as well. But sometimes, some cancellations can happen in the monomials themselves. Okay, and in this case, it's said to be a non-property. Just note that this phenomenon doesn't happen if I'm looking at the case where I have dimension one, because if I have a univariate polynomial function, then if I take a point in the Then, if I take a point in the line, complex or real, that converges to infinity, then the dominant kind of term with like the term with the highest exponent will dominate everything. So its image will converge to infinity. So this kind of phenomenon only happens whenever looking at higher dimensional spaces. So let me give you an example. So the map from before is non-proper at the point. At the point, at all the points that are inside the first coordinate axis of the target space. Since if I take any pair RS in the target space, its pre-image generically looks like this. So R over S, S. Now, if S converges to zero, so if we're close to the first coordinate axis, then its pre-image converges to infinity, right? So this is kind of an example. Right, so this is kind of an example of a non-proper map. So I'm interested in the set of non-properness of a polynomial map. So this is the set of all points Y at which the map is non-proper. And to understand the topology behind this, one can look at the graph of a map. So this is an Of a map. So, this is an algebraic set that is given by this equation. So, set of xy, such that f of x equals to y. And usually in the proper case, we have locally the image, this graph looks like this. If we're projecting this graph towards the space of images of f, then it's a locally analytic Analytic covering of the space, and it looks something like this. So, the pre-image of a generic point is a finitely many points, but around because we have some folds, two of the pre-images collapse to one, and this will create the set of the discriminant of this map, so the set of critical values. But sometimes we don't have always this phenomenon. The graph can have the following shape, so it can stretch. Can have the following shape so it can stretch towards infinity while its projection of those branches will be towards somewhere in the affine part of the target space. And this is why non-properness happens. I mean, this is one explanation of it. So to study the topology of polynomial maps, one can look at the set of pre-images of generic points and the discriminant. Of the map, and also the set of non-properties of this map. And these three quantities are kind of enough in many contexts to understand topology. So the first two can be computed using elimination, but there is always the problem on how to compute or approximate the non-properties. Okay, so it's important. Its importance appears in several applications. So, for example, well, it started off by a work of Jalonik in the early 90s, and his motivation was to study the Jacobian conjecture. So, if we know that if a map, polynomial map from the complex space to itself is invertible, then the determinant of its Jacobian is always constant. But the inverse, the converse of the statement is a conjecture. Converse of the statement is a conjecture and was very difficult already from the 30s. So, non-properness comes into play because if we have a polynomial map that has a constant determinant for the Jacobian, then invertibility is the same as properness, right? Because in this case, it will be a covering of degree one. Degree one. Another application for kind of appearance of the non-properness set is when we have an unconstrained polynomial optimization problem. So we'd like to minimize a polynomial function over the reals. And so some of the minimal values are achieved when x converges towards infinity. And in the early 2000s, Jalonik and Ko Deka have shown that this can be. Courdeca has shown that this can be actually to compute those values, one can look at a bigger polynomial map and compute its non-properness set, and one can obtain a certain superset of those values in the real line that correspond to minima that are reached only at infinity. Another appearance is the, so when we have the converse of the Tarski-Zeidenberg principle. Principle. So it is known that the image of the real space under a polynomial map is semi-algebraic. So the question would be to classify all semi-algebraic sets that are images of the real space under a polynomial map. And so one way to kind of study those sets is to look at their boundary and the boundary of such a semi- Of such a semi-algebraic set that comes as an image of a polynomial map is actually either consists of a union of the non-properness set and the discriminant. Well, it's a subset of this unit, actually. So non-properness also appeared in this context. And I mean, also it appears in different contexts. For example, in elimination theory, when we have a certain algebraic variety and we want to compute its projection. And we want to compute its projection. And this can be done using elimination by eliminating some variables from the equations. But this will gives us the equation of the Zariski closed set that kind of generates this projection. But sometimes geometrically, this projection can be non-proper, and there will be some set of missing points for which this kind of elimination procedure doesn't sometimes. Doesn't sometimes take into account. And one way to compute it is to find those set of missing points, is to compute the non-properness set of this map. And in general, the polynomial maps appear in several applications of mathematics to sciences and to engineering and to intelligent systems. For example, in computer vision and in robotics. Vision and in robotics and in chemical reaction networks. So, where kind of the problem can be modeled as a polynomial map from a certain space X to a space Y, and in which the input of the problem are points in the space Y, and the output is actually the set of pre-images. So, the non-properness set of this polynomial map would kind of represent some. Kind of represent some inputs to which the solution is suboptimal. And usually we would like to avoid those kind of critical sets, so hence the importance of computing. So that was kind of the motivation for computing the non-properness set. Let me give you some information about previously known results. So here's I keep the So, here's what I keep the definition here. So, this is the notation for the non-properness set. It will be JF because it was first studied by Jelonek in the early 90s, and he showed that first it is ruled by polynomial maps, phi from k to jf. So, this means that for each point in the non-properness set, there exists a rational curve that belongs that belongs. belongs that belongs to this non-propital set and passes through this point and the parametrization of this rational curve is given by polynomials so so the rational parameter right so the rational functions that give this parametrization are actually polynomials so this this is written as a k union rule and and he showed that it's semi-algebraic for the uh for the real case okay and um he showed that its dimension can be very show that its dimension can be varies between one and n minus one and for the complex case it's the situation is is more uh kind of rigorous that it's it's algebraic and it's a it's a hypersurface and actually he gave a method to to compute it using elimination but I'll get to that soon um yeah so this is about kind of the geometry of the non-proper in the set and there was similar results that was that were Similar results that were proven for more general polynomial maps, where the domain and the codomain are both affine varieties. And so, Jelonik, Lassoni, and Stashitsa-Valet showed that we have similar kind of the K-Uniroumis property and also on results on the dimension and etc. Let me finish this slide by giving. Let me finish this slide by giving an example where this map of an example of a polynomial map that has the non-properness set that is semi-algebraic but not algebraic. So if we take this polynomial from Alisa and she asking why it is always non-empty. So so So the non-property set, it's not always non-empty. It can be empty. Yeah. But whenever it is non-empty, then we have those geometrical properties. Does this answer your question? Maybe I didn't make it clear. It can be empty. It's okay because you said that the dimension is always at least one or n minus one. And this is non-empty. Okay. Yes, yes, yes. Exactly, yes, yes, that's true. That's that's a good point. Um, thank you, thank you for this question. Yeah, so it can never be a finite set of points, right? This is this is kind of the idea. It's either empty or it has this kind of dimension. And here we see the example in this example. So I consider this polynomial map, this is kind of a particular one from R2 to R2, and it sends R2 onto this yellow half plane. Yellow half plane, and the reason for that is because you know the first coordinate is all is a square, so we have some negative values cannot be reached. And the non-properness set is actually this half line here, because the pre-images of any point inside the half-line other than zero are empty. Because if we put v to be zero, then this first coordinate cannot be a non-zero constant. So this means that the non-profit. So, this means that the non-proper in a set is this half-line. And in this direction, there are questions like, for example, how to classify those polynomial maps that gives semi-algebraic non-properness set that are real, but not algebraic, and vice versa. So, yeah, and this kind of question is still wide open. Concerning computations, so there are some results that were shown. There are some results that were shown by Yolonik. So, first, he gave an upper bound on the degree of the non-properties set. This is kind of a rough estimate. He gave a more refined upper bound, but for our purposes, this true upper bound on the degree. And he introduced methods from elimination theory to compute the non-properties set. I'm not going to go into details. I'm not going to go into details. I can explain to you later if you want. So, the one just makes creates an ideal out of the polynomials and then makes and adds one of the variables xi and then eliminates like computes some some Grubna bases and one can obtain the non-properness set. So its complexity is quite high actually. It's quite high. It's quite high with respect to the degree. So, this is a bit complexity. So, these methods for any dimension work only for the complex case, but there were results for the real case, but only for special families. So, these are maps with finite fibers. And that was done by Stashetza Velet later. She gave a method on computing the non-properties set for real maps. For real maps, but only like particular families. So the current state of the art is that there exist methods for computing the non-properness set. However, they have drawbacks. So for example, they require this to be algebraically closed, right? So it only works in the complex case and in the real case, only some special cases. And they're not input sensitive. So this means that all the Sensitive, so this means that all the structure that coming from the polynomials will be lost. And also, as we have seen, it has quite high complexity relative to degree. So in some sense, in theory, it can and should be improved. So that was the motivation of my work, is to design an efficient and complete method for computing the non-profits that kind of addresses those issues, the current state of the art. The current state of the art. Okay. So, in what follows, I'm going to give some notations. So, here we have a polynomial and variables is written as a finite linear combination of monomial terms, monomials. So, here this is, I use this convention to write the monomials. And it And it gives rise to a finite set of exponent vectors, which is called the support of the polynomial. So these are exponent vectors that appear with non-zero coefficients. So this is the support. The convex hull of the support is a polytop and the real n-dimensional space. It's called the Newton polytope. Now, if I pick a phase of the Newton polytope, let's call it gamma, then P gamma is the polynomial. And p gamma is the polynomial, is this polynomial the same p, but I only take the exponent vectors that appear from the space. So in some sense, it's the restriction of the polynomial to the phase. Now I can extend this notation to polynomial map. So polynomial map is a collection of polynomials and polynomials. And I can look at the Newton. I can look at the Newton collection of f. So, this is the collection of the Newton polytops of the polynomial. And I can consider the phase of the Newton collection of F. So, the phase of delta F is a collection of faces of the corresponding Newton polytops that are compatible in some sense. So, this is a set of faces where gamma i is a phase of delta of gamma i is a phase of delta of fi and the minkowski sum of all those faces is a phase of the minkowski sum of all the newton polytops another way to view it i can look at the dual cone a dual fan fans that that define the the neutral polytops uh that that that are made of that are formed by inner normal vectors their common refinement is is a fan also itself and each cone of this of this fan Of this fan defines me a face like this, like I have right. So, given a phase in the Newton collection of a map, I can look at the restriction of f onto this phase. So, that's a tuple of polynomials where each polynomial is restricted to the corresponding phase. So, and it's written like this. So, now maybe I can define a certain family of. Certain family of polynomial maps. So, these are Newton non-degenerate. If for any phase of the Newton collection, the restricted system has no solutions inside the torus, the n-dimensional torus. So note that because if I have a face of a Newton collection, then the restricted polynomial system is a quasi-homogeneous polynomial. Homogeneous polynomial, a square polynomial system. So it's usually over-determined. So it having a solution means that I'm inside a certain resultant that corresponds to the space. And this means that Newton non-degeneracy for a polynomial map is an open condition. So I'm trying to convince you that it's a large family of polynomial maps having a support, having common support. A support having a common support. Right, so now to allude towards the main result. So let me take any polynomial map and let gamma be a phase of the Newton collection of this map. I define this Sf of gamma to be the set of all y inside Kn such that this polynomial system has a solution inside the n-dimensional. Inside the n-dimensional torus. So f minus y, this means that f1 minus y1, f2 minus y2, and etc., I restrict them to gamma. So the yi's are treated as constant numbers. And I want this system to have a solution, set k star n, and this is SF of gamma. So let me give you an example. Consider the map from K3 to K3 defined by the variables ABC where Where the polynomials look like this. And here I have the Newton polytops. So I can consider a face. So the red gamma is the collection of red faces of the Newton polytops. So the first one is this square, second one is this triangle, and the third one is this edge. I look at the restriction of these polynomials onto their corresponding faces. So in the first equation, I have the same polynomial because I have the same polynomial because it happens so that the Newton polytop is two-dimensional. So I have this equation, the second is restricted to this triangle, I get this equation, the third, I get this equation. So this is basically SF of gamma, as the set of y, such that there exists a point ABC inside the three torus such that this is satisfied. And since it's a kind of quasi-homogeneous polynomial, I can eliminate the two variables, three variables A, B, and C. Variables a, b, and c, and obtain this conic. So, sf of gamma is this surface, k3. Another example of a phase, so a phase of this collection can be this edge, this triple consisting of one edge, the green, the two green edges and this vertex. And again, so fs s f of gamma is the set of y such that this has a solution, and I eliminate the b' I obtain a line in. I obtain a line in the three-dimensional space. And if I take the set of faces can be just those three vertices, then Sf of gamma is just a point. So this kind of this set will be important. Can I ask a question, Judas? So did you assume at the beginning that the region is a point belongs to each Newton polytope or not? I mean, because... Okay, so in this exam, so this example is. So, um, this example, this is the case in this example. This is the case, but in general, I will assume, and this is right in the next slide. Okay, but this the definition of Newton non-degenerate is not is not related to whether a map has a polynomials have a constant, non-zero constant or not. Right, so this is this is the next slide. Uh, this is the main theorem. So, if I could sorry, but I have another question from Alexander. question from alexander uh does uh so perhaps you can read the question by yourself uh does sf gamma equal to the image of uh f restricted to to gamma uh not always actually uh it's related to uh to to the question of so if if all the gammas if all the members of of gammas contain the origin as a vertex then yes but uh if no that if not then If no, then if not, then does this answer your question? Great. Thank you for the questions. Yes, please do interrupt me anytime. Yes, so this is the main theorem. So let's consider a dominant polynomial map, Newton non-degenerate, and sending the origin onto the torus. The torus inside the torus. So, so in this case, yes, the polynomial maps have the origin as a vertex. And let gamma infinity f be a certain family of faces of delta of f. I'm going to explain soon what this means. Then it holds the non-properness set is the union of all those SF gamma, where gamma goes through all of such infinite. Gamma goes through all of such infinity phases. So, what are infinity phases? What I can do, I can just look at the cone that inside the refinement, the common refinement of the fans of the polytops, the cone that supports those faces. And if one of those vectors that support those faces have a negative coordinate, then this is an infinity face. Then this is an infinity phase. If not, then not. So, for example, the red phase downstairs is an infinity phase because there exists a vector that is normal to those three faces and that is inner to the Newton polytops and has a negative coordinate. The same for the green face and the three vertices. But for example, in the first row, the purple face. The purple phase is not an infinity phase because any vector that is normal to the three of them at the same time has no negative core. Okay. So this is and the theorem says yes, yes, fine. Sorry. So there's this is not a question but a remark perhaps by Alicia. Perhaps you can read it. Yes. And Coffee Moran. And confirm our knowledge. Yes, exactly. Some SF seem to be redundant. This is kind of the that's a very good point. And this is, I'm going to address this in a couple of slides. Thank you for this. Yes, there is a redundancy phenomenon, and it should be exploited for computations. So this theorem. This theorem says that, okay, we just have to go through all the infinity phases and we compute some sets and then we obtain the non-propertiness set. But make no mistake, most of those SF of gamma are empty. And I mean, of course, in higher dimension, one can imagine there's lots, lots of faces exponential in the dimension, if I have a degree high enough. But most of those SF gamma are empty. And for example, if one of those example if if one of those the members of a face is a vertex that is not the origin then sf of gamma is empty this is like this condition removes lots of faces and there are other more refined conditions combinatory conditions that make sf of gamma to be to be empty right so this is kind of the main theorem and let me um let me say a couple of words about the the proof so um for the first inclusion the proof is really is First inclusion, the fruits is really just a bunch of observations. So if I have a point inside the non-properness set, I take a point that is outside the non-properness set that is generic enough and converges to this point y. If I look at the set of pre-images, by definition, one of the pre-images converges to infinity. So this is the second, this equation here. I can approximate this point that converged to infinity as a Puzzi series. infinity as a Cuisine series and so each coordinate looks like a coefficient times t to the power of something plus higher order terms and since x of t converged to infinity then the the first order term one of them should be negative because I take t to be converging to zero now if I take x of t and I plug it in inside this polynomial system of equation defining this pre-image and I kind of expand kind of expand, I collect everything in the terms of t, then the first coefficient, the coefficient of the first order term in t in this expansion should be equal to zero. And because of reasons that the vector alpha i minimizes some some phase, these coefficients should be f minus y restricted to gamma equals to zero. This will have to have a solution. Therefore, y has to be inside one of those sf. I mean I'm trying to convince you that the I mean, I'm trying to convince you that the proof doesn't need too many sophisticated tools, it's just observations. The second inclusion I'm going to skip because lack of time, but I can explain it later if you would like. So let me give you a couple of consequences for this theorem. So let me recall Sf of gamma is the set of y and kn such that f minus y gamma of x is zero for some x inside the torus. This is the topic. This is to remind you of the main theorem. So, corollary: so, if I have f as in the theorem above, then the non-properness set is k uni ruled. And it's quite easy to see that. So, it's just looking at the equation, and one can directly deduce it. So, to see it in this example, I recall that I have SF gamma that is defined like this. And so, since it's And so, since it's a quasi-homogeneous polynomial, then instead of b, I can make a change of variables to be written in two variables. So, instead of b, I put r, instead of a times c, I put s. And thus I see that this is actually a parametrized surface and parametrized by polynomials. And in this case, we see that it's actually unique because it has this nice parametrization. But this holds true for all the SF of GAM. Of gamma. Okay, so this is one geometric property. There's another geometric property. So, but first, let me define a stronger family of polynomial maps. So, a more generic in some sense. So, a polynomial map is maximally Newton non-degenerate for any phase gamma. So, I look at any phase of the Newton collection and I look at all the subsets of those. Look at all the subsets of those faces. And for each subset, I look at the polynomial system that is restricted to it. And if for each subset, this polynomial system defines a smooth intersection inside the torus, then, and this is true for each phase, then this F is maximally Newton non-degenerate. Okay, so it's kind of a stronger condition than. Then a Newton non-degeneracy, but it's also if I don't have degenerate faces of the set of the Newton collection, then this is also an open condition. Right, so recall that if in the complex case, then the non-properness set is a hypersurface. That was a result by Yolonik. Bayalonic. And so one can deduce a theorem, actually, a result that if I look at a maximally Newton non-degenerate polynomial map, then the non-proper set is a hypersurface in Rn, even if I consider the field of real numbers. And this is kind of mostly thanks to this condition. So the proof is also not. Proof is also not too sophisticated. So I look at Cf. So this is the complexification of the real polynomial map. That means that I look at the extension of the polynomial map to the complex space. And so this, but just looking at the definitions, one can see that Sf of gamma is a subset. So this is a real set, is a subset of this SCF of gamma, which is a complex set. Up, which is a complex set, so I have this, and thanks to this condition, maximally Newton degeneracy condition, then I have some results on this. I mean, one can deduce something about the set has mild singularities, which means that the real dimension of Sf of gamma is equal to the complex dimension of S C F of gamma. And since I know that the non-property set for the complex case is a Complex case is an algebraic hypersurface from the theorem before stated, one can deduce that it is also the case for real polynomial maps. So this is kind of another characterization for another consequence of this kind of representation of the non-properness set. So So here's yet another one, but concerning computations. So let's say we have a maximally Newton non-degenerate polynomial map, and we want to compute the non-properties set. So what we do kind of the this, what I'm trying to convince you is just we just have to look at infinity faces of the Newton collection. And I can And I compute this for each infinity phase, I look at Sf of gum. So actually, it turns out that one doesn't have to go through all of them. And the reason is as follows. So there was like a famous paper by Stelfel about the resultant of a polynomial of a collection. Of a collection of supports, of sets. And in it, he gives the dimension, the result about the co-dimension of the resultant of this collection of supports. And this is given actually by only by looking at the combinatorics of the polytops. So a consequence of that is that if I look at That if I look at the phase of the Newton collection in my case, then there is then for each subset, I look at the difference between the number of elements in this subset of faces and the dimension of the Minkowski sum of the corresponding faces. So, I do that for all subsets of the face. And so, this is an integer. So, this is an integer in every case, and the maximum of this number gives me the codimension of SF. And this is thanks to results by Stompfeld, and of course, thanks to maximally Newton non-degeneracy. So this SF of gamma can be viewed as a very particular case of a resultant of a collection of sets inside the letter. Another consequence of another thing one can kind of deduce is that if I have a phase and I have a phase of a phase, so if gamma prime is a phase of gamma, then the SF of gamma prime is a subset of the closure of SF of gamma. So this addresses kind of this redundancy that has been mentioned by Alicia before. And in this example, to see it. And in this example, to see it clearly, so we see that these three vertices, the yellow, blue, green, this is a phase of the Newton Polynes and it's a face of the green phase, which in turn is a face of this red phase here. So here we see that this SF of this set of points is a point, and SF of this green phase is actually this line. But if we put R to Is actually this line, but if we put R to be equal to zero, then I obtain the first set. And similarly here, if I put S to be zero, then I obtain this line from before. Okay, so this is kind of, it tells you that what doesn't need to go through all the phases to compute the non-performance set, it's just enough to look at those that are maximum in some sense. Yeah, so let me. Okay, um so let me uh I have one minute, so let me uh give a summary of what I told you. So I'm interested in the problem of computing efficiently the non-profitness set of a dominant polynomial map. So for the previous works, the previous methods, they require algebraic closure and they only worked on some particular cases for for the real. Cases for the real case. And of course, they also, the previous method didn't take into account the structure of the polynomial map. But I mean, that wasn't the purpose back then. The idea was, I mean, we have this set, we don't know how to compute it. And that was kind of the first results that gave an explicit way to compute it. So, in my work, I introduced a method for computing the non-profit set of a family of polynomial maps that are generic with respect to the Newton polytops. And these are efficient. So, this means that the input theta depends only on the coefficients of f at some phases of the Newton collection. So, we only need the data of the phases. And it exploits sparsity and the structure of f. So, this means that. And the structure of f. So, this means that if I want to make an algorithm that's specific to some type of polynomial maps, then this can be very helpful. For example, if the polynomials are symmetric in some sense, then one can reduce the computational time. And it's explicit, so in the sense that it doesn't only give me the components of the non-protonate set, but also I have the information where each component comes from and how does the pre-image. Does the pre-image converge to infinity for each component of the non-profit set? Yeah, so there are some future directions to extend those methods to degenerate maps. There are results that I haven't mentioned yet about slightly more degenerate polynomial maps, but it would be too cumbersome for this talk. And with very recently, with Elias Sigaridas, we have Very recently with Elias Sigeridas, we have solved the problem for all the generate polynomial maps where n equals to two. And yes, thank you for your attention. That's all I wanted to say. Thank you very much, Bruce. Are there some questions? So Alexander, you can speak. Alexandra, you can speak if you want. Okay. Is it possible to classify somehow families of Newton polytopes for which the non-propertiness set is small in some sense, like for which it is empty or irreducible or has small degree and so on. Yeah, th this this uh this is uh the answer uh the short answer is yes. The short answer is yes. Take, for example, concerning emptiness. If you assume that the union of the Newton polytops intersects each of the coordinate axis, then and the map is Newton non-degenerate, then the non-proper set is empty because all the infinity faces do not contain the origin. Not contain the origin. I see. And this is the criterion. So if it does not satisfy, then it is not empty. But the other way around is not true for maps that are a little bit degenerate at infinity. So you can have maps with some degeneracies at infinity, and then this is not true. And concerning And concerning irreducibility, so I okay, so so let's let's let's think of uh Newton non-degenerate maps. The way I understand is that each kind of phase or the maximal phase in some sense gives me a component of the non-profit set. And so, if you want, for example, only one component, then Component, then for Newton non-degenerate maps, then you just have to look at ones that have only one infinity relevant infinity phase in some sense. So that's concerning irreducibility. A small degree, well, the degree of the non-properness set depends on the faces. So you'll have to choose the faces that are not too big, right? The smallest faces. You can, for example, You can, for example, look at maps that are Newton non-degenerate and whose faces that are infinity faces only gives you polynomials of degree one. And this way, or after change of variables, if you polynomial of degree one, and this will give you a non-properness set of very small degree. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for the question. I have one question. It seems to me that the map F is maximally non-degenerate can be rephrased in terms of only one single polynomial, which is a K polynomial associated to F1, F2, and Fn. So this is a polynomial that you obtain by adding extra variables and takes. And take the sum z1, then two extra if you want, and look at the polynomial sum of the z i f i. Yes, yes, yes. This is the same as saying that this polynomial is non-degenerate in the usual sense. I think so. I don't see it. I think so too, yes. Yes, that's a good point. I think so too, yes. I I'm not sure it can be used, but yeah, that that's that might be a simpler way to put it. That might be a simpler way to put it. Are there other questions?
