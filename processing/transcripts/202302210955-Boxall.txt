This is joint work with Notti and with Tsinzu Rakitena Rebu, who is my former PhD student. And basically this talk is a kind of appendix to Itai Kaplan's talk yesterday, because I'm basically discussing your theorem with some modification. So let me start by recording the guy's theorem. So suppose we have a couple A couple of MIP structure, and then I'm taking a sufficiently saturated elementary extension. Let phi formula over n and some two. Some tuple B in N be such that this does not divide over M and then the conclusion was that there exists some formula phi in the type of B over M. In the type of B over M such that the collection of formulas as B prime ranges over the elements of the second prime by sine is consistent. Okay, and as I explained, Okay, and as I explained, this is equivalent to a definable version of the PQ theorem. Okay, so I sought to state one part of it slightly differently. Instead of saying this doesn't divide over n, one can of course say that this set of formulas is consistent. In NLP, that's equivalent. So then the theorem is saying that if this family of formulas is consistent, then it can be extended to a definable family, definable over m, which is also consistent. And then this And then this raises the question: can we replace consistent perhaps with some more refined information? So suppose there's a dimension notion in the structure. Can we replace consistent with dimension at least d? And well, the answer is yes. So equalize we're in a situation with an appropriate dimension notion. So make it messy. So suppose the assumption is instead that that's got dimension at least d, then the conclusion here would be that that's also got dimension at least. But of course, for this to make sense, we need there to be a good notion of dimension in these structures. So is the dimension of the So is the dimension of the finally which has to be larger than V, or do you mean the collection of dimensions of instas that's larger than V? So take the set defined by this in the monster model. That type definable set has dimension at least. So it's going to be a family or family. There should be an intersection. Yeah, I'm identifying the partial time with the state that it defines. But yeah, we need to be in a situation where we have a good dimension. So I'm going to assume for now that we're in a geometric structure. So model theory to algebraic closures of pre-geometry and we have uniform finiteness. So then that gives rise to a good notion of dimension with all the properties we need and maybe more than we need. I suppose I should also quantify. Suppose I should also quantify this D at some point. Okay, and then, yes, so what I mean by this is that in the monster model, this is realized by some a such that the dimension of a over m is at least d. And similarly for this one. Okay. Okay, so, well, I guess why would one end up thinking about this? The context in which we did was Sinju's work on his PhD. So before it proved the need to find more PQ conjecture or full NIP, we knew it for various cases, including distal. And so SINGU was looking at lovely pairs or dense pairs. Lovely pairs or dense pairs of distal geometric structures, which might themselves not be distal. So that was a good sort of example outside the distal setting. And indeed, he meant to prove the conjecture there under the additional assumption that ACL equals DCL in the underlying geometric structure. And how you might approach that is to under the definable sets and the pairs are well understood in terms of definable. Well, understood in terms of definable sets in the underlying geometric structure. So, you want to sort of reduce to that case. But it turns out that you need a more refined version of the definable PQ theorem in that case for the argument to work. So, he proved a version of this in the distal setting in his thesis. And as the title of my talk suggested, I was going to focus on the distal setting, but in the last few days I've had a proper look at your paper and it seems the adaptation works. It seems the adaptation works fine in that case as well. So, in the full night of this dimension, but okay, so how might one improve it? Well, basically, we need to look a little bit at the fruit. Right. So, I even wrote them down. But it's not the geometric dimension, so it's not the ACL, the dimension of the ACL? Yeah, this is coming from ACL? I see. But in general, if you have a dimension notion, so saying that the dimension is at least D should be type-defined, should be given by a partial type. You want something quite close to definability of dimension, and then you just want some basic things like basic monogenicity and extension. I think that's. You don't need a few again? I think you need to check it. How about it? And you don't even need it to be ordinal-valued. I think values in some ordered thing. You're looking through the argument, that's all we seem to use. We didn't use editor to get all. Okay, so I was going through it. Well, so a key step in So, a key step in the GitHub's proof of the version before I changed it was the following proposition. So, there exists a type R and formula first over M. Such that, and I'll again express non-talking in the way I like to. So, this means that for every c realizing the type R, theta xc does not divide over n. Divide over n and for every finite every finite set B of realizations of the type of B as a m. Of the type of B as M. There exists a C realizing R such that for all V prime in B we have the following. We have the following. What is B? B is just a finite B, so case that. So we're in assumptions here. So we have a B and we have a Phi. B and we have a phi, and phi x b does not divide over n. So the original. Under the assumption of this theorem, and additional have this proposition, right? Yeah, so under the assumptions of this theorem before I changed it, we have that proposition. So when I was just saying consistent here, or if you like, dimension grade things to zero. I mentioned great things to zero, then it proves that proposition. So, what is P here? P. P. Some fixed element in head. So, P is an element of Ph. Yeah. So, over here, B is just, we have this elementary extension, and B is an element of it. Okay. And Phi is a formula. And. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, yes. Proposition was like a step in the proof. Exactly. It was a step in the proof. And in fact, it was also a step in my proof. So we proved it using distancy. We used a strict Morley sequence and distality. And you used a better strict Morley sequence and basically slightly more intricate argument. So, yeah, and I mean, well, it's just a technology. You will need your method for you. Oh, no, sorry. Metric for you. Oh no, sorry, EPS. So, okay, forget geometric, forget dimension, just say consistent and consistent. Denote proves this. Now go back to the dimension assumptions, and I'm going to change this. So let's now change this in the same way. This would be the natural way to change it in the dimension setting. And in the distal case, And in the distal case, we can prove that. In the NIP case, we don't quite get this. We get it for sufficiently generic or sufficiently close to the high-dimension x. So to fully correct this, we actually need a further formula, gamma. And then over here, it needs to be. It needs to be the conjunction of this formula with gamma that implies what we want. And this gamma is some formula in the partial type that asserts that x has a dimension at least d over these things together. least D other these things together with M. So where gamma excuse me? Did you say what the dimension was? The hardest to find the dimension. What is it? What is it? So, I mean, I just assume this is geometric. So, it just comes from ACL. Just the dimension comes from ACL. So, just a minimal or something. An abstract dimension with good properties is sufficient. Yes, and I gave what I think is a complete list of those properties. Geometric dimension, and you also assume that it's distal, right? Is that enough? That's nib. So, it's what? No, no, we're no longer assuming distal, nip and geometric. Okay, so. Sorry. And the this was also the assumption in the d equals zero for the data. Yeah, but in the in the d equals zero case, we didn't need a dimension, so we didn't need geometry because we didn't need any dimension at all. Sorry. It seems like a better idea in my head to do several things at the same time. Okay, so basically there's a partial type that says that, and this is a formula in that partial type. Okay, right. So, yes, I said a little bit about how the two different approaches to get this, but this is what we get in full generality under the. This is what we get in full generality under the assumptions of this theorem. So, I then want to say how this can be used to conclude the proof of this theorem. So, assuming we have this proposition, how do we prove this theorem as stated with the dimension assumptions? You have here that the dimension of theta is at least D and dimension of gamma is at East D. But how about the conjunction that appears in the state? Can it be a smaller dimension? So, this formula is simply set because you're going Set because you've got conjunction of states. So the conjunction might be of limits and at least. Because, I mean, asserting that this has dimension at least D is given by a partial type. And this is one of those formulas in that partial type. So anything with dimension D over the right things will already satisfy this. Well said. Yeah, I I want I want to use compactness later on, so I want a formula here, not a type. Okay, so how can we use this to prove the theorem? So let Q be the V C, the dual V C dimension. So you're choosing the gamma in the state dimension over V prime or over the big V where the B primes are running. No, just the individual B prime. It doesn't prevent the realization here having A realization here having dimension D of everything. This is what it says. Okay. This gamma doesn't differ any problem. It actually does, yeah. So it does, but then. Oh, sorry. One of the nice properties. One of the nice properties of dimensional geometric structures is that this, not only is this given by a partial type, it's given uniform. So if you vary these, it's the same partial type of varying dimensions. That's actually important. Yeah, that actually matters. Okay, so suppose we have a Q bigger than the dual VC dimension. I correct this. I just applied to the um to the first part over there. Um there is in the tau in the type R such that we'll C one up to CQ minimizing tau. We have an IV tau. The dimension of the formula defined by this conjunction is greater than or equal to d. And here we're using a definability of dimension property. So asserting that this has dimension, these d is actually given by a formula, in a formula with a pi dot. In a formula when it's pilot. And then we'll just put that to this first part over here. Okay. Now we're interested in points, in tuples that have the correct dimension over the whole of it. So in a monster model, we want all, actually what I mean by this is not all tuples. Actually, what I mean by this is not all tuples, but all X tuples. All tuples of the right sort that have dimension at least D over M. Let's consider that G for time. Okay. Then consider the following separate. So it's well, it's like the set system just given by this definable family of definable sets, except we want only the points. I suppose that's not going to make sense. Let's call that U, where U is the monster model. Okay. Um, this has the QQ property. Well, this said has the QQ property, which simply means that any Q elements of this set have Have some Q elements of them. Any Q elements are consistent, which is exactly basic. Well, we said that for any Q elements, this set has dimension at least D, which means that it will have a point in G. So this is a set system with the QQ property. So we can apply the original PQ theorem to it. So not the definable version, that's the original PQ theorem. We have a K and And some element k elements of g such that for all c in the set defined by tau this disjunction is true. Okay, so that's that's exactly what the PQ theorem tells us. That the dynamist given by C is uh P? Or no. So well the C is living in N and the Ai is living in G. So they will have the rights. But B is not living in but the other is not Okay. Right. Now I'm going to apply compactness again to the second part of that proposition, which is still visible. So we're now going back to the original type of B over M. And there is now a formula psi in that type, which is what we want to find. We want a formula psi with some properties, and this will be it. Such that Such that for B1 up to BK and it's set divided by this if there is size C in tau. Tau such that for all A in G, if A is phi related to C then if it's theta related to C, then it's If it's theta related to C, then it's phi related to all of the BI's. Okay, so it's sort of kind of this statement, except it's not for an arbitrary set B, it's for a B of size K. It's no longer living in a type, it's living in a Type, it's living in a set of type-dividable set, but a set defined by a single formula. And I've now upgraded this gamma to full-on a sufficiently large dimension after applying compactness using just that gamma. Okay. So we have this psi, and then whenever we have these k elements left, so in this part we didn't use this GQT or yes, it's just by compactness from the By compactness from the move that of it doesn't cool it. I mean, indeed, it would be stronger to Okay, well we'll get rid of that. Hopefully you remember that there were some AIs. So we have, say if this is tau n, we had some AIs that are phi related to some elements in here, and we had In here, and we had a1 up to a k, and that was enough to cover the whole of the power n. Then for some i noticed, we have that that particular AI is the same as the k. A pi is pi related to B prime for all B prime realizing our format. So, do you recall what was tau? Could you recall? Yeah, so tau. Well, I mean, so I guess at this stage, tau is just a set with this property, but previously we had a type with this property, and then we screwed back. So we have a formula with this property, but moreover, we happened to know, because of the way we chose it, that we have these finitely many generic things. Okay, and then the claim is at least one of them will, in fact, be fine-related to everything here, which is exactly what we want. That exactly proves the theorem, because that tells us that not only is the definable family indexed. The definable family indexed by this consistent, but it has a realization which is of dimension at least d of there, which is exactly what we wanted. So why is the k true? Because otherwise we have b1 up to bk inside n such that So such that AI is not phi-related to BI. I mean, if there's no AI that's phi-related to all of them, then for each AI, we can pick one that it isn't phi-related to. But now we gather up this tuple and go back over here. Well, there'll be a C in tau such that everything in Such that everything in G that's theta-related to C will be phi-related to all of those. In particular, there'll be an AI that does that. So there will be an AI that is phi-related to all the BIs, but that contradicts the way we constructed the BIs. So we do get a contradiction. Okay, so that then proves just for every C there must be one AI, which will follow. Exactly. For every C. For every C, at least one of the AIs will put in that. Yeah, so this is really the same argument from before, just with a little bit of tweaking to make the dimension less fake. Any questions? So, this will work for Jami Interjects. It's a version that we're called for Rosian. Well, it's just the sort of defined. Well, it's just the sort of definability. So, one doesn't need full definability of dimension, but one needs some amount of that, which I think does not generally follow rosy. But, yeah, it's worth thinking about. Questions? Yes? I also have a question for geometric theory. So, if you are an IP and not DP minimal, is it possible to be geometric? I don't know. NIP DP table and chain doesn't imply geometric. Sorry, outside. If it's DP random is more than one, there's a possible DV geometric. Is there an example of a geometric you don't think the correct one? Because for example, you need RAM to be one to be as you ramp to be one to be drawn. Because the hydrocoder is like satisfied. It also has like a cube space and then you add it to mirror. I think this has an IP statement. After lunch, I will go, I have a car, I will drive for short shopping. Someone urges me to buy some workloads or boots, let me go. Very short shopping tree. Let me kill you after the break.
