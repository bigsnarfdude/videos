Okay, thank you. First, I would like to thank other organizers and other audience for this wonderful workout. And so today I'm going to talk about something of the total artist. As you can see, that this title may not show I don't have anything about About multi-laborang forms in this title, but I'm not supervised about that because so seven days ago, we already have like Yuri and Matt mentioned technologies. And also, Vincent and Ancin already said their R metrics formalism held out as about the R metrics formalism and also like And also, like there's a Lagrangian manifold. So, my belief is good things are connected. So, I would propose this question that finds the connection between the total analysis that I'm going to talk today and the Lagrangian modiform and the Fury Lagrangian systems. Okay, so my talk is going to be divided into Are going to be divided into three parts. The first part, I'm just going to talk about some basic behavior. And the second part, I will propose the question that I care about. And then the third part, I will give you a solution of this one. Okay. So the first one, so this is the classical diagonal totalities. So it's a Lagrangian system and it describes like the interaction of M particles. Of m particles on a line that has exponential interaction among the nearest neighborhood. Okay. So with this Hamiltonian and with the standard Poisson bracket on R2N, we can write under equations. So in 1974, Seflaska made this change of remarkable change of a variable. So after the change of a variable, A variable. So after the change of variable, you can put it in a relaxed form. Okay, I changed it slightly. So this is actually the form that Costend used. With this form, we immediately can formulate this whole theory inside the Lie algebra. So let me do that by first introducing some notations. So we just allow the G to be a simple Lie algebra. H is catan and n plus minus. Katan and M plus minus that's the neopotent, B plus minus that's the Boreal. And pi is the simple roots, and the data is the positive and the negative roots. Omega I is the fundamental weight. And then the last one, H alpha, I, X alpha, Y alpha, that's a Chevrolet system. So the next line is about the Lie group terms, and the last one, W is the is the well group. Is the wow group okay? So, this is our uh basic notions. Then, the uh matrix, Lux matrix that we saw before, this is we can consider this as something in type A. And then we can we can write, actually we can write down for any simple Li algebra. So this x alpha, its coefficient is this once under off-diagonal. And Ai is under diagonal, okay, and Bi is under lower off-diagonal. On your lower of diagonal. And then the constant potential can also be written in terms of this log form. And if you just expand it, you will see that actually the coefficient is just a cartan matrix. That means what that means, somehow you should expect or should expect that other information about this Lie algebra is contained in this simple system. And also, the Hamiltonian is Also, the Hamiltonian is also has like a simple form, it's just a one-half trace of L square. Okay, so um so this this system can actually be solved very easily. So in terms of the factorization, that means you just take a L0, that's the initial value, and then you consider exponential T L zero, and then you do their L U factorization. The LU factorization, Gaussian factorization. We know that when t equals zero, so the left-hand side is an identity matrix that always exists. And when t is small, you can always do this factorization. Okay, so you have this factorization, then you can easily prove that this L T, so you use the B plus conjugate on L0, or you use N L minus, it's inverse conjugate on L0, you will get a max. On L0, you will get a metric that will give you a solution. This factorization actually takes some time. So, there's something better that you can do. You don't need to perform any factorization. You can still get the solution. So, that's the next one. So, that's the, we can use actually use the representation theory to write down like other solutions. So, for example, if For example, if we just consider those fundamental representations of this simple Lie algebra, we know that there are L, many of them. L is the rank of this Lie algebra. And then we can define a sequence of tau functions. That's actually, Yuji already mentioned that. So we have a sequence of tau functions. Each of them can be associated with one of this fundamental module. And here the equation four is nothing but Uh, equation four is nothing but uh, but this uh, you know, exponential metric exponential of a TL zero, it's a principle minor. Okay, it's a first principle minor, second principle minor, uh, third principle minor, etc. And then the solution can be written. So you see, like in inside tau functions, we didn't do any vectorization, they just write down this matrix and then take its principle minor. Okay, and then the diagonal. uh the diagonal elements you can just take uh their log and take a log and take it first the derivative with top uh to to t and then you will get their diagonal elements and you can easily recognize that so uh even you just consider bj of t you just take another derivative okay and then you can easily recognize that that's something very similar to your tau function of k t for solution of k t For solution of kt, you actually have that formula. Actually, that's that's not a coincidence. So, uh, each in at least in type A, each of these tau functions actually gives you a solution for Kp. So let's look at now let's look at the formula three. We'll see that from the formula three, actually we're using B plus to conjugate L0. L0 is actually leaves in so leaves. lives inside B plus star. So that means we can actually view this totalattis as their cojoint orbits, cojoint action of the boreal. So from that point of view, actually the B plus a star, it has a much larger space. So what we consider like a three-diagonal totality. Like a three-diagonal to the lattice is just their smallest quadruped orbit. So there's nothing prevent us to consider the bigger one, for example, the generic one. So in type A, then the generic one, you see, this is one type of realization that we realize B plus star. And there are other realizations of B plus star. For example, you can use QR decomposition. And then you will get another version of totalities. Okay. So today we're just going to sort. So, today we're just going to focus on this kind of thing. So, the first question that we should ask is: okay, you can, sure, you can do all kinds of generalizations, but what's good for? So first, we can still similarly define their total lattice. You can use this Lux matrix. You project the two different boreal parts, and then you take a commutator. And the second, we still have this. And the second is we still have this vectorization method, so that means somehow we can write down the solution. We don't know whether it's integrable, but we can write down our solution. And similarly, we can define the isospectral variety that's an analog of this Jacobi variety. X-2 for each of this, we fix their Fabl√© invariance, okay, here. And then so then we need to come back. So then we need to come back like whether this system is integrable. So it is in so this original form. So you can get this kind of result from several works. So the first one is that the Lee, Nanda, and Tome. The second one is, so this study of their four-symmetric to the lattice. But their method is very similar. And this type of to the lattice actually was the first. To the lattice actually was first proposed by Ikonani, Slatska, and Singer in 1994. And then Geha minus Shapiro proved that on any simple algebra, it's solvable. So in type A, what you do is something like this. So you just consider this L minus lambda ID. That's something like you consider your eigenvalue problem. And then you need to get enough invariance for this system. So what you do is you just The system. So, what you do is you just every time you just take a chop this matrix, so you take the take away the first row and the last column. You take away the first two rows and the last two columns, and then you will get a polynomial of lambda. And you normalize it. So, you normalize it, and the coefficient of these polynomials will give you invariance of this system. Okay, so there. Okay, so very integral. Um, and also you can define similarly defined call functions. So, uh, the only difference is that so originally your L0 is a trade diagonal. Now you can just take a general one. And the diagonal elements, you can still, so same formula, same proof. Essentially, there is no new things. So what I want you to And what I want to really stress is actually this geometry that it describes. So, cosine has a similar like this. If you have a matrix, if you have a matrix like what we introduce, it's E plus B minus. So, this is a Lux matrix that the form of Lux matrix that we introduce. There's a linear subspace, L-dimensional. L is the rank of. L-dimensional, L is the rank of the Lie algebra, L-dimensional. So this is S. So every matrix can be normalized to this canonical form. I mean, in some sense, in integral system, we're finding all kinds of canonical forms, right? So you can use a lower unipotent matrix to conjugate it. And this lower unipotent matrix is unique. So then that gives us actually, this gives us actually Now, this gives us actually an isomorphic of five varieties. So we can just take this unique lower uniper matrix and view it as an element in the flag variety. So you see, now we come to the famous picture of isospectral deformation. So, how we solve a line linear system? We actually have to solve three linear problems. So, here is the simplest example. So, you first use So, you first you conjugate this L0 to this normal form. And then from the right-hand side, you will see that so as we said, the solution actually is given by complication by UT. Ut is one of the factor, a Gaussian factor of exponential TL0. And then, so after a simple manipulations, you will see that. You will see that on the flag variety, this flow is linearized. Okay, so you have u0, and then it's linearized. You just use exponential t C lambda push this u zero. Okay, and then you just use a c lambda conjugate data back, then you get the solution, okay. So now, uh, the question is, as I just said, I, we, uh, when we solve this system, we put a very, so we put some condition. We um so we put some condition. We have to do be able to do Gaussian decomposition. Not every metric you can perform Gaussian vectorization. So if your pins of minors, some of your pins of miners vanishes, then you couldn't do that. You have to use some permutation metrics to get a non-vanishing minor, principle minor, right? So then in general, what you should consider is their Bohemian decomposition. position okay so what we would like to know is what so what happens if you go to the uh small small but hot cells that happens exactly when your tau when our tau functions becomes zero and as i said like your diagonal element is just uh you take a log of a tau and then you take derivative if tau is zero then your diagonal has a singularity there so what kind of singularity it uh we can have that that's the question That's the question that we want to understand. Okay. So then let's see. If at some point T star we have a basic general decomposition, then we can just make a shift. We expand this solution, try to expand this solution around the T star. So then, so we just plug in. So U0, U star, we can combine them together because both of them are very unique matrix. And B star at boundary high square weight vector. It's basically With the vector, it's basically just a scalar and it doesn't affect our solution, so you just take it away. So, then we formulate this problem. Then, what we want to understand is what kind of U and what kind of a W star we can put there in our solution. Okay. So, I think that's half of my talk. So, this is just a so if you so the first part I realized I used a lot. I realize I use a lot of terms from freely from simple algebra. And if you don't know or are not familiar with that, that's totally fine. From now, you can just forget about this. Okay, let's come back to this problem. So what I want to understand basically is what kind of solutions I can have. So I will take a last method that people will try this kind of. Method that people will try this kind of a problem. So we just assume we want to find this kind of solution and we find each term for this solution. So what do I mean by Carloski-Panavier analysis? It's something like this. So first we assume our solution looks like this Lorenz series, okay? Everyone understands that, right? And then we need to identify what's the exponent, what I said, like a data i, gamma alpha, and I need to identify all the coefficients. And that's something that I think we can explain to Andrew Basis. So we solve our linear system and then we just get a series and plug it in. And then the second step, I will find the resonances. To find the resonance states. I will explain this in a simple example: what's the resonance non-states? Okay. And the third part, I need to check that this system is compatible and also my solution actually converges. It's not just a formal solution. So let's consider a simple example. So this is a simple example from S05. So type B Li algebra, Brim 2. Okay? Right down every Write down every so explicit to the equation. Actually, we can we find that there are a lot of benefits. If we write down the equations, we can see it easily. So if we know A1 and A2, we actually know B1, B2. If we know B1, B2 from the third and fourth equation, actually we know C1. And if we know C1, we know B1. So that means the key ones are actually A1 and A2. Okay? That's one observation. That was one observation. Now, let's just carry out this T-Rex calculation. So, the first step I already finished. So, I already identified other exponents. And in this specific example, it's not hard to do that. So, claim is AI of T can only have, at most, have simple singularities. All the other ones you take derivatives, so then you can identify their. you can identify their uh their the worst singularity i i did not prohibit that a uh for example a10 to be to be zero both of all of them can be zero if they're uh even they don't have a singular part then we have a holomorphic solution that's okay and then now uh the first step i need to identify their lead increasion okay so the lead encryption that you just plug this series into their equation and then compare their powers of e to the k and then you will get their K, and then you will get together leading division. So we have six equations. And from these six equations, we can also easily get that. So we know A10, A2, 0. We're going to know B10, B2, 0. We'll know C10 and B10. So A10, A20, they are the most important ones. And also, so then I can eliminate, eliminate all the other ones, okay? P10, C1, 0, and the B10. Is C10 and B10, I will get three equations. So you can easily see from here, from the first two equations, I get B10, B20, and I plug it into the third and fourth equation, eliminate the C10, I will get, let me just show you. Okay. I will get three equations. One is the degree two and the other one is degree four. Okay. So then I should expect that I get eight solutions. So remarkably, so Remarkably, so if you just do a little bit of calculation, you will find that other eight solutions for A10, A2, 0, they're integers. So eight is a miracle number in this case. Because you see, like type B L algebra, rank two, eight is your number of the well group elements. And all of them are positive integers, but then if you learned a little bit about. But then if you learned a little bit about combinatorics, then you begin to imagine. So they must be counting something, what they are counting. That's what they're seeing. So it turns out that they're counting something like this. So there is a correspondence between these solutions and the wild group elements. So each wild group element acts on the coroot system, not the root system. That's why I choose a type B. system that's why i choose a type b it acts on their q root system so it will just send some of the this this positive roots to the negative ones and you record it sends which positive roots to the negative ones and then expand it in in terms of their simple curves okay because simple currency is a is a basis and then you look at the the coefficients these are positive integers it turns out that these integers These integers solve those equations. Okay, so let's more concretely. We have actually this eight cases. So you just randomly take a well group elements. You look at which positive Q root is sent to negative Q roots. You sum all these elements and then you expand it in terms of simple Q roots. And then you look at their coefficients. That gives you their solution, other solutions. Because we already have the enough number. Because we already have the enough number of them, okay? Okay, so then we got the leading term. Now we have to do their higher-order term all your higher coefficients. If we just write a plug this CDO, plug this Laurent series into the equation, we'll get this. So the right-hand side, every step, so we will just have to do an iteration. The right-hand side, all your terms we know from the previous steps. And we focus Previous steps, and we focused on their case step. We will see that this is actually okay. So, if you just stare at these systems, we're actually looking at a linear system. Okay, so we're looking at the linear system, and then there are several things we need to consider. Sometimes the coefficients matrix, they are degenerate. Okay, so for example, small k is an eigenvalue of this capital K matrix. Capital K matrix, this security K matrix, I call it a Kawalevsky matrix. So if a Kawalevsky matrix has a positive integer as an eigenvalue, then their previous matrix is degenerate. So that means you don't have a unique solution. You need to introduce some free parameters. That's their step where I call it resonance. The resonance happens. Okay, so then to get some... Then, to get other solutions, we need to identify other places that the resonance happens. For the simple example, you can do the calculation just directly. So you can calculate the other determinant of this, and then we can easily identify other places that it degenerates. We see that two of them, they don't depend on the initial condition. So it's two and four. And we know that two and four are degrees. Two and four are degrees of Chevlin invariance. And there are other four. So then the other four they depend on their initial condition. That means if my initial, my solution, my initial equations, you take different solutions, then you will get a difference. You will get a different eigenvalues. Okay. So I call the other ones pat x because we don't know anything about them. Actually, that's not true. Otherwise, That's not true. Otherwise, then we couldn't write anything. So, just let me list all your cases that we can calculate. We can calculate all your eigenvalues. And from this table, we can see that we can see a lot of the patterns. First, all the eigenvalues, they're just, you see, one, one, two, three. So you shuffle them a little bit. So some of them become negative, but the CD of one, they're absolute values, still one, one, two, three. So, and also, So, and also we have the so each of them actually I identified, I said like the solution of the initial equation identified with, we already identified with their well group elements. So then the length of the well group element actually tells me how many positive integers that we have, eigenvalues we have there. Okay, so that actually has a correspondence with the dimension of the Schubert decomposition. Okay, so. Okay, so now let's summarize just based on this example. Hopefully, I already convinced you because now, at least for this example, we already know everything, right? We know their leading term, we know all the attributions, where we will get the three parameters, etc. I think that's good. So, let's have to summarize. Actually, for any simple Li algebras, we can have this identification. We can have this identification. So, for the leading coefficients, you just take one group elements and you do the same thing that I said before. You look at, so how it acts on the code system. I mean, this is, we can put this a little bit fancier because code system actually is the root system of a long and dual, obviously our diversity. So, you know, some secrets is hidden behind. And then you just look at their coefficients. Just we just look at their coefficients that gives us a solution of individual equations. And we still, for higher order terms, we look at this linear system. And then we need to worry about two things. First, they're kidding the matrix. They may degenerate. Second, so when they degenerate, then you will have a flat home alternatives. So this linear system may not always have a solution. So you need to check some compatibility conditions. We check some compatibility conditions and the eigenvalues that's the thing that we need to check. It turns out it has such a nice formula that you just use this well group element act under a positive root. So act on the positive root and then you just look at the length of this root. So it may become negative. That means we already saw their negative sign. It may become a positive, it may become negative. May become negative in any case. So, all of them are eigenvalues of this Kappa-Levsky matrix, so this Kappa W. And then from that, we know how many free parameters that we can have. And we also know that these solutions are convergent. So, you can choose some functions to control this solution. So, they are neutral. And all right, so the number of All right, so the number of parameters and the elements are what's our conclusion. Our conclusion is you can just for consumer values, you can just randomly choose W, randomly choose U. Any of them are our solution. So in some sense, actually at last, we compactified our solution space. At first, we just have the big cell, and this server actually says like any point in the smaller cell also gives you a solution. It blows up, it's fine. It's remote. Up, it's fine, it's a remote exposure. Okay, I think. Uh, um, yeah, my time is up. I will just stop here. Okay, thank you.
