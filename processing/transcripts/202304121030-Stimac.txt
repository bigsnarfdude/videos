And now we have the pleasure to have Sonia Shtimak. We'll talk about the clinic for conduct of Zagreb University. We'll talk about the clinic conduct of the classification of anomalies in the patterns of standard factors. So first of all, let me thank the organizers for organizing this great conference and thanks for invitation. It's so nice to be here. nice to be here. So back to real work. This is a joint work with Jan Boralsny. So we are interested in real Hennon maps, two real variables, two real parameters and we are interested in the set of parameters where the corresponding HANO map has stranger parameters. Okay, so let me record. So let me recall that the first proof of the existence of the cannon strain attractors was given in this remarkable paper by Bellix and Carlson in 1991. So they proved that if V is greater than zero and very small, then for a positive measure set of parameters A close to two, the corresponding HANA map denoted here FAP. denoted here FAP exhibits a stringent factor. After that work, that paper, several generalizations appeared. For example, in 1993, Bora and Jana wrote analogous results for canonic maps. And for our work, an important paper, results is from his paper of Van Lin Young from 2001, when they gave conditions for strong decipher. Conditions for strongly distributed maps that guarantee the existence of strange attractors. So, they prove a lot of results in this paper, for example, many physical properties associated with chaos, symbolic coding of orbits, and so on. For us, what is important is that for the attractors in this class, they develop the geometric fractal, the geometry of fractal critical sets. Sets. So they result for Hannon family of maps for cost imagined set of parameters AB such that B is very close to zero and A is arbitrarily near A star, where A star is any parameter between 1.5 and 2, such that the corresponding quadratic map is a Misuarevich map, which means that if you take Which means that if you take the critical point zero, all its forward iterates are bounded away from zero. So its zero is not trans. So we call this parameters the Wang Yang parameter set, and we denote by the Wang Yang's parameters with B greater than zero. Is B the Jacobian? Yes, and this means. Yes, and this means that the Henon maps are orientation reversing. And note that Ernie mentioned by this Carlson result is evasion for A star equals 2 and B greater than 0. And let us... So, let's go back. So, here is B. It's B. Ah, okay. So it's a problem in my speaker. We have all the normal editions of Kield in the middle. Okay, and let me emphasize again that for Van Yannis parameters, the critical set denoted here by script C is the sole source of not hyperbolicity in the whole system. not hyperbolicity in the whole system. Which means whichever epsilon you take and whichever point you take such that orbit in the attractor is epsilon far away from the critical set, then all points of the orbit are hyperbolic. And moreover, critical set has property that whichever point you take it's a for Its forward and backward iterations are not again critical points. So, from now on, for simplicity, let us denote by f a hand on map and we assume that parameters are in wy and we denote by lambda f the strange attractor of f. And so recall, f has two fixed points, one which is in the first Which is in the first quadrant, which is in the attractor, we denote by x, and the other one, which is in the third quadrant, we denote by y. And we denote the unstable manifold of the fixed point x, and by ws we denote the stable manifold of fixed point x. Here you can see my sketch piece of W. Sketch piece of WU is in blue and piece of WS is in red. And here is some computer simulation of stable manifold and adapter on the kinetic number. Okay, I would put emphasis in this talk on the pruning from conjecture, and later on I hope I will have enough time to say a few. We have enough time to say a few words about classification, how we used pruning from applied pruning projector to classify an element between these parameter sets. So recall that Wilhelm-Turston-Neading theory in one dimension, for in one dimensional dynamics is really very powerful tool. So central object of Meanwhile needed theory for Notice in needing theory for unimodal maps on an interval is the needing sequence. And the needing sequence is the itinerary of the critical value, not of the critical point, but of the critical value. And it completely characterizes the set of all possible itineraries of the unimodal maps with negative parts and derivatives without periodic interactions, for all the leading sequences and invariants of the topological conjunction. Invariant of the topological conjugacy classes, and it is a key ingredient in proving monotonicity of topological entropy and continuity for the quadratic family and universality, and so on, and so on, and so on. So, and the idea to develop such a theory, such a symbolic dynamics for two-dimensional maps is a Maps is quite old. In 1988, Sutan Michuenat and Fatia proposed a symbolic in this paper here, proposed a dynamic model for what they call Henon types maps. And this means for maps of the plane that falls the plane back into itself only once. And in this paper, they especially addressed the case of Hannon and Lossy maps. And so they stated that every allowed orbit has a unique binary label, and that her binary tree that contains allowed orbits is not complete, since these allowed orbits are pruned from it. So they coined this term prune and they call the boundary that separates the allowed and forbidden orbits a pruning fraud. So and here I'll show you. I'll show you. This is a citation from the paper. So, in this paper, they write: a prune front arises from the fact that the two-dimensional attractor is not a single curve, but is multi-sheeted. There is no single maximal point, as in the one-dimensional case. Each sheet defines the locally past allowed itinerary. We conjecture that the pruning from specific set, specific Specific set specific specifies the allowed symbolic dynamics fully. There are no orbits which are pruned out by the other mechanism. All the other disallowed regions of the symbol plane are obtained by backwards and forward iterations of the primary pruned region. And this conjuncture is known as the pruning-from conjuncture and has received a lot of attention in the last 35 years. Last 35 years. So I will not have much time to talk about all results related to the pronunciation juncture. Because our approach is motivated in part by the piecewise affine case of the lossy maps, I just want to mention that Yuta Kaishi in this paper in 1997 proved the Proline Front conjecture for the Lausimap. From conjecture for the Lausy maps. And later on in 2016, Mihal Misurevich and I developed the knitting theory for the Lausy maps. So in this work, Yotaka uses formulas of Lausie maps to prove the Pruning-Francon junction. But in our work, Mitisurevich, we avoid explicit use of formulas defining the logic maps. Defining the loss in maps and take a geometric approach, having in mind various generalizations. And that allowed Jan Borovsky and me to follow the main idea in the Lozi case to prove the puddling structure for the Hanon merch and develop the knitting theory for them. But it's obvious that there are a lot of differences between the family of canon and Mosima. Family of K on Lazy Maps, so we have to develop some new methods and tools to add them. And one of the main distinctions in developing symbolic dynamics for the Hennon and Lausse maps is as follows. So for the Laussey maps, to use y-axis to partition the plane into right part and to left part. Right part into left part. It's natural, natural, and it's used for a long time. But for the henonics, but for the canon maps, y-axis doesn't play any special role. Ziktanovich noticed that a partition of the plane by y-axis does not attain. By y-axis does not determine the periodic points uniquely. Numerically, it appears that a line joining the conclude patricis does in fact partition the plane as needed, and we conjecture that this line partitions space so that the unstable periodic points are uniquely described by symbolic sequences. But the question is existence of such a line or curve. Or curve which contains all critical points. Is it some object-lady exists? And in Ben Discrassum paper, they mentioned that one might, for example, believe, although this is doubtful, that the set of critical points, script C, is located on a smooth curve cutting through the unstable manifold of the figure. Unstable manifold of the fixed quantity X. We can, however, only prove this for a C1 curve, and this is based on the fact that unstable manifold never intersects itself. But we couldn't find any proof of existence of such a curve. And therefore, for completeness, we provided a proof that there exists such a curve. We denote it the square k and we Script k and we'll call it the critical logus. So let's see. So first again script C is the counter set of all critical points of F, of N on M. And for us, not all critical points are equally important. For us, the most important critical points are those that belong to the unstable That belong to the unstable manifold of the fixed world. So, therefore, we know these points which belong to the unstable manifold by this, I will call it frac C, fractional C, cortic C. So I have script C, frac C. So frac C is the set of the basic critical points. Basic critical points are those that belong to unstable medical fixed point, and this set This point, and this set is countable. And we can index them by integers. And we do this in the following way. So let z0 be the first critical point to the left of the fixed point. And then we can parametriz unstable manifold by the real line such that zero is mapped to fixed point x and that z zero is in the image of negative part of a real line. Part of a three line, and then we can index using this parameterization. I don't need this parameterization later, but to see indexing it's easier on the picture. So we go from X to the to the left, we follow downstairs. We main follow the first one is Z1, then Z2, and so on. Z2 and so on. If we go to the right of x, then first one is z negative 1, z negative 2, z negative 3, and so on. So this is the index here. And we call all images, first images, second images, third images, and so on, all the critical set of the basic critical points, the basic post-critical points. And for simplicity, for a point P, For a point P, F i to the P, i iteration of P we denote by P to the I and for every i in Z integer, and naturally P is P0. So here you can see, so the critical point Z0 is mapped to Z01, it is mapped to Z02, Z03, and so on. Critical point Z negative Z negative 1 is mapped to Z negative 11. One, one. So all critical points are mapped to the right of a set of critical points. How did you define critical points? How did you define critical points? I didn't. That was by Vanguard. That was from Van Guard paper. So these are points such that when you take there is the host. There is the hot stick. The hot theorem is the same. These are times that go to faults, that are mapped to faults. So this is, yes, this is in stable direction. Tangent is in stable direction. Yes, yes. Okay, did I skip something? I didn't. Okay, and if this student, there exists a arc script K here is in green such that it contains all critical points. So lambda at attractor intersection script K is the set of critical points. Script k is the set of critical points, and the endpoints of this arc are z0 and z0. Now we use this critical locus to partition a forward invariant this D that contains the Henne attractor into the left and right region as the base for the symbolic dynamics for the Hennell map. For the handle map. And this D is defined and denoted as in the Bennett-Starson paper. So the boundary of D consists of two parts. One is this part of unstable manifold of fixed point, and the other one is this artificial line L which is tangent to unstable manifold. This D here is in green, it contains the polar tractor, it's forward. The polar tractor is forward invariant. And now we denote TL, the region that lies to the left of critical locus, and by DR, the region that lies to the right of script K. And both of them contain the critical locus, that both of them are compacted. And now, because points of the We call points of the attractor in the following way. For a point P to a point P, we assign a bi-infinite sequence B bar. So dot, decimal dot shows you where the zero coordinate is. Zero coordinate is on the right of dot. So coordinates are Pn and P n is minus is an iterate of P is to the left of the critical locus. I was still thinking about your curve, but your curve doesn't contain all the discursive points. I was still thinking about your curve, the curve that you drew before. So your curve, your blue curve, doesn't contain all benefits covers and critical points. Doesn't contain what? All Benedict Colbert critical points. So you are that's your So you have to That's your line. Blue line contains all critical points. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Blue line. Blue line is unstable manifold. And green line is the critical locus. It contains all critical points. Okay, we can discuss. Go ahead. Sorry, go ahead. Okay. So, in standard notation, a biophane sequence Q, standard terminology, biophane sequence Q bar is called admissible if there exists a point Q in the interactor such that Q bar is assigned to Q. And this sequence is then called itinerary of the point Q. And since both components used for coding contains critical locus, some points of the attractor have several itineraries, but okay, we denote the set of all admissible sequences by sigma f. It is a metrizable topological space with the usual product topology and since And since D L and D R contains, are compact, the intersection between the F is compact and sigma F is compact and we prove that a map pi from the symbolic space to the attractor such that to a sequence P bar, the sequence P bar is itinerary of pi of P bar, which means this is itinerary of the point which is assigned. The point which is assigned, this is well-defined map, and it is a liconjugacy between canon map on the attractor and sigma, and sigma is shift map on the space on the symbolic space. Okay, so now I can recall: if you have a critical point C, then Z. then Cn doesn't belong, is not critical point, doesn't belong to script C for any forward iteration and therefore for any backward iteration. And this means that if we have a point B, then it can have at most two itineraries. If it had more than one itinerary, it can have it it it if it have more than one itinerary it can have So, more than one itinerary, it can have maximally two itineraries. And these two itineraries differ at only one coordinate, say k. And in this case, p to the k is a critical point. It belongs to critical logos. And for simplicity, in such case, we write bodies itineraries as just one sequence in a way that on this special coordinate we. In this special coordinate, we can include both symbols, plus and minus. I will need this notation later. Okay, and also to simplify explanations, we introduce the following notation. So if we have a sequence P bar, then we denote by Pn with this arrow pointing to the left. The left integrity sequence which starts with coordinate Pn and It starts with coordinate Pn and goes to the left. And by Pn with this arrow pointing to the right, we denote the right infant sequence. We start with Pn and goes to the right. And a finite sequence we call word. And if we have a sequence which is infinite to the right and consists of all classes, then we write this in this way. Plus to the infinity, this infinity is on the right side. Infinity, this infinity is on the right side of plus. And if we have a one-sided sequence which goes to the left and consists of all classes, then we write this in this way, plus degrees infinity on the left of x, of plus 3. So let us first consider itineraries of the points of unstable manifold of the fixed point. We denote the set of The set of these itineraries sigma w u. So the itinerary of the fixed point X, which is on the right of the critical locus, consists of all pluses. So we denote it as X bar and it consists of all pluses. But W U is unstable manifold of the fixed point X, meaning that whichever point you take in the unstable manifold and iterate it backwards And iterated backwards, it will go converge to x, which means that for any itinerary p bar of point p in the unstable manifold, there exists an integer n such that the left tail p n consists of four pluses, because fixed point is on the right of the club. Okay, so recall images. Images, first images of critical set are the notice CI1. This is F of script C, basic critical, the images of basic critical points. They play a key role in our proof of fulling quantum conjecture, so we call them turning points. And the itinerary, they itinerary we call kneading sequences. Recall in one dimension, now dynamics kneading sequence is an itinerary. Sequence is an itinerary of critical value. So here we have critical points and take its first images, and these are turning points. And so every and the set of all needing sequences is denoted graph F and we call it critical set. So we call it knitting set. Sorry, we call it knitting set. So knitting sequences are denoted k by are denoted K bar I. So critical point, the clinic point Zi1 has itinerary Ki bar and this is a knitting sequence. So there are countably many knitting sequences. The set of knitting sequences is countably in even. And every knitting sequence k bar has the following form. So here is dot, decimal dot. Here is red tail which starts with k bar. Right tail which starts with k0. So zero coordinate is plus because turning points are on the rate of critical office. So then when you go one coordinate to the left, this is the critical point. So it's on critical locus. So we have plus minus. And there is a n such that after something we have all classes. So in between, So in between is a finite word. This finite word should start with minus because this minus is the first one which you see going from the left. So every needing sequence looks like this. And so we proved only from conjecture, but proving that script K characterizes all itineraries. And truth is given in two steps, in fact, in two theorems. In fact, in two theorems. So the first rule that this Kf characterizes all itineraries of all points of unstable manifold. And we call this W admissibility. So since W is invariant for F, the set of all W admissible sequences is invariant for shift maps. Invariant for shift map sigma. And this means that apart of the sequence which consists of all classes and which is in fact itinerary of the fixed point text, so you need to check it, we need only a way of checking W admissibility for sequences of this form. So here is the small dot, on the left are all pluses, and then we have some right there P0, we start with minus. We need only to check this. You need only to check this. And here is theorem which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence to be admissible. So a sequence of this form is WU admissible if and only if for every leading sequence which such that this word W is initial part of this P0. part of this P0 for some m, we have that shift to the m plus 2 of this p0 is less than or equal the needing, this right air of the needing sequence. So this less than or equal is standard veriti lexicographical ordering. And so let me just recall, let me compare this formula which maybe looks a little bit complicated but that It is a bit complicated, but let me compare it with the one-dimensional case. So, if we have unimodal map with negative Schwartzian derivative and without the universe factor and so on, so we have here critical point C and here is image, map is F, here is F of C. F of C and here is F2 of C. So this interval is dynamical core. All interesting dynamics is here. So if we restrict F on I on dynamical core, so C, F of C, let us denote by K the itinerary of F of C, this is the needed sequence. And in one-dimensional case, a Case a sequence, so here we have one-sided sequences. So sequence P is admissible if and only if sigma to the n of P is less than or equal leading sequence K for every n is n. So this is formula. Very compact, very elegant, very nice. But please Compact, very elegant, very nice. But please know that here we have, in fact, countably many conditions. And but we have only one needing sequence. So every shift we should compare with this one sequence which we have. Here we have similar formula, but we have countably many leading sequences. So we need a criterion. So we need a criterion which tells us when to use which sequence. And this criterion is given here. So what we do in fact, we take the sequence P here and make one shift and look initial piece. And if this initial piece is the same as a finite word of some leading sequence, then this inequality should be satisfied. Inequality should be satisfied. And then we do the next shift. And we again look at the initial piece. If this initial piece again coincides with a word of some leading sequence, then we use this leading sequence again and this formula should be satisfied and so on and so on. So in fact this is the same, but just we have comfortably many needing sequences. Okay. So but So, but so, and now when we have this, when we have this WU admissibility, and since the symbolic space is equipped with the product topology, then it's easy to see that this theorem holds. So, A sequence P bar is admissible if and only if, for every positive integer n, there exists a W admissible sequence. W admissible sequence Q bar such that this P bar and Q bar points that the coordinates are the same around decimal point for end coordinates to the left and to the right. And know that in fact this set of kniving sequences is indeed the pruning front, and that these two theorems prove that all other disallowed regions of the The disallowed regions of the single plane are obtained by backwards and forward iterations of the primary proved region, which is the statement of the throne infringement. And okay, we use countably many needing sequences to show that using them we can give necessary and sufficient condition. And sufficient condition of admissibility of sequence, of other sequences. But canon maps, but the question is could we do better? Because canon maps on the plane fold the plane into itself exactly once, and as such, they could be considered as two-dimensional analogs of unimodal maps. Of unimodal maps on the interval. And so, to characterize itineraries of all points for unimodal maps, we needed only one sequence of two symbols. And as I told you, as I recall, this is an important sequence which gives us a lot of information about things. And the question is, is there such a good sequence of two symbols for the calendar? Balls for the canon bars. And what is very exciting to me is that the answer is yes. And we call this new notion the folding printer. And so let me show you how we introduced this new notion. So recall our parametrization phi of unstable manifold of fixed form. So phi of 0 is x and critical point z0 is in the image. point z0 is in the image of the negative part of the part and now we require one additional property on this parametrization so we we require that all integers except zero are mapped to the critic uh basic critical and basic post-critical point which we call for simplicity basic points. Simplicity basic points. So zero is mapped to x, but all other points we require that they are mapped to basic critical and basic post-critical points. And let us denote this bi-infinite sequence, pi of k, and let us consider it now. So here you can see these critical and post-critical points, and this is piece of unstable manifold of x, and here Unstable manifold of x and here is the same piece of unstable manifold just standing. So here is point x and then you go see 0, 1, z negative 1, so all these points are here. When you go to the left, all these points are there. So we simplify this sickness by still keeping all the information that it provides in the following ways. So first we replace X by X by decimal point and then replace each critical point Ci by the symbol zero and each post-critical point CI to the j by one. So here is post-critical point one, critical point zero, post-critical point one, critical point zero, three, post-critical point zero point zero point Critical point zero, three post-critical points in the row, and so on. And so we get a sequence like this. And we call this binary sequence of two symbols 0 and 1 the folding pattern app. And we prove that it characterizes the set of itineraries of such canon map. So the set of needing sequences and the folding pattern are equivalent. That is, given one of them, we can recover the other one. The other one. Moreover, it is an invariant of the topological conjugacy classes of the Hennan map within the set Wi. So we have time. Okay. We characterized, we classified canon maps for these set of graphs. And so to do this. No, that's okay. Just a question: is it the same idea as saying that the set of critical points is all down and when it says open, it's somewhere because it places where it is open and ends again. When you see the green curve, the points are ordered on the right. And so when you apply the diagonal, this order will be vector at 8 by 41, 75. So for this So, so this thing. So, so you know, only critical points are important. These lines, the joint, how we get them, these lines, the joint critical points are somehow artificial. But they are not important. What is important is that they are the quote-minute curve is between two pieces of stable manifold. And because this is homeomorphic, because this is homeomorphism, it's always between the corresponding two pieces which draw closer and closer closer. So somehow this line is somewhere in between. But let me emphasize that one and the other show in this paper, provided in fact symbolic dynamics, in the sense that they prove that some work dynamics exist. We tell this Without these critical laws. In the other way, this is something that they do. But what they didn't do, they didn't characterize ideas related to anything. They just proved that the fact that some organisms exist. So therefore, in some sense, this critical locus is important and is not. It's not important for the program, but it is important for what follows. What follows, or our representation of lossia tractors in terms of unresistance. And for that purpose, this line is good. It's hard. So, our classification relies on this proof of. this proof of pronunciation lecture and on some results on the two recent papers. One of them is this Clovisier-Poussal paper from 2018. In this paper they prove that the FG from a disk back to itself is a strongly dissipative CR. Is a strongly dissipative CR diffeomorphism and R is greater than one, then there exists a semi-conjugacy pi from G to a continuous map F on the compact metric 3T, which induces an ejective map on the set of non-atomic and ergodic measures G, and moreover, entropies of multi and size style are the same. But for the same but what what is important for us that this is this tree and this map on the tree and this this uh real tree is in fact a dendrite that is local that is locally connected to phenomen that contains a simple closed curve. And so using this construction of T and this result in this paper by Jarn and myself we proved Myself, we proved that for each Hanon-like map, here is important for each Hanon map, there exists a diaspora tree. This is this tree from Rubisi Apple's all paper, such that F on its strange attractor is conjugate to the shift homeomorphism on the inner limit of T using this map as a bonding map. And now, when we have this, and there is no simple And there is no simple model, so you cannot have a if you want this result, your tree needs to be densely branched. And having now these ingredients, we classify canon maps for w y parameters so that first we isolated specific two specific sets of these trees. One minute left. Okay, right. May I use the same deal as the first day? So I will stop here and say thank you, and then you will ask me to show you the last year. Thank you very much.
