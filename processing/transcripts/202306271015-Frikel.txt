To first, the organizers, for inviting me. It's a pleasure to be here. And yeah, as Dimitri already said, it's about data incompleteness in tomography. So again, I will focus on the classical Radon transform in 2D. So the stage was set already yesterday by Alan Greenleaf and especially Filippo DeMarc. And also in the previous talk, it was perfectly explained that actually data. Explained that actually data incompleteness in the form of sparsity affects a lot the image reconstruction. So I will turn to a different type of data incompleteness and explain how this affects the classical reconstructions and also would like to discuss and maybe to show how this might be of interest in practice too. So basically I will focus in the first part of my talk on First part of my talk on what I call limited data tomography. It's not only about limited angle. Limited angle is one instance of this, but limited data is basically everything data is missing in the sinogram domain. And what I would like to present is actually the work I did before the pandemic. It's a joint work with Todd Quinto in a series of papers where we analyzed actually reconstructions from different limited data. Different limited data. So, I would like to show those characterizations and explain how this micro-local analysis, which is now finding more and more the way into the practice, can be used and why it is useful for even practical applications. Okay, let's begin by this heading. As yesterday, I'm using kind of very similar notations. So, the general So, the general setup is as following. So, we consider Fourier integral operators acting on some, let's say, data space, so functions defined on, or distributions defined on omega. So, for example, as in the last talk, might be unit ball or some subset of Rn, R2. And on the other side, it maps to some functions on some data space where each point here represents. Each point here represents some manifold and in our retina, or something like this. And for some reasons, we consider full integral operators because they're nice to work with. And you can do a lot of analysis with this kind of operator. So I will be coming right after this slide to particular instances like Radharn Transform. And what we basically consider is the so-called limited data reconstruction. Is the so-called limited data reconstruction problem? So basically, what we have is not the whole RF, but some restricted data where the restriction is due to this kind of truncation going on with respect to some real subset of this data space. So we don't measure on the whole space, but we only have some particular subspace at hand, or we have access only to this kind of data. Access only to this kind of data. And this is, yeah, from which data we would like to reconstruct. And a very typical way to reconstruct is of filtered back projection type. Again, what this means is basically that in order to reconstruct, we first apply some filter to the differential operator. So, and then we back project by applying the dual operator of this free integral operator. So, this includes like So, this includes like the classical FPP reconstruction formulas or like local reconstruction lambda tomography and this kind of things. Okay, so this is a very general setup. And just to make it more specific, in this talk particularly, I will consider this classical Radon transform. So, everything has been said already about that. But just to set the notation, so again, I'm considering theta, those are Considering theta, those are like unit vectors in R2, for example. And P. So the unit vectors, they define the orientation of the lines along which I integrate here. And P defines the location in this parallel bundle of lines. Yeah. And Rf theta P is actually an integral along a line which is identified by this theta in P. Okay. Okay, so this is a particular and very well-known transform. It's a Fourier integral operator and has been considered for a long time. So another one which can be done in the same setting is the photoacoustic tomography in the sense that with some assumptions, this can be boiled down to the so-called spherical Radon transform, where you now integrate along spheres or circles instead of lines. Circles instead of lines. So it goes basically in the same way in this abstract setting, which I presented before by considering this type of problem. So this is also some work what we did, but I will not go into particular details on this one today. Okay, just to show you some pictures, just to motivate what we're doing or why it may be interesting is, yeah, so this is the sinogram. Yeah, so this is the sinogram. So, this is basically the full data what we have, and the reconstruction on the right-hand side. So, I can see that the contrast is not very good, but yeah, okay, we'll get through this. So, classical limited data is, for example, limited angle. So, basically, this means there is a portion missing, but the restriction is only with respect to angles. So, we don't have access to certain projections. So, we don't have access to certain projections along some angles. For example, digital breath homosynthesis or even dental tomography. There are several examples where this is like this. And what you can immediately see, of course, going back and forth, that some things are missing now. And what you actually cannot see, but I hope you can somehow believe me, there are some streaks appearing also here. So, there are two things. Also, here. So, there are two things going on. There are some artifacts and there are some missing features in these reconstructions. So, this is another type of well-known problem. So, this is region of interest tomography, where you basically have a restriction not on the angles, but so, for example, if your detector is too narrow, so and you take the data, then you have a cutoff here along these parallel lines. And then what you can see is actually everything inside here, but there is some bright. Everything inside here, but there is some bright circle appearing here, so we will see this is actually an artifact that can be described by this theory, and so on and so forth. And then there can be other types of data which is destroyed, for example. So this is also a simplification maybe of some so-called metal artifacts, which block out some certain x-rays and destroy this type of data. And then you can see it's really bad. See, it's really bad in this here, okay. And just also again to show you the same thing, this is local tomography actually with different reconstructions and filters. And maybe more interesting on this side, this is photoacoustic tomography. We can see similar effects, but only now instead of streaks, we have some curves here, some curved artifacts appearing. Also in real data situations. Okay, and so the question is. And so, the question is actually: so, what, or I think one of the important questions when interpreting this type of images is it's important to know what we can rely on and what not. And also, in order to maybe make things better, it's important to really have insights into this process. And in order to do that, I think by now a well-established framework is the one of micro-local analysis. Local analysis, and this is what I would like to review very briefly here. So, in microlocal analysis, we are interested in so-called singularities of objects. Briefly, so mathematically, this means what we are looking at are singularities with some locations at points x0 that have some directions, right? And look, a singular point is based of a function or distribution. Is basically of a function or distribution f is basically a point where when you would kind of localize the function around this point, then this function would, or the Fourier transform of this function, would not decay rapidly in any neighborhood of the direction c. So basically in the point in the direction, the function is not, the Fourier transform of this function is not decaying rapidly. And practically, this means that, yeah, the locations are. Yeah, the locations are if you take such a piecewise constant image are just boundaries, and when the boundary, for example, is smooth, then the direction at this boundary is just a normal or like multiples of normals. So everything in this normal direction will be like a singular direction. And so the point x with together with the direction is a singularity and Singularity and the set of all singularities is what we call a wavefront set. And so, this is a way to describe basically, I would say, features in the image and a good way to distinguish between the features that can be reliably reconstructed and which cannot be reliably reconstructed. Okay, so this is the definition and the starting point for us is, for example, like this. Is for example like this. So we have reconstructions that look like this, and what we're interested in in kind of describing the wavefront set of exactly this reconstruction. So what do we actually reconstruct? And this is what micro-local analysis is basically about. And let me just give you some basic ideas, what we distinguish. So once again, So, once again, here what you can see from this image, so everyone knows, I assume this Shaplogen Phantom, you can actually see, of course, many original boundaries which are present in the Shaplogen Phantom. You can maybe see that there are some additional boundaries or kind of added to this kind of image, and some of them might be even destroyed. So, there is sort of Be even destroyed. So, there are sort of three types of. So, this set basically, which we would like to characterize or to provide, is composed of three actually distinct sets, which we distinguish. The set of singularities, the so-called visible ones, are exactly those which are reconstructed, but also belong to the original object. So, this is what we call visible singularities. Singularities. Then the invisible ones, of course, are those which belong to the original object but cannot be reconstructed. And the one which we were concerned with the most are so-called singular artifacts, the ones which are reconstructed but do not belong to the object. Okay, those are the streaks and extra boundaries that are added by the algorithm. And for micro-local analysts, this is, I think, quite well known. And this, the foundations, I think, so at least to my knowledge, were already here in this Guillemin Stenberg book. But I think in 93, there was a paper by Todd Quinter, who basically, to my knowledge, nailed the term visible and invisible singularities and kind of popularized this micro-local analysis. Popularized this micro-local analysis for in this practical setup and explained those more complicated integral geometric principles in a very like concrete situation of 2D Radon transform. And the basic paradigm actually of micro-local analysis says the following. So a singularity is visible if you have a like an x-ray which is tangent to the singularity, which is kind of hits the singularity. Is kind of hits the singularity tangent. So this means if you can find such as again, thinking back, we have a limited data set. So we're not having all the lines or all these manifolds somehow in our data space, but only particular ones. But if you can find one in your data set, then everything which is tangent to this singularity will be visible. Okay, so this is the visibility principle basically. Basically, so and actually, this corresponds exactly to those parameters to those lines which are in the interior of your data set. And those which are on the exterior, which you don't have, of course, there could also be some singularities which would be tangent to those lines. But since you don't have those, they will be invisible. Okay, this is, I think, this applies. I think this applies. So, here I formulated it with respect to these parameters of lines, but this actually applies to any curves of integration or manifolds. So, whenever you find something tangent to some singularity, this will be visible. So, again, what I will explain now is kind of here, was published in a series of papers, but I also would like to acknowledge many other authors. Many other authors, among others, also Ellen Greenleaf, who have done a lot of work in this direction. So it's not something that we invented, but we kind of applied it to this particular problem and analyzed it and found out quite some interesting things to me at least. So basically, what we've seen now is that visible singularities somehow belong to the interior of your data set. So you cut off somewhere. Set so you cut off somewhere. So, in the middle, like the interior, this is everything which will kind of determine the visible singularities. In the exterior, this will determine your invisible ones, but there is also boundary. And so, this is the interesting part. So, singular artifacts are always generated due to the lines which are in the boundary of your data set. Okay. And this explains. This explains actually, for example, if you think of limited angle tomography, so you cut off somewhere with respect to your angle, then you have like basically two angles, and the streaks that are appearing have always this orientation of this cutoff angles. But this can be made more general, and what was quite surprising actually to me in the end, that there are two types of single artifacts. Two types of singular artifacts. The so-called object-dependent ones. This is what the typical example are those streak artifacts in limited angle tomography. So basically, they depend on the object because there will be always an artifact generated, a streak, whenever there is a line tangent to it. Okay, with this orientation. So you fix an orientation and this parameter, and whenever you find Well, a singularity which is tangent to this line, then this whole line will be like an artifact. Okay, so it depends on the object, but also, of course, on your geometry, on both things. So we call them object-dependent ones caused essentially by singularities of F that are normal or conormal to the line. But also there are so-called object-independent artifacts which can be added, and they are only due to the geometry of the. They are only due to the geometry of your boundary. Okay, so it doesn't matter if your function that you're imaging has singularities or not. There will be some, or there can be some artifacts generated due to the geometry of the boundary. And they can be streaks again, or they can be even curves. So, and this is what I would like to explain, like the both types of artifacts now. Now, and first of all, let me just show you the theorem. Basically, what I already explained: if f has a singularity normal to the line, so basically the line hits it tangentially, then a strict artifact can be generated along this line. So, for example, now looking at the boundary means this is exactly the point along this line or along this like curved line here. So, in every point here. So, and every point here corresponds to a line somewhere here. And when it hits a single, like a singularity with this direction, like think of the direction is just the normal to it, then there will be some streak visible. So, if we had better contrast, you could actually see those singularities here. And this happens to every point here and to every point here. And if you do this kind of an experiment here. This kind of an experiment here, and you just change the slope, then you would actually see that those orientations change also inside the object. Okay. Good. So now let me explain the next I just move this way. So, this is when the boundary was smooth. I forgot to mention this. So, when the boundary no, this was so, okay, this was object-dependent. Now, I'm going to the object-independent ones. So, now, so imagine, so this is really a synthetic example when you have a cutoff, which is like this, for example. Cutoff, which is like this, for example. So there is straight lines, and then you have a kind of a tip here, which is very sharp, basically non-smooth. Okay. And so what happens when you reconstruct, you get this kind of reconstruction. So you see on the one-hand side, the type of artifacts I just explained here, there are sort of streaks tangent to it, but also what you see, those bright lines in the middle, which are not tangent to any singularity. Tangent to any singularity in the object, for example. And so basically, what happens is that every point where the boundary is not smooth itself generates a singularity independent of the object, which is just added to the whole picture here. So for us, it was actually the starting point because even if it looks like very unrealistic, we had such data from a micro CT scanner. From a micro CT scanner with lots of such peaky points, and there were lots of artifacts all over the image. And so we couldn't explain it in the first hand with our former theory. So this is what motivated actually this work. And once you understood it, it's quite natural actually that, of course, if you have a singularity here, it's back projected back into the image. But we never observed it before in practice, actually. Um, in practice, actually. So, so this is what happens. This is one type of object-independent singularities, but there is also another type, and I would like to show you this again. When you look exactly here, so not only singularities inside are changing, but something happens out here. And in the first time, we thought maybe maybe this is an artifact or whatever. Maybe this is an artifact or whatever, but when you look it further, then you see something happening here. So there's something moving inside the image, and somehow it depends on the slope of this cutoff curve. Okay. And the analysis showed afterwards, of course. So this is another type of object-independent artifact, which is actually always present, but maybe you cannot see it. But maybe you cannot see it because it's far outside of your region of interest where you look at. And so the exact statement is like this: so if F is smooth, normal to this, so if there is no singularity, actually normal to this line and it's non-zero, then such an object-independent curve will appear. So basically, at every point of this type, there will be an artifact generated. Be an artifact generated, a point artifact actually. And you see, this is the location is given by P of theta. It's some scalar times the theta. But also, there is, well, the curve I have to say, this cutoff curve is parametrized by P of theta. And somehow also the location depends on the slope of the curve. So basically, now when you look at this part, so this is this class. Part. So, this is the classical limited angle type cutoff. So, here the slope is infinitely large. So, if the slope is infinitely large, then you basically this point is in the infinity somewhere. So, you cannot see it in the case of limited angle tomography. But once you change the slope and the slope becomes finite, then it's somewhere, maybe far outside. But once the slope is getting to. Once the slope is getting to to zero, then it moves towards the center somehow, and then you start seeing it. Okay. So like this. And basically, so like every, you see this, the theta basically, or like the slope changes here smoothly. So every point here generates a point here, and in the end, we get a whole curve of artifacts described by this form. By this, by this formula. So, this was quite surprising to me, at least, because I never seen something like this before, and I didn't actually expect because all I was thinking before was limited angle or sparse angle or something or region of interest. But speaking about region of interest, this is exactly this ring given by this formula, which you can describe here. I will just show it to you here, just to be more to be. Just to be more to be more clear, to explain this kind of image now, so we can basically fully explain. Now, you see what happens along this line and along this part of line, there will be some added streaks as we know them from limited angle tomography. Then you see here non-smooth, like those points, those yellow points, which are really kind of a corner type of artifacts. They will generate, every point generates a line. Will generate every point generates a line with a with this orientation, but at different locations, like here and here. Also, this and this point will generate different lines. And then you see this magenta type curve here, which has a slope, which would be, which moves some artifact curve into the image. And you can actually really, so this is really a calculated thing. So this is not what we marked by hand. Not what we marked by hand. So we actually recalculated it from this formula using a particular cutoff. I think it was square root or something like this and painted like the calculated stuff. And you see the curve is exactly this. So it matches pretty well with what we see in the reconstruction actually. Another type of reconstruction when you cut off like in the middle something. So we did several experiments now. So it was. Several experiments now, so it was quite funny to see how it looks like. So, this was actually the image I started with. Then, you basically can see that again, those four points generate those four yellow streaks. Okay, this part, it's only some added artifacts, like limited angle-type artifacts. You cannot see them there very well because also the strength of those artifacts is much less than the strength of these artifacts. Artifacts, but those magenta curves again generate exactly exactly this and this part. Yeah, and so and now you could do like a lot of different things. So this is region of interest, for example. This is what I was saying when you have region of interest, then it's symmetrical to the origin somehow. So if you cut off symmetrically to the origin, then this would generate a curve again here. Again, here, and it's actually, it would be a circle around this object, which would be brightly visible. And this is what you actually can see here. But since the object fits into the so from this perspective, it fits actually onto the detector. Then, of course, here is no artifact anymore because f is zero outside here. So, there is nothing generated here, but in these points, you really see those artifacts. So, this why. Really, see those artifacts. So, this white line here is not a boundary of the object, it's an artifact. Yeah, we also done it in a way that it is actually within the object, such that we can clearly see the ring. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. We've done it. Yeah, this was actually what I shown you in the beginning, the picture. I can show it a bit later. But yeah, it basically explains everything and the natural question to ask, then, of course. The natural question to ask, then, of course, when you have an understanding how those artifacts are created, how can we reduce them? And I mean, there is also a standard way to do this. So this has been, it was interesting that like many people from practice who I talked to, so they didn't know it, but many also knew it already, but couldn't explain it why it works. So, and the thing is, what to do is basically instead of avoiding basically instead of avoiding this kind of hard cutoff at the end of your data set, but instead replacing it by a smooth cutoff. And mathematically, this means that instead of considering your classical back projection here, so you see you have your data, then there would be some filter and then back projection instead of before filtering, you just smoothly cut off the data. And what happens then, then you get a classical You get a classical pseudo-differential operator, and it is known, of course, that pseudo-differential operators then don't add anything to the image. So then it's again a classical theory that tells you, so once you've proven that this is a classical to the differential operator, then you know that there will be nothing added to your reconstruction. So, but the cost, of course, there's some problems. Cost of, of course, there's some price you have to pay. If you cut out something, then you might lose some singularities which have orientations which are close to the boundary. But you don't avoid the artifacts, actually. And in some cases, it works well. This technique already. So, for example, it was quite surprising. You see, this was this cutoff which produced this kind of image. Then we did the smoothing around the edge. The smoothing around the edges, and already got this kind of image. So it was kind of, there's nothing with pre- or post-processing, it's just like this. So in this example, it worked extremely good, but there are other examples where it doesn't work. You do not affect the signality, but on the intensity value. Right. Right, right, right. So you could also see this here. So there is some kind of intensity going on. Going on, right? But it's not that bad, actually. It's yeah, okay. So, this is about that. And so, what I would like to basically conclude from this is I think it's quite interesting, although it's to understand this. And even if you work with applications, to know what's going on, if I have this kind of data or this type of data, what I can reconstruct. So, because this can facilitate the interpretation of images. Facilitate the interpretation of images, which is important, but also provide ways to reduce them, like I mean, those very simple ones or maybe some more advanced versions, and also can help to design or improve CT systems. And I have like two particular examples, which I found quite interesting. So, this was a work of one of my students when I was at DTU. So, when I was given So, when I was giving a course on micro-local analysis in tomography, and after this course, he worked for a company who basically built devices to inspect oil pipes in the North Sea. And they struggled always with the image quality. And basically, I think in the end, it was a basic setup problem somehow of the city system. So, what they helped with this understanding of micro-local analysis to make a better configuration of Better configuration of this measuring system without any additional costs, let's say it was just misplaced somehow in order to get like all singularities reconstructed from here because they want to also to get cracks in there and so on. So, this is actually reported in this paper here in inverse problems. This is one thing. This is one thing which immediately kind of helped. And the other thing, which is quite interesting, so it's close to Regensburg, there is a group Fraunhofer. They install this kind of robo-CT systems, for example, at BMW, because they scan motor blocks and stuff like that. And then they have, of course, they always have to deal with limited data, just have to scan it somehow. But the question is then, of course, what is a good scanning? Course, what is the good scanning trajectory? And then you can again use those micro-local insights in order to design a good, let's say, when a good scanning trajectory in order to get most information out of your scans. So this is also a way to use it, those kind of insights. But also some algorithms, and here I would like to kind of also refer to some. Although referred to some work, although by people in the audience, by Tatiana and others, who already exploited this kind of information for designing some algorithms. And I just want to give you a hint, since many people already talked about wavelets, curvelets, and so on. And of course, when you would like to make this micro-local information somehow available, you need to have tools for that. And yeah, shields or curvelets are one. Curvelets are one, two, of course, to do it. So I don't know any others, but I mean, this kind of very oriented systems or highly directional systems are well suited for that. So basically, you have systems which, as wavelets, have locations and scales, but also have an orientation. So they can be tight frames like this. And what's important, basically, as we already saw in the talk. Basically, as we already saw in the talk before, you can basically characterize smoothness, but you can also by studying the decay properties, right, of the wavelength coefficients and so on. So basically, you can say if they decay fast, then it's smooth. If they don't decay fast, then it's maybe non-smooth, then it comes, it's up to the decay rate and so on. But the same principle also holds, for example, now it's just a symbolic. It's just a symbolic when you take b and theta. So b is a location of singularity, theta is a direction of singularity. And now, if you fix your function, like curvelet or shield, with exactly this location and direction, and then study along scales the decay properties, then you can basically decide: well, if it decays rapidly, it's not in the wavefront set. So this gives you kind of a tool to work with that. kind of a tool to work with that and then basically what's been done what gives you what provides you basically you can sort of separate your function a priori as soon as you know your acquisition geometry you can basically separate it into some visible part and invisible parts because actually curvelets or shields are even in the in the kernel so you can even kind of uh calculate that this this is even in the kernel here and then um And so this is also already quite a good idea. And so, basically, what you can do, you can do dimensionality reduction, or you can learn the invisible, or you can, even in the context of this maybe machine learning techniques, you can use this kind of information in order to do this kind of consistent learning. So, not to learn everything, but to say, well, I know what I know, and I know what I don't know. So, let's learn what I don't know and combine it somehow. What I don't know, and combine it somehow with what I know. So, there are several ways to use this kind of information, and with that, I would like to end my talk. Thank you for your attention. One actually, I understand, you know, that the strategy you follow is to. Strategy you follow is to the right theorem that tells you that given a certain data truncation in the radon domain, right? When you generate a singularity, the singularity generates, I mean, generates like stricken artifacts. But the way you use it is to say, when I see a stricken artifact, I want to, in a way, so anyway, your result go one way, right? Doesn't exactly characterize. Do you have any type of property that go backward? They say, given the stricken artifact. Would they say given the streaking artifact, I can associate it back to the specific type of truncation. You know, your result goes one way, right? Then you say, okay, this is what I know will happen. So I expect that what I observed there is due to that truncation. Yes. Now, but is these a characteristic? Are there cases where this gives you a characterization? I'm not sure if this can be done uniquely, but the thinking is. But the thinking is you know your system, right? So before you reconstruct something, you will know actually what you can reconstruct or not. And so when you actually reconstruct, then you can tell. So of course you look at the reconstructions, but before that, there was some process from data to the reconstruction, which is basically already set by the system you're looking at. And then this setup already defines somehow what you will see. What you will see in the artist. Thanks for very, very interesting insights on how artifacts originate and how you can theoretically explain them. And my question goes into a similar direction. You could maybe, I don't know, simulate a lot of these cases. And basically, you have, if I understood you correctly, three or four origins of problems that you can have in the sign of. Of problems that you can have in the sinogram, kinds of truncation or similar, that will then show. And you can easily label them beforehand. You say, okay, I will create this truncation and that will create this image and that has label. This is curved, like cut off of the cynogram. So maybe you can then directly invert it and say, okay, I give you a lot of reconstructed images that already have a Reconstructed images that already have a label tell me what I have to fix in my cynogram or in my measurement. Yes, exactly. So when you have this understanding, you can do it. And so maybe I'm not sure if this goes into your direction, but what's also interesting, so I've been working with this Fraunhofer Institute, they more in the industrial CT setup and what they do, they measure like things like distances in the images and so on and so forth. And they have to rely on those measurements somehow. On those measurements, somehow. And what they are kind of interested in, and what you, I think, can do, it's not been done to my knowledge, is basically use this kind of insight. So, for example, use your favorite algorithm, machine learning or whatever. But then every algorithm kind of incorporates prior knowledge. So you basically don't know what's actually invented, but you can actually mark at least those kind of things. Actually, mark at least those kind of singularities and tell them: okay, this is actually what's coming from the data, and this is what you can rely on. And everything else is coming from your priors somehow. You know, you can do all the disk type of thing, but to that end, I think you would need some kind of a robust wavefront set detector in your images and so on.
