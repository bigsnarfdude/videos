And P U is a locally bihomorphic locally bihomomorphic. So, this connected is inherited from this connect here. So, examples. So basically, there are two borderline cases. So, one case is when U is just a domain Enix. So, if U is an X, then I can associate this sort of cloning domain, which is just you and the identity. And such domains are called Schlicht. This is a German word. This is a German word for unival. So flat. Because it's not to be confused with land trees, it's a cover. So P U to S is a covering. Then in this case, I can again form this pair. I can again form this pair UP, and this will be at the mean over X, sort of without bound. In the sense that if I take a path in X, it lifts to the mean without ever hitting any kind of boundary point. Just by the main problem. Just by the main property of coverings. And now one should also remember that there is an equivalent way of defining this, which people often use. So come on. Where you do not really say that this u is a complex manifold, you just say that u is a U is a house of connected topological space and P U from U to X is a local homeomorphism. And then you actually can pull back the complex analytic structure to U. Then U is. A view as complex analytic, which is obvious, but then a slightly less obvious thing is that you can actually make, well, you should be a manifold. Yeah, manifolds are housed off and second countable, usually. So you have also to prove that in this case, you is second countable. And this has a name. This is called the Polytarian's theorem. So that's really the same thing, but often it is more convenient because it's much easier to check than something that just said pops off connected space. And some map is a lot of homeomorphism, then well, getting the lyric structure. And now, because we want to extend things, we need to know what does it mean for one such domain to be contained in another one. And here is another definition. And this is inclusion. So, what does it mean when one such domain sits inside another domain? So, an inclusion. So, the word inclusion appears again in some kind of weird situation. So, let's say G from one such domain to another is actually a map, a homomorphic map, if you want. It will automatically be homomorphic. Denoted by the same letter G, from you to V. U to v from between the domains, the manifolds in those pairs, such that, well, the diagram commutes. So, u to x v from d and this is my g and the diagram commutes. So, here the standard point applies that because of That because of this definition, J is only locally injected. So for example, if I take my domain U, which is a pair U, P U, then P U itself from U to X is an inclusion. So it includes. So it includes my damn u in the shi-damin x that individuals. So that's not so surprising, I mean, because the mean should be in x. Yeah, the definition should be set in such a way that the means are in x, yeah. But there is a nice situation when things go well. So if my damn you so if. So, if is itself free, which means that pu is just that energy. So, the embedding of u inside x. Then, j to any other v is automatically injected. So, in particular, if I start from a usual domain and I do any such construction, Do any such construction, then my domain will indeed be an open subset of this kind of bigger domain, which may itself kind of go in some kind of layers without any problem. So now the last thing we try to think of defining is how do I actually extend functions to such things? And this is, of course, also very formal and very natural. And natural, so a function I don't know, fall from u to somewhere actually extends to this inclusion j of u v if there exists a function, say capital F. A function, say capital F from V to that same something. So this is the same. Somewhere such that F composition J is smaller. This agrees, of course, with the case of just a bigger domain containing a smaller domain and me extending a function. But this thing also takes care of the function. But this thing also takes care of the things which you see when we are extending homova functions. So, for example, the original domain was something like this with a cut. And then I'm extending. Then this takes care of the fact that I'm extending to here. And it takes care of this definition, it takes care of other things which can go wrong. For example, when I'm extending from this to me and my extension goes to something like this. Extension goes to something like this, and then I take just one connected component of the intersection to move which I extend. And here there is no gradient. Defining the extension like that with the use of the standard agreement domains makes all the definitions correct. So I'm making this point because if you just open a standard, well, not a standard, well, very many textbooks or papers on several complex variables, then the definition of an Then the definition of an articulation is just wrong. Yeah. Okay. So now that's everything. Yeah. And the wonderful thing is that with this language, you do have the notion of this kind of maximal extension of functions, just formal. So maybe I still have space here to state this here. Yeah. Can you see? Yes. Can you see? Yes. Yep. One. So theorem. The theorem is due to two them and was proved in the 30s, but in fact, in fact, this is just kind of large class. And it actually follows, but it's a formal consequence. If you use, I don't know, some kind of basic cheap theory. It's a formal conflict sequence or just the uniqueness theorem for homogeneous. So the key here is that the uniqueness here. So that also applies to any kind of functions or objects which form a sheaf and which satisfy the uniqueness. And that's the form statement. Well, basically, that maximal things exist. So for every domain U. The mean U over X never exists. And in fact, if unique up to very natural isomophas, so computing with projections up to natural isomophasin inclusion, let me call it J U because it's defined by you. J U because it's defined by U somehow, or maybe J U from U to some the name which I will write as H of U mean and the log of home of so H of home of that such that all home. All holomorphic functions on u extend, and this inclusion is maximal with this cost. Meaning, of course, that if I have any other domain containing you, Containing u such that all functions extend, then this domain has an inclusion into this maximum one in the sense of this business. Okay, now there are yeah, okay, and then this domain here is called the envelope of home of everything. So this is the envelope of the homotomy. Now, if my original Dene U was Schlicht, so usual the meaning, then I know that U is sitting inside this thing as a normal subset. But as this example in the talk showed, this may still be multi-sheeted, so it does not have to be flicked, and in fact, it can be, can have infinitely many. It can have infinitely many sheets. So, some points in X may actually have infinitely many pre-images. So, it may vary well. Now, this definition has some kind of more or less solvents. Properties, one thing is actually essentially this uniqueness: that this thing is functorial. So, with respect to inclusions, so if you Inclusions. So, if q is included in some other domain and along your prime, then there is an inclusion of envelopes and everything can be used. And another thing is that, so maybe I even write this here, so remark, that this functor, that's actually a function from the category of these domains with more principles of inclusions. This is a functor to the same category. Category, yeah, take conclusions, conclusions, and this function is an ideal attack. So, if I take the end-of-something which already was an end-all, then I get negative. So you can state this as envelopes are precisely the means of home. And the means of all are the means which coincide with variables. So such that H of, I don't know, V of A Z. So this is all sort of very standard, but actually also very, very important and very, very nice. So I personally like it very much. So, I personally like it very much. Now, the question, of course, where does convexity come into play? And this is now. But first, I have to erase something from the whiteboard. But maybe keep it all up. So let me so then let's make this a subtype of complexity. But let me first make the following observation. So, suppose I have this to be u over some whatever complex manifold. And suppose that in this domain, this complex manifold u is Star. Then U is a domain of all. Mean that it coincides with the semi as I define layer down here, yeah. So so why uh well essentially uh if you still maybe remember the complex analysis definition of a stein uniformia, there were actually three conditions. In fact, you only need two. One is that commotive functions That homomorphic functions separate points, and another is that the manifold is homophobical tangents. Essentially, if I have a sequence of points going to infinity, I can always find that homomorphic function so that at least the sup of the absolute values along these points goes to infinity. And now, then, if I just consider this inclusion, To the manifold from this pair. Then separability, separability implies that this is injective. Well, because I mean two points. Well, because I mean, two points cannot go to one point if there is a homomorphic function which takes different feathers there, yeah, because it will have to extend. And the extend means that it's the composition with this inclusion. And if two points go to the same point, then it must take the same value. And homomorphic complexity then tells me that this is surgery. Is surgery. And again, why? Well, that's sort of again obvious, yeah? Because since this is injective, I'm actually sitting inside. So this is you sitting inside h or v. And if I have a boundary point, I can find a function by homomorphic complexity. So the modules is, the soup of the modules is infinite, yeah? And this function will not extend. So this is sort of a picture respectively. Total picture respects. So you see that if something is tai, then it is automatically sold in the main envelope of home. So you would sort of expect that if you have maximal things, then they should have something to do with shtai. And that's indeed true, but again, so in some kind of in general, in some kind of local way or semi-local way. So let me give another definition here. And mean u over x is locally fine. Sometimes this is also called locally pseudocomplex. But this is a relative dosion. So, again, so this is over. So again, so this is over x. If for every point down in x, there exists a neighborhood of that point contained in x, such that the pre-image of this neighborhood is a stein manifold, but maybe disconnect. Disconnect so it's time, but possibly, of course, with countably many connected reports, possibly disconnect. And again, so the examples are as follows. So if I have a viewer, I mean Q in X, then of course the interesting points in this definition are the points on the bottom. And are the points on the bottom. And then I need a neighborhood v like this so that this part is strange. Just the v intersection with v is stagnant. This pre-image here is just the intersection. And another example which I erased, that's the example of coverings. So if I have a covering, this is all This is always locally stein. Because every point has a neighborhood, just a small neighborhood, over which the covering splits is completely trivial. So I take a small ball, this is Stein, and then the preimages will be just isomorphic copies of this ball. So everything I call it Stein, everything Stein. So this is always. So, in particular, x itself is local with time over itself because x could be, for example, compact. Yeah, you see that local style is very far from actually being And the first thing is a justification of this kind of command that I made after this observation. So that maximum things should somehow be kind of related to being shah. And so this is the theorem of Khatan. This is Ahitan. And to them, not in full generality. Not in full generality, and in really full generality was put by Oka, yeah. So we like got a box that popped up on our screen that's like about to obstruct a box on your screen that you can click okay, or you do see a box on your screen. Sorry, I cannot really hear you. I mean, I can hear you, but when you are speaking together. Okay. Can you hear me? Yeah, we can hear you. You're just the screen is blocked by like the recording pop-up. Okay, I actually got the message that the meeting is being recorded by one participant. Can you press that wasn't me? But can you press Got It? Is it possible? But can you press got it? Is it possible for you to press like yes? I did. I did. Ah, okay. You sort of saw it on your screen, like in front of me. Yeah, you still see it. I actually see myself there behind me. Yeah, okay. No, actually, it's a bit strange because I don't really see it. I don't see it on my screen. Yeah, and so now he has it on his screen. So the user, the user named video should also click. Okay, we have a specialist from there. There is some Zoom participant by the name of Vivio. Oh, we got it. We got it. We got it. We're good. Great, yeah, wonderful. So, that wasn't the case of censorship. Yeah, it was just kind of so, okay. So, I was about to say something important, and there was that, I didn't introduce this notion just for fun, and there was a classical theorem saying that Envelope's Outomorphic are always locally high. And there is a big problem, largely completely open in several complex variables, which is usually called the Levy problem after Jenny or Levy, which actually says something like this. It's a bit vague. So suppose you have a complex method. So, suppose you have a complex manifold of X. Can you describe locally time domains over X? And here, describe means like tell which of them are really time, which are not. And for most manifolds, this is completely and hopelessly over. But there are some classes of manifolds for which you can actually say something. And fortunately, now the time manifolds are actually one such class where everything is really one. So, theorem, another classical theorem. Theorem and not the classical theorem, due also to OCA in the case of CN, but that's a crucial case, and to Dokier-Brau in the general. And that's if X is time, then every law coming time. And the mean over X is sine turkey. That's rather difficult here. Well, actually, this first one is also not so easy. But for the first one, one at least has something which you want to call an elementary proof, do the bishop. But this one, actually, no matter how you do it, it's not really elementary. So the detection. So, but this actually sort of explains why Stein manifolds are really interesting for complex analysis. So, it's one of the reasons. Okay, so when we are extending functions from any domain in, say, Cn, C and Stein, you are always somehow ending up in something Stein. In some sense, you do not really, I mean, for example, function algebras, all domains are actually Stein algebra. So, algebras of functions on Stein mains. So, this has some rollers. Have some corollaries. So the first corollary is what the envelopes are. So envelopes, which, as I said, the same as the main homo, the main homogeneity. So it is the main homogeneity. So those maximum over stein manifolds are all stein. A role style. So, in particular, if I have a domain which is shticht, so something sitting in a shtal menu, then it actually is embedded as an open subset into something shta. And this is this is not shah and this is shy. And business shot. And the corroder, which is actually proved by Carl Stein himself before the theorem was available. And this concerns the second example here. So coverings of manifold of Which is actually very nice to know, especially when the copper has infinitely many sheets. It's not at all obvious that you can separate the points in the fibers by functions. And also homomorphic conduct is not at all. So it's also the difficult theory. Okay, so now one can apply this and the things you know about. Know about to describe any of the morph and that kind of thing. So we'll be interested in topological properties of animals. And let's first look at the general case. Let's first look at the general case. And then, when I'm saying topological properties, let me just say something, just kind of wave my hands a little bit. The idea goes as follows. You want to kind of see how the envelope is different from the original domain, which you interpret as functions being forcibly extended somewhere. And how do you actually distinguish two topological spaces? You maybe take your favorite functor on the category of topological spaces, maybe multiple. Homological spaces, maybe homotopy groups or homology or something. And you try to see that when you apply this function to the inclusion map, you do not get any solvents. Which means something happens. Either some new cycles or whatever loops appear, or maybe some cycles which you had in U get spammed by some kind of change. And this means that the angle is somehow different from the original thing. And the first thing is that actually, if you look at groups, you cannot really hope that new things appear, which is maybe a good thing. So, and this is a theorem. And it's actually a corollary of the theorem of stein. So, if I look at the map of fundamentals, so induced by, of course, the By, of course, the inclusion to pi one of the end group. Then this is all this subject. So, well, for example, if I start from a simply connected, the mean and the envelope is also simply connected. This actually is a corollary of Stein's theorem and a sort of form. And sort of form. So I have my U, and there is my inclusion map to the envelope. And now, suppose that this is not, and then I can take the covering, and this is the covering corresponding to the image of this matter. To image and then, just by definition, the map lifts. And this contradicts, so this is the diagram of the music. And this contradicts the uniqueness of antibodies. Because the big thing, well, because this is the function will extend. The function will extend, and this will be also maximum because it is stein. And this will contradict its stein by stein's theory. So this contradicts the uniqueness of animal objects. Unless this covering is true. So you've not yet actually, yeah, and it's actually a good question. How can you describe the current of the How can you describe the curve of this thing geometrically? And there is a result of this direction much more recent by looking the origin in 2009. And this is that elements in the kernel are always represented by boundaries. By boundaries of actually generally merged, well at least in dimension two homomorphic disks. So there's a homomorphic disk in the envelope so that its boundary is inside my delay u and represents this class. So it's not just spanned by something, but it actually is spanned by a homomorphic disk. Not every representative. Not every representative, but some. And now the general thing is that, of course, Stein manifolds have very special quality. And then Moji groups of time manifolds, this is stein, all vanish for k bigger than the complex dimension. And then, of course, this basically means obviously, yeah, so that if I take this map. That if I take this map and take its action on theology in degree k, and this k is bigger than the dimension, the complex dimension of u, then this is automatically zero. So all these titles bound something. And in particular, let's draw a picture. So if I have some real hyper surface in a time, so this is of complex dimension n, and this is. Dimension n, and this is all so real hypersurface closed. And if I take u to be some neighborhood of n, something like this. And then if ends at least two, this cycle must bound. Must bound in the angle, which, if you play a little bit with degrees and the fact that all the maps here are locally but homomorphic, you see that it actually means that n is the boundary of something and that something is included into the envelope of one. So this is included. This is actually, this is a shift. This is actually a fichter, so this actually is a real matter. And this is, of course, just a very complicated proof of a classical theorem called the Hart of Schugensatz. So that homotopic functions of more than two variables never have complex singularities. Okay, so that was some kind of introduction of basic things. And now let us go to dimension two. We are more interested in things that we have. Okay, so dimension two and then just start with examples. And the examples will And the examples will be just in C2. So suppose I have a two-sphere. So this is a two-sphere smoothly embedded in C2. If I now take a neighborhood of this here, then I know. I know that if I take the homology class of this S in the endulo of U, then this one is U. Why? Well, this is shine and Uh, and the self-intersection of S is zero, so it violates a junction and therefore must be honorologically true sorry, momological tree. But I can actually do a little bit better. Namely, I have my S, it sits in U, U is included, and actually in this case, embedded into the envelope, and this is fine. But now I can take the universal cover of this and this lifts, and now I can. And now I can also apply a junction up there. So, this homology class is trivial in this simplicity thing, but this actually implies that also the class of S in the second multiple of H of U is zero. So, this S. So this S is also homotopic. So that's one example. So we see in dimension two, Holmes dimension two, even in this critical middle dimension, things get to bound things. Okay? And the second example. And the second example is a bit different. Let us consider RP2. So this is a surface embedded surface in C2. There are actually two cases here. So one, the cases depend on the Euler number of the normal one. So if this Euler number of the normal number, Uh, this ordered number of the normal bundle is minus two, then the sigma may have a connection, it can always deform two, may have a neighborhood, a small non-much neighborhood. But if this normal bundle or the number of the normal bundles plus two, then I get a To you, then I can again play this game. I can take sigma, I map it to you, then it goes to the envelope, then I consider the universal cover. And now, if pi one of sigma is mapped to pi one of the endable. Non-triviable. Then what happens is that this, well, this doesn't lift. This lifts. So get a two-sphere in this cover violating a junction. So, what I get from this is that this cannot happen. So, I see that in the second case, so this map pi one on, I don't know, so this J U on pi one Pi one must be zero. Okay. So again, something happened. If I assume this, so that I cannot easily construct a small shiny neighborhood by deforming my surface, yeah? Then all of a sudden the envelope is really big. There's a whole kind of There's a whole kind of two-dimensional now disk which must exist inside this envelope, spanning this only non-trivial loop in RP2. In general, one can play with inverse surfaces, which I did 20 years ago. So let me say this as a theorem. I'm actually sort of running out of time, but I think I still. Running out of time, but I think I still have time to state a theorem and a conjecture. Yes, definitely. Oh, yes, you have time to state a theorem and the conjecture. Okay, thanks. That's very old one. So it's by myself in 2003 in this Turkish journal. So if I have, so sigma, which is the image of, let's say, I motor of, I don't know. I don't know. S and it says just real surface, oriental or not. So closed, real surface. And this iota from S to actually any timing is this kind of thing. So it's an immersion with this ordinary double point. Okay, then either Satan. Signal is isotopic to a sort of ambient gisop to a surface again immersed of course with arbitrarily small shiny ions Which is actually the same as sigma, satisfying the strongest possible version of the junction with double points of all signs. Satisfying the strongest possible junction. This appeared in Microsoft. So this is this I plus minus. Or the map by inclusion from pi sum of sigma, where sigma is the thing with double points. So I'm also thinking about loops created by the double points. So sigma is the hinge. So it's this thing. But also hands. But also happens to convex is not injective. So that's very, very special for dimension two. Either things sort of you deform things and everything becomes stein right there. Or there is a huge thing which you have to add. Which you have to add when you pass to envelopes because envelopes will be stein. Okay, so even in the minimal possible domain containing your surface, there will be some kind of disks or three balls immersed, of course, kind of with boundary near your surface. That's why this is why I'm optimistic and jetting. Now, just looking at surface is not natural from a point of view of complex animals. You would really want to start with a domain. So let's start with the simplest possible domains other than just neighborhoods of such surfaces. So suppose that I just have something which is a finite. So suppose U. U in X, and this is Scha is a finite handle body smooth without, of course, handles or index greater than three. And this is a surface. Then either you is the ambient me isotopic to time the name. Actually, the ambient isotopic should then be that we can also make it between the C0 small or something in X or Or this map is not in general. Okay, so the meaning is that if you cannot really make your so you start with the mean that sort of looks like it could be really fine. Like if you really kind of shuffle it, you will not have any kind of. Of half of it, you will not have any kind of extension. And in higher dimensions, we know that if you start from such a thing, then, well, actually, you can indeed buy a dashboard, you can indeed shuffle it in such a way. And now I'm seeing that in dimension two, even if you cannot do this, then you cannot do this for really drastic reasons. Like the minimum of time thing containing it will kind of necessarily contain really big things. Contain really big things. The topology will really change big time. Okay, thank you very much. And sorry for going over time here. Does anyone have any questions for Stephen? Can you say, where did you use the condition in the previous example, the RP2, where does the condition of the normal oil number enter? Oil number answer? When I'm lifting this to a sphere, in order for this here to violate a junction, I need the intersection index of this lifted sphere to be greater or equal than minus one. If I lift a thing with this normal minus two thing, I don't get it. Thanks. Thanks. In fact, this thing exists and it has a one, a complex point, and then a shiny. More questions for Stefan? Well, actually, it's probably not two. Anyway, so this is maybe, this two is maybe one. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's, it's, yeah, it's all the. Yeah, it's allocistic mode. No, no, no, two. Twice mode, twice olocistic mode, four. No, two, two. It's all right. Sorry. Well, let's thank the man for being the talk. Yeah, we hope somebody proves that or disproves that. I guess we should thank the remaining in-person organizers. They mean in-person organizations. Oh, sorry. I forgot something. Yeah. I should be as the last speaker now. I didn't think I was going to be the last speaker. I have to thank the organizers for organizing this wonderful meeting and for bringing all us experts on convexity and amateurs of convexity together. Yeah, thank you very much.
