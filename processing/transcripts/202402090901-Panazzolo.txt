The workshop. So, my talk is not, it will be, of course, related to turn series, but not exactly to let's say the turn series themselves, but to the germs of functions which are, let's say, associated to turn series. So, what's the goal? So, we are interested in considering, in fact, some subgroups I will call G, which are subgroups of the group. Which are subgroups of the group of homeomorphisms, of germs of homeomorphisms, which fix the point at minus infinity on the real line, right? So these are, let's say, they're realized by functions, continuous functions, which are defined on a sufficiently small neighborhood, on some open interval, which contains a minus infinity disclosure. So more specifically, we are trying to understand those groups. Those groups whose elements have some sort of transiential asymptotic expansion. So, well, I will start by some example to show to you what I mean by that. So, the simplest example that I, well, it's already very rich, is the case where the group G is generated by the following elements. So, consider all the translations, right? So, I denote by TA the translation, which let's say the function which associates. Which, let's say, the function which associates should x plus a, right? So, this is a group indexed by the reals, I call t. Then there is the scaling maps. So, these are just the scaling maps with a positive alpha, right? Because we want the plus infinity to be preserved. So, we require that this alpha, this multiplier alpha, should be strictly positive. And again, this is a subgroup of homeomorphisms. Of homeomorphisms, and now, of course, if you just consider these two elements, then you have just have the fine maps, fine maps which preserve minus infinity. But now I'm going to add the exponential and the log. Of course, they also form a... So I always mean the main determination of the log here, of course. So this forms a third group that they call E. Right, so now the idea is that. Right, so now the idea is that you want to consider the group G, which is generated by T, S, and E, right? So T S plus and E. So, okay, so first remark is that if you consider the finite composition of these elements in these three groups, you have something which is, there is a germ of function which lies on this, let's say, on the minimum structure here, is definable here. Here and by as a consequence, it's defined by a converged trans series. Of course, I just said a word that you can expand in this, let's say, a word given by composition of this symbol series, defines a function which lies on this ominous structure and then corresponds to a convergent trans series. But what I want to know is not really the finiteness properties of this. The finiteness properties of these germs, let's say, but the structure of the group itself, right? For instance, one natural question that one can ask is: can we characterize the free subgroups inside G, right? So which groups are a copy of, let's say, a two-element-free group or things like that. So, a first remark, let's say you have a hint on this structure, is that the exponent. hint on this structure is that the exponential can of course this is a very natural observation that it conjugates t to s plus so if you take a translation then you you conjugate by the exponential you just have the scaling map with the multiplier given by exponent of a right so in some sense you can see the exponential as some external homomorphism which maps one t to s plus One t to s plus right. So let's say this is the relation that we obtain here, relation which, let's say, between a translation and a scaling map. And we would like to say that E is some sort of external homeomorphism which lies outside the fine group and which maps one piece of the affine group to another piece. So I've drawn this diagram here because this is what we call Here, because this is what we call a structure of an HN extension. So, let's say one natural guess is that the group G should be isomorphic to the HN extension of F plus, where the exponential plays the role of the stable letter. Okay, so I think I will not have time to explain in details what that does it means, but in fact, it means that roughly speaking, this is the only related. Roughly speaking, this is the only relation that holds in this group. Yeah, okay. So it seems quite easy, but it's not a really very easy theorem because, well, there are some delicate points concerning the elements, algebraic elements that you can generate by such kind in this group. This is a very large group. But let me just give you an example of a consequence of this result. Consequence of this result is that you can have many free subgroups, and you can, in fact, characterize all free subgroups inside G because this is well, this is a part of this H an extension property. So, as an example, let's consider the group generated by the translations and the powers. So, this, I mean that you just take translations and then you take something which is, let's say, x go to x plus a, and then the power maps, x go to. that the power maps x go to x to the power lambda where lambda is some positive number and the group generated by these two elements is free so it means that it's a copy of the two generations the group gen there is all the only relations that you have in this group are the those which are internal to the translations and those which are the group law for the for the the cover map right so this is a was a question of hidman So, this was a question of Hidman. It is a consequence of this result here. So, let's say a word in this group is something like this. You see, composed translations and power maps. And you'd like to know if you can generate, let's say, the identity germ with some non-trivial combination of this kind of elements. And that's not possible. So, okay, so this group G is what I. Is what I like to call a finitary trans-series because it's generated by, let's say, composition of some very basic elements, translations, scaling, exponential, and logs. And it's generated in a finite number of steps. This is why I call it finitary. So, well, of course, you can have something, you can generate things which are interesting. Let's say this map here, you can easily obtain it inside the group G. Obtain it inside the group G. And when you write this, let's say you would expand it in this trivial way, you get something which is a germ which is tangent to the identity up to exponential expression like this. Okay, so it's exponentially flat tangent to the identity. And now, when you start to compose such kind of maps, we get a subgroup of a very, let's say, group which Very, let's say, group which is very useful in dynamical systems is what we call Dulac group. Okay, so this is the group of, I will explain more in detail in a moment, but so roughly speaking, it's the group of formal series which have this kind of expansion. So it's, let's say you have some identity part here, and then you have some sum, whether this exponential, this exponent's lambda. exponential these exponents lambda can be any real numbers but they don't have accumulation points on their on their on the let's say the the the line they are strictly increasing exponents which don't don't accumulate but then go to infinity and um and then you this is what they call a let's say one simple instance of the Julax series so for instance by composing the the kind of map that I wrote here above you can Here above, you can get what you call a finitary Dulac series because you, of course, you can make this lambda increase as much as you want by composing successively these numbers, but it ends up by being something which is finitary because you only have the right to compose a finite number of these elements to stay in your group G. So you have some, let's say, very precise information about this finite Dulux series, which are, of course, Series, which are, of course, consequences of the result that I just stated. But, well, for the application that I have in mind, I will describe them in a moment. Of course, it's not sufficient to consider just this finitary Dulac series. And now I'm going to define what we call the Dulac series, the real ones. And then we are going to try to Then we are going to try to describe some results, let's say, in the same spirit that the one that I have just explained in the case of arbitrary Dulac series. So for Dulac series, there is two parts. Let's say you have the formal definition, and then you have the germs, the germ part, the analytic part. And I explain them separately. So, what are Dulak series? For me, there are some different ways of expressing this, but I stick with this definition. So, these are formal series, which have this expression. So, they start with, let's say, an affine part, Ax plus B. And then again, you have this increasing sequence of exponentially flat terms. Exponentially flat terms. Okay, so of course, we are looking at a neighborhood of plus infinity here. And so this mu are positive numbers, which are strictly increasing. And okay, so there is some difference. This is not really a trans series, the usual sense, because it's important for us to allow complex coefficients somewhere. Okay, so the restriction here is that A is always. Here is that A is always a strictly positive real number, okay, because we want to preserve it minus infinity. But we are going to allow B and all these polynomials which appear here, so these are polynomials, to have complex coefficients. You're going to see in a moment why this is important. So, this is our, let's say, formal object. And let me just explain the motivation. So, of course, this So of course this series had been introduced by Dulac in the beginning of the 20th century. And his goal was to understand, or more precisely, to give an asymptotic expansion to the transition maps near hyperbolic settles for planar vector fields. So what I mean by that is that you have, let's say, this is a configuration for a planar vector field where you have what You have what you call a saddle point, right? And then you want to understand the solution curves of your vector field in a neighborhood of this saddle point. And what you do is that you fix these two traversals and you look for this transition, what we call the corner transition map. And just to show how the exponent, let's say the transcendental part appears here, is that even if you consider the simplest case of Case of a linear saddle. So let's say you take something like of this form here with lambda some positive real number. Then you can write the first integral for this vector field and you see very easily that the transition map has the form d of x equals 2x to the power lambda. Okay, so of course, this is not exactly the Dulac map that I've written above, but it's more natural to consider everything. It's more natural to consider everything in the logarithmic chart. So, what I do is that I compose on this expression for capital D on the left and on the right by the map exponential of minus x. So if you compose by exponential of minus x. Daniel, sorry, there's a question in the chat. Do you require the muse to belong to a finitely generated semi-group? No, not necessarily. No, not necessary. No. Yeah, I'm not seeing the chat. Sorry. So. Thank you. Yeah. So of course, in this, let's say completely trivial linear case, the Julak map seen on the logarithmic chart has this expression here, lambda of x. Yeah, sorry. So in fact, in the context of dynamical. In the context of dynamical systems, this will lie on the finite-generated group. Yes, this is a finite generated monoid, but it's not necessary for the what I'm going to explain. So you see this gives you this lambda of x, so the linear part. So this is why I'm requiring that the first affine part of the Dulac bed has a multi-party. Has a multiplier which is a strictly positive real number. But it will be important in a moment. I will explain this because we want to compose such kind of maps. So now, how this, let's say, I explained to you how this first multiplier part appears, but then it's also very natural to see this affine part appearing. For instance, when you compose When you compose the DULAC map, the transition map with a regular map. So, this is what this configuration that I've drawn here is the so-called saddle loop. Okay, so now you just connect the two transversals by some regular transition map outside, which let's say just is just something of given by a scaling map, x go to the r times x. And so when you times x. And so when you compose the power map with this scaling map, you get something of this form, of course, right? And now again, written in the logarithmic chart, you have d of x is lambda x minus log of r. So as I said, eventually this log of log here can be a complex one because I'm not supposing that my vector field is real. So I can allow this. Okay, so this I can allow this log to be, this second term to be complex. So, of course, the complexity starts to appear when you compose many such kinds of transition maps. So, here I've drawn what you call a hyperbolic polycycle with five saddles. And so, of course, we want to understand the structure of the group generated by composing such kind of maps. By composing such kind of maps, Dulac maps. So Dulac introduced this formal definition of, let's say, of Dulac series, but then Ilyashenko gave a full analytical realization to this series by introducing what we call now a Dulak germ. So what's that? So in fact, it's important to consider not only germs defined in a neighborhood of The germs defined on the neighborhood of infinity on the real line, but also which have some appropriate complex expansion to some neighborhood of the real line, which cannot be so small either. So let's see. So a Duluch germ is just a bounded holomorphic function defined on a domain which contains the region that I have just drawn here. So the important fact is that this region fact is that this region have some growth as i said it some should contain something which is um greater than a sector containing the sector containing the the real axis so something like the imaginary part of z smaller or equal than constant times real part of z square okay so when a domain contains such region we say that it's a standard quadratic Such region, we say that it's a standard quadratic domain for some C. Yes, sorry, I should have made some, there's some displacement factor here, I forgot. But anyway, so it's as a germancy at infinity. Sorry, I should have put some translation part here. So the second part of it, so we need some germ which has its holomorphic function. It's a relationship of a holomorphic function on a domain of this type. Of a holomorphic function on a domain of this type, and moreover, which has a dual series as an asymptotic expansion uniformly on such domain. So the very important fact that has been proved by Lashinko is that there is this quasi-analytic property, which says that I will call the Taylor expansion map. So the map which associates to each. Associates to each Dulek germ, the corresponding Dulex series is an injective map. Okay, so it's what we should call a cosmetic property. And for this, an essential ingredient is really the fact that you have a function which is defined in a sufficiently large region. So this is an important element for this proving this. And in particular, In particular, well, I said that I'm admitting complex Dulac series, but a Dulac series will be real if it's, let's say, a Dulac germ is real, let's say it maps the real axis into a real axis, if and only if its Dulac series contains only real coefficients. All right, so now this is this important effect that they do like. This is important that they do like germs, as I've written them, they form a group on their composition. So, in fact, this is why we require this first coefficient A to be strictly positive, because using this, you can prove that a region like this is mapped to a region like this by composition. So, you can compose maps of this type, and this forms a group that we call. And this forms a group that we call the Dulac group. Okay, the group of Dulac gems. So, in particular, let's say to go back to our original problem, we'd like to understand, for instance, what's the structure of D intersected with homeomorphisms which preserve infinity. So what are the structure of the Dulac germs, which are real. So, let's say this analytic realization of Analytic realization of trans of some particular type of trans series, but not of convergence trans series, but because in principle, of course, this correspondence doesn't say at all that you have normal convergence for the trans series that appear on the right-hand side of this error. Okay, so now I'm going to introduce a particular type of I'm going to introduce a particular type of Dulac germ because this is also motivated by the dynamical system, by differential equations, what I call unramified Dulac germ. So let's say we can say that a Dulac germ, somehow is a very general way to obtain a ramified analytic germ because you see, let me just go back to this drawing. So you have some germ. This drawing, so you have some germ which is defined on an on a, let's say, on some sort of half, right half plane here. But when you go back by the logarithmic to the look to the original chart, I remember that this domain lies on the logarithmic chart. So, in the original chart, you have a multivalued map, right? So, in some sense, this is a very, very ramified map in the sense that you map in the sense that you you have a lot of logarithm and ramification which appear in the in the original chart. Okay, so I'm going to just isolate a particular type of Dulac germ, which are precisely those ones which are not ramified. So of course this is I'm going to define and then we're going to see this very natural to consider this class. This class. So, what I mean by unremified, I mean the following: you consider this particular element of the group, the Dulac maps, which is just a translation by 2πi. So this is just a translation that you send you upstairs by this distance 2 pi i. And of course, you see that this is an element of my group because I'm allowing to have complex coefficients. To have complex coefficients. And now I am going to see that a Dulac germ D is unramified if it commutes with TO, right? So this commutator of TO and D gives you the identity. So, in fact, this means that if you conjugate D by T, you get D itself. Of course, it's not very intuitive by the definition, but what this means, though there's two equivalent ways to state this. So this is ramified if only if its Dulac series has the following very particular form. So there is no coefficient A here. And then on the expansion which appears on this sum, all the exponents. This sum all the exponents should be positive rational numbers, positive natural numbers, and then there is no polynomial part, just the polynomials which appear multiplying the exponential are just constants. Okay, so why this is so well, this is very easy. You see that if you have this kind of, if you write a Dulac series and then you change x to the x plus 2 pi i, it should have this form. It should have this form to commute with the translation. So it should necessarily have this form. And then why now you use the quasi-analysis property, you say that if D is unramified, then its dual series, let's say it's imaged by the Taylor map, should necessarily be of this form here. So what does this mean? There is another way to see this. In fact, it means This is, in fact, it means simply that you are taking a germ which is not ramified on the, let's say, on the original chart where your object lives. So it's just a series, a holomorphic function, which is no ramification at all. And then you lift it to the universal cover of the punctured disk to get something which is let's. To get something which is, let's say, just this series D, so it's easy to say that if you lift something which is not ramified before lifting, then its expansion should have this form here. This C1 means that you just take germs which are tangent to the identity. So they fix the origin. So phi of zero is zero, and phi prime of zero is equal to one. This is what I mean. zero is equal to one. This is what I mean by this index one. Right, so these are the unramified ones. Let's say this is the nice ones, but of course we'd like to classify all Dilac maps. And we consider the following the problem of conjugation. So I'm perhaps at the first sight it will seem a little bit artificial, but I'm going to explain why we are interested in this. So we're not trying to So, we're not trying to classify. So, what kind of classification are we trying to do? I'm going to say that two Dulak germs, D1 and D2, are U conjugated or U equivalent if they are conjugated by some element of the group of unramified germs. Okay, so D1 and D2 can be very ramified, but I'm asking to have a conjugation between. A conjugation between them, which is given by some f which is not ramified. Okay. So what's the motivation for this? So let's just give one motivation. In fact, you remember that the origin of the DLAC series is to study analytic vector fields. So So one could ask the following thing. So you consider two hyperbolic polycycles. I'm just making a schematic drawing here, left one, the right one. And I would like to, in fact, to construct a holomorphic or say an analytic equivalence between the foliations in a neighborhood of these hyperbolic polycycles. So in fact, I'd like to give a map which sends a neighborhood of one polycycle to a neighborhood of the other polycycle. To a neighborhood of the other polycycle, but preserving also the solution curves, right? So mapping solution here to solution here. And well, in some sense, this is to do this, you need, of course, to have some equivalence which is not ramified between the Dulac maps. Okay. So this is the. So, this is the unremified classification, but you can also consider formal unrememified classification. So, what I mean by that is that instead of looking for a classification where this F is a convergent germ, we just take F as a formal germ. Okay, so what I mean here is that, so just go back a little bit. In the beginning, I said that urban fire germs. I said that urban fire germs come from convergent series. But if I change this by formal series, by this taking double bracket here, then I have this group utilda. So these are just series, which no convergence requirement at all. And then we say Q Dulac germs are utilda conjugated if there is some F. If there is some f which now a formal one which maps d1 to d2 by conjugation, right? So I have these two classifications, which of course you can say that this utilda classification principle is much, let's see, the orbits are much larger. So let me just make this remark. So let's make this a schematic drawing here. You have on the left-hand side. On the left-hand side, you have the group G, sorry, the group D, and you have the action by conjugation of U. Then you have this arrow here, which is the Taylor error, which embeds D on D tilde. And on D tilde, you have the action of this group, let's say this larger group, which is the group of formal and rubified series. So, as I said, as I said a moment ago, the group utilizes. Ago, the group util in some sense is much larger than U as because C double brackets much larger than C convert, right? So this is, let's not, I'm not going to say precisely what I mean by large, but of course you can see that there are much more larger, much more power series than convergent ones in some sense. Okay. So what you expect is that the orbits, the UT. The u tilde orbit of an element of d should be much larger than its u orbit, right? Because it's quite natural to say that if you have an orbit by a group which is much larger, then the orbit should be much larger. Yes. So let me just give an example of this. Let's say a very classical example. Suppose that you want to classify all germs of convergent C. Of convergence series, which have this expansion here. So you have this linear part, which is given by a rotation, an irrational rotation. And then you have a non-linear part. So now you would like, for instance, to classify this kind of germs by formal conjugation or by analytic conjugation, right? So in this case, you have these two. Have these two classifications that differ quite spectacularly. So, for instance, for the formal classification, if you suppose that lambda is not a rational number, there is a unique orbit. I mean, all germs of this type, which have the same linear part, are conjugated by a formal series. So, there is a single orbit here. And on the other hand, On the other hand, if you look for the analytic classification, sorry, then it's in fact unknown. There is some result, let's say, the very precise result of Bruno, which say that if lambda satisfies some Diofuntine conditions, then you have a single orbit. But if lambda is not the Diefuntine number, then we know that there are examples where formal equivalent. Examples where formal equivalence doesn't imply analytic equivalence. In fact, it's a completely open problem to describe this analytic orbit. Adam? Yeah. I was wondering if you complicate a term by formal something in u ta, do you always end up in the unit? No, no, no, no, that's not true. Oh, then of course. The orbit is much larger, but yeah. orbit is much larger but uh yeah so yeah i should say that um what uh well i think i've written this in here yes yes what i i'm looking at is then you take an element d okay yeah i think it'll be clear in the next definition i i just going to give you so uh yeah so there is the following is that you have That you have, we'd like to understand what we call a rigidity phenomenon. For me, so a quite surprising phenomenon which appears for these Dulak germs, which is the following. So we consider a Dulac germ D. Okay, so a convergent series. So not convergent series, but an analytic germ. And we're going to say that it's u tilde rigid, or let's say just short rigid. Rigid if it is formal classification implies its analytic classification. I mean, this is roughly speaking, but let just see what I mean by that. Is that a funny thing? So, consider two elements. One of them is D, and I take another germ, D1, and I assume that these two germs lie on the same formal orbit. So they are utilized conjugate. So this is just true that. So this just shows the show. Of course, I take the intersection of the U-tilde orbit of D, the small D, with the set of dual series which represent dual germs, right? So suppose that D and D1 are U-conjugate, then, sorry, they are U-tilde conjugate, then they are U-conjugate. So this is the rigidity phenomenon. Phenomena. So, another way of stating this is the one that I just wrote here. So, you take the u tilde orbit of D, so the set of all elements which has this form here, f minus one composite with d, composed with f with f tilde f on u tilde. Then d is rigid if and only if the orbit, the u tilde orbit of d The U tilde R of D intersected with the Dulac germs is exactly the. So in principle here, you could have a strict containers here, but if the orbits are, this intersection is exactly the orbit of D by U, then you say that D is rigid. So of course, So, of course, the previous example shows that this you cannot expect to have this all the time. So, again, let me just go back. So, this kind of situation here shows that this kind of germ cannot be a refit because it's formal classification and it's analytic classification. Okay, so. Okay, so in fact, what we were able to prove is the following thing. So you see that the previous example, it has the property that this F, this irrational rotation, comes from something which is unverified, right? So this is just a germ which is converged on the neighborhood of origin. So it gives rise to an It gives rise to an unramified germ if you look at it as a germ, adulterox series. And the result that we prove is that, in fact, this is precisely the obstacle to have rigidity, in some sense, that the ramification generates rigidity. Almost, there is an exceptional case here that I'm going to. Well, I'm going a little bit fast. I don't know if some questions, but so what's the result? So you consider a germ D, which is a Gilac germ, and then one of the following three possibilities hold. They are not mutually exclusive, okay? So either D is unramified, so in the case where D is unrifamifified. In the case where D is unramified, then we can have such kind of phenomena that I just explained on the irrational rotation. So in some cases, you don't have rigidity. Second possibility is that D lies in D minus U, so it's ramified. Okay, so it's something less ramified. And then there is this case where it's conjugate. This is the case where it's conjugate to the time one flow of some vector field. So, this is the exceptional case where it's quite strange, but in this case, you can prove that it's not rigid either. And finally, as I said, the service situations that this rigid. So, except for the, let's say, the case where something is not ramified or this quite. Not ramified, or this quite exceptional case where you have something which comes from the flow of some vector field, you always have rigidity, right? So this seems, it means the following. You take two Dulac germs and you want to know if they are, let's say, analytically conjugated. You just write them there, and you try to find a formal conjugation between this. A formal conjugation between the series. Okay, so I'm not saying that this is simple because, in some sense, we could read this result as saying not that the analytic classification is easy, but more as saying that the formal classification that it's difficult, because it is as hard as the analytic classification. Okay, so this is the result. Well, I'm just going to give Well, I'm just going to give two, yeah, two or three words about the idea of the proof. So, in fact, there is one of the main ingredients of the proof is what you call a Tauberian type theorem. So, it has been used in a paper of Dominique Servot and Robert Mossieu to study the subgroups, the groups of germs. The groups of germs of diffeomorphism on C. And this is well, one of there are several statements of this Toberer type theorem. One of the simple statements is the following. Suppose that you have a formal series which is k summable and k prime summable for k different from k prime, then such a series converges. Okay, so I'm going to. Convergence. Okay, so I'm going to stay like this. You suppose, so this is what you call this is the notation for the k-summable series. So if it's some formal series is at the same time k summable and k prime summable, then it's convergent. Well, so in our case, we use some kind of version of this result, but we since we are working with Since we are working with ramified objects, we are not really on the context of a formal series, but you have some sort of dynamical point of view of this kind of identity. So I'm just going to make a drawing. So the idea is the following. You take some dual series. Let's say, let's suppose that you have this form here. And the idea to apply this principle is to... This principle is to try to find a way to conjugate f to the translation by one. So try to conjugate f to the map x go to x plus one. Okay, and this, if you are able to choose to conjugate f to this, you are solving what we call the abel's equation. So, of course, you cannot hope to have this. You cannot hope to have this conjugation by this without any restriction. And the idea is that you're able to do so in very particular types of domains, which we call the Fatu petals. I'm just going to be a little bit sketchy here, just going to write this, make some drawings. So what are the domains where you can conjugate F to translation? So remember, this is what you call them. Remember, this is what you call them. This is the standard to cadet domains, it's a natural domain of definition of a Dulac series. And then you divide it in strips like this. Okay. And well, these strips are, in fact, the opening of the height of these strips is related to the lambda, which appears here. Okay, just to precise you in a moment. So in fact, on each one of these. In fact, on each one of these strips, you are able to find an analytic conjugation, an analytic solution to the Abels equation. But the problem is that these solutions differ when you are in different strips. And it's precisely this kind of phenomenon which allows you to have this Tauberon type theorem. So these are what we call the Fatu petals. And then, as I said to you, the height of this. The height of this strips is given by 2π over lambda. And well, in fact, the idea that you this if well this lambda here will play the role, roughly speaking, of the k which appears here. So if you have domains of this type where with different values of lambda, let's say lambda. Different values of lambda, let's say lambda and lambda prime, and you have a same function which has for two petals which different values of lambda, then it will be convergent, converged as a function of this tree. Sorry, I've been a little bit sketchy here, but this is just to give you an idea for the ones which understand such kind of object. So I'll stop here. Sorry, I've been a little bit quick. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions for Daniel? I'm sorry, could you just explain this last diagram again, that last part about why the different lambdas having different lambdas? Having different lambdas, so having different size by three pedals corresponds to the convergence. I just didn't quite get it. Yeah. So in fact, this is the following. There is another characterization of k summability, which is what you call the Hamis-Sibuya characterization, which is the following one. You have a function. You have a function. So this is the classical definition of, for the classical definition of case mobility, you have a formal series. Let's say you have some holomorphic functions which are defined on sectors and then which cover a neighborhood of the origin. The unit of these sectors covers a neighborhood of the origin. And then you suppose that on the intersection of these sectors, These sectors, the difference between these functions is exponentially small, is k exponentially small, like this. Okay, so this is a way of defining something which is k-summable. So, of course, here the open of the sectors is related to the index k, which appears here. And the idea is that if you have something which is Which is so the importance in this result, this characterization of case mobility is that you have when you have something which is defined on different sectors. So let's see in our ramified chart, these sectors are given by these strips here. And the opening of the sectors is precisely this height, which appears here. Okay, right. So the idea is that if you on the intersection of this. On the intersection of this, one of these. So, these strips, of course, they can be a little bit extended to some larger strips. And then, in their intersection, their difference give functions which are very, very flat at infinity. So, what happens when you have this kind of phenomenon characterize you uniquely, the series? The series, but when you have, let's say, a same Dulac series which is asymptotic, which has a realization with this strip-like, let's say, strip-like realizations with different variables of lambda, let's say lambda one and lambda two, then it turns out that you can use this different possible. possible um this this these different possible um strip-like decompositions to fully um extend the function to to the whole domain right because you let's say this if lambda one is different from lambda two let's say let's suppose for instance they are qui-rational independent then at some point you are either in the intersect in a strip of two of the type two types two type two Of the type two types two pi over lambda or two pi over lambda one. And in this way, you can, in some sense, extend the function to the whole domain because either you use one petal for one lambda or for the other one. So this is the more or less the principle which is already behind this result of the classical one. But of course, there is also an analytic way to see this without. An analytic way to see this without talking about petals at all. Thank you. That's really helpful. Any questions? Yes, so on this page, exactly, so if you want to conjugate F to X plus one, then not the previous one. Say if you know that you can conjugate F to X plus one in the larger. To spawn in a larger group of cells like trans cells, so I didn't hear your question. Say that you know you can conjugate f to x plus one in a larger group of transeries, like very formal translies. Yes. Then don't you know that two different uh pan series that conjugate f to x plus one, they just differ by. They just differ by something. Yes, you can prove that, in fact, there is a Munich formal term series with lies on the same one, let's say on the same one, which is also of type of Dulux series, which conjugates F to X plus one. Okay, so in fact, you can prove that if they have two different That if they have two different germs, so this is more or less the idea that I should have said to you: that there is a unique formal turn series, and all the germs that appear in these different sectors, they are asymptotic to the same turn series of height one. It means that the difference between two of them, in the domains where they intersect, is something which is even smaller than any exponential. Even smaller than any exponential. Okay, so I mean, they lie in something in the intersection of two strips. We have a germ of function given by the difference between the solutions of the Bell equation on one strip and the other, which is something which goes to zero faster than the exponential of minus lambda times x for all lambda. In fact, In fact, it's double exponential, it's exponential of minus exponential of x. So it's a, yeah. I hope that I've answered your question. I've always send you an email. Thanks. Questions? Let's thank Daniel again. And we resume at 10:30. I have a short announcement to make.
