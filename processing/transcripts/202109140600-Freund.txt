And first, it's my pleasure to introduce Anton Foynd. He's currently leading a research group at the University of Darmstadt, and it's in connection with the Eminotor program of the DFK of the German Science Foundation. And Anton is going to talk about. To talk about, and let me see the title: Resemblance and Collapsing. Please, Anthony. That's right. Thank you very much for the introduction. So I'm going to share my screen again. So, thank you very much for the introduction again. And thanks in particular to all the organizers for inviting me. It's really nice to be part of this great conversation. Really nice to be part of this great conference. I will be speaking about resemblance and collapsing, and I want to begin by stating the idea behind these concepts in very general terms. So the idea is that we consider statements of the form some ordinal alpha resembles an ordinal beta that is strictly larger than alpha. So that's the statement up here. And we consider these statements because we hope that they are strong and that they force this ordinal alpha to be large. One first obvious question is probably what resemblance is supposed to mean. And the strongest form of resemblance that we have across mathematics is, I guess, isomorphism. Isomorphism. So one idea would be to say instead of resembles here, is isomorphic to. But then our statement does actually become contradictory because for ordinals alpha and beta, if they are isomorphic, then they are already equal. And then beta cannot be larger than alpha. So that's quite closely connected to the Burali 40 paragraph section. Section. And now we hope is that if we make resemblance a bit weaker than isomorphism, then the statement might become non-paradoxical, but it sort of retains one feature of the paradox, namely that it has tremendous logical strength. And this, well, very general idea, I think one can recognize it in some large cardinal properties, but that's not the topic that I want to speak about. Topic that I want to speak about here. I want to speak about this idea in a rather different context, namely the context of computable ordinals. And this will have connections with ordinal analysis and second-order arithmetic. And specifically, I want to speak about two manifestations of this general idea. Namely, first of all, patterns of resemblance, which are due to Timothy Carlson, and I will explain what they are. Explain what they are. I also want to mention: I think that Gunnar Wilkin might be here. So, he is one of the leading experts on these patterns of resemblance and has contributed enormously to developing that area of research. And the second manifestation of this general idea that I want to consider are ordinal collapsing functions, which appear, for example, in the description of the Bachmann-Howard ordinal that is very prominent in ordinal analysis. And I've just In order and analysis, and I've just put a few of the names that I have that I could have put, which we associate with developments of different ordinal annotation systems that involve these collecting functions. Okay, so let me start to make this concrete, and I want to begin here with Carlson's patterns of resemblance. So, on this slide, you have a definition for the simplest. Definition for the simplest possible case of these patterns. Namely, we consider a language that has two binary relation symbols. And we will interpret this language only in structures which have a set of ordinals as universe. And also, the interpretation of this first relation symbol is fixed, namely, it's the usual notion of inequality between ordinals. Between ordinals. And then the idea is to define this second relation symbol here, so the one with the index one, by recursion, by this clause here. So this clause here says that alpha is in that relation to beta if and only if the structure with universe alpha and these two relation symbols over that universe is sigma one elementary in. One elementary in the structure with universe beta and the two relation symbols. So, first of all, what do you mean by sigma one elementarity? I consider sigma one formulas that may begin with several existential quantifiers, but then no further quantifiers are allowed. And sigma one elementary means that whenever you have a statement that has ordinals below alpha as parameters, an existential statement with these parameters, whenever such Statement with these parameters: whenever such a statement holds in this larger structure beta, or in other words, has witnesses below this larger ordinal beta, then it must already hold in the smaller structure or have witnesses below alpha. And that's a recursion. So the symbol that we define does also appear on the right side. And this works because, in order to know what, for example, this larger structure here is, I only need to know comparisons between ordinals that I. Comparisons between ordinals that are strictly smaller than beta. And so recursively, I can define a comparison in which beta is the larger ordinal. Now, we are in a language without function symbols and with only finitely many relation symbols. And in these languages, sigma-one elementarity has a particular simple characterization, which I give here in the lower part of the slide, namely to check. Namely, to check whether alpha is one elementary in beta. What you should do is you should consider arbitrary finite subsets of alpha. So subsets X of alpha and finite subsets Y of beta that lie above alpha. So X is down here below alpha and Y is below alpha and beta. And then the requirement is that for any such set you can find another finite set Y tilde. Another finite set y tilde, which now lies below alpha, below the smaller ordinal alpha, and a function f which fixes these elements of x and sends the elements of y to y tilde. And this function should be an isomorphism for our language. So it should respect the usual inequality of ordinance and this one elementarity relation. So the connection is really that the existential witnesses that you have. Witnesses that you have in the larger structure are mapped down to existential witnesses in the smaller structure. And we will see an application of that a bit later. So you will see how that works concretely. Now, what I find really nice is that from this simple but ingenious idea, we get a characterization of probably the most famous. Of probably the most famous ordinal in ordinal analysis, namely the ordinal epsilon zero. So, in terms of ordinal arithmetic, this ordinal epsilon zero is usually defined as the minimal fixed point of exponentiation with Bayes omega. And because it's the minimal fixed point, all smaller ordinals can be generated as two. Can be generated as terms that involve this operation of ordinal arithmetic, or rather, involve function symbols that correspond to them. So you have a term zero, and then whenever you have already constructed terms alpha zero to alpha n, you can add another term that corresponds to something like a counter normal form. And now the founding result, I guess, of ordinal arithmetic due to Gehab Jensen. Arithmetic due to Jehab Gensen is that piano arithmetic has proof theoretic ordinal epsilon not. I don't want to explain in detail what this means, first of all, because many of you will be very familiar with this, but secondly, because it's not really the topic of my talk. And if people want to read more about proof theoretic ordinals and different general ways to define them, different applications, then this paper by Michael Rotten here. This survey paper by Michael Rotten here is one that I can highly recommend. Now, the amazing thing is that these patterns of resemblance by Timothy Carlson give a very simple characterization of this ordinal epsilon naught, namely epsilon naught is equal to the minimal ordinal alpha, which is sigma one elementary in any beta that is larger than alpha. Okay, so the next thing I want to point out is that these patterns of resemblance, once we enrich, once we sort of give us a bit more material to get started with, we reach much, much larger ordinance. So far beyond Epsilon naught, we have the proof theoretic ordinal of pi 11 comprehension, which is the strongest of the big five. Is the strongest of the big five axian systems that are commonly considered in reverse mathematics, and that much, much larger ordinal can be characterized by patterns of resemblance as well in two alternative ways, which have been worked out by Carlsman and Gunnar Wilkin. So, the first possibility is that you enrich the language a bit. So, you add a constant symbol zero and then A constant symbol zero, and then you add actually a relation symbol for ordinal arithmetic, for ordinal addition. And once you have that, you jump from that moderately small ordinal epsilon zero to this extremely large proof-theoretic ordinal pi 1-1 comprehension. And another way to jump to the same ordinal is that you don't add any ordinal operations to the language. Operations to the language, but you do add a second of these inequality symbols. And then simultaneously for i equals one and two, you say that alpha is i elementary beta. Well, if the structure over alpha is sigma i elementary in the largest structure over beta. And that also brings you up to this very large ordinal of pi one bond comprehension. And then there's a conjecture. And then there's a conjecture by Timothy Carlson, which says that extensions of that will lead to, well, extremely large ordinals, which are currently far beyond the reach of ordinal analysis. Namely, in one of his early papers, Carlson writes that the proof-theoretic ordinal of full second-order arithmetic can be given by extending this approach into here to arbitrary. To arbitrary natural numbers. Now, I don't really know what the state of that conjecture is. I think, in any case, we are very, very far from proving it. But at the same time, I think it's amazing that at least we have a way to describe a reasonable conjecture on the proof-theoretic order now, second-order arithmetic. So, that was my brief introduction to patterns of resemblance. To patterns of resemblance. And the next thing I want to do is give an introduction to the collapsing functions that were mentioned before. And I want to present this introduction by way of another characterization of that ordinal of psaldon zero that we have already encountered. So consider this transformation D here, which takes an ordinal alpha. takes an ordinal alpha as input and outputs the ordinal one plus alpha square and for each ordinal alpha i also want to define something that i call a support function and that takes any element of this value d of alpha and maps it back to a finite subset of alpha so this here stands for the finite power set so rather than So rather than explaining that abstractly, let me say what it does in this concrete case here. So in that order here, d of alpha equals one plus alpha squared, we have first of all the ordinal zero. And the ordinal zero is the unique ordinal that lies below that one here. So it comes from here. And now the question that we should ask is on which elements of alpha Is on which elements of alpha does this ordinance zero depend? And the answer is: it doesn't depend on any elements of alpha. It just comes from this first summon born here that I have added independently of alpha. And because it doesn't depend on anything from alpha, I say that it supports the empty set. And then further elements of this order here, they are pairs of ordinance below alpha. And I can write the And I can write these pairs in this way here. So the one is just the one that was already up here. And then the pair of beta and beta prime below alpha squared can be written in terms of ordinal arithmetic as alpha times beta plus beta prime. So this expression here is really just a pair of beta and beta prime. And now on which ordinals below alpha does this pair depend? Well, it depends on its two components. So it depends on beta. So it depends on beta and beta prime. Okay. And given this structure, I can look at collapsing functions that go from this ordinal d of alpha back into alpha. And here the first observation is that d of alpha equals one plus alpha square. This ordinance is always strictly larger than alpha. So as we have seen earlier, essentially So as we have seen earlier, essentially by the Raleigh-Forti paradox, there cannot be a strictly order-preserving function of d of alpha into alpha, simply because d of alpha is too large. And so the idea of these Bachmann-Howard collapsing functions is to define a function that is, well, almost order preserving, order preserving as often as we can hope, as we can achieve. So that's this first condition here. This first condition here. If gamma is smaller than delta in the domain of our collapsing function, then the collapsing value theta of gamma should be smaller than the collapsing value theta of delta. So that would just say that theta is water preserving. And now we cannot demand this all the time. So we need to add a side condition under which this holds. And the side condition is that the support of the smaller elements of the support of The smaller elements, so the support of the gamma is bounded by the collapsing value on the larger element, so the collapsing value of the delta. And here, maybe I should say that I identify this ordinal here with its set of predecessors. So what this inclusion really means is that any ordinal in the support of the smaller argument is bounded by the collapsing value on the larger ordinal. So that's the side condition. side condition and then the second condition is that everything in the support of gamma should be smaller than the collapsing value of gamma so this second condition here has in particular the effect that these collapsing functions cannot be trivial so for example i cannot just send everything to zero because then the second condition would be violated and now if this second condition holds then this means that well Holds, then this means that, well, the supports they tend to be smaller than the collapsing values. So that means that the side condition in one is going to be satisfied some of the time. But if it satisfies some of the time, then this collapsing function theta will be order preserving some of the time. But if it's order-preserving some of the time, then that means that these values that it assumes are really reasonably large. And if they are reasonably large, then this side condition. Then this side condition here will be satisfied even more often. So theta will be order-preserving even more often, and its values will become even larger, and that's some sort of self-strengthening process. Okay, so what do we get in this particular case? Well, we get another characterization of epsilon zero. So if d is this simple transformation of alpha into one plus alpha square, then epsilon zero can Psyodon zero can be characterized as the minimal ordinal alpha as such that such a Bachmann-Howard collapsing function of d of alpha into alpha exists. Okay, so now let me say something about collapsing functions more generally. So, this definition of Bachmann-Howard collapse here makes sense not only It makes sense not only for the specific D that we had on the previous slide, but it makes sense for much more general transformations D of ordinance. And it turns out that the condition that you need in order to really make sense of things is that D is a debater in the sense of jean given. So that means that D is a functor from ordinals to ordinals and that it preserves pullbacks and direct limits. And what I And what that means more concretely is if d preserves pullback and direct limits, this means precisely that I get these support functions that we had on the previous slide. So we get support functions which tell us that we can, in a sense, view the elements of d of alpha as terms, and which will depend on finitely many elements of alpha. But the technical details are not important here. So we don't really need it. They really need it latest in order to understand the rest of this talk. Okay, and now one result here, which is a few years old by now, and which I present here because it's the basis of newer things on patterns of resemblance, is a result that is formulated in the setting of reverse mathematics. So we are in the usual base theory RCA naught of reverse mathematics. Are seeing a lot of reverse mathematics, and we have an equivalence between two statements: namely, the principle of parval non-comprehension, which, as I said previously, is the strongest of the big five principles that are commonly considered in mathematics. And the statement that every delated D admits an order now, capital omega, that is so large that there is a Boffmann-Howard collapse of D of. Howard collapse of D of omega into omega. So, as I said, this result is more a preparation for the following than the main result of this talk. So I don't want to say too much more about it. But let me maybe say that at the center of the proof is really Gerhard Jäger's ordinal analysis of crypto plat accept theory. And then one idea is that you should relativize this ordinal analysis to a given. Ordinal analysis to a given delay to D in order to prove the existence of admissible sets, and that will prove pipelined comprehension. An abstract version of this classical ordinal analysis. Now, I want to get to a new result that relates pyro mod comprehension to patterns of resemblance. And the first thing here. And the first thing here is that we need to relativize these patterns that I have defined for a specific case before to arbitrary delators as well. In fact, we should not consider arbitrary delators, but delators that satisfy a certain normality condition. And I will say a word more about that a bit later. So if you have a delator that satisfies this condition, then any ordinal then any ordinal gamma below some value d of alpha of that dilator will have a unique representation of that form. So what does that mean? Well, you should think of this sigma here as something like a constructor symbol and of these gamma 0 to gamma n minus 1 as something like the arguments of that constructor symbol. So that's some sort of term and that sigma determines the Of term and that sigma determines the form of the term. And these ordinals are the arguments, in a sense, the constant symbols that appear in that term. Now, one nice thing is about delators is that these constructor symbols arise in a systematic way, namely the constructor symbols are closely related to the values of the delator on finite ordinance. And also, if Also, if that is being represented is below d of alpha, then the arguments will be below alpha. Now let me briefly say what this normality condition is. So on an extensional level, this normality condition ensures that the function from alpha to d of alpha is a normal function, in the usual sense, ordinal arithmetic. So that means that this function is continuous. So that means that this function is continuous at limit ordinance. But the related, but more obviously crucial point for us is that in general, this representation here of gamma can depend on the alpha. So gamma is below d of alpha, but it's also below d of beta for some beta that is, say, larger than alpha. And since that is the case, the gamma will have a representation. The gamma will have a representation without with respect to the alpha, and it will also have a representation with respect to some larger beta. And in general, these representations can be completely unrelated. But the normality condition ensures that the representation does not depend on the alpha. So the representation of gamma with respect to a bigger order nor beta will be exactly the same representation as the one with respect to alpha. And that turns out to be. Alpha, and that turns out to be convenient. Well, it's important in the context of patterns of resemblance because otherwise, certain things wouldn't make sense. Okay, so how do I relativize patterns of resemblance? Well, I extend the language. So let LD be the extension of this original language that we had in the context of patterns by an n plus oneary relation symbol for. Relation symbol for each such representation. n plus one means that it has n plus one arguments. So the arguments are these n arguments of the representation plus gamma is also an argument in that relation. And the only thing that is fixed and that determines the relation symbol is the sigma. And now you can define one elementary with respect to D. Elementary with respect to D in exactly the same way as before. So this holds between alpha and beta if the structure over beta with respect to that relation is sigma one elementary in the larger structure over beta with respect to that relation. And well, yeah, as I said, now with respect to this extended language L D that contains relation symbols for all constructors of the delator instead of just the original two relation symbols. To relation symbols. And now we have the following theorem, which proves a conjecture that was in this list, Open Questions in Reverse Mathematics, by Antonia Montaban. And the theorem says that once again, we have an equivalence between pi 11 comprehension and another statement. And the new equivalence statement here is for every normal delay to D. Every normal related D, there is an ordinal capital omega, which is one elementary with respect to this extended language in D of omega plus one. Should maybe briefly say something about the Bay theory. So this here is a set theoretic version of the theory ATR0 in second-order arithmetic, which is also one of the central systems considered in reverse mathematics. That in reverse mathematics. And this set theory here is due to Steve Simpson, and it's conservative over the usual system, ATL0 in reverse mathematics. And the reason why I work over the set theory here is simply because the definition that I gave of this notion of resemblance was set theoretic. So there are ways to Ways to access patterns of resemblance in terms of notations, which can then be treated over much weaker theories of arithmetic rather than set theory. But for this theorem here, I really wanted to rely on this beautiful and simple set-theoretic definition of that relation here. And that's why I chose some set theory as the frame. Okay, so in the rest of the talk, I want to sketch the proof. So the first part of the sketch goes towards resemblance. So what I want to do is I want to assume pi 11 comprehension, statement two, and I want to derive for a given d beta d that we can find an omega that has this property here. That has this property here. Now, parallel comprehension, our assumption tells us, at least over this set theory, that any set is contained in an admissible set. So in a model of crypto-partic set set theory. And I then choose my ordinal omega to be the height of that admissible set. So omega is an admissible ordinal. And I can choose it in such a way that it is closed under my. A way that it is closed under my delay to D. So that maybe sounds a bit technical, the message is just omega is some sufficiently large and sufficiently closed ordinal that I get if I have Qi Bon 1 comprehension. Okay, now consider any ordinal gamma that lies between d of omega and d of omega plus 1. And by consequence. And well, you can show that if it lies in that interval here, then its representation looks like this. So the point that I want to make here is that the last argument that appears in that representation of gamma is this ordinal capital omega. Okay, and now the idea is to define something that people from ordinal analysis may associate with. May associate with fundamental sequences of ordinals. Namely, to define gamma of theta, I take the same representation, but I replace this largest argument omega by the argument eta that is mentioned here. Now, in these representations, I don't know if I said that before, but it's a fact that these ordinary It's a fact that these ordinals in the representation, these arguments here, they should always be ordered, they should always be strictly increasing, in strictly increasing order. So that means that this here is only defined if the eta is strictly larger than all the previous arguments. And that's precisely this condition here. So I consider the previous arguments at one so that I'm strictly larger. I take the supremum of all this. I define the supremum as gamma star for later reference. As gamma star for later reference. And then this fundamental sequence here begins to make sense when eta is large or equal than gamma star. So once again, that's supposed to yield some sort of fundamental sequence. So in other words, it yields a sequence that approximates the given ordinal gamma from below in some systematic way. And now the idea. And now the idea is to form these sets here. So for each gamma as above, I form the set of all eta below omega so that first of all, eta is sufficiently large for this reference to the fundamental sequence to make sense. And then the crucial condition is that one. So eta is supposed to be sigma one elementary in the eta element of the fundamental. E tarth element of the fundamental sequence of gamma. Okay, so I define these sets here. And now the idea for this first direction here is that I can prove that all these sets here, they are club below my plus four ordinal omega. So club stands for closed and unbounded. So that's a very fundamental notion in set theory. And well, the point is that the omega is. Well, the point is that the omega is sufficiently large. So, usually you would consider club sets with respect to regular cardinals, I guess. But in fact, if omega is an admissible ordinal, then many of the familiar arguments can be pushed through. So, for example, if you have a diagonal intersection of sufficiently definable clock sets below inadmissible, then that diagonal intersection will still be clocked. And that's, for example, what you use in the limit case of that induction. In the limit case of that induction here. Okay, so you saw that they are club, and in particular, they are closed. So by the proof that they are closed, that they are closed, you learn that the upper bound omega on these elements here satisfies these conditions itself. Yeah, so this condition here in particular will still hold if you replace. Particular will still hold if you replace eta by the upper bound omega simply because these sets are closed. So this condition here, if you just copy it and replace eta by capital omega, then it becomes this condition here. So omega is sigma one elementary in gamma of omega. And now gamma of omega is nothing but gamma itself. If you look at this here, so gamma of eta, you replaced omega by eta. So if you Replaced omega by eta. So if you replace omega by omega, then nothing changes and you just get gamma itself. So now we know that capital omega is one elementary in gamma for any gamma below d of omega plus one. And then in some sense, by one last location of closure, you learn that capital omega is also one elementary in this upper bound d of omega plus one. And that's precisely what. Plus one, and that's precisely what we wanted, right? Omega should be one elementary in d of omega plus one. So that's in a sense the easier direction. And the next thing I want to do is I want to look at the maybe more surprising direction, which shows that if we can always find these omega for each deglacier, then we get pi11 comprehension. And for that, I want to use. And for that, I want to use the theorem that I had before. So, here we want to derive pipeline comprehension. And by the theorem before, we know that pipelines comprehension holds if any delayed D admits such a Bachmann-Howard collapsing function. Okay, so that's what we want to establish. We want to construct such a collapsing function given that we can. Given that we can find these large sigma one elementary ordinates. Now, the first thing to note is that these collapsing functions, they are not particularly interesting if D is normal. So in the context of the patterns, we needed normality, but for these collapsing functions, they are only very interested for non-normal relatives. So this D here will in general be non-normal, and in order to consider General being non-normal, and in order to consider patterns, we have to associate a normal dedata with it. So, this normal dilator that is constructed from B is defined as a sum over D and specifically it's given as the sum over one plus D of beta for all beta that are below the argument that we consider here. So, we sum up everything that comes before, and in that way. comes before and then that way we get something like a normal function. Okay, but ultimately we want to collapse values of this original delay here. So we have to embed this original delay into its normal version. And here it turns out that we have to increase the argument omega from omega plus one. So that can be seen here where that is the case. And specifically what we do to define xi To define ψ is embedding on some value alpha of d of omega, where we take all the previous sums up to omega. And then the last summon, it should come from 1 plus d of omega. And if alpha comes from d of omega, then we can take 1 plus alpha here as the last summant. So that's a bit technical, never mind. The message is just we have an arbitrary debate to D, we can make it normal, and we can find an embedding of the order that we are actually interested in. Of the order that we are actually interested in into the normal version. Okay, and now the question is: well, how do I define these columns and functions? Well, so the assumption that we have in our theorem is that we can find a large ordinal omega that is one elementary in this normal dilator sigma d on the argument omega plus one. Omega plus one. And now we want to define the collapse on some argument alpha that comes from this order here. So we can form the embedding of alpha into this larger order here. And then actually nothing changes when we look at this omega element of the fundamental sequence, but it will be important later to look at this sequence here. Look at this sequence here. So it's not hard to show that if omega is sigma one elementary in this larger order, then it's in particular sigma elementary in this thing here, which is smaller than the upper bound that we had before. And now the idea is that, so this relation here, it pertains between Pertains between two elements that are below this upper bound here. But if we have some relation below this upper bound here, then by this sigma one elementarity relation, we can collapse it down below this capital omega. So what that means is that we get an eta which is now smaller than omega, for which this relation does also hold. Relation does also hold, or in other words, for which eta is one elementary in psi of alpha, and then take the eta member of the fundamental sequence. Okay, so once again, from this here, we get this, and then this can be collapsed down below omega by sigma one elementarity, and this gives us an eta with this property. And then the definition of our collapsing function simply takes function simply takes the smallest eta that has this property. So maybe to say a bit more precisely how this eta arises. So previously in this characterization of sigma one elementarity, we had some set x and some set y, and the x should lie below the smaller element and the y should lie between the smaller and the larger element. And then the y could be collapsed down to And then the y could be collapsed down to some y tilde. And here, what you take is that for x, you take the support of alpha, and for y, you take these two things here, which are in the relation that you want to bring down. So, y consists of omega and xi of alpha omega. And then the y tilde, the omega is collapsed down to some eternal. And this larger element here is also collapsed down to something small. Also collapsed down to something small. And a priori, it's not clear, it's not guaranteed that this thing to which it is collapsed down is also of this form psi of alpha of eta. But that comes from the fact that we have all these new relation symbols in the language. So we have all these relation symbols associated with the letter D in the language, and that means that this type of structure is preserved as well. So that's the definition of the collapsing function. And then on the penultimate slide, I would like to sketch why this definition works. So what we need to show is if we have ordinals alpha smaller than beta in the order that we want to collapse, and if the support of alpha is contained in the collapsing value of the larger argument, then Argument, then the collapsing value theta of alpha will be smaller than theta of beta. That's what we need to show in order to verify that we have such a Batman outcome. Okay. Yeah, so assume that the support of alpha is contained in this collapsing value. And this here just recalls from the previous slide how the collapsing value is defined. So in particular, if we So, in particular, if we write eta for this collapsing value, then this relation holds just by definition. Eta is one elementary in the eta member of the fundamental sequence of psi of beta. But now, if alpha is strictly smaller than beta, then you can show by some monogenicity properties of these fundamental sequences that the eta member of the fundamental sequence of xi of alpha is also. Psi of alpha is also smaller than the corresponding member of ψ of beta. And so if this relation here holds between eta and the larger element, then it also holds between eta and the intermediate argument. But then just as before, if I have this sigma one and laminarity relation, then I can collapse this relation down to something that is below the eta. That is below the eta. So by sigma one linematarity, I will find some eta zero below eta that does also have these properties. So in this case, eta zero will be at least as big oxi of alpha star. And also eta zero will satisfy this here if we replace eta by eta zero. So eta zero will be sigma one elementary in the eta zero member of the fundamental signals. Of the fundamental sequence xi of alpha. So, in other words, eta zero will satisfy precisely these conditions here that define the collapse with alpha at the place of beta. And the collapse eta of alpha is the smallest eta zero that has this property. So it's certainly smaller or equal than this particular eta zero. And then it's strictly smaller than theta of beta because, well, it's strictly smaller than eta, and eta was defined as the collapse of beta. Columns of beta. Okay, so that was maybe a bit technical, but I wanted to show how this looks anyway. And just to give a more intuitive summary of what has happened. So the crucial property is that where we have some relation that involves this very large ordinal capital omega, and now by elementary. And now, by elementarity, we transfer this property to some ordinal that is below capital omega, and that will be our collapsing value. So, in other words, the collapsing values, they inherit certain closure properties from this very large admissible ordinal. And the closure properties that these collapsing values inherit are precisely those that guarantee this Bachmann-Howard property. This Bachmann-Howard property that guarantees that the order relation is preserved under a certain site condition. Okay, so now let me come to my last slide and summarize just in non-technical terms what we have seen. So we have started with a statement: alpha resembles some beta strictly larger than alpha, which would be paradoxical if we did replace. If we did replace resemblance by strict isomorphism. But by weakening this notion of resemblance, we have obtained statements which are not paradoxical, but they are still very strong. And we have looked at two particular manifestations of this idea, namely at this relation of one elementarity, which is due to Timothy Carlson and has the name patterns of. Carlson and has the name patterns of resemblance. And a second manifestation where these almost order-preserving collapsing functions of some larger beta into some smaller alpha. Now, it was already known before that these statements one and two are intimately linked. So resemblance and collapsing functions were known to be linked by work of Carlson and Gunnar Wilkin. But these links, they were were formulated in concrete specific cases which is great but also comes with let's say a lot of syntactical detail that is specific for these cases and what I hope to have shown is that this links become this link becomes particularly elegant if you lift these this connection to a more general This connection to a more general level. And lifting this to a more general level amounts to relativizing these statements to the latest. So maybe to say something still more general about this line of research. So ordinal analysis is traditionally concerned with very concrete things. Very concrete things, so very concrete notation systems for rather large ordinals and very concrete independence results. And these are extremely important. But I think that it's also nice to lift certain considerations to a more abstract framework because you will see certain uniformities that you That you maybe find harder to see if you look at the concrete cases. So, the hope is that by lifting this to an abstract framework, some things may become more uniform and more elegant. And one other thing that I would like to say is, so these properties like this one here, every delator has a Bachmann-Howard polypsing function. Or this one here, for every delator, you find a large every delater you find a large order now which is sigma one elementary in something larger um maybe you can see this um in some sense as computable counterparts of large cardinal maxims so we are not in the realm of the uncountable um in fact we are not even uh beyond uh we are not even in the realm of large countable ordinance beyond the church cleaning ordinal we are really in the realm of something very concrete and computable but Very concrete and computable, but still we have some properties that have a sort of general abstract feel to it, which I like to compare to large card in Laxkis. Okay, so if you want to see more details of these proofs, so if you want to remind yourselves to do precise definitions and statements, then here is an archive preprint that you will find all this. Thank you very much for your attention.
