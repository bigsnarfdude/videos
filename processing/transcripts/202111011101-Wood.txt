With these things. And most of what I'm talking about today is joint work with my PhD student, Robert Allen, Simon Lentner, and Christoph Schweigert, who are all in the audience or speaking. And yeah, most of this can be found under this archive number. And so the outline for today's talk is: since I believe I'm the Is since I believe I'm the first VOA talk of the conference, I thought it would be good of me to go over the tensor structures that arise from VOA theory since I don't know how general knowledge these are among non-VOA people. And then specifically, Corten de Valier structures, which exist for abstract tensor categories, but then I want to of course relate them back to VOAs. And then a lengthy worked example in terms of the free boson. In terms of the free boson. And so, what this Grotendig Verdier structure is intended to sort of replace or provide an alternative for is that often one would like tensor categories to be rigid. And so I'd like to quickly review what rigidity is. But it turns out that rigidity can be quite hard to establish. So let's recall what rigidity is in 18. Call what rigidity is in a tensor category. So, if we have some object U in our tensor category, then we need to find three things. We have to find another object, which we'll call the dual object U check and two morphisms. One is called evaluation, and this is a morphism from u check tensor u to the tensor unit. So, I'm using this diagrammatic notation where the tensor unit is normally omitted. Where the tensor unit is normally omitted, and you just have, or you have dotted lines to it, but I'm including it in case people are not so familiar with the notation. So, this is a narrow u-check tensor U to the tensor unit and co-evaluation, which is a morphism from the tensor unit to u check tensor U. And this triple needs to satisfy these straightening relations, which are drawn down here, which means you can compose evaluation. You can compose evaluation and co-evaluation to get a map. Again, just sort of ignore all the occurrences of the tensor unit. To get a map that goes from U to U. Basically, if you look at these pictures, you just compose these caps and cups. And this needs to be equal to the identity on U, or if you compose the other way around, it needs to be equal to the identity on U check. And so this is. And so this is very rigid in the sense that it is a property. So if you have such a triple, then it is unique if it exists. So if you find a different triple, then there'll be a unique isomorphism that relates the two. And yeah, and it turns out that for VOAs, for tensor categories in general, you can get a lot of mileage out of rigidity. Mileage out of rigidity, but because it's such a powerful property, it is actually quite hard to establish. So, there's few general results on rigidity in VOA theory. And so, I'd say that results on rigidity in VOA theory are rare. Probably the most famous result is Huang's proof of the Linderkelle conjecture, which states that rational theories, and I won't go into full details of what rational means, but basically it's VOAs. It's VOAs for which you have a natural choice of tensor category for the modules. And this module category is semi-simple and finite. Then you have that these tensor categories are actually modular tensor categories, MTCs. And then I was searching the literature. I probably have missed a few things, but the upshot of what I want to say is that there's just not that many results. So there was, I mean, of course. So there was, I mean, of course, Huang's work builds up on Moore and Seiberg from, I believe, the 80s or 90s. Then there was Huang's proof of the Wallinder conjecture. Then in 2013, Tsu Chia and I studied a family of theories called the 1,p triplet models. Of course, many other people studied them as well and still study them. But in particular, we showed that their sort of natural choice of module category is rigid. Module category is rigid. In 2016, I found a paper from Thomas, Shashank, Andy, and David, where they showed that simple currents for a VOA are always flat. Flatness is closely related to rigidity. I believe Miyamoto also has some work on flatness, but I'm not familiar enough with that to give a good citation. And then suddenly in 2020, there was a small explosion of activity. A small explosion of activity. Many of the results by Thomas, Robert, Shashak, and Jinwei, with other contributions from Suipa Jiang, Flora Oswunsika and David Riddell. We're basically for VeroZoro at suitable chosen central charges and suitably chosen module categories, you get something rigid with nice properties, various results for affine. Results for affine Lee super algebras, or the beta-gamma ghosts, which is work by Robert Ellen, my student and myself. So, for all of these, you can choose module categories which are rigid. And I would argue that part of the reason for the difficulty of showing rigidity in these situations is that the choice of module category is not necessarily obvious. So, up here, these first two examples. These first two examples. These VOAs are what are called C2Cofinite. And for C2cofinite module VOAs, there's a natural choice of module category, the category of C2cofinite modules. And these have nice structures. When you come to these other more general examples, you're kind of in a similar situation to the situation you are with Lie algebras, even if they're finite-dimensional Lie algebras. You might choose. You know, you might choose a category of finite dimensional modules over early algebra, you might choose category O, you might choose category of all modules. I mean, there's many choices, and it's not necessarily clear in advance what a good choice is. And you can definitely choose badly. And so I'd like to now recall the tensor structures that you get from VOA modules. There are many experts in the audience on this and some. On this, and some may well know more than me on it, but I would argue that at least some people in the audience aren't familiar with this. And so, almost all of what I'm going to say now about structures, tensor structures on VOA module calories, is from Wang Leposki Zhang, the eight-part series from 2013. But there's, of course, many nice reviews and expansions of that work that came later. So, if we have a triple of VOA modules, which I'll just call. Of VOA modules, which I'll just call V, the VOA. M1, 2, and 3, then a logarithmic intertwining operator of type, I'm never quite sure what to call this, M1 fused with M2 to M3, so it looks like a binomial thing, but yeah. This is a linear map from the complex tensor product of M1 with M2 to M3 valued formal powers. Valued formal power series in Z. And these are quite nasty formal power series. So you're allowed to have, so this curly brackets here around the Z mean you're allowed to have any complex powers of the form variable Z and polynomials in log Z, which is another form variable whose derivative is defined to be Z. And so these linear maps need to satisfy three properties in order to be intertwining operators. There's a Twiny operators. There's a lower truncation condition, which basically gives lower bounds on the powers of Z that can appear. But these lower bounds depend on the vectors M1 and M2 that you plug into the intertwining operator. They're not global lower bounds. Then there's a derivation property in terms of the ViraZoro L minus 1 generator. So taking the derivative of the intertwining operator is the same as plugging the L minus 1 operator into the first argument of the intertwining operator. Argument of the intertwining operator. And then the most important property is the Jacobi identity, which I'm not going to write out in its full details because it involves algebraic delta functions, which you're either familiar with and then you know it, or you're not familiar with, and then writing it out is not going to help. But morally, it says that if you have an action of your VOA on the module, you've got an action of the VOA on your modules one, two, and three. And so you can either have the action on. And so you can either have the action on M3, so that's on the image of whatever the intertwining operator sends you to, or you can have the action on the first argument, or you can have the action on the second argument, so M1 or M2. And these are all supposed to be the same. And so if we take a step back from this and think of VOAs as just commutative rings where some things have gone a bit weird, then this is essentially. Is essentially just the definition of a bilinear map, so a V-bilinear map. And if you've done anything with VOAs and their representation theory, you've actually implicitly already been working with intertwining operators. So the action YM of some VOA on the module M is a special case of an intertwining operator. It just also happens. So it goes from V tensor M to M because V acts on M and gives you. Because it V acts on M and gives you something in M. And it just has the additional condition of being normalized. So if you put the VOA vacuum vector into the intertwining operator, you get the identity operator on the module. But of course, in a general VOA module, there is no vacuum element, there isn't, you know, because it's not the VOA itself. And so this condition doesn't make sense. So generic intertwining operators have no natural, no canonical normal. Natural, no-canonical normalization. Okay, and so this gives us a notion of bilinear maps, which almost gets us to tensor products, but we now sort of continue this analogy of bilinear maps to get the notion of a tensor product. And so a tensor product of VOA modules, also called fusion, is defined as follows. You take M1 and M2 to be V modules, and then the tensor product is a pair, so consisting of a module, which we'll write. Consisting of a module which we'll write as m1 box times m2. So we use the box to distinguish it from the circle times which will normally be our complex number tensor product and a intertwining operator which I call u for universal because we're characterizing this three universal property and I'm parametrizing, I'm indexing it by the two modules that we are tensoring. So this u is an intertwining operator of An intertwining operator of type sorry, my zoom interface is now getting in my way. Of type M1 fused M2 to M1 box times M2. And we want this to satisfy a universal property, which is, so we've got the C tensor product of M1 times M2 takes us to M1 box times M2. 2 takes us to m1 box times m2 via u. But if we had now any other intertwining operator, any other intertwining operator to some module x, then there must exist a unique module morphism which makes this diagram commute. And so if you remember, if you recently teaching a course on linear algebra or so and introduced the tensor product there, this is exactly how the vector space tensor product works, right? You have your Space tensor product works, right? You have your tensor product vector space together with a universal bilinear map, which takes you from the two vector spaces originally to the tensor product space. And so, and you'll also remember from when you introduce this in your linear algebra lectures that this characterization of our universal property does not actually construct the tensor product. You then have to give a construction of the tensor product. Tensor product. And even more so than with vector spaces, the construction of tensor product BOA module tensor products is highly non-trivial. But HLZ in the many-part series provide a construction. It is conceptually clear, but very laborious to actually do in practice. And the way they do it is they actually construct its dual. Construct its dual. And we'll be talking about duals a little bit more in a moment. But if we've got duals, they basically turn around arrows. And so this dual that is constructed is actually characterized by maps into the module rather than maps out of it, as we have in this property here. And there's a nice review of this construction by Shashank and David from 2018, which I recommend you read if you want to actually construct by hand these tensor products. These tensor products. Right, and so this universal property, because it's a universal property, we can get quite a lot of mileage out of it and prove properties about categories of VOA modules. And this is all still due to Huang Lepovsky and Zhang. And so under some nice assumptions, we have the following theorem. We have the following theorem. So, if we take the category C to be a category of modules over our vertex operator algebra V, and at the very least we need V to be included in this category. We also need the tensor product of any two modules in this category to exist, so the universal property to have a solution. And then we also need for any triple of modules in this category, we need a family of Category: We need a family of morphisms which go between the two different bracketings that you have for the tensor product. But because everything is constructed from intertwining operators, and intertwining operators have a variable, this family of morphisms also has variables attached to it. And these variables can't be formal, they must actually be in certain domains of the complex numbers. But I don't want to get into the analytical properties of these. Analytical properties of these. But the important thing, what these maps do, is they map sort of the universal intertwining operators of the modules that are written here, sort of combined in one way that sort of corresponds to the domain up here to the universal intertwining operators corresponding to the codomain. And so in the parlance of HLZ, what is done. What has done what these maps allow you to do is they allow you to sort of replace products of intertwining operators with iterates. So, product of intertwining operators is if you compose them via sort of writing them like this. And the iterate is if you place one of the intertwining operators into the first argument of the other. That's the iterate. Okay, and if all of this is satisfied, then we have many nice properties. The first The first is that this kind of tensor product actually defines a functor, but to say that it is a functor, we have to say what it does to morphisms. So if you have morphisms from m1 to n1 and from n2 to m2 to n2, then you need to get a f box times g morphism, and that is just constructed from the universal property. So if we compose the universal intertwining operator for n1 and n2, intertwining operator for n1 and n2 with f tensor g, so we precompose with f tensor g, then this is an intertwining operator from m1 tensor m2 to the fusion product of n1 and n2. And so by the universal property that we have up here, we must be able to write this as some morphism times the universal into tiny map for m1 and m2. And this thing that we have to put here in front of it in order to This thing that we have to put here in front of it in order for this equality to hold, that is what we define to be f box times g. So, this uniquely characterizes how the functor must act on morphisms. Similarly, we can construct unit morphisms. So, the VOA will turn out to be the tensor unit. And this makes sense because, as we noted up here, the action of a The action of the VOA on a module is always an intertwining operator of type V tensor M to M. And so this looks just like a unit property. And the units are constructed essentially by this. But I mean, we have our universal intertwining operator that goes from V tensor M to M. And now the left unit morphism is characterized by the fact that it just applying that to it must give us the That to it must give us the action of the VOA on the module. And similarly, if we do it from the right, we still just use the action, but we twist it in a special way, which turns it into an intertwining operation of the right type. Then the associator you get from this family of maps that I mentioned up here by taking appropriate limits. And this is where some fiddly analysis comes in. Comes in to make sure that these limits are well defined. And if you're ever actually trying to prove that the Huang-Powski-Zhang series applies to your given choice of modular category of VOA, this is the hardest part. So showing that the associativity is well defined or that these associativity maps exist, this is where really all of the effort goes. And this is also where arguably much of the effort of HLZ goes in their work. So these three properties that we have here establish that the module category is in fact a tensor category. Because we've got the tensor product, we've got the associators, and we've got the unimorphisms. But it's a tensor category with additional structure. We can define a braiding, which flips modules, and it basically does what you've already seen here with the right unit morphisms. Morphisms. And so the braiding is characterized by the fact that if you apply it to the universal intertwining operator for M1 with M2, this is the same as the universal intertwining operator for M2 with M1 if you twist it with suffering exponential of L minus 1 and you multiply the form variable Z by e to the I pi. I've written out an e to the i pi here rather than minus 1 because we have fractional powers of z and so one must choose. Fractional powers of z and so on must choose branches of logarithm. And I've just chosen my branch for minus one to be e to the i pi. You can choose any other branch that you want. And so what this actually establishes, this braiding, is a sort of natural transformation between intertwining operators of type M1 fused M2 to M3 with M2 fused M1 to M3. Fuse M1 to M3. But we have more than this. The module categories are not just braided, they also have a twist, theta. And so depending on how abstract or concrete you are, a twist is a tensor equivalence from the identity functor to the functor given by the square or the braiding. Or if a bit more concrete equivalently, this means that the twist satisfies the following balancing property. The following balancing property. The twist on a tensor product of modules M1, M2 is the same as the double braiding of M1 with M2 composed with the twist on the M1 factor tensor, the M2 factor. So these are equivalent characterizations. And VOA theory gives us this twist automatically. It's just e to the 2πi Virozora L0 generator applied to a module. Yes, so we have the structure of a braided monoidal category, braided tensor category with a twist. And so now we might ask ourselves, where does rigidity come from in all this? I haven't mentioned rigidity at all in this. And so to get rigidity, we need some notion of duals. And so I want to talk about that next. So if we have a VOA module M together with an action of the VOA on it. Together with an action of the VOA on it, we can define what is called the contragradion module, which I'll always denote with a prime, so m prime, and y on m prime. And so as a vector space, m prime is just the graded dual space. So all linear maps from homogeneous components to the complex numbers. And you need to choose your grading so that... Your grading so that these components are finite-dimensional. So, normally one has the conformal grading, but conformal weight spaces might be infinite-dimensional depending on the VOA you're looking for. And then you need to refine the grading to make sure that these homogeneous spaces are finite dimensional. And then the action on this dual space is characterized by the following equations. So, for any linear functional phi in M prime, little m in m and little v in the voa. v in the VOA. You define the action on phi by just pulling it through a pairing and having the opposed field map acting on m. And the opposed field map is given by this formula. So you apply e to the z l1 minus z to the minus 2 exponentiated by l naught to v and you invert the formal variable put into the field map. And yeah, you just And yeah, you just have to sort of crunch through the definition of a module, and you'll see that this is again an action on the dual space. And if you've chosen your grading sensibly so that these homogeneous spaces are finite dimensional, then dualizing twice gives you back a module that's isomorphic because you're basically dualizing a finite dimensional vector space. You can canonically identify that. You can canonically identify that with itself again. And now you can take all this dualization of modules. You can actually generalize it to intertwining operators. And I won't write out the full definition because you just have to write it all out again. But basically, the VOA action is an intertwining operator of type V fused M to M, and so you now. M and so you now instead of taking something from V fused M to M you take M1 fused M2 to M3 and then you can just take the opposed intertwining operator and it satisfies exactly the same formula as here, just that the element V that you put into it is now from the module M1 rather than from the VOA. And this flips these two parts of your intertwining operator. Of your intertwining operator, so then it becomes an intertwining operator from M1 fused M3 dual to M2 dual. And because this is all well defined, you get a natural isomorphism from the M1 fused M2 to M3 intertwining space to the M1 fused M3 dual to M2 dual intertwining space. And then if you compose this appropriately with the braiding that we had in the last slide, Slide, you see that you can apply this all again back to actions, and you see that you got the action from V fused M to M, but this intertwining space is naturally isomorphic to M prime fused M to V prime. And so, oh, I forgot to add a very important part here. This gives a natural candidate for evaluation if the VOA is isomorphic to its dual. Oops, that now looks like an exclamation mark. And if we go back to the original, one of the earlier slides. Slides in these rational theories and Huang Fru for MTCs, one of the assumptions there is that the VOA is isomorphic to its dual. This is also true for the 1K triplet and many other cases that were considered. And so this is quite a common property, but VOAs need not satisfy this. So, for example, the This. So, for example, the beta-gamma VOA that my student Robin Dell and I worked with, the way we needed the VOA to be defined to get the right module category, it was not self-dual. And so the obvious sort of rigidity morphism would not have been, the obvious sort of evaluation map would not have been well defined. And And so, and another example of VOAs that also falls out of this, but where we still know there's nice things, is if we go to the P comma Q triplet, so not just the one, P triplet, but the P comma Q2, the P comma Q triplet, there the VOA is also not isomorphic to itself, very much not isomorphic to itself because it's not simple. isomorphic to itself because it's not simple and so its composition series is reversed. Yet we know that it is C2 cofinite and so it still has a nice tensor category in some sense but it's not yeah it's not dual to itself and but for that VOA we also know that the tensor product is not exact and so that category cannot be cannot be rigid and so it would be nice to be able to somehow handle this more general class of VOAs. This more general class of VOAs. And so this is where Grotten-Week Vidier duality comes in, and which is my next topic. So, Groton-Week Vidya categories. So, let C be a tensor category and K an object in C. Then K is dualizing if it satisfies two properties. The first is the functor, hom, where we tensor anything with y and take all the homs to k. To k we want this functor to be representable. I we want there to be for each y, we want there to be a dy. Oh, I should maybe written that like that. So for every y there must exist a dy such that we have this natural these natural identifications between these hom spaces. Identifications between these hom spaces. And so by the Joneta lemma, this defines a functor which assigns to y dy, which I'll also call d. And then in addition, we need that this contravariant functor characterized by one up here is an anti-equivalence. So it must be an invertible functor. If these two properties are satisfied, then C is called a Gorton-Dec Valdier category. And we call D the duality functor with respect to K. The duality functions with respect to k and we normally, or at least at least in this talk, I'll always denote Gorton-Diek-Valdeer categories as pairs of C with a dualizing object. And so why do we care about Gorton-Diek-Valdeer categories? Well, they satisfy many nice properties. I'll just highlight some. So this is citing work by Boyachenko and Drumfeld from 2011. So let C, K be a Gotten DVIDA category. idea category. Then here are four nice things that I personally like. If u is an invertible object in C, then you can construct more invertible objects by either taking d applied to u, this is isomorphic to k tensor u inverse, or we can apply d inverse to u, which is isomorphic to u inverse tensor k. So at the moment, we're not assuming that the category is braided. So that's why we're distinguishing. So that's why we're just distinguishing the two different orderings. Then these two new objects defined in this way are also dualizing. And so what we get out of this is one consequence of that is that the dual of the tensor unit is the dualizing object. So that's how they're linked. But Um but um we do not assume sorry assumes interfering with my thing yeah we do not assume um that the dualizing object is isomorphic to the tensor unit then from one we can we can define a functor from invertible objects to either k tensor u inverse or u inverse tensor k and these functors define these ways either actually anti-equivalents between the subcategory of Equivalence between the subcategory of invertibles and the subcategory of dualizing objects. And you can sort of think of this basically as the dualizing objects are a kind of torsor over the invertible objects. Then, very important from if you think of VOAs as leading naturally to CFTs, if you want to do boundary and bulk CFT. Boundary and bulk CFT in sort of the style of the Hamburg school, then it's crucial that internal homs exist because these basically encode boundary algebras. And Gorton-DeFaldier categories give you internal homs for free. There's an explicit formula. So the internal hom from x to y is just d of x tensor d inverse. Oh, it should be a y, not a z. Why? And if in addition, so here we have not, for the first three points, we have not assumed that the category C is braided or has a twist or anything like that. But if it is braided and has a twist theta, then we can use D. Then we can use d to find a new twist basically by conjugating the twist by d and this is also a twist. You just work, you just go through the crank through the definition of a twist and you see that this is true. And then a ribbon Gorton-Deek Valier category is a braided Gorton-Deek Valier category such that the twist is invariant under this application of the dualizing functor. Of the dualizing functor. And so the dualizing functor defines an involution on twists, and for each fixed point of this involution on twists, we have a ribbon called DVADA category. Okay, and so really it's point three is the reason that I'm excited about Corton Deval DA categories in the context of Categories in the context of VOAs. And so I've now introduced Gorton DeFadier categories, and you may or may not be impressed with this, but this is, of course, only useful if we can relate this to the VOAs. And this is the connection, I guess, and the greatest level of generality is due to Robert Allen, Simon Lendner, Christophweger, and myself from this year. But there were hints that this was true in earlier work, and I'll. Was true in earlier work, and I'll talk a little bit about that in a moment. So, if we have V, VOA, and C, a category of VOA modules where the HLZ theory, as I presented it before, applies, which in addition is closed undertaking contragradience. Then the dual of V is a dualizing object, and the twist that I mentioned previously is invariant under. Invariant under the dualizing functor. And so this defines a ribbon called DVLT category. And while I'm currently attributing this to us, I mean, really, HLZ did all of the legwork and for us then using their work, the proof was so simple of this particular property that I can actually give it on the rest of the slide. We know from what I've already talked about. From what I've already talked about, that we have different identifications of these intertwiner spaces, which are basically correspond to natural isomorphisms of certain hom spaces. So if x, y, and z are objects, then we can identify x fused y with y to z with x fused with z prime to y. And so that means we have a natural isomorphism of x tensor y to z. So hom from x tensor y. Z so hom from x tends to y to z with hom from x tends to z prime to y. So all you need to do now is set z equal to the dual of the VOA. And then you have a natural transformation from hom x tensor y to v prime to hom x tensor v prime prime to y prime. So we've just done this step here. What you do is you flip the second argument of the tensor product with the product with the codomain of the HOM space and apply duals to everything. So the V gets an extra dual, it becomes a prime prime, and the Y gets a single prime. But then as I said, dualizing twice is naturally identifiable with not dualizing at all. And so this is identifiable with x tensor v goes to y prime, but of course x tensor v can be identified with x through the right. Be identified with x through the right unit morphisms, and so this is just hom x to y. And if we go back to the definition of a Gorten Dec Verde category, that was exactly this property here. And so the first property is satisfied. And now we need the functor that sort of comes with this to be invertible. Well, the functor that comes with this is exactly the taking contragradents. Taking contragradents. And as we've mentioned previously, taking the contragradi twice just gives you back the same module. So this is an auto equivalence. And then we also said that the sort of obvious choice of twist is invariant under the dualizing functor. And this follows from the fact that if you work out the formula for the opposed map of the L0 operator, it just gives you back the L0 operator. gives you back the L0 operator and then you're basically it's just a property of transposes of linear maps on vector spaces and you just get that it satisfies this invariance property and so that's the proof that VOA module categories with fairly benign assumptions are just what you need to get HLZ theory to work which can take quite a bit of effort to establish. Take quite a bit of effort to establish. And the fact that there is closure under contragredients is enough to have Gordon Dec Valdier structure. But HLZ, in their series of papers, gives some sufficient conditions in order to establish the structures that they need. And these sufficient conditions generally include closure under contragredients. So you're not really adding anything, any strong assumption that sort of deviates by what's done in this paper series. In this paper series. And I mentioned that aspects of this structure were, I don't know, shadows of Gorton Digdau's structure were seen in the past. By that, I mean there's a paper by, I think, Thomas, Shashank and Robert on gluing vertex algebras, where they had VOAs that were self-dual, but they then from that, they got a formulae for From that, they got a formulae for Enner Homs, which are basically the specialization, well, which are just this formula. And this formula for Enner Homs, in a paper with Ingo Runkel and Matthias Gabaldila and myself for my PhD thesis, we found this in the triplet algebra, the one, the two, three triplet algebra. And so this is a structure that was lurking in the shadows for a while, and it's nice to see that it's actually really general. Really general, but right, and so now this has all perhaps been very abstract. So let's make it, let's go to the other extreme and become really concrete and just work out all of the structures that I've mentioned in the example of the free boson. And I personally like the free boson because no matter how much I work with it, I always find little bits and pieces that I hadn't thought of before. That I hadn't thought of before. I feel the Fibroson is much richer than people might give it credit. And so here I'm mostly following Dong and Lepowski's book, but maybe with slightly different notation here and there. But they did, when that book is, large parts of that book are dedicated to the free boson. And so that's a good place to learn about many of the VOA structures related to free bosons, as opposed to the theoretical physics. As opposed to the theoretical physics literature. So, our input data are a finite-dimensional real vector space fractal H, a symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form on H. Note that we are not assuming that it is positive definite. This deviates a bit from what Dung and Lipowski do, but it doesn't add much. Then we pick a discrete subgroup. pick a discrete subgroup lambda in H such that the bilinear form restricted to lambda is even and integral or integral uneven. Note that we are not assuming that the bilinear form restricted to lambda is non-degenerate or that lambda is non-zero. And I should actually also add Or that the lattice is full rank. So I'm not assuming that it spans the entire vector space H. We're deviating in this from standard assumptions in the literature because of later work that we'd like to do. Basically, when you construct field field realizations. When you construct field field realizations of various interesting VOAs and do kernel of screening type constructions, you occasionally want your lattice that you're working with to have these properties. And then as a final datum, we have a distinguished element xi in what I call lambda star, which is a slightly weird version of a dual of a lattice. It's now not just the standard algebraic dual, it's sort of dual in H. So it's all very H. So it's all vectors in H which pair integrally with all of lambda. So this pairing with lambda might of course have a kernel. So there might be some elements in fractal H that just pair trivially with everything in the lattice and they would be included in this dual. So this is standard, this is larger than what would be sort of the standard dual that you got if you just extended lambda. Lambda by scalars to like the rationals, and then took the dual within that. So, this is bigger than that. And then we have some extra sort of auxiliary things that we need in order to construct the things I want later. One is a set theoretic section S, so a set theoretic map from the quotient group lambda star mod lambda to lambda star. So, this map must, it just picks a representative of each coset. It just picks a representative of each coset in this quotient group, and we normalize it so that the trivial coset gives us the zero element in lambda star. And then we need another auxiliary map whose name I've accidentally erased, K, which takes two cosets and maps them to the representative of the sum of the two cosets minus the representatives of the individual cosets. Minus the representatives of the individual cosets. So, what this auxiliary map does is it measures the failure of S to be a group holomorphism. And then we also need what's called a normalized two-cocycle epsilon with skew minus one. I haven't given my domains here. domains here alpha comma beta in lambda and I'm not going to write out what the default what the precise definition of such a normalized two cocycle is just all you need to know here is it's a map from lambda cross lambda to the non-zero complex numbers and our precise choice of all these maps doesn't matter because all choices are Because all choices are co-homologous. So, some things that we'll do later will depend on the precise choice, but they won't depend on it in an important way. And so then you can construct a nice Gotten Deep Idea category of modules from a lattice view away from all of these things in the following steps. So, the first thing that you need to do is So the first thing that you need to do is you complexify this real vector space H and interpret that as a trivial Lie algebra. And then you affinize this trivial Lie algebra. This gives you the Heisenberg Lie algebra and the rank of this, it's called the dimension of the vector space is the rank of the Heisenberg-Lie algebra. And so, since this is a trivial Li algebra, it's technically a reductive Lie algebra, and so the standard affinization procedure applies. And you've probably seen this before. So, for any two vectors in H, when you affinize it, these vectors get extra indices by the integers. And then their Lie bracket is zero unless the two indices add up to zero. And if the indices add up to zero, And if the indices add up to zero, then you just get this formula for it. So you pair the two vectors, you multiply by the index of the first entry into your Lie bracket, and this becomes a coefficient of proportionality on a central element. And you always take the central element to act as one on your modules, which is why I've just called it one here. And then where you have Heisenberg algebras, you have Fox spaces. In particular, you have the Fox space. Of the Fox space on which all of the elements with mode zero index act as zero. That's called the weight zero Fox space. And this can be turned into a vertex algebra by asserting that the sort of minus one descendant of the highest weight vector of the Fox space is assigned this field here, where alpha is any vector in your vector space H. And then once you've sort of established And then, once you sort of establish this map and you then just go through the definitions and properties of a VOA, like normal ordering and operator product expansions and everything, you see that this satisfies, basically you go through the strong reconstruction theorem. You see this satisfies the definition of a vertex algebra. And in particular, any basis of H will form a set of strong generators for this vertex algebra. So I've said vertex algebra, not vertex operator algebra. So I distinguish the two by a vertex operator algebra having A vertex operator algebra having a conformal structure, so a Verazzoro vector, a conformal vector whose field expansion gives you the Verazzoro generators. And so for any element of the vector space H, you can define such a conformal vector through the formula that is here. So you pick a basis, alpha I, and alpha i star will be the dual basis. And so you just take this, what basically looks like a drip quitter. This is what basically looks like a quadratic casimir, and then you add the minus two mode of gamma applied to the highest weight vector to this thing. And then you use the field map that was characterized up here. And then you can verify that this thing satisfies the property of a conformal vector and its field is a conformal field and it satisfies the required OPE of a conformal field. And you can compute what the central charge of the resulting Vira-Zora algebra is. Of the resulting Virasora algebras, and it gives you this formula here. So it will be the dimension of the vector space minus 12 times the norm of gamma, so the pairing of gamma with itself. And then any Fox space you wish becomes a module over the vertex operator algebra defined in this way. And you can work out what the conformal weight of the highest weight vector is for such a Fox space. And it's just given by this formal. And it's just given by this formula here. So we have a Fox space for any element in the vector space H. And so this Fox space, actually, maybe see how it's characterized. So it's characterized by the fact that for all... Sorry, Simon, can I ask this thing? Of course. I missed this dual basis. Do you now assume that the pairing is non-degenerate? I missed that. I assume that the pairing is non-degenerate on the full vector space H. Oh, I see. Space H. Oh, I see. So the alphas are not a basis of lambda. Lambda has not appeared here at all yet. Oh, I see. I see. So I see. So it's non-degenerate on all of H. I see. Yes, but not necessarily on the lattice lambda. Very good. Thank you. Yeah, so I do have some non-degeneracy. So yeah, here, so the Fox space weight is defined in the following way. We have that So it's just the zero modes of any vector coming from the space H act by pairing with alpha. That's how the weights of the fox spaces are defined. And so for any element of this vector space, again, we have a fox space. And these fox space are all simple. Space. And these Fox space are all simple as modules over this vertex algebra, and they're also mutually non-isomorphic. Okay, this gives us just the Heisenberg VOA, and we can look at its modules a little bit, and with some work, one can compute dimensions of intertwining operators, dimensions of intertwining spaces. And basically, they are only non-zero if the weights add. So if you want to fuse if mu. If you want to fuse f mu with f nu to f rho, you can only do this non-trivially if rho is equal to mu plus nu. And there's actually a sort of a candidate intertwining operator coming from the physics literature where they're called vertex operators. And since these vector spaces are all one-dimensional, this basically gives us a basis for all of them. And you can characterize these intertwining. You can characterize these intertwining operators by just saying that the tensor product of the highest weight vectors maps to something whose leading term is again the highest weight vector and then some higher order terms. And in order for the intertwining operator axioms to be satisfied, the Z powers that appear must satisfy these properties. So if you've got weights mu and nu of the Fox spaces, the leading power of Z must be Power of z must be z to the mu paired with mu. And you can then take the collection of all these fox spaces and sort of sum them together when if you take the weights along the lattice and you give a VOA structure on what was called a lattice VOA. And so on F naught, you just have the same VOA structure that was on the previous slide. And away from F naught, you use the Away from F naught, you use these intertwining operators to define your field map. But basically, in order for the VOA axioms to be satisfied, you need locality and you need the state field correspondence and a few other properties. This forces you to include these two cycles epsilon that I had a few slides back. And if you choose epsilon, I mean, the requirement is you have exactly every UA structure if epsilon is. structure if epsilon is a two cocycle with skew that I gave there. And if you choose two different, if you choose two cohomologous two cocycles, you get equivalent VOAs and all choices are co-homologous. So there really is only one VOA structure you can put on this. And then you choose as the conformal vector one that we took from the formula that we had here, but you're a little bit restricted in terms of the vector gamma that you're allowed to use. terms of the vector gamma that you're allowed to use, you have to take a vector in the dual of lambda. This guarantees that the VOA as a whole is conformally graded. So we've now seen the lattice appear as a datum. We have the vector space H that was in there the whole time, the bilinear form, and now also this distinguished vector chi. So these are all four data have now appeared. Data have now appeared. And so we now, once we have this lattice varway, we want we want modules. And so we can construct lattice fox spaces. So here we essentially constructed the lattice fox space corresponding to the trivial coset of lambda star mod lambda. And so for all other cosets, we can also construct lattice fox spaces where we now pick, we use our section S to pick some representative for each coset, and then we just go. Coset, and then we just go along the entire coset. So we sum up all Fox spaces supported in the same coset. And the field map, the action of the VOA on this is again built from intertwining operators. I'm not going to give the formula. And it turns out that these are all simple modules over the lattice VOA defined here. And then with all of this information prepared, you can prove the following. You can prove the following. So, most of this is just a direct, either directly done in Dong and Lepowski or a fairly obvious generalization of it. But now, because we're not considering positive definite bilinear forms and we're not assuming that the lattice itself is non-degenerate, you have to generalize some things. And a lot of work has been done there with Teuton Juevski, Li and Wang, Thomas Shashi. Thomas, Shashank, Andy, and David did a lot of work on when they considered simple currents and flatness conditions of modules. And then, of course, Robert, Simon, Christophe, and myself, when we were working through the Corton devaluer stuff and wanted a nice worked example, we added a few things ourselves. And many people have worked on Free Boson, so I'm sure I've missed much of the literature. Anyway, we let Anyway, we let's take our collection of data and VM will be the category of generalized lattice VOA modules which are graded by lambda dual, which are finitely generated, where this real vector space H acts semi-simple. We just take the zero modes of elements in here and we require their eigenvalues to be real. Be real, and we require all positive Heisenberg modes to act locally nilpotently. So, this is how we define our module category. Then the HLZ theory applies. And so this category is a braided monoidal category with a twist. And in addition, it is actually ribbon Gautenik Verdier because it is closed under Closed under contragredients. Simon, sorry to interrupt you, but I have to make you aware of the time. Okay, I have three minutes left, and I only have one more real slide. And so, sorry, yep, thank you, Christophe. So I'll speed it up a little bit. So the fusion product is just the addition on the Heisenberg weights, and you can write out explicit formulae for the intertwining operators. Operators. The braiding has an explicit formula in terms of the representatives of cosets. The associativity has explicit formula in terms of the representative cosets, the auxiliary map K, and the two co-cycles. So this is all Dong-Lipolsky. And then we can form the contragradient duals and we can work out what it is. And so we get as dualizing object, we get two times, so the Fox space corresponds. get two times so the fox space corresponding to two times this distinguished vector and the uh twist map we can also work out from um from the just the formula for for the action of the Vera-Zaro algebra on these Fox spaces and so yeah so that's that's a worked example of all of these data coming together in the example of the free boson with slightly more general assumptions than one normally makes in the literature and so since Literature. And so, since I was told to wrap up, this is it. It's the end. Okay, thank you very much. And let's thank Simon for this nice talk. So let me. Christian, I think you have a lot of noise in your background. Okay, so since Simon went a bit over time, 10 minutes over time, so let's still have the time for a few quick questions. Yeah, I was wondering. Yeah, I was wondering. So, with the GV categories, one of the problems is that the tensor functors are not exact, just write exact. Do you know if there happens to be any condition that's say weaker than rigidity where you would get exactness? We don't know it yet. I mean, of course, refining the methods further is Methods further is, of course, the next goal. I mean, we know this can't be easy because even in the case of C2cofinite VOAs, the WPQ triplet is a counterexample to exactness. It would be interesting. I mean, a potential condition, I mean, is stuff that you've worked on, right? Where if the VOA is self-dual, that might. Dual that might lead in that direction with some other.
