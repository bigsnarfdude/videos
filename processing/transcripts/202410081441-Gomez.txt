describing the pinning model and just the formal asymptotics of it, just so we all kind of know how that model goes. It's a really kind of nice idea for getting pinning. And then I'll give a pretty brief outline of the proof and I'll conclude with just kind of summarizing some of what I've talked about and then discussing some possible directions for future research for the PDE people in the room. So the wave pinning So, the wavepinning model aims to address this problem of cell polarization. So, you have a spherically symmetric cell, for example, and you want to somehow establish a sense of polarity through, for example, chemicals. This establishment of cell polarity is important for morphological changes that follow it, but it can also be an important precursor for cell motility. So, that's something that Alia Kesha did a lot of work on. And so in 2008, there was interest in trying to develop a minimal model for cell polarity. So, if you think about what goes into establishing cell polarity, there's going to be some really complicated biochemical networks with lots of different proteins and calciums probably in there somehow. But in 2008, Maury, Jilkin, and Keshet introduced this minimal model, which basically tries to describe wave pinning as arising due to two key principles. So, one of them is having mass conservation. So, one of them is having mass conservation of some kind of proteins, and the second one is having some kind of bicepility in the reaction kinetics. So, here's a picture from an experimental paper where I can't remember exactly what they're talking about here, it's like the PAR2 proteins, but there's an establishment of polarity on the membrane of a cell. And then these two pictures are from simulations in this paper by Kusadu and Keshet and others in 2018, where they're trying to simulate this kind of pulse, which Trying to simulate this kind of pulse, which originates in a small region, and then it grows, and then it stops growing, and then it just stays, sticks around. So, using formal asymptotics, we can describe when this front stops, and this is the mechanism of weight pinning. So, what does the system look like? In a general setting, it'll look like a system of two reaction diffusion equations in some domain omega. You have some active state U, so that's what the concentration is describing, or that's what U here is describing. Is describing, or that's what you here is describing, is the concentration of some active species. And so in the original model, they were describing these GTPases, and they had an active and inactive state. And the active state was a membrane-bound state, and the inactive state was supposed to be this bulk-bound state. So you have the other concentration, which is for the inactive species. And then you have bistable reaction kinetics, which are describing how active states shuttle between, or how the protein shuttle between an active state and an inactive state. And so one of the important things to note. And so, one of the important things to note from this equation: we have numbered boundary conditions. So, if you integrate it out, you have mass conservation. And what ends up happening is that there's this combination of the bi-stability of the reaction kinetics and the overall mass conservation, which lead to front propagation and then halting. The front propagation is perhaps not surprising if you just considered the first equation. You have a bi-stable reaction diffusion equation, so you would expect there to be some kind of front that moves. Some kind of front that moves. The interesting thing with the wave pinning model is that the bicepility depends on the second parameter v, and that also changes with time and it can suddenly halt the front from propagating further. So the original work of Yochiro Chilkinikesha was posed on a 1D domain, but since then, this idea has been extended to a wide variety of scenarios. I'll just briefly mention a few. So people have considered multi-component systems where you have more than these two reaction diffusion equations. Others, authors have considered. Other authors have considered actually modeling explicitly the shuttling between a bulk and membrane bound state, and this fits into this category of bulk surface coupled rapture and fusion systems. And then others have also considered incorporating mechanical feedback in these models. And in all these cases, typically the type of analysis that's done is a linear type of stability analysis and then also some formal asymptotics and then numerical simulations. And so one of the things that we hoped to do was to actually do To do was to actually kind of come up with some rigorous results to justify these asymptotics and numerics. So, for the remainder of the talk, I'll briefly describe the asymptotics, what wave pinning is and how it arises, some nice ways to think about it, and then some of the recent progress that we did on rigorously justifying these formal asymptotics. So, we simplified our problem a little more. We assumed that the inactive state is well mixed. So, we have a high diffusivity of the inactive state. If you go back to the original PDE, If you go back to the original PDE, that means that you go roughly like a spatial constant, which just depends on time. But then you have mass conservation, so you can actually come up with an explicit expression for the inactive state in terms of the original total amount of U and V, which we're going to treat as a parameter. The first assumption for the model to exhibit wavepinning is we want these traveling fronts to appear. So we need the bi stability for this function f of uv. And so we assume there's this range of v values, v bin. There's this range of v values, v min and v max, in which the nonlinearity is bistable in u. The bistable zeros, which I call h minus and h plus, these are the stable zeros, as well as the unstable zero, h0, they all depend on b, right? So it's a parameter that's always sticking around. And the stability with respect just to the reaction kinetics just poses some conditions on the derivatives of the reaction kinetics with respect to u. But we also have to assume that we want the front to have. We want the front to have like one of the states here, the other state here. We don't want the other state to be destabilized in the spatial problem, so you also have to assume these spatially homogeneous states are also linearly stable. So this is a stronger constraint than this in that we have to have stability with respect to spatial sort of basic law. Okay, so the next thing we have is we have an initial condition which is a bang bang type. So we assume that u originally looks like h plus in some region omega naught. some region omega naught, and it looks like h minus in some in the complement of that region. Okay, so chi here is the indicator function. And v naught we specify as a parameter which has to satisfy the mass constraint equation. Okay, so m0 is something that's fixed. We assume omega naught is also fixed. And then this becomes an algebraic equation for the initial value of the natural state V0. And we can solve that explicitly, or not explicitly, but we have a unique solution here. The way the asymptotics go is you describe basically the evolution of the activated patch. So that's what we're going to call omega hat. And here we're describing it as a set that's growing. So the front itself is moving, the interface of the active state is moving at some speed alpha. And so here we're saying that the evolution of this domain is described by a front that's moving with the speed alpha. With the speed alpha, and so the active state is wherever this distance is less than the integral of the speed. So, here the distance is the sine distance. When you're inside of the active state, it's negative. When you're outside, it's a positive quantity. So, you have to solve this evolution equation. You can rewrite this as an ODE if you want, if you want to talk about the normal speed for the interface. And it has to be coupled to this algebraic equation, which is again the mass constraint equation. So, numerically, there's a little bit of work, but it's So, numerically, there's a little bit of work, but it's not too bad to actually simulate these things, especially in simple geometries like disks. The front speed arises from zooming in on the interface, and on the interface you want to find a heteroclinic solution. So you have this heteroclinic problem, and so the front speed comes in as the unique value alpha here, which allows you to have this heteroclinic connecting H plus and H minus. Okay, the asymptotic solution then is a step function in the active state. A step function in the active state. So you have the indicator function now on omega hat, and you're going to be equal to h plus of v hat in the active region and h minus of v hat in the inactive region, and then this thing will expand out. Okay, so for wave pinning to occur, you also have to have some assumptions on how the speed depends on v. So we need to have some value of v, the inactive concentration, or the total inactive species for which the speed banishes. Species for which the speed vanishes. We also have this assumption on the nonlinearity. It has to be an increasing function in B. But what we really need is this alpha to be non-decreasing in B. So there's three key things that then allow us to see that wavepinning can occur. First of all, you can see that the rate of change of the inactive state is negatively proportional to the normal speed of the interface. So H plus minus H minus is some positive quantity. Minus H minus is some positive quantity. One can show this thing here is positive based on the stability of the steady states. You have a negative here, and then alphas up here. So it's negatively proportional to the active state's interface speed, which means that as the interface grows, V should decrease. The second thing this follows from this condition on F is that the speed is non-decreasing in V hat. One could instead drop assumption 3 and use assumption 2. Something too. And then the final thing is there's this mass constraint that's going on, right? And the mass constraint is effectively saying that the volume of the active region and the total amount of inactive chemical has to be on the contours of this function here. In this function, you can calculate its gradient and you can sketch out what the contour looks like. So here, this dashed line corresponds to Vc, the critical value at which the speed vanishes. The speed is negative to the left of the dashed line. The speed is negative to the left of the dashed line, to the right of the dashed line, and to the left of the dashed line it's going to be positive from its perspective for some reason. Okay, so alpha is positive here, negative here. So if alpha is positive here, that means that you're moving up along the contours, right? So alpha is positive here, the domain grows, but B decreases, whereas down here, the domain shrinks, but B increases. And so then there's three different scenarios you can have based on your. You can have based on which contour you're on, which comes from mass conservation, as well as your initial size of the domain and your initial total amount of inactive chemical. For example, you can have the domain just shrink to zero in finite time, you can have it take over the entire domain in finite time, or you can get this wave pinning phenomena where you follow this contour and your domain gets fixed to some fixed size, which is not this full domain. So here's a numerical simulation. So here's a numerical simulation. The dashed line is the interface predicted by the asymptotics. Blue means u is h minus, red means u is h plus. And you simulate this thing. In this case, it happened to be a shrinking domain. So it shrinks. And we see that the asymptotics are good here, but they're actually kind of bad out here. And so some of the rigorous stuff that we did suggests that this scaling should look like epsilon to the one-half, and we'll see that in the end of the talk as well. Okay, so our goal is. Okay, so our goal is loosely related to wavepinning specifically. Wave pinning gives us bounds on V, which is helpful, but what we really want to show is that the true solution U and V is close to this predicted by the asymptotics. So we have the three assumptions from earlier, which are the ones required for wave thinning to occur and for this to be this traveling print. And then we had to incorporate this third assumption, which is a Lipschitz constraint, on the functions H. Constraint on the functions h plus and minus. So this is a technical assumption that we made, and it comes up in the last part of the proof. But this is something that hopefully can be loosened in the future. In addition, we assumed that we had well-prepared initial conditions. So we had these bang-bang type conditions where you have an active state and an inactive state, and it's basically a step function. Okay, so this is the main theorem we came up with. The name is just to distinguish it from another one in this presentation. From another one inside in this presentation. Name isn't important here. But the theorem basically says if you give me some time t, then you can always find an epsilon so that for any gamma between 0 and 1 half, you can get within order epsilon to the gamma when you're looking at the inactive solution. So it's going to be within order epsilon to the gamma of the asymptotics. And then there's a more complicated one for the active state because it has a spatial component. And so we can get within order epsilon. We can get within order epsilon to the gamma of the prediction from the asymptotics in a region which isn't the full domain from the asymptotics, but it's shrunk a little bit by an amount that's order epsilon to the gamma as well. So a picture I think is a better way to maybe describe this. The solid line here is the prediction from the asymptotics. That's the front from the asymptotic solution. And so we have to move inward a little bit by an order epsilon to the gamma amount, and inside of order epsilon to the gamma amount and inside of here we can make an order epsilon to the gamma estimate and outside of there moving out from the front by an order epsilon to the gamma amount we can make an estimate there as well. So the non-local theorem is basically proved in two parts. The first part is we prove an analogous theorem for a scalar PDE. So here we assume that V of t is some prescribed function with some constraints. So it doesn't depend non-locally on U. So, it doesn't depend non-locally on you. And then we basically compare the non-local, the full PDE, to this scalar PDE in some restricted time interval. And then we were able to show that that time interval could be extended all the way to 0 to capital T. So this is the scalar counterpart. And so the main feature again is we replace V with something that's fixed. It's some C1 function in this case, and it's bounded. And you can apply the exact same kind of asymptotics to derive. kind of asymptotics to derive a very similar asymptotic approximation to this system. It'll again be this front that moves at a speed prescribed by the heteroclinic equation. And so we have a similar type of estimate for the scalar PDE, where again, we're coming up with an estimate for u tilde epsilon saying it's close to the asymptotics within a region that's not quite the asymptotic region, but something that you perturb a little bit to go inside. And so the idea for solving this was to use basically a comparison principle. So we come up with sub-solutions on balls that grow with the same speed as these front from the asymptotics. It's not going to be the exact speed. We have some little epsilons of room in there, which allow you to kind of come up with appropriate estimates. So these balls are going to be growing. And then the idea is then to consider multiple growing balls in that. To consider multiple growing balls in that original activated region, and that'll give you a bound in the full activated asymptotic region, or something that contains it. So the way we construct these sub-solutions on each of these balls is by utilizing the heteroclinic solution at the front. So we again see this Q function here with the speed alpha, except we perturb the nonlinearity a little bit with this parameter A. This parameter A. The important thing to note here is that when A is positive, right, you have a bistable thing. When A is positive, you shift it upward, so you're going to decrease the stable zeros of that bistability. And that gives us some room in the estimates later on. And then we construct this sub-solution, which basically looks like the solution to this, where the argument is some rescaled cutoff function. But this is what the sub-solution looks like. Looks like. Row one here is describing the location of the front from the asymptotics. And so we see that inside of that growing ball, it basically looks like something that's just a little bit less than H plus. And outside of the ball, it's something that's less than H minus. And this is going to allow us to get this lower bound to have an appropriate sub-solution. So you have some estimates on the heteroclinic solution, which you can then use to show that this phi x0. To show that this phi x0 rho naught is a subsolution for any x0, which is a position in the domain, and rho naught, which is the original radius. And then you can also bound the initial condition by this phi of x0 rho naught. And here we're using the assumptions on a well-prepared initial condition. So after that, you can get an estimate basically on that growing ball for all future times. And then we can also come up with global bounds on U. On you using these spatially constant sub- and super solutions. And then the idea is to have all these balls that are growing, and you take the union over them, and then you have to show that those unions basically cover the expanding front from the asymptotics with a little bit of room. And so, using this, we can then show that first estimate, and you can prove the same thing for the second estimate using super solutions instead of subsolutions. I have a little bit of time left. I have a little bit of time left, but the way we prove the non-local theorem is we restrict our time domain. So we restrict our time domain to those values of t for which the asymptotic or the true solution d epsilon is close enough to the asymptotic d epsilon. Based on that, we can then compare our true solutions to the solutions to these two scalar equations. Okay, so we can bound, we can use u plus as a super solution and u minus as a super solution. As a super solution and u minus as a subsolution. And then using that, we can then use the results from the scalar PDE to come up with estimates in distinct regions and basically come up with an upper bound on the difference of V epsilon and V hat to show that that constrained time interval can actually be extended all the way to T. So the main point where this technical assumption on theta comes in is when we're looking at this difference, you come up with this quantity here, and you basically Quantity here, and you basically need this thing to be small enough so that you keep extending this time t epsilon all the way to t. And that proves the theorem. So in conclusion, we can get within order epsilon to the gamma of the true solution for any gamma between 0 and 1 half. And I mentioned that this seems to possibly be a tight bound. In the case of a contracting front, you end up developing these cusps. And so when you're looking at numerics, you can look at the fronts in a wide The fronts in a Y cross section and in an X cross section. And so in the Y cross section, we get grid agreement throughout, right? That would be the bottom one. So the orange line is the true solution, the dashed line is the asymptotics, rather the dashed, orange line is the asymptotics, the blue line is the true solution. So you get good agreement throughout, but then on the X cross section, you end up developing this error. And if you plot this error, one of the things that you see is for small values of the timed, Small values of the time, when you're looking at the asymptotics and the numerics, you roughly have order epsilon error if you look at the slope of this. But then as time increases, on that specific cross-section, your slope decreases and it looks to be tending towards something like epsilon to the 1 half. And so some of the reasons why this might be happening is that over longer periods of time, V is going to a constant. So you end up having a bistable reaction diffusion equation, which will exhibit mean curvature flow over life. Mean curvature flow over longer time periods. And so we think that's one of the things that's causing this kind of error as well. But as far as the estimates for V hat and omega hat, those seems to be within order epsilon for all times. So the other kind of, one of the other open problems is to actually do front generation for this type of system. Here we had some issues with trying to come up with locating the initial front in order to construct these sub-solutions. And then also lifting this technical constraint is something that. Lifting this technical constraint is something that I think would be good for future work as well. And so, here's some references. This is the paper where we have this proof. It's in the Journal of Mathematy. This is the original paper by Yotiro from 2008. Here it referenced Adrian's recent book as well. Thank you. Thank you, Ben. Others have questions for Ben? Are the costs specific to this problem or do you see that like Alan CAD or over this table? I think you're gonna see it whenever you have something contracting. But even for Alan Khan, I believe you end up, you would get a cusp if you're just describing the motion of the interface. But with Alan Khan, you could also, I mean, you know that it ends up becoming like some kind of mean curvature flow, so you could incorporate that. But if you just look at the leading order asymptotics for how that front should Asymptotics for how that front should contract, you would see a cusp. I mean, the polarity here is for what purpose, for the cell to move? So, in some cases, it would be for the cell to move. I mean, this is all the acting stuff, the network inside the bypass of that. So, this model was basically, I mean, they've used, I know some of Leah and some of her colleagues have used this kind of model. Colleagues have used this kind of model as one of the ingredients in a more complicated model for cell motility, where they'll use this polarity switching or this polarity formation based on external signals. But it's only one small part of a more comprehensive model. Enjoy your early slides. I think you had some convergence rates for omega hat. Um this one maybe? Uh no, earlier. Like the contour plot? Yeah, yeah, right. So so maybe I missed this one. Why is this happening in finite time? So the growth here and here, I mean that's maybe, I maybe, I probably shouldn't say finite time because here boundary effects will probably roll you're Will probably, your asymptotics are probably going to start to fail when your domain gets too small. So, yeah, maybe I shouldn't say finite time. Maybe I should say starts to shrink. Numerically, you do see them vanish. Yeah. All right, so yeah, thank you very much for the reader meeting that we're needing.  I really would like to have some mathematical basic situations.  They want to get a bigger part. So they're saying now. I guess the artist might do a little down to the end of the day. If you model service, that change colour. There are other things that I think are speed. How far is the dish all time? And so the same thing happens with regard to here's an area of occupation and then some external factor can even cause some contraction to happen. And you can move that information collapse down to something. And that actually lasts the time actually. Not the collapse, but the environment itself or I mean that the environment has changed in change, but the environment is still there, so that people might have something. Then you are asking the one lawyer. That's also an interesting idea. We haven't been looking at that. I think in this paper, we've increased looks like it's changed as a domain with the same. But the maximum of what we send that was most of the package. Most of the stuff. Also, like the WIPP and all the optional or 2008. But it's usually in the context of like self-belief, so like self-signaling or someone building. I was actually hoping to kind of hear from people about possible biological analogs as well. But I'm not familiar. I can't think of that same kind of model that we can use in the logical setting. Questions for the future. I believe we just write the first part.  Okay, yeah, David has done coffee. Um, so actually, it's very tight. Before you start I'm just starting this in this faculty position, and uh I don't have enough that'd be the point for some equal connections. Um I'd be I'd be very happy to have any response to things.
