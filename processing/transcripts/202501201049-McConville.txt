Combinatories and topology of the lattice of wide subcategories. Okay, yeah, thank you to the organizers for inviting me out here. So I'm going to present a problem about wide subcategories. In case this is something that's new to you, I would say don't worry too much about that. I think there are many points of entry to this question, which is why I have a minute to thought about it here. The project was basically inspired by this paper that came out by Edley Barnard and Eric. Came out by Emily Barnhardt and Eric Hansen. One of their theorems from this paper is to say that if you have an associative algebra that satisfies some finiteness condition and its representation directed, then this is off the bottom. Okay, so maybe we can do it. Okay, good. I was hoping we're gonna have to guess what I wrote in some of these slides. Yes, I want to show that this post-head is post-head is called Eel Shovel. called EL shellable. So this is, so I'll talk a little bit, there's a lot of words here that you don't recognize. Let me just start with an example of this. So if we take an example of a representation directed algebra, if we take the path algebra of a directed quiver from 1 to n, in this case, the poset of widespread categories is just known to be isomorphic to the lattice of non-crossing partitions of the numbers 1 up to n plus 1. It's a well-studied lattice that people probably know about. Here's the example when n equals Probably know about here's the example when n equals 4. This will have some non-crossing partitions. So, this is all of the partitions, the numbers 1 through 4, except the one case where you have a crossing is if I split it into two blocks, 1, 3, and 2, 4, then you can say that these two blocks cross. I want to avoid that example. So, this example, of course, is already known to be EL shellable, and you can think of their result as a generalization to a much wider class of functions. Class of functions. What you get from EL shellabilities, define it here, but what you get from this is a topological consequence is that the order complex of the proper part of this process, I'll talk about those things in a minute, is a shellable complex. And so as a consequence of that, you can say the topology of this complex is it's a wedge of spheres of various dimensions. In fact, if it's also graded, as it is going to be in these examples, and it is. Be in these examples, and is in this theorem, then this is also a pure complex, and all these spheres will be spheres in the top dimension. The rank of p minus 2. Okay, so this is the kind of motivation that I had for proposing this. So, I'm going to talk about a different approach to this theorem that goes through what are called quotient posets. So, I'm going to talk about poset topology through quotient posets as part of one, and then part of one. As part one, and then part two, we'll get into defining these representation theory terms and see basically what kind of postets I'd like to apply this to. Okay, so first of all, what is a quotient poset? So if I have just a partially ordered set, some relation, and I can take an equivalence relation on this poset, I can consider the set of equivalence classes, modulo of this relation. This is typically not going to be a postet when I do this sort of. Postet when I do this sort of natural relation that you define on these equivalent classes, namely, you say that the class of x is less than the class of y if there's some representatives of those classes for which the relation holds. So if I have some x prime equivalent to x, y prime equivalent to y, which x prime is less than y prime. That's just a relation. This is always reflexive, but not necessarily symmetric or transitive. So this slide shows a simple example. You can see We can see this can fail to be a post set in general. So, for example, if I take this fence post set, so this is just kind of up-down post-set on numbers one through four. Here are two different ways to say group together elements that will fail to make this a postset. So, the first example, I'll take two and three together, the middle two elements, one and four together. This, when I take the quotients of this and just take the induced relation, I'm going to get relations going in both directions. So this will fail. Going in both directions. So this will fail to be symmetric. The one way it can fail also can fail to be transitive. If I group together elements this way, let's say I split the one and four into two different classes, then we get one is less than the class of two and three, and the class of two and three is less than four, but you don't get the population extended between the two of them. Okay, so generally quotient posets, or generally quotients of possets are not going to be posets, so we want to look at what are good poset quotients, or what sort of conditions. Quotients, so what sort of conditions can I apply to theta to ensure that this will actually define a partially ordered set? For this, there are many different variations on this that are nicely encapsulated in the survey article by N. Williams, a different N. Williams, actually. So, yeah, so the one in particular that I'm going to look at called upper regular congruence is, I'm going to say that theta is upper. I'm going to say that theta is upper regular if I have this sort of picture. So I have a relation between x and y, and then something x prime which is in the class of x, but I need to have also something in the class of y, that will be greater than this, what I think. So if I have x less than or equal to y and x prime equivalent to x, then I need to have a y prime, which is in the class of y, that's greater than equal to x prime. So that's what we call upper regular. Of course, lower regular. Call upper regular, of course, lower regular, you can just dualize this condition to define what that is, but I'm only going to talk about upper regular anyway. Okay, and this type of congruence was something that was studied a lot in this paper by Hallam and Sagan, Joshua Lock, and Bruce Sagan. They showed that if you have a poset which satisfies some finiteness condition, Condition. So it only needs chain finite if this is sufficient. And if theta is upper regular, okay, actually chain finite maybe means something else. I just want, so there's no infinite chains. That's what the condition I want here. And if you have an upper regular congruence, then this actually does form posit. So it will not fall under the traps of anti-symmetry and transitivity that we had before. Finiteness is really the condition that's. Really, the condition that's going to be used for anti-symmetry, you could potentially replace it with some other condition that will ensure anti-symmetry instead. But a counterexample, if you have, say, just the infinite chain postets, like the natural numbers under the usual partial order, you can think of grouping all the odds together and all the evens together, and that would be an upper regular congruence that is, of course, not going to be a posite when I do the conclusion. So we do need some kind of finiteness to do this in general. Do this in general. We're also going to care about another condition, so upper regular is kind of the main one, but I'll also look at rank homogeneity. So to define this, we say a postet is graded, of course, if you can decompose it into these graded pieces, P0 through Pn, let's say, so that every maximal chain has to contain exactly one element from each of the graded components. So the picture goes as follows. So the picture goes as follows. But I have a maximal chain C has to touch each of these created pieces. And we'll say that theta is rank homogeneous if it has the property that all of the equivalence classes are going to be at the same rank. Okay, let's look at an example of this. So there's an example that I put in the notes, right, that you can look at. This is a slightly different example that also. At this is a slightly different example that also will involve forests. So, I'm going to look at the postet of all NBC forests. Actually, yeah, the one I had before was regulations. Okay, so this one's different. This is what we call NBC forests. So, what I mean by that, so you just take a forest on the numbers 1 through n. Okay, so I have some collection of edges, which are acyclic. And I'm going to order them by inclusion of edge sets. So, this is a little bit different than. Sets. So this is a little bit different than some other versions of this you might have seen before because we do just ordinary inclusion of edge sets. Kind of the simplest order structure I could think of on these. What makes it NBC, so no broken circuits are allowed, is that you want to avoid pictures like this. So if I have this thing called a broken circuit, so if I have i and k together, and j and k, that's just not allowed. You can't have that particular configuration if i is less than j less than k. Okay, and then on these, and we see And then on these NBC configurations, unless the I and J are also, yeah, so I also want to avoid that case as well. Thank you for the question. Yeah, so if I have two forests with the same supporting partition, I'll say that they are equivalent to each other under some relation data. So, and this equivalence relation doesn't care about the underlying tree structure. So, here's two examples. So here's two examples of NBC forests, F1 and F2, that will need to be equivalent because they induce the same partition of the numbers 1 through 5, same supports on their tree components. Okay, and then the claim is that this is upper, regular, and rank homogeneous. This is actually the sort of main example in the Laman-Sagan paper where they initiated the study of these. Oh, yeah, question. Are you allowed to have like IJK, but not the IKN? So it is a forest, so you're not allowed to have a cycle in there? Yeah, but if you have I to J and J to K. Yes, you are allowed to have that. And you can have I to J and I to K, that's also allowed. Yes. The other two sort of choices of two of the three edges are fine. Okay. All right. Okay, another way to think about these, maybe before I move on. Another way to think about these, maybe before I move on, you can also think of these as like increasing trees. So I can think of kind of at each of the tree components rooting them at the smallest node, and then all of the sort of nodes going down below that have to go increasing from there. This NBC is just sort of a kind of indication that this maybe has a matroid handler as well. Maybe this is obvious, but the quotient is the usual partition lattice, I assume. Yes, alright, yeah. Got to mention that. I forgot to mention that, and that'll actually show up later. So, thank you for the questions. Yeah, so we can also throw in the quotient posite will, in fact, be the induced order that you get on the quotient is the partition lattice. Okay. So, next we're going to look at a Mobius function identity. I realized I didn't actually define Mobius functions in here explicitly, although we'll be moving past Mobius functions fairly quickly. Fairly quickly. So, yeah, we're most using this as motivation for the next thing. So, there's this theorem that Josh and Bruce proved in this paper, where they were looking at these post-set quotients. And they said that, okay, so if I have a post-set which satisfies some kind of finiteness condition, locally finite just means that intervals are finite, so we can define the mobile function. And if it's a grade, And if it's a graded postet with a minimum element, so I'm going to go out with the minimum element with zero hat. If there's a top element, we'll denote with one hat. In this case, we only need a minimum element. If I have a congruence, which is upper regular and rank homogeneous, and it satisfies some extra condition, this is some sort of vanishing condition that I want on the sum of certain obius values. Then, under those hypotheses, we get this identity. Okay, we can say that the noobius function. Can say that the Mobius function value on the quotient coset is equal to a sum of Mobius function values on the original coset before we did this quotient. Okay, cool. So, oh, yeah. We all right, so I wanted to kind of give a topological interpretation for this. There's a sort of general philosophy in post-etopology that if you have an idea. Philosophy in Post-Topology: that if you have an identity involving Mobius functions, whatever that is, it should come from some kind of homotopy equivalence of spaces. Or it should be somehow, maybe not directly come from that, but it should be sort of tied to that in some way. And so for this, the main way to get a space from a postet is to take what's called the order complex. Take the abstract simplicial complex, whose spaces are chains of the postet. And under, you know, so then Hall's theorem states that Mobius invariance of the entire poset, if it's a bounded poset, is just equal to the reduced Euler characteristic of this space, at least if I take the proper part of the space where I remove the top and bottom elements. And reduced Euler characteristic is a homotopy invariant. So that means that if I have some kind of homotopy equivalence between two spaces, that gives me an equation of these Euler characteristics. Of these other characteristics. Okay, so if we think about it in those terms, we want to sort of reinterpret this as saying that if we have some conditions, you have some kind of maybe topological condition here, instead of a Hovius function condition, that we should get some homotopy equivalence between these spaces, and that this should fall out as just taking other characteristics of these spaces. Okay, this looks an awful lot like this thing called Quillen's fiber lemma, which is a very Called Quillen's Feiber Lemma, which is a very widely used result in posset topology. It basically says if I have an order-preserving map, so a map that preserves the order of relation between two posets, if I have some kind of contractability condition on certain fibers of this map, then that holds for some kind of technical condition. Then we actually get one of these so much equivalences. Yeah. Do you want the map of? Do you want the map to be surjective? Because otherwise it seems like Q could have some stuff that's not hidden. Yeah, so I think that falls out actually of this, because I'm not saying F inverse of just Q, of just X itself, but the whole order ideal under X. Yeah, but if Q had stuff that was above the image of P, like yeah, so in that case, In that case, right, so okay, so if Q has some elements that are sort of too high in a sense, then this will usually turn into some kind of trivial condition where actually delta P is just a contractible complex anyway, and they both end up being contractible. If I add a top element, for example, to this postet. Okay, I'm a fair way. Yeah. Actually, you don't need to assume surjectivity. The standard way to prove this is you embed. The standard way to improve this is you embed both of these postets into a larger post set, and so it's called the mapping cone of the post set. And then you can do like a deformation retract to each of these sub-posette kind of arguments. So they are homotopy equivalent to this larger space, and so they're homotopy equivalent to each other. You don't know all the positive topology of that. It's not too big of a deal. We're going to change topics a little bit. But yeah, so the problem is that this actually doesn't translate correctly. So for many years, actually, after I saw this theorem, I thought, oh, well, this is just equivalence fiber lemma. You just apply this directly and you get this result. The problem is that the desired equivalence, your homotope equivalence I wanted is just not the one that seems to pop out of the vanilla equivalence fibrillema. And so we changed it. Or I changed it, I guess. Okay, so this is a slightly more complicated lemma now that we have to introduce here. Also, the result is going to be a little bit strange. So, first of all, it uses a construction called a suspension. So, the suspension of a post set is just defined to be: I take my post-set and I add two extra maximal elements to it. So, two elements that are above everything in the post-set, but are incomparable. Everything in the bow set that are incomparable to each other. In terms of the topology of the order complex, this just looks like the suspension of the original order complex. We can also define a wedge sum of two possets. What we do is we take the disjoint union of the two posets and then just have them match up at some minimal elements. So that they, you know, if they're both connected posets initially, when I do the wedge sum, it still stays connected, but they're sort of, you know. But they're sort of, you know, don't really interact with each other otherwise. So it does from the point of view of just the postet, raw post-set itself, but from the topology point of view, it doesn't really matter. If we only look at order complex that's a collection of chains, the set of chains that you get doesn't matter which minimal elements you'll link together. Yeah, thanks for the question. Okay, so here's an alternate. So here's an alternate version of the Quillen fiber lemma. I'm going to take two cosets where I have some extra restrictions. So I'm going to assume that P is bounded below, so it has a zero hat, Q is fully bounded, has a top and bottom element to it. And we have an order-preserving map between them where these conditions hold. So first of all, I want the bottom element of Q to go to the bottom element of P. I'm actually going to sort of remove these when we're looking at a home with. Remove these when we're looking at homotopy types. So, sort of want these irrelevant elements to match up with each other. The top element of Q should be an anti-chain. There's actually a condition that showed up in the Halam Sagan, sort of one version of their theorem. And then the last thing, we need to replace this Mobius function condition from before, some of the Mobius values, with some kind of topological condition. Here, what I'm going to say is that if I take this fiber and I remove the bottom element, And I remove the bottom element. The bottom element would be a cone point for the order complex, so I want to get rid of that. And I'm going to assume that this is intractable for all x not equal to 0 hat of q, of course, with 0 hat, then you'd get an empty poset, and so this would not be contractible. But yeah, all the other cases, I want these to be contractible. And then it induces a homotopy equivalence of spaces. Yeah. I can't read what you're summing over there at the very bottom is the x. Over there at the very bottom is the x and y? Oh, yeah, sorry, this is very small x and f inverse of one hat sub q. So this is all of the elements that under the function f would go to the maximum elements. That's fair. There is a very strange thing about this homosepic equivalence, which is that I'm taking suspension of both sides. In terms of homology, suspension, all it does is just shift homology by one degree. So if only I cared about the homology, I could just drop that from both sides. About the homology, I could just drop that from both sides of the equation. But in terms of homotopy, I'm not sure if I can get rid of these things. Actually, it's sort of unclear to me. Okay, and in the notes, there's the proof of this as well. So if you want to see a proof, I'm not going to do it here, but does the post-edge suspension functor have an adjoint? And adjoints, so you want to take a loop of a post-edge or something? Yeah, like I want to push the topology back then. I'm not sure actually what that would be. Yeah, so in pure topology land, this should be some kind of loop space, right? But I don't know what that would be in terms of pussets. Yeah, but ideally, I could get rid of the suspension by some kind of construction like this. I'm not sure if that exists. Can you think in what the bars are? Oh, yeah. So, bar. Yes, so bar, right, thank you. Yeah, bar means I want to take proper part. So this is, so proper part, I just mean get rid of the minimum element and the maximum element if you have it. The problem with these minimum and maximum elements, of course, is that they make everything contractible because they become code points to the order complex. And so you can just suck everything down to one of those points. So if I want to, you know, interesting statements about the polology, I need to get printed on these functions. For this suspension of the proper part of Q, basically we say that the bottom element now is kind of the second top element, right? So instead of being smaller than everybody, it is bigger than everybody, but the... Yeah, so right, so you kind of remove the top elements, but then you, or maybe say you duplicate it, if you will. Yeah, I guess that would be a way to think about that. Combination of those operations. Probably good just to think about an example of this would be if I have, so in topology, if I have a sphere, let's say at dimension n, then the suspension would always be a sphere one dimension higher. And basically, all the examples here are going to be spheres or wedges of spheres. So if you just know that one example, that's fully general for this. All right. As a corollary to this, if I have a If I have a locally finite poset with zero hat and I have one of these congruences, which is rank homogeneous and upper regular, then you can say that the natural map from p to p mod theta, so the x goes to the equivalence class of x, will satisfy the conditions of this viral lemma. And the contractability hypothesis basically just turns into I want certain sub-posets of the posets, so everything under something in the equivalence. Everything under something in the equivalence class of X after you remove the bottom element from P, this should be contractible for all X. Okay, and then you get this homotopy equals. So this is sort of the alternate version of the Fiber lemma that I want to employ for the participation theory. Yeah, so I put explicitly this question: why not drop a signal from both sides? I actually don't know the answer to this if you have some special knowledge of. You have some special knowledge of plus an topology that maybe you can save me. You can kind of figure out how to get rid of that. Back to the example of MBC forests. So it's already been remarked that, yeah, the quotient of p by theta is isomorphic to just the full partition lattice. The theorem says then that this is something equivalent to a wedge of the subposets of P over the maximum elements, the non- The MVC trees, so these are the sort of maximal forests of this coset. And it's just known that there are n minus 1 factorial MVC trees on right hand. So this is determining the topology of the space, at least, modulo the suspension on both sides. Okay. So then we get into section one and a half. I think, in the interest of time, I'm going to just abbreviate this section. I'm going to just abbreviate this section a little bit. So, the point is that I want to apply this in a lattice theory context. So, if I'm, so yeah, so what kind of instances of this equivalence relation do I actually want to look at? So, the setup is I have a semi-distributive lattice. In that case, then I have some kind of edge labeling by general irreducibles. So, if this is a familiar story to you, we'll just sort of move quickly. Um we'll just sort of move quickly through this. Uh the example of the Tamari lattice is here. I have three joint irreducibles. That gives me some edge labeling on the covers of this lattice. And then we can define this thing called the core label order, which is just certain, so I take certain intervals in this, they're called cores of elements of this lattice, and we order the core label sets of the sets of labels that I see in that interval just by inclusion. This alternate positive called the core label order. And this, in particular, includes: say, if I take the Tamario lattice, this is a semi-distributive lattice, and its core label order is actually isomorphic to some non-crossing partitions. And then there was this paper by Henri Milo, where he looked at these core label orders in general. So if I have a semi-distributive lattice, what can I say about core-label order? And what sort of questions you can ask about this? And I think a lot of these questions maybe don't have great answers to it. Have great answers to it. Some of the questions do have good answers to it. But so, yeah, you might have some fundamental questions: is this lattice? Is it bounded? Is it graded? So, these profits works with it. Is it shellable? And maybe question N you might get to is, is this a proper regular rank-egenous quote from the face post of a shellable ballistic system? High blameless. So, that's a question that I'm interested in. And I have some ideas of things. There's an example. There's an example. Okay, everyone sees? Yeah, boom. Okay, great. All right, now we get to part two: representation theory. So, yeah, the actual open problem is about this. So, let's say I take, yeah, because I want to get to wide subcategories. So, let's say we have an associative algebra. I'm always going to deal with what are called basic associative algebra of finite dimension over a field. The basic condition when I'm working over a field just means that if I take the algebra modulo, this. means that if I take the algebra modulo, this ideal radical, that this should be isomorphic as an algebra isomorphism to just a k to the n, where the algebra on the right-hand side, to make that an algebra, I just do component-wise multiplication. So the simplest kind of operation I could do on that field. Now, actually, to construct examples, and the example that I'm going to show is we're going to start with a quiver, so just a directed graph, and we'll take Just a directed graph, and we'll take the path algebra, so the algebra of paths where a patient is just joining paths together. Modulo, perhaps an ideal of some kind. So the example that I'll use is I'll have a directed three cycle. In this case, I want to mod out by the ideal is just all two paths. So any path length two, we're just going to set to zero. And so the only paths that survive are just the lazy paths that just are set at a single vertex or just a single arrow. A single vertex or just a single arrows. So it's a six-dimensional algebra. If I do this quotient, this algebra has three simple modules corresponding to the vertices of the quiver. And it has three other indexposable modules, which are all either projected or both projective and injective. And the way that we can specify these modules usually is just with this composition series. So just say, like, at the bottom, we put At the bottom, we put a simple submodule at the bottom. At the top, we have a simple module that fits above it in the composition series. So if I take the quotient modulo, the simple on the bottom, then you get the top. Okay. So just, yeah, take that for granted. That's how that example works. Now I want to define two things. So we need wise categories and tau tilting in order to get this map. I want to investigate. To get this map, I want to investigate. So, very just briefly about tau tilting. So, this without really any context about this. So, definition of tau tilting, if I have a module, I say it's called tau rigid. If on from m to tau m is equal to zero, tau here is defined as the outside radium translate, which we're going to see an example of that on the next slide, but I didn't want to define it carefully here. So, it's just basically some way of transforming some. So, it's just basically some way of transforming some module into some other module. Okay, so we can define tau-rigid modules by some vanishing HOM condition. And tau-tilting modules then are tau-rigid, which are sort of maximal in size. So I need to have as many possible non-isomorphic indecomposable sum n's. This number of n here of sum ants is actually equal to this number of vertices in my quarter, sorry, or the dimension of this lamp. Of this lambda radical. And then we can form the tau-tilting complex as an abstract literal complex whose vertices are the tau-rigid indecomposable modules, and then faces just correspond to different indecoms we can fit together to form tau-rigid, large tau-rigid modules. So the maximal faces here are going to be tau-tilted models. So in the example, so this Gaussian or in translates, just one way to calculate it is I can take Just one way to calculate it is: I can take a projective presentation. So let's say I start with a simple S1, then I can take the projective cover of it, label P1, that has some kernel, which then has a projective cover P2. And then I can apply what's called the Nakayama functor to turn the projectives into injectives. This is an equivalence of categories between projectives and injectives. And if I do that, then I just want to take this map and take the kernel of that. This map and take the kernel of that, and that'll give me what we call the L Central Strength. Okay, so S1 goes to S2, S2 then goes to S3, S3 goes to S1, so we get this nice cycle. And everything else, all the other three indicos, will actually just be killed by tau. Okay, and then some calculation that I'll suppress here. We can find the tau-tilting complex basically by saying, what are all the tau-rigid modules that can form from these six pieces? So I can tell you. So I could take all the three projectives together. That works because tau of each of them is equal to zero, and so HOM from each of them into tau of that module is going to be zero automatically. The rest of these, you have to do some calculations to check. But what we notice about this is that this is some nice shellable and simplicial, sorry, well, shellable, it's true, but in particular, it's a contractible complex. Complex. Maybe go ahead and set up for this problem. Alright, the other piece we need is widespread categories. May I ask one question? Yeah, sure, sure. Yeah. Was this type A1? Type A? What do you say again? Like type A1? Like, is this the translation of the type A1? Like, you say the software complex terminology? Yeah, so I don't. Yeah, so I don't think this is like mutation equivalent, maybe this starting quiver to like just a path quiver. So there might be some kind of relation there, but I wouldn't call this like a type A. I don't know. Would you agree with that? Yeah, so this is an example of what we call a gentle algebra, and this is just the. The modules you get out of that. There are a lot of similarities, I think, between type A combatorics and gentle algebra combinatorics. Okay, good. Not going to get into that here. Okay, so wide subcategories. So this is the other piece we need. This is, so we say a full subcategory is wide if it's cloud closed under, I should also say isomorphisms, extensions, kernels, and code. Extensions, kernels, and co-kernels. So if I have, the way I like to think about this is, let's say I have a short exact sequence of modules, like a simple module S2 goes to P1, quotients to S1. It's basically saying if I have any two of the three, then I have to have the third one as well. So if I had S1 and S2, then I have to have the extension, which is P1. Or if I say I have the S2 and P1, then I have to have the co-kernel, S1. And conversely, I have to have the kernel if I have P1 and S1. Okay, we could look at so because we want the full subcategory and we want it to be closed under isomorphisms and so on, we can just say, and also under direct summands, we can specify these subcategories just by saying what indecompable summands or what indecisible modules do they contain. And we're going to blurter them by inclusion of subcategories. And it turns out we get this post set. This is very similar. Very similar to the non-crossing partition lattice. You can see rank sizes 1661. It looks very similar to the non-crossing partition lattice. It's actually not something different. This is what I call a non-crossing tree partition lattice. So it has a kind of different interpretation to it. Okay, and the connection to Lattice theory is that the widespread categories, this post-set is known in the case where lambda is taxed finite, this is always isomorphic to a core-label order of the. A correlable order of some other lattice, the lattice of torsion classes coming from this algebra. This is a post-episomorphism between these two things. And so, yeah, so if I want to study correlable orders in representation theory contexts, I'm looking at the question of whites and categories. Okay, and now finally the map. Okay, so to find the map, I need to define both a right perp and a left perp. Both a right perp and a left perp. So if I have a subcategory C, then we define its right perpendicular subcategory to be those modules for which this space of HOMs vanish. So if there's no homomorphism, non-zero homomorphism from module NC to X, then we include X in this perpendicular, right perpendicular subcategory, and then left perpendicular is defined dually. I just flip the positions of X and C here. Okay. And then there's this theorem by Yasso, which says that if I have a tau-tilting finite algebra, then we get a, and say this maybe in like a different way, but we get the surjective map of posits from basic tau-rigid modules. So these are just, you take the, basically faces of the tau-tilting complex. Basic just means I don't want to repeat any indecomposable summants. Okay, so there's finally a Okay, so there's finitely many of these in the finite case. And I can turn them into wide subcategories in this kind of funny way, where I do this intersection of two perpendicular subcategories. Where I take the module I look at, the right perpendicular subcategory of that, and I'll take the left perpendicular subcategory of tau of them. And sort of the things that fit in here, it turns out form a wide subcategory. What does that mean? What does add mean? Add just means I want to take the module and turn it into a category. So I want to take all direct sums and summands of m. Okay, so y lambda star. Oh, right, yeah. So the point is, I, okay, so this, to make it an order-preserving map of post-sets, I had to take the dual of the post-set of y subcategories. When I do perpendicular subcategories, it's going to sort of flip the order around. So if I have an inclusion of basic. So if I have an inclusion of basic origin modules, then the perks are going to flip the order around. So I need to take the dual closet of wise categories with it. In the example here, it looks like this. I have my tauntless complex that I showed before. We can just list the basic target modules. Here I've listed a few of them. This is, of course, naturally graded because this is This is a pure complex, so it's graded by a number of incomposable sum-ands. And we can apply this map, right? Gausso's map to wide subcategories. And so, in particular, if I want to verify that this map satisfies the condition, then I want some kind of contractability hypothesis, sort of the main thing. So, I want to say if I take the fiber of some module in here and look at everything below that. Here and look at everything below that. So, in the case of S3, there are actually two different ways to write it. Its inverse image includes two different ways, two different things. So, there's S1 plus P1, and there's also P1 plus P2. This is a calculation that, again, I'm suppressing. This is a contractable subcomplex of the original cal tilting complex. So it would be something that would fit in with this one. Okay, so that's the problem. Basically, in general, we want to do this. Basically, in general, we want to do this. If I consider this map from basic tower engine modules to this post-to-to-wise categories, the first question is: does this actually identify the post-set wise categories for the LC tool as a quotient postet via this map? So what that means is that precisely the relation that we get by passing through the quotient is the induced relation on categories. In principle, there could be more. In principle, there could be more relations among light-subcategories than would be induced by this map. So, in other words, I want to know: can I always lift an inclusion of lights of categories to some inclusion of basic tyrigid modules? And we want to lift this in a particular way to get a certain kind of post-I quotient, because I want to know if the conditions of this fiber lemma hold. So, is this post-Iquient actually upper regular homogeneous, and does it have contractible fibers? And my suspicion to this. And my suspicion to this is that they should, the fibers of this should actually be some kind of shellable balls that we can get a handle on. And so there will be actual consequence of that. As a corollary, then you can deduce the, say, from an enumerative point of view, we can find the characteristic polynomial of the post-wise categories in terms of the F polynomial, polynomial kind of cases of the downloaded complex. And then the third question here, this is more of a stretch, is I want to know: is there a way to go back to the original question, which is about shellability? Can we actually prove shellability, let's say maybe like a more general kind of like CL shellability of the Puzzle YSF categories via this map? So is there a way to say take a CL labeling of the, so people that know about this stuff, I guess, is there a way to take a CL labeling of the positive left? The CL labeling of the puzzle on the left and having it pushed forward to a CL labeling of the puzzle on the right. And I thought I should probably give some example of that just to convince you maybe that this is possible if you're interested in seeing this. Well, yeah, so here's a way to do this with NBC points. And that timer means that we're out of time? Yeah, I think they said you could go a little over, though. Okay, great. Yeah, so if I take the NDC forest, the way So, if I take the NBC forest, the way that I'm going to label these covers from f to f prime is we're just going to look at the new edge that was added. So, remember, these were forests, and so they're ordered by inclusion of edges. I can just label it by this new edge, ij, if that's ij included. We also, so to talk about CL labeling of this postset, I only do that for bounded postsets. So I need to add a top element, one hat, to this postset. And then we're going to label this cover. So if I have an NVC tree, well, this maximal elements. MBC tree, well, this maximal element in the MBC4 is post-hat, going up to one hat. I'm going to label it by this new label, one, n plus one. We order labels in this kind of lexicographic way. So if I have, this should be like i less than j and n k less than l, but I'm going to order the pairs of edges this way. ij less than kl if i is less than k, or if i is equal to k and j is less than l. So it's just usual dictionary order. These pairs. The claim is that this is an EL labeling, and we can check the conditions of that. Basically, we want to know in intervals, at least of the type going from forest to MEC forest, these are just Boolean postsets. And this induced kind of labeling on this is just sort of the ordinary label thing on a Boolean postset. We just order by the new thing included. So there's sort of no problems with those intervals. If I'm looking at intervals to the top. If I'm looking at intervals to the top element, these are a little bit trickier or more complicated. But still, you can find a unique increasing chain, and its sort of eye construction will be lexicographically smallest. So that satisfies the conditions. This is again for the experts on shallability. Better do it. This is, I think, probably already known, like in a paper by Halam and Rafa De Lenon. I think they. I think they kind of had a different way, maybe, of titles. And then, okay, so this was supposed to be an EL labeling of the MBC4S postet. And then pushing forward to the partition lattice, right? The quotient by the relation we had before, what we do is we just say, among all the possible inverse images of a cover in the partition lattice, I'm just going to choose the one with the smallest label. So that's going to give me some correlation of 4s. And the claim is that this is actually one of the standard heal labelings of the partition lengths, basically saying what is the minimum of the two blocks that I'm merging together. Or yeah, the minimum of each block that I'm merging together, and that's the order pair I take. I mean, you said, not as a mathematical term there, but just one of the ones we know well. Yeah, that's right. There's actually many labelings of pi n, I should say, and so this is like one of the ones that. It's the, so it's not that it's because I want to label by order pair. Yeah, this is more like a matriated one, I guess, where I'm taking those total order of the ground set in a particular way, like this. And I'm just taking like the smallest new edge that we can possibly have. So there's a matrix analog of this theorem that you could do as well. That's it. Are there further questions? You have these open problems. There are some special cases of really nice well-understood algebras.
