Okay. Um, are you able to see the slide? Yep, everything looks great. Thank you, Josh. Excellent. Hi, I'm Joshua Sadikoff. I am an undergraduate research assistant in the Welch Lab, part of the Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. And today I'm going to be talking about the application of LIGER to the integration of C. Liger to the integration of seekfish and single-cell RNA sequencing data. This is going to be more of a discussion of benchmarking seekfish against a number of other spatial transcriptomic methods. And aside from that, I'm very excited to be speaking with you today. I'm glad that even under these circumstances, you're able to put this conference on. So I'm going to be breaking this down into a discussion of the LIGER approach. Discussion of the LIGER approach, some previous results generated with it, and the comparisons that I generated sort of to benchmark across different spatial transcriptomic protocols. So LIGER, standing for LinkedIn of Genomic Experimental Relationships, is an INMF-based integrative approach for single-cell data. Essentially, it utilizes non-negative matrix factorization. Non-negative matrix factorization, but applies it over multiple count matrices. It does this by modifying the standard W matrix to include both a data set specific and shared element. And the data set specific element is penalized. So essentially, you end up with a learned low-dimensional. Learned low-dimensional space that jointly defines multiple data sets. And then there's downstream clustering, either with max factor assignment or Louvain clustering and quantile normalization. And this is pretty useful for the integration of multiple data sets, not only from different modalities, as I'm going to discuss, but also from different samples and different species. And the data set-specific elements can give a little bit of insight into what. Can give a little bit of insight into what the differences between counts are in this case. So I'm going to discuss a little bit why spatial transcriptomic and single cell RNA sequencing data are very useful to integrate. They're very complementary in the information they offer. Spatial transcriptomic protocols generally assay only several cells, generally a low number of genes. Low number of genes. However, they provide in-situ measurements, obviously, showing the specific locations of where cells are expressing these genes. And there's much more limited dissociation bias as a result of all cells remaining in place and not having to be processed in any way to generate the counts. Whereas for single-cell RNA sequencing data, generally there's more cells covered at a higher rate. But as a result of tissue dissociation, But as a result of tissue dissociation, spatial information is lost, and there's bias in terms of the cells that are actually measured. So integration in this case is able to better resolve cell types in spatial transcriptomic data as a result of the higher resolution of the single-cell RNA sequencing data. And conversely, the embedded spatial transcript data is Spatial transcript data is able to essentially impute spatial trends and cell type distributions based on the single cell RNA sequencing data. So one application of this I'm going to discuss is in the original Liger paper, 71,000 single-cell RNA sequencing samples and 2,000 cells assayed using star map from the mouse frontal cortex. Star map from the mouse frontal cortex were integrated. And as you can see in this TSNE plot, there was a strong alignment between data sets and using marker genes. The accuracy of the joint clustering was confirmed. This was able to increase the resolution of detected clusters from just the star map. Additionally, sort of to build on what I was talking about, using an app. Talking about using an averaging of the closest single-cell RNA sequencing samples in the shared factor neighborhood, they were able to impute genes not previously measured in the star map. In this case, this shows genes that were measured in star map and then held out and compared across the single cell sequencing data as well as the Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization data to demonstrate that the spatial distribution of gene. Spatial distribution of gene expression could be determined. And now I'm going to talk about the specific work I did in this case. So, aside from the seek fish data that was given in this case, I also utilized similar data collected using the MERFISH protocol and from StarMap. And the two guiding questions I had as I was going through the study were, Study were how do integration results differ based on a spatial transcriptome protocol controlling for a number of other factors? And how does the number of shared genes affect results? We just discussed the methods a little bit. Seekfish, as was given in the study, is a multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization method, and it just utilizes sequential rounds of barcoding hybridization. Of barcoding hybridization to measure multiple genes. In this case, we had a little over 110 genes measured, but it now scales up into the thousands, which is pretty useful for measuring complex phenomena in a tissue. Murfish is fairly similar, except it uses an error correcting binary code to identify each gene, which allows for a little bit more error correction and also scales into the thousands of genes. Finally, star map. Finally, star map is a little bit different. It involves the conversion of tissue into a hydrogel and uses rolling circle amplification with snail probes in order to fluoresce for various genes. And it allows the measurement of 3D tissue volumes, but it's limited at about a thousand genes. So, in order to compare spatial transcriptomic protocols, I use Spatial transcriptomic protocols. I used the given seekfish data set with about 1600 samples across 113 genes. I used the star map data set given in their original paper, which this one had 1020 genes. And I utilized a Merfish data set of the mouse hypothalamus, and I downsampled it to. It to 1,600 samples to match the other two. And as you can see, there's some structure to the data. But in all of the cases, there's definitely some overlap of subtypes, specifically neuronal subtypes, just because as compared to non-neuronal subtypes, there's more overlap in terms of the actual expression there. So, in order to complete the integrative analysis, I integrated the data with the primary visual cortex subset of cells from the TASIC et al. paper from 2018, which is an atlas of the neocortex. And it's sort of an expanded version of the data that was given for this hackathon. But I still use the same genes as a result of variable gene selection. Genes as a result of variable gene selection. So the workflow I used just involved pre-processing, including normalization and scaling, variable gene selection, followed by INMF, quantile norming, and clustering. And 111 of the genes given were used as features out of the 113. So this is just an overview of the integration. Of the integrative structure, as in how the data sets are integrated. And you'll see generally there's a good amount of integration between all the data sets. There's two things I'll point out as I go forward. First, the cluster of cells in the seek fish data that came entirely from the seek fish protocol. And in the MERFISH, you'll notice that in the bottom. That in the bottom right, there's a cluster that seems highly enriched for cells found using the Murfisch protocol. Sorry. So the first conclusion was that resolution was definitely improved from integrating with the single-cell data sets. There were more better aligned clusters than were originally. Clusters than were originally found, especially in the seek fish data, where originally there was not very much structure. Now, especially non-neuronal cell types, were pretty well separated. And just to build on that, more highly aligned integrations allow for better imputation of spatial information. And this also suggested that the star map data set, which had the most genes, Star map data set, which had the most genes, resulted in the most informative integration just from the more defined clusters. Also, just to talk about what I mentioned previously, it seems like for the seatfish data, it was one specific subset of oligodendrocytes that was not found in the single-cell RNA sequencing data, which is something I probably want to investigate more. And in the MERFISH, it seemed like astrocytes were, I guess. I guess overexpressed in that one cluster, which is probably a result of the dissociation bias found in the single-cell RNA sequencing data. And just to talk more about the individual analyses, the Seekfish data was a little bit less aligned with the single-cell RNA sequencing data than the others. And the other noticeable element was that there was some loss of structure in the single-cell data. Structure in the single cell data after integration as compared to, say, like the star map data, which used the same single cell RNA sequencing data. There was more overlap and misidentification between clusters. And I'm going to touch on why I thought that was in a little bit. So, yes, the thermap analysis seemed to be the most informative, but it also did have 10 times more genes measured. 10 times more genes measured than the others. So the question essentially was: what would be the lower limit of genes needed, just randomly selected, in order to have an informative integration? And I will show that analysis after I talk just about this Murfish analysis, which was also highly aligned after integration, despite having about 135 genes. About 135 genes assayed, which was interesting. And probably I'm going to look more into the, I guess, why the protocol was able to deliver slightly more informative results with fewer genes. So, yes, being motivated by the difference in analysis, I repeatedly downsampled the 1020. The 1020 gene star map data set by 100 genes at a time. And the main questions I had going in were, would the breakdown and quality of the alignment be linear or would there be a specific number of genes that would break down at? And also, how would it differently impact the RNA sequencing data and the spatial data? Because as I know. Data because, as I noted earlier, it seemed like for the one seatfish analysis, there was actually a breakdown in the quality of clustering for the single-cell RNA sequencing data as a result of the integration. So, what I found is that generally the single-cell RNA sequencing data retains a high Retains a high level of structure and quality of clustering, which is sort of based on the alignment itself, up to a very low number of genes for the spatial data. And it is subset to the number of genes in the spatial data. So that just suggests that the resolution is high enough that it's able to act as a structure to put the spatial data on top of. Put the spatial data on top of. You'll notice at the lowest number of genes, 100 genes sampled, the 10th of the genes assayed, it seems like there's a significant breakdown in both the clustering quality measured by the purity and ARI for both the spatial and the RNA sequencing data. And the theory for this is at the lowest level, having a few randomly sampled genes could obfuscate real patterns. Could obfuscate real patterns in the data that the integration would have to essentially compensate for. Whereas above that, there is high enough resolution and quantity to provide some structure. And I guess I just one more minute. Okay. Another point I wanted to bring up is that, so the Murfish data that I utilized came from a much larger data set with about a million samples. And in that case, the integration yielded. And in that case, the integration yielded a pretty similar alignment to what was found using a much smaller number of cells. Although, having a more even number of spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing data points more thoroughly demonstrates, I guess, the dissociation bias and the difference in cell types assayed by both, which I didn't really have that much time to analyze. And most of this analysis was completed by. Most of this analysis was completed by another graduate student in the lab, but it's something that I'm interested in looking into more in the future. And this is just a graph showing some of the benchmarking. Specifically for the star map data, this shows when it was downsampled to 120 genes. So even then, it seems like the Murfish data, a low number of genes, provided a more informative integration. And I'm looking forward to continuing to use all of these. Continuing to use all of these protocols for analyses in the future for a variety of different tasks. I'd like to thank my mentor, Dr. Joshua Welch, other members of the Welch Lab, including Jilen Liu and April Creble, the multiple funding agencies that help fund our lab, and you for listening to my talk. Thank you. And if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Thank you. Wonderful talk. Thank you. Wonderful talk. Thank you. Are there any questions? Quiet. Getting to the end of the session, I guess. Yeah. That's fine. Can you describe your IRA normalization criterion a little bit more closely? Like, so how are your assessment criterion? How are your assessment criteria and how are you benchmarking? Yeah, so we were primarily basing it off of the quality of clustering measured using purity and ARI. Purity is a more straightforward measure of just if the cells included in a cluster are found together in the same given cluster. ARI accounts for essentially pairs of cells if they are supposed to be found in the same cluster or different clusters. Or different clusters. And just alignment is a measure of how well multiple data sets overlap. So I primarily benchmarked for the star map data set just because it had enough genes to repeatedly downsample across, and it's a little bit harder to accurately compare across different measured data sets, especially when there are different protocols. Although that was part of Protocols of the that was part of what I was trying to determine. Great. That also gets GC's comment also really well fits into that of can you talk about the quality of the data for each technology other than scale and how this could affect your performance? So the actual quality of the data based on technology is something that I'm a little bit less knowledgeable about just because I'm Knowledgeable about just because I'm more focused on the actual computational protocols. But ultimately, the quality of the data found directly impacts the ability to integrate it because it is supposed to lie in the same low-dimensional space as the single-cell RNA sequencing data. So, data that either has trends that are counter to it, especially. Trends that are counter to it, especially when there's so many more single-cell RNA sequencing data points, could result in less informative outputs. Great. Are there any other questions? If not, let's thank all of our speakers for the session. This has been great. We finished our first day, so thank you.
