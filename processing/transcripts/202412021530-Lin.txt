This is uh the last afternoon section. I hope you are enjoying the program. Now it's time to learn something with the ULU link. Sorry for my pronunciation, you know that it's a bit difficult. And she's going to talk about her normalized coverage integrals on Paul Cana in Sen Man. Please. So first of all, thank you for the organizer for the invitation. This is actually my first time in Ben Institute. Throughout my career, I have been heard a lot. Throughout my career, I have heard a lot of nice things about the Lambda Institute and finally had a chance to come here. So, today, so I want to talk about we normalize curvature integral on the Poincaré-Einstein setting. But first of all, I would like to give a little bit of motivation and overview that why in general people care about PE manifold. And first, what's the kind of model case for PE manifold? And then I'm going to talk a little bit about renormalized volume, which is kind of the spatial case. Bollow, which is kind of the spatial case of renormalized curvature integral. Then I will state the couple of Mann theorem and then as application, I will also, if time for me, I will try to do a little sketch of the proof for the Mann theorem. Then in the end, if I still have time, then I would maybe introduce a couple more examples and also like a surprising out like a byproduct for our project. So this is joint work with Jeffrey, Ayu Xiaon, and William. Ayu, Sharon, and William. Okay, so first of all, for the P manifold, one of the motivations people want to study P manifold is the following. It's actually the hyperbolic space because there's a deep connection between the Riemannian geometry of the hyperbolic bulb and also with the conformal geometry of the boundary on the sphere. And for example, the conformal transmission group of the sphere is actually isomorphic to the group of isometry on the hyperbolic space. Isometry on the hyperbolic space. So we think about: okay, can we generalize this model a little bit so then later on, the interior, the hyperbolic space, become our Poincaré-Einstein manifold, or sometimes people call it CCE manifold. I'm going to introduce it in a minute. And also the boundary will become, the sphere will become what we call the conformal infinity in this case. So that's to settle some definition here. So we say a remaining. So we say a Riemannian metric on a manifold X is what we call the conformal compact if you have a defining function R such that when you multiply by this R squared, it compactifies the manifold here. And the defining function, the definition is that it's going to be non-negative. So it's positive in the interior, but zero on the boundary. But you want the gradient to be non-degenerate on the boundary here. Boundary here. And actually, once you have this conformally compact manifold, it actually defines a well-defined conformal class. Because you can see that even though you pick a specific defining function r, but the defining function is not unique. You can always multiply by a positive function, then it becomes another defining function. Then you will have a different conformal metric on the boundary, but in the same conformal class. So it only gives you a well-defined conformal class on the boundary. Conformal class on the boundary. So the boundary manifold M along with this conformal class is what we call the conformal infinity of this G-class. Okay, and sometimes that it will be nice if we, because we want to kind of mimic what the hyperbolic space is. So in some sense, we want it to be either asymptotically hyperbolic or actually it will be stronger. We want it to be Einstein. So we prescribe this additionally other than being confident. And additionally, other than being completely compact, we add this additional condition where the Ricci curvature of this G-plot metric to be, we normalize to be the negative Ricci curvature like this, then we call this manifold to be conforming compact Einstein, CCE metric, or point-counting Einstein. So throughout my talk, I might sometimes say CCE, sometimes TE, but mean the same thing. So just to do a quick overview of one release and the A quick overview of one of the reasons that why people study P-E-metry is that, like what I just mentioned, there's a connection between the conformal geometry of the conformal infinity with the geometry, the linear geometry of the P manifold. And of course, one consideration of one interest is from the physics side where they studied this anti-deceider conformal field theory correspondence. And also, you can use P-E-metaphone or P-metric to construct local or non-local conformal invariants. Local, non-local, conformal invariant. And in particular, this result by Graham Lee a while ago that they actually prove if you give me a metric H which is close enough to the round sphere, then you actually can find a corresponding T metric in the interior such that the conformal infinity is this given H here. So this is essentially an existence result for a conformal metric. For a conformal metric that's close enough to the sphere. And so, this is some sort of existence theory. And I would like to add a remark that actually this metric G plus here is actually unique. And I believe it's proved by Alice Ching and Ger and Jing, if I remember correctly. So I will mention that later on. And also, so one motivation of study P metri is also from the existence theory, but we also can consider either non-existence theory. Also, can consider either non-existence, existence, or uniqueness, non-uniquen, and so on. So, for example, this Grand Lee is one of the existence theory. And the other non-existence result is actually, for example, Gerskin and Hahn and also Gersking-Hahn and Stove, they actually prove there exists a topological obstruction. Like, I think it's in the spin setting and when the dimension needs to be like 4K bigger than equal to 8, something like that. You actually find out that. You actually find out that there exists some conformal metric or conformal class on the boundary, such that there's no corresponding interior PE metric that corresponding to the conformal infinity. So that's the non-existence part. And what about uniqueness and non-uniqueness, right? So actually back to the hyperbolic case, so J Cheng actually proved that through a possible Actually, he proved that through a positive mass theorem, he proved that actually hyperbolical, the classic one, actually is the unique P metric corresponding to the sphere. But also, like Zhang Jing and Ching actually proved that the Grand Lee's metric is also unique here. And also, I think like Da Ta Jafari and Li Ching Shi, they proved similar the same result with. With similar result, the same result with J Ching, but without using the positive math theorem. But also, of course, what about is there any possibility that this non-uniqueness results? So it turns out there's a famous cooking page example where you could have same conformal class on the boundary, but you have two different non-isometric PE feelings, like a CCE feeling in the interior. So that's actually the non-existent result that exists here. Exists here. And also, like a group of people also consider the compactness result. For example, if you consider, say, a set of compact conformometry, and then you wonder whether the corresponding PE metric as a sequence, whether it's also compact or not. So there's a lot of different direction in the study of PE manifold. I definitely didn't list every result here, but this is just to give you a taste that there are a lot of atoms. Taste that there are a lot of actually a result considering like the different study of PE manifold. Okay, so just a little bit more background here. So, okay, so then what's the nice thing about PE manifold is that if you specifically choose a nice defining function, this is what we call the geodesic defining function. So the definition of geodesic defining function is just that you actually want to require the dr The dr square with the compatify metric to be one. And you also want that after you compatify it, when you restrict it to the boundary, it's the chosen conformal metric that you have. So for each conformal metric, each representative, you actually have a corresponding unique geodesic defining function. So sometimes people call this spatial defining function, but they're the same thing. And so once you have this geodesic defining function, Deodesic defining function, then you can identify a neighborhood of M with a tubular neighborhood. So essentially, you can identify a neighborhood around n with this kind of small cylindrical neighborhood. And then you can also rewrite your point-colour, like sorry, P-y metric in terms of this what we call the normal form. So normal form looks like r to the minus 2 times dr squared plus this one parental family, depending on the r. Depending on the R here. And of course, when you plug in R equals zero, that goes back to the representative metric you choose on the. But actually, when N is odd, this N order coefficient here is trace-free, but the traceless part is undetermined. You can actually pick different types of traceless part. And for the even dimension case, the stinks will be. Dimension case, the things is a bit different. So you have this R to the n log R here where K is actually trace-free. And GR per n, the trace part of G r per n is locally determined by H, but the trace-free part is not locally determined. Okay, so there's this, but everything below that, you have only even powers here. That's the beauty of it. And then actually, one of the reasons a lot of Actually, one of the reasons a lot of Psych Theory can work is because it has this nice kind of even power expansion. Okay, so more example here. Let's take a look at some classic PE example. So first of all, like when I said the hyperbolic bow, right? So Poincaré bow here, and you can really explicitly write down the hyperbolic metric. And if you want to identify what's the space, this is actually a spatial defining function. This is actually a spatial defining function, and you can add once you find a spatially defining function, you can really just directly plug in and check. So, in this case, if we scale this way, then the conformal infinity is actually 1 fourth times the standard sphere metric. And if you really want to write down what the normal form is, if you use our spatial dividing function, then you write down what's the normal form. Okay. And another interesting example is this ADH Schwab child space. One of the reasons I take these two examples is later on, in a minute, I'm going to compute the renormalized volume for these two class examples so you can kind of see that like how things work or compute. So for this structured space, I mean this M is essentially the mess over there, and this lower bound R sub H is a positive group for the Is a positive root for this V here. And I mean, you can actually compute what's the conformal infinity. It's the S1 of lambda times S2 with the standard metric here, the product metric here. And one reason I want to specifically mention this example too is because this is exactly will give us the holding page non-existence, sorry, the non-uniqueness example. So for each lambda between this range, you can actually Range, you can actually find two different values of m here. So, such that, so for each one, that's if you have m1, m2, that's say, right, then g plus m1 and g plus m2 will be the CCE fill-in, the PE metric in the interior that corresponding to the same conformal metric. So, this is essentially give us the holding page non-uniqueness example here. Okay, so. Okay, so one of the goals of our project is to study the global invariant, and the classic one and pretty well studied one is what we call the renormalized volume. And there are actually several ways to kind of write down the definition or compute it. So probably this is more accessible and most related to the normal form here. So to define re-normalized volume and later on generalize to normalized curvature integral, you can see that, okay, so one way. You can see that, okay. So, one way to define is that you pick a representative, then you have the corresponding unique geodesic defining function, then you can write down the normal form. Then you really just directly compute using what you know, the conformal change metric, blah, blah, blah, and you compute the volume form here in terms of the square root of the determinant of the one-parameter family over the determinant of the metric on the boundary, the representative metric. Then you can really. Then you can really compute the expansion here. Since we already know the expansion about GR from the previous slides, you can really compute it here. And all the B upper end here is related to taking trace of the coefficient that we saw earlier. So remember that if we go back to the earlier slide, so if you're taking trace of all these coefficients, then in the R-dimension case, this GR per n is. Case, this G upper n is trace-free, right? So that's why later on you don't see the V upper N anymore. Okay, so because once you take trace, it's going to be like zero. So then you compute the volume. So why we, okay, so maybe I should mention this in the beginning. So why we consider we normalize volume, right? Because P metric is complete. So if you just directly integrate the volume with respect to Integrate the volume with respect to geometry, it's going to blow up, it's going to go to infinity. So you need to do a regionalization. So you consider the volume when R is really epsilon, but you're thinking in a sense when epsilon goes to zero, then you have the asymptotic expansion here. And you already saw the parity difference in the expansion of the matrix. Of course, you can see that there will be a parity difference here. And for the R dimension, it's the So, the R dimension is the good case I'm going to explain in a minute. And this V that I highlighted in red here is actually what we call the renormalized volume. And also, you have another constant term, which is the renormalized volume here. So in some sense, we can define the renormalized volume to be the constant terms in this Forensic expansion here. But you will notice that there's also this weird L got of 1 over epsilon terms. Gaugh of one over epsilon term. So it turns out that unfortunately in even dimension, the renormalized volume is not independent of the choices of your conformal metric. So only the L here in the even dimension will be invariant. So you can actually prove that in R dimension, the Renomize Galling is good. So be careful, n here is the dimension of the boundary of the conformal manifold. So you're seeing. Of the conflict manifold. So your space will be, the T space will be n plus 1. And so you can actually show that when n is odd, this b is independent of the choice of the conformometry. So essentially what you did is you really just have two conformometry, you compute it and see whether there's a constant terminating, then you can actually see that there's no difference. So it turns out because it's independent of the choices of the conformometry, so you can view. The conformal metric. So you can view this remoteized volume as a global invariant because it only depends on the G plus the Poincaré Einstein metric. And this L will also be invariant, but since later on, we're going to consider the RK, so I'm going to just not too much detail on L here. Okay, so let's do a quick computation about what's renormalized volume. If you are new to this concept, then maybe. If you are new to this concept, then maybe it's good to see a couple examples here. So, first classic example, hyperbolic road, right? So, we already have everything explicitly written, right? So, you can really just directly compute it. What's the renormalized volume here? Actually, this hypo here, this should not be a V, this should be the volume from R bigger than epsilon. So, this is the volume of the region, like when you take our bigger than. Region, like when you take R bigger than epsilon, but taking epsilon goes to really small, then as we saw earlier, it's really the constant term of the Lorentz extension that gives us the normalized volume. So I highlight the constant term so you can see that the minimalized volume of four-dimensional hyperbolic bow is 4π squared over 3. Of course, you can compute any twin dimension, that's fine. Okay, and another example, this is where we are. Example: This is where we saw earlier the ADH Schroud-Shout space, and the computation of Renomize volume is actually quite messy. So, I'm just going to only show you the final result here. But the reason I want to show you this is also kind of give you like a hint that renormalized volume really is not the volume in the classic sense. It could be positive, zero, or negative, right? Because it's already renormalized, so there's no So, there's no point that why there's no reason why it has to be positive. So, in different range of this R sub H, your renormalized volume in this ADS matrix could actually be negative or zero or actually positive. Okay, so it could be any value. So, and oh, by the way, I also want to make a remark that for the non-uniqueness, though, not just these two metrics that Hogan-Pays non-uniqueness. That Hogan-Page non-uniqueness example. For S1 cross S2, you also have another topologically different P-metric. So, for example, if you consider the conformal infinity to be this, right? So, holding page is doing the kind of the CCE filling on this one, but you can also do the CCE filling on this part. So, then there's the other P metric that will be something like this. This. It's totally already totally different than the hogging page example. Okay, so now finally, so other than renormalized volume, so we wonder, okay, is there any more global invariant of PE manifold, right? And later on, the goal is we want to do renormalized curvature integral where the curvature is the scalar Riemannian invariant of a certain degree. So, first, what do you mean by So, first, what do you mean by a scalar Riemannian invariant, right? So, first, if it's a scalar Riemannian invariant, it means it can be written as a linear combination of complete contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor and its derivative. And so you just have a whole bunch of curvature terms, and probably possibly its derivative, and you take the complete contraction using the G inverse here. And regarding the weight, it means that when you do the rescaling. It means that when you do the rescaling of the metric, it rescales in this sense. So that gives you the weight here. So now we do the similar thing, right? So actually, first you find the Jodesi defining function, and you can define on the p-manifold. Then you can define the so-called renormalized curvature integral. So we use this notation. And the definition is really just the finite part of the Lorentz expansion. So you can think of the renormalized So, you can think of the renormalized volume to be the renormalized of curvature one, right? Then you take the constant term. And here, whatever your scalar-Riemannian invariant is, you just take the expansion and take the finite part. But in general, of course, it's not that easy to compute explicitly because, like, I mean, you need to actually manage to do the expansion here. And actually, in Alban's paper, I forgot the year, probably 2009 or something, he actually proved that in He actually proved that in, so be careful. Now I switch the dimension back to n on the P manifold. So this N is actually the now back become the interior, right? So remember back then, if the conformal boundary is odd, that's the good case. So that means when the interior, when the P metric is even, that's the good case. So that's why I'm asking to have an even-dimensional P-manifold. That's when the P manifold, that's when the renormalized volume, and actually, even more, when renormalized curvature integral is independent of the choices of the conformal class. Okay, so I want to actually prove this. Okay, so for example, what's the renormalized curvature integral? The two classic examples, first we just saw it, the renormalized volume, we just renormalized one. The other would be the renormalized integral of the Flavian. That's kind of part of the Kind of part of the key things that we're going to see today that it involves this renovation integral of the Fafium. So, one of the motivation of our project is coming from the following. So, actually, Alvin in his paper that not only he proved you can generalize the idea of renormalized volume to renormalize curvature integral, like what you saw over there, it actually also proved that similar to the classic Gaussian. Similar to the classic Gauss-Bernet theorem, if you take the renormalized curvature integral of phi, then it actually gives you a multiple of Euler characteristic. And this is actually true for any even-dimensional PE manifold. And if you restrict it to when n equals 4, you can actually, in lower-dimensional case, you can really write down Fafian on the Einstein manifold. It's not bad. Then you can actually recover the four-dimensional case. Recover the four-dimensional case, which is contributed by Anderson's phone up here. So, basically, in four-dimensional, you can see that the first term of Faufium, the renormalized integral will actually give you the renormalized volume here. And the second term in the Faufium will give you the 1 over 8 while squared. And on the other hand, similar to this formula, Zhangqing-Yang, they actually prove that they can. Prove that they can write down this even-dimensional Gauss-Bonet formula, but they specifically say that actually they can prove the integrand here is actually a scalar conformal invariant. And so what do you mean by scalar conformal invariant? It means that when you do the conformal change of metrics, say when you take u squared g, then it will actually rescale in this u to the minus. We scale in this u to the minus n. So this wn is exactly of weight minus n. So why we care about this weight here is because once you have a weight minus n, right, then what happens is that then so if you integrate this new invariant on the on the conform metric, right, then it's a because it is scaled in u to the minus n. Minus n. And then your volume form also was rescaled in a nice way. So it actually cancels out. So this tells you that if you really have a scalar conformal invariant of specifically weight minus n on the n-dimensional manifold, then you integrate that same. That integral is a conformal invariant. And that's the crucial part. So it turns out that this part originally, if you want to integrate, you should do as other terms, do the renormalize. Other terms do the renormalize like integral. But since it's a conformal invariant, so you just really don't need to renormalize anymore. You can just take the compatible metric in the conformal class and then take the integral with respect to that nice metric. So is the V here just the finite part of what you would get from a standard Gauss per nature formula? Yeah, so this V, you mean this V. This is the renobized volume. Oh, you mean like, so if you were. Oh, you mean like, so if you were in the compact manifold, not PE case, then this will be the usual volume. But we are in the PE case here, so this V is the normalized volume. Is that, sorry, is that you're not going to be able to do that? Okay, so if you want to close or let's say your conqueror eyes like, okay, so then that thing's just going to be a constant because of the conqueror eyes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, because actually you can kind of see it from the PF here that if you like you can write down the variant in terms of polynomial of wild tensor. The very first time it becomes like a scalar. And then on the P case, it becomes like just comes. Okay, so actually I want to remark that in Jean-Tion's paper they actually wrote down the explicit formula for n equals explicit formula. n equals for explicit formula sorry for the W n in n equals six but actually they didn't really specify like exactly what's the explicit formula there because actually it could be it should be very complicated and but they do comment that this WN should look like a polynomial of a bunch of wild tensor so and also in their proof they actually rely on this Alastock's like decomposition so what they do is they take the QN Do is they take the QN curvature and then they decompose into the Fafian plus a scalar component invariant plus a divergence part, and then they take a spatial like Fefferman-Grand metric so they can make the Q-treat to be zero and they do the integration. Okay, so that's general their approach. So one of our goal here is actually the motivation comes from this thing, what you saw here. So we wonder, is there any way to kind of somehow relate this album's results? somehow relate this album's result to like Zhongqing Yang's result or vice versa, right? How do you write from one thing, from one formula to the other? And especially bypassing this decomposition techniques here. So that's essentially the goal here that we want to be able to kind of compute, develop a general procedure and independent of allisotics like decomposition. And hopefully we can get it more explicitly like the W. Like the WN formula, and explicitly in the sense that we can actually write down this WN using ambient formula, the ambient formula in terms of ambient metric by Fermi-Gram. Okay, so first because we need to use Fermi-Gram's ambient metrics, I just want to, I think some of the speakers earlier already talked a little bit about the ambient space. So I'm not going to do a deep introduction, but just show you. Introduction, but just show you the definition here. So, in order to work well with all the metrics, we take a straight normal ambient space associated to the conformal class here. And so this G load essentially will be a one-parameter family on the manifold n. And actually, the definition essentially is like when n is odd, then you want it to be as intolerant reach-flat. It to be as intolerant, retrieved flat. And when n is even, you can only do up to this order here. And so, okay, so maybe just to give one quick example of ambient space is that if you have a Sn, then ambient space is essentially Rn plus 1 M1, the Minkowski space. So one thing about the application for using Like, like using NBM formula or this NBM metric as a tool is that if you have a scalar Riemannian invariant of weight w and omega, actually we actually could omega, and if you actually put it back, if you compute it like on the n plus two dimensional ambient metric and you pull back to the manifold, on the n-dimensional manifold, it actually gives you a scalar conformal invariant. And actually, in most of the cases, And actually, in most of the cases, not all the cases, there's some exceptional cases, but most of the cases, all the scalar conformity invariant is produced this way. Okay, you can actually show that. And just to give you some example, for example, one famous scalar conformity invariant would be the while square. And it actually comes from taking the probability of the ambient Riemann squared. And of course, if you're not careful, your probability might actually be zero. And also, a little bit more complicated example is that you take the ambient Lafortion of the Riemann squared. And of course, you can see that this is like in general, it's a scalar conformity invariant. But if you don't know what's the correct combination, it's actually hard to directly from the scratch and write down a scalar conformity invariant in general. So you can think of using this ambient space as a nice tool to create a bunch of scalar conformal invariants. Of scalar conformal invariant. Okay, so our first theorem, I should probably say this is maybe not. So the first theorem, one and two, I'm going to present is actually a maybe direct application for a more technical theorem. But I'd rather show you this first two because it's more kind of answered the question we just asked: that is there any way to more explicitly identify the WN in Jung Channel's formula? So, this is our first result that you This is our first result that you can actually identify the WN to be exactly something like this. So, this is the, so PFL is this like ugly, like a polynomial type of the 2,2 tensor here. And so, if you're using the ambient Riemann curvature tensor, you take the correct power of ambient Laplacian, then it's going to create a scalar conformal invariant of weight minus n. So, again, if it's Minus n. So again, if it's weight minus n, then this integral will actually be a convergent integral because it becomes a conformally invariant here. Okay, so just to give you a little bit of a sense what this weird PFO is, so if you take L to be exactly n over 2, and then it's the Fautian. And if you take L to be 2, and then this T to be wild tensor, then it actually gives you the 1/8 of wild squared. So this actually, so if you consider the case of P24, this becomes, or actually recover the Anderson's formula, of course. I mean, it has to run. Okay, so this essentially kind of like mimicking, I mean, what Zhangqian has, but then we explicitly identify this PLN here. And just, like, remember, I said that the only explicitly known formula is really when n is less than or equal to 6. So I just want to include the A-dimensional. I just want to include the A-dimensional case. But this can still be scary, right? This is not ideal. Yeah, so the thing is that we write it in terms of the ambient metric. So this, okay, I don't want to write down the whole thing because it's going to take maybe half a page. But W21 is essentially the while square. W31 and 3,2 is essentially like you have three triple of while tensor, but you have two different ways of taking. Have two different ways of taking the complete contraction. And then for W41, you have actually seven different ways to take the complete contraction of all the full copy of biotenser. You can actually do a nice complimentary count. So yeah, but at least you can actually write down the ambient formula here for the A-dimensional case. And another result is actually similar to the PE case. If you restrict it to the compact case, then of course. Compact case, then of course the renormalized volume don't need to renormalize anymore, so it becomes just the volume, and everything else is the same. So this is restricted to the compact, even dimensional Einstein situation. Okay, so then so like I hope that I can show you a little bit of the proof, so then you will know like what's the kind of the key techniques here. Techniques here. So it turns out that what works well with our techniques or the ambient formula here is a space like a spatial class of invariant. It's what we call the strandable invariant. So, but depends on how you want to say it. So first, we define this, you can either define a scalar invariant or tensor invariant on the ambient manifold, and we call it straight. It is straight if you can actually relate to the invariant in this way, in this factor. And the reason we have this factor tau is because when you write down, you can actually explicitly write down the ambient metric when you're manifolding, conflict manifolds, Einstein. The last part is explicit involving this tau here. So if your invariant is scaled in this nice way and related to the ambient invariant in this nice way, then we called it. Then we called it straight tensor on the ambient case. And the corresponding or associate invariant on the manifold is what we call the strandable invariant here. So it turns out that later on we have some key lemma you're going to see in a minute that our techniques for computation works very well with this spatial type of strandable invariant. And just to give you a couple examples again, that while tensor, luckily, is a strandable invariant. Is a strandable invariant of weight two because it actually comes from taking the ambient of ambient Riven curvature tensor. And actually to prove, to show you that we actually can create a lot of this type of example, one thing you can show is that if I have two strandable tensor invariants, you take the tensor and then either take the partial contraction or even complete contraction, you can create more such strandable invariants. So the example is. So the example is a lot. And so, for example, the PFK or PFL, I think I called it PFL earlier, it's actually one of the examples. That's why we can apply our theorem. Okay, so this is the main technical theorem here, that if you do have a strandable scalar invariant, right, with this specific K, the reason we need to pause this is really just because that when you write down the ambient invariant, I mean, you want to. The ambient invariant, I mean, you want to make sure the ambient metric is well defined because, in even dimension, it's only defined up to a certain order. So, that's the only reason we set this bound here. So, if you have a point-Callet-Einstein manifold, then when you're trying to do the renormalized curvature integral of a stranded bone invariant here, then you can actually compute it as a convergent integral here. So, this scalar conformity invariant on the right-hand side. Conforming invariant on the right-hand side is identified using the ambient metric, ambient formula here. And again, the right-hand side is because this i n over 2 minus k is a scalar conforming invariant of weight minus n. So again, this whole integral is a conformant invariant. So instead of doing the renormalized curvature integral, you can just take the compatible metric, then everything is convergent on the right-hand side. Okay, so this essentially. Okay, so this essentially is a convenient tool in the sense that you essentially you don't need to calculate a normalized curvature integral, but you can actually just turn it into a convergent integral here. Sorry. Okay, so essentially the stereo one and two you saw there is kind of like a application for this theoretical three. So first I want to introduce you like this like couple proposition or key layma that why key layman that why we need strandable actually. So it turns out that if you have i to be strandable and with certain weights say minus 2k then if you define this another invariant that's coded i sub l, and there's a reason that why like you see this kind of factorization because you're going to see that if you take the ambient law function to a certain power and then you restrict it back Certain power, and then you restrict it back to the conformal manifold, then this is the formula you're going to see. So, one thing that we need this I sub L is that it turns out that this I sub L, because you can prove that if I is strandable, then I sub L will also be strandable. And so essentially, it gives you much more invariant to work with, and especially with the correct weight. And if you're And if you're because we are in the Einstein setting, then of course you can actually compute or rewrite this IL in terms of some multiple of I, right, the invariant, and module, like some divergence term. And this is crucial, we're going to see later on. Okay, so there's this key layman that really is crucial for our proof is that, so if you have an even-dimensional point color, An even-dimensional Poincaré Einstein manifold, and you have a natural divergence here. And then, if you take the renormalized integral of this natural divergence, it's going to be zero. So, this is actually a crucial time because then this is essentially help us to somehow bypass the ASAC decomposition. So, another key observation is the following: if you consider If you consider this, so remember I said that if you take the ambient invariant and you pull back, it's going to give you a scalar conformity invariant. Then, if you restrict it to the eigen case, then it turns out that this scalar conformity invariant is going to equal to the strandable invariant that you start with. Okay, so now I want to do a quick sketch of my technical. Of my technical theorem. So, what happens is the following: how we can turn a renormalized integral into a convergent one, right? So, if you pick a specific L, right, then this I L by definition is the pullback of the ambient formula. And it's actually in the correct way. So, if it's the correct way, we know that it's actually, you can turn it into the conformal, like, like. Like, you can turn it into, because it's conforming invariant, so you can turn it into a convergent integral here. But on the other hand, how do we relate it to any of the strandable invariants? So, this is kind of the right-hand side of our technical theorem, right? You actually turn it into a convergent integral. But what about the left-hand side, right? So, if you integrate, because the key observation here, right, if you Here, right? If you are in an Einstein case, then the renormalized integral of this i sub L here, it's going to, I know this is actually a bad notation, I realize because there are so many I here, I apologize. I should call the code or take some other notation. So if you are in the Einstein case, you know this script I sub L is going to be equal to the strandable one, right? And then the strandable one, actually, this specific I L in our earlier prophecy. I L in our earlier proposition actually shows that it will be a multiple of I, module of a divergence term. But when you do the renormalized integral of the divergence terms, it's zero. That's why you only see this renormalized integral of I. So it's a kind of a combination of all this nice observation and the key laymark where you take the renormalized divergent to be zero, then you get this nice. So you essentially, from the left-hand side, is actually the step two. You rewrite it in terms of the right. Write it in terms of the right-hand side, which is a convergent integral. And so, some application of the technique, one thing, as I said, is our main theorem one. So, actually, in Alban's paper, he actually write down more or less, not very explicit, like the formula. You need to pull the formula a little bit, but he wrote down the formula for the Fafian on the Einstein manifold. And actually, you can write it in. And actually, you can write it in terms of this PFL of bio tensor. So you can see that on the Einstein manifold, including the PE tase, then the Bobbian, the first term is going to be the, this J is essentially the sigma 1 curvature, the trace of the shell tank. And so in the PE case, this becomes a negative constant. And you have this remaining PLN and modular divergence term. So what you do is really you just take the What you do is really you just take the renormalized curvature integral, right? So the Fafian renormalized integral by Alban's result is going to give you the characteristic. And here, constant term, then it becomes renormalized button. And this is just turned copy. So this is essentially the Ethereum one. Sorry, I forgot to change the A here. Okay, so essentially, this kind of all combined together give us the tool to bypass Arizaki's decomposition in Zhang Jiang's result, and we are able. So, and we are able, again, we identify the WN in their paper by using the NBM formula. And, okay, so I have five minutes, I think. So, throughout the whole process, we actually have some interesting, nice byproduct here. But first, I want to make this remark that the strandable remaining invariant in general is not necessary to be conformally invariant. Okay, so one example is that we know while. One example is that we know while squared is strandable of a certain weight. And by earlier, like the proposition I showed you, if you take this I sub L, say take I sub 2, then you using this stuff, you create another strandable invariant, but you just really direct compute this. This would not be a conformal invariant, unfortunately. So not every strandable invariant is conformable invariant. And so, one of the interesting examples is the following. So, actually, I only take some spatial case from a recursive formula. So, it turns out that if you have a straight symmetric tensor, you can keep doing a specific type of divergence on the first term and take trace on the second term and take the divergence and keep doing this recursive formula. You can actually produce a nice scalar conform invariant. Conform invariant. And first step is you can actually use this like recursive computation, you can keep creating more and more strandable invariants. So for example, if you just take the symmetric two tensor like this, and you take this specific linear combination, then you actually create another straight sigma invariant. So and now if you consider a spatial Now, if you consider a spatial case when you take this ambient tensor to be the Riemann curvature in the ambient case, then you pull back to the conformal manifold. This will actually give you a scalar conformal invariant of the correct weight minus eight on the n-dimensional manifold. And it turns out that this shows you that if you produce using this type of recursive algorithm, you actually produce. You actually produce a scalar conformal invariant. That's always the divergence. And what's significant about this is that in Zhang Qian's formula, they actually have this W n here, the scalar conformal invariant. It turns out it's not unique because we can always add this type of divergence term, right? It will also be a scalar conformal invariant, but the integral is going to be zero, so you can keep adding it. So it turns out this is a nice surprising result that we find. Surprising result that we find out along the way. And just to finish it up, that not only, so first, the interesting story is we first do this computation kind of on the unused time manifold, but we realize that if we keep using this kind of recursive way to compute, the scalar conformity invariant we create is not just natural divergence on the Einstein manifold. It will always be divergent. On the Einstein manifold, it will always be divergent on any manifold. So, this is what happened here. So, essentially, by using our recursive construction, we can prove that in any even dimension, we can construct a lot of scalar conforming invariant of the correct weight such that it will always be a natural divergence. And the crucial reason is because we make sure the tensor we start with actually is annihilated by. Actually, it is annihilated by this x delta, which is the infinitesimal generator of the dilation. And so, we actually prove, I just want to, this is no be technical, so I just want to show you that if you pick a specific weight, it actually is true. But actually, if we have a general proposition that if you have one tensor that has weight minus 2k, then if you consider this scalar conformal invariant, This scalar conformal invariant, it's going to be weight minus n. And if we write down the local formula, it's always a divergence on any manner, not just the Einstein. Okay, so I don't want to, if you want to, these are just a couple examples we compute that, like if you want to know what's the Reynolds curvature integral of Nabla, like gradient of Weill tensor squared, then you can recover it using a scalar conformity invariant in terms of ambient formula. And you can keep computing. And you can keep computing. We compute a couple of examples in our paper. So, yeah, I would just refer you there for more complicated computation there. Okay, so I think I would just stop here. Thank you very much for your talk.
