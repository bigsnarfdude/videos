So we're happy to have Harry Gutton, who's going to tell us about a generalized teaching expression. Great, thank you very much. Yeah, thank you for inviting me. Do you have ever given a talk where I've been told so much by what I'm going to say before? So hopefully I don't disappoint the previous speakers. We'll see. Yeah, so the goal at the talk is Is to describe a fairly general construction for making metric spaces for groups to act on using walls. And there's a couple of different applications that we have for this construction. One is related to what Stephanie is going to be talking about later in the week, but the one I want to focus on today, given the setting, is taking an HHS and then making a slightly different space that you could. Slightly different space that you can replace your starting HHS with. So it has some slightly nice confined properties that make certain things slightly easier to deal with when you're just often making a structure of some type. So here's a kind of potted version of the theorem I'd like to try and get to. And then let me stick it. Okay, um Okay, um let Y the MHS is a median algebra M with a metric D. And a natural map from Y to M such that, okay, and then there's a few different things you can say here. So first of all, this is a quasi-sometry. And it also preserves, so this is a median algebra, HAJET is a coarse median spaces, and this map coarsely preserves the median. The map is equivariant, which I'm going to say like this: equivariant. I'll say like this, equivariance. And with this metric, D is coarsely injected. So that's one of the things I was supposed to say. D is coarsely injected, and I'll talk about what that means later. Then just to say one Just to say one more thing, M comes with a natural family of genesics. This is the thing Abduel said in the second talk that he gave earlier. These paths, which are like normal cube paths or Nibler Reus paths, cube complexes, which we call normal wall paths. Yeah, and which are rough GLSA controls IRI paths. Okay, so so. Okay, so what this does for you is it makes the median fine. And there's also, as we'll see, there are walls going on, which essentially equivalents saying this median is fine. And it just allows you to make certain constructions precise. So earlier, one of the things Matt said is when you have a hierarchical repository next thing, you have a gate map to it. And the gate map is like a coarse. And the gate map is like a coarse to Lipschitz map. So the whole. So here you can again take gates, but now you have something that's genuinely Lipschitz, and it's genuinely a medium morphism. So certain things are just maybe slightly nicer to deal with. This family is like coarsely transitive too. Sorry? The family is coarsely transitive. Oh yeah, between any pair of points you have one of these things. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah exactly. So yeah, any two points and m you have uh one of these paths. Have one of these paths off. Yeah, and they're preserved by the group collection who starts it with. Yeah, so these are paths that you can use to win this semi-hyperbolicity. If you started with an HHG here, then you can use these paths to get semi-hyperbolicity of that HHG, which is not something that I'm going to go into. Those aren't like finite dimensional mean algebra always complexes or something. Well, possibly, but I never said finite dimensional. So it's not necessarily finite dimension. Yeah, so it's not a finite dimensional algebra. This median algebra is going to come from a wall space. You can have infinitely many walls that are powerwise crossing. And the dimension is the same as the maximal collection of powerwise crossing. So this thing is, yeah, it's not finite dimensional. Yeah, it's not high-dimensional. Yeah, and also, there's some, okay, maybe you've got some topology from the way the thing is constructed is there's been some topology on it. The topology is not going to agree with the metric topology, but that's not something I would play on, I guess. But yeah, so the thing that I must try and get across is that the way this thing is built makes it reasonably nice to work. Makes it reasonably nice to work with in certain situations. So the two parts of the talk are: first, I'm going to describe what the general construction is that you then will need to prove this to them, feed some HHS stuff into. And then the second part, I'll say what the HHS stuff is that you feed into this to then get the same sort of stuff. I think the construction itself is largely the thing I want to highlight is something that should be useful for Highlight is something that should be useful for other things. Okay, so that's where we're going. Are there any more questions about this before I start? So it's an awkward silence. So do you know how the normal wall paths vary as you change as you find different meeting house growth? As you find different weedy algebra for different structures on the same space. Okay, so the way that I so it's going to depend a little bit on what your input is. So the input to the construction is you need to make a set of walls to run the CQ construction arguments. So the way that the So, the way that the structure will affect the paths is just in what the walls you produce are. And there's different ways of producing the walls. The actual walls that you use, it's actually pretty flexible about which ones you take. The way that we set it up in the paper that we wrote was we didn't directly interact with the HHS structure itself. We just used the fact that it's a space with a cubicle approximation theory. With a cubical approximation theorem. And so if you know nothing, so okay, so how do you prove there's a cubicle approximation theorem? You have to actually use the HHS structure and get into the popul spaces. But if you've just made the cubical approximations and forgot about the HHS structure entirely, then changing the HHS structure, but leaving the approximation where Q compact is the same, nothing would change because you could. But if you use different HHS structures to build different cube components, HI just structure just to build different cubicle approximations, then you could, in principle, build them total. I don't know if it would be a mean of the same. Well, if you do the thing you said, you're leaving the course median the same. Yeah. Yeah, okay, that's what I thought. I I didn't think about it particularly, so uh yeah, I'm not sure. Um Cool. So, yes, the language of the construction is going to be similar to the language of Sagi's construction. So, let me just briefly introduce that. So, definition. Let S be a set and P a collection of partitions. Which I'm going to call walls. So it's just a partition of S into half spaces. And so that sets up. So then an ultrafilter on P is a consistent orientation of the walls. Of the walls. Sorry, what are you positioning S or? Yeah, partitions of S. I've got a set and an element of P is a partition H into two sets H minus and H plus. So a hyperplane where S is the vertex set of the G populates. So, ie, what do I mean by consistent orientation? So, it's a function phi that chooses a half space for each wall. And it does it in such a way that if you make the half space bigger, then that forces your hand as to which wall tape. Such that if H1 and H2 are such that H2 plus is a subset of H1 plus, here's H1, here's the positive side, here's H2. Here's H2, here's the positive side. Then, if so, 5 selects a half space of each of them, so if it selects H2 plus, the smaller one over here, then it has to select H1 plus. Okay, and I'm going to write a little bit of a multi-sc I'm going to write x hat for the set of all ultra filters on P. Okay, so a couple of examples of ultra filters. So firstly, each element of S determines a principal ultra filter. Determines a principal ultra filter. X hat. So what does it need to do? For each wall, you need to select the half space. You just select the half space that contains S. Okay, and then this defines you a natural map from S to X hat. In general, it's not going to be injective or surjective, but I'm going to just identify S with its image under this map in general, and I'll forget to say the object filter determined by S, I'll just call it. The object filter determined by S, I'll just call it S and think there is, even though it's not actually injective. If every pair of points in S are separated by some wall, then it will be injective. Two more examples. Second one is S is the plane, and P is the set of V's. The set of these three lines, each line, cuts the plane into two halves. And here you have the seven principal ultrafilters here, and you also have one where you point all the walls away from the middle. And this is basically. This is basically a cube. And so, more generally, whenever you have a set of walls that cross each other, you get a cube over here, which is what Jacob was asking earlier. And then last one, S is the integers and P is the sets of cubical hyperplanes. Of cubical hyperplanes. This gives you n hat. So you get the whole of Z. Then you also get a point at infinity where you point all the walls right, and a point at minus infinity where you point all the walls left. Right. There aren't really any edges. Yeah, I've just defined a set here. There are no edges. I just put the edges, because otherwise it looked like I just drew dots in a random position. This was just supposed to be secretly window with this QT. But I haven't, there isn't a Qtl yet. There will be a QTU. Okay, right. So, with that language, I can state it's a use construction. Describes a use construction, I guess. So but Let S be a set and P at A My S P S up with walls and then given S given Given x and y ultrafilters, declare d of xy to be just count how many walls separate those two intricacies. Sorry? Yeah, so each ultrafilter determines an orientation of each wall. How many have to swap? Just how many have to swap? Yeah, so I mean, yeah, so that's the point. So terminology, a wall separates two ultra filters if those ultra filters determine opposite orientations of that wall. Yeah. Um yeah. And if you go to the principal odd filters, this is looking exactly like what the filter was. One of them's on one side, and so I pointed it that way, and they're going to both sides and passes. Now I'm going to rewrite this in a way that looks worse, but will be useful in a minute. So a different way of saying that the number of walls that separates is it's the supremum over subsets that separates. Okay, I didn't do anything there, I just rewrote it in a less intuitive way. Okay, now you make one assumption, you assume one thing, which is that Which is that this function outputs, so that it can output infinite values at the back. But if you, the one assumption you make is that for any two points in your starting set, it outputs a finite number. In first. I guess we say that C separates X from Y. Let's mean everything in C. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, I've been really sloppy with the word separate. Yeah, it's exactly what he says. Yeah, it's exactly what he says. This collection is going to separate if all of our elements separate. Where the element separating means the thing parallels. Okay, good. So you make this one assumption and then define x to be the set of all bulch filters that are at finite distance from Okay, and it doesn't matter which element of S you choose here because any two of them are at finite distance. So if you're at finite distance from one of them, you can have a finite distance for another one. So this is just some subset of ultra filters that you're looking at. And the theorem, this is the diffuse construction theorem, is that X is a catzero Q complex. Or the vertex S complexion vertex. And D is the combinatorial option. I mean, the edges in this complex are like switching one wall? Yes, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you. Two things with distance one if they differ on one wall, puts an edge to another, two things with distance one. Okay, and here's something that I forgot to say before, so I'll say it now. The set x hat of all large filters has the structure of mean. Lodge filters has a structure of a median algebra. So this just means, well, if you give, if you take three ultra filters and you want to make a median, an ultra filter is choosing orientation of each wall. If I want to declare a median, I need to tell you which orientation to choose in each wall. To choose each wall, there are only two half spaces of each wall, so because I'm taking a meaning of three things, one of them has to appear more than the other. So choose that one, and it turns out that that defines an ultra filter. It's just the majority bones median that turns it into a median algebra. There's a median algebra and a majority bones. Okay, so now I can tell you what the generalization is, and it's going to look very similar to that. Because it's really just a small observation. The generalization is, so let S P Let S P be a set of walls and I'm going to take C to be a subset of 2 to the P that is closed and the taking subsets. Okay, so this is where the word generalization applies. Where the word generalization applies, because the thing I'm generalizing is going to be take 2 to the p itself. Okay, now do the same thing. Given x and y in x hat, declare the c distance from x to y to be equal to the supremal cardinality of an element of c that separates those two things. Okay, and we have to make one assumption, which is the same assumption, it's just that the c distance from s to t is finite for any two elements on my starting set. And then define x sub C is set of X and X hat such that the C distance from X to S is finite. And again, it doesn't matter which S you choose because they're all finite distance from the fourth. Okay, and now instead of writing a theorem, I'm going to write idea. idea is that this set xc is a median, is median convex in x half, in particular it's a median algebra. And if you say more things about c, then you that turns into metric properties of this space here.  Subcomplex of X. So again, isn't a subcomplex of X. Okay, so the difference, so this, so this assumption here is Here is assuming that the total number of walls that separates any two points is finite. This is a weaker assumption. This is saying that a subset is finite. Okay, so if you satisfy the stronger thing, then you will end up with potentially a bigger vertex set because there can be more ultrafilters that are a finite distance. And the distance between those points will be smaller. Between those points will be smaller. So it's almost like a quotient of the metric, something a metric quotient. So maybe an example of that would be if you take S to be Z and you take P to be the set of the set of hyper planes. Then, as we said before, the set of older filters is z together with infinity and minus infinity. But if I take C to be the set of singletons, then every two ultrafilters are a distance of most one, because elements of C all have cardinality one, so this supremum could be one. And so X C will be the entire set of ultra filters, so I include. Sets of ultra filters, so I include infinity and minus infinity. But metrically, it would just be a clique. So it's not strictly speaking a sub-complex or a quote-unquote. And then, well, I guess that's example one, and example zero is that if you take c to be equal to two to the p, then this is just exactly the thing that's on the left point. And I'll do a couple more examples. Some have a few words smaller. The smaller C is, the worse. Yeah, it lets you kind of collapse. So yeah, so it's more interesting when you do have infinitely many walls across from each other, because there you can't do security construction because you don't satisfy that assumption. But you can still satisfy this one and still get something. Let me do more examples. In this example, I'm going to take, let S be a cat zero acute complex again, so not really talking about it. S cats zero acute complex and e the sets of pipelines. I find let C be the set of chains in E. So a chain is just a sequence, oh sorry, a chain is a sequence of walls like this, H1, H2, H3, such that H2O is a huge, Such that Hi separates Hi minus one from Hi plus one for all I. We're calling it a chain of that point. And so if I take C to be this thing, then this is something that I've all kind of hinted at towards the end of this talk: is that then xc will, in this case, exactly be. In this case, exactly the S with the LMS metric, which is a nice heligraph. And more generally, in general. In general, if C is the set of chains in P, so this, all I'm saying here is that we didn't use the assumption that this was a Peteric inquiries. If you just take C to the set of chains in P, then X C is a Hallograph. And we'll almost prove that in a bit. I want to do one more example, which is: so let S be the hyperbolic plane. And P, I'm going to say walls defined by geodesics in the way that I'll draw in the picture. So what I mean is just take any geodesic and as you can see it cuts it into two halves. The wall is just going to be those are the two half spaces. Okay so there's uncountably many of those things and uncountably many the parallels cross extremely bad. Now let's see Now, let's see the set of chains of geodesics, or walls induced by chains of geodesics. What's the right way of saying this? Sets of chains of walls induced by GLS at a distance at least one. Okay, so here's one genesic, and now we're going to make a chain like this, and this distance has to be at least one. And so now we're going to say Elements of C. Okay, so yeah, like I said, uncounterly many walls, uncountedly many pairways cross, but something that you can check is that here Xc will be quasi-asymmetric to H2. So even though you made this extremely terrible collection of walls, some Terrible collection of walls, somehow you were able to get rid of, to some extent, the terribleness by making the right choice of C. And it's not too hard to see that it's quasi-asymmetric, but well it's embedded, because if I take two points in the hyperbolic plane, then if I want to know the c distance, I have to find a chain of geodesics to separate them, where the geodesics are a distance of at least one. How long can that thing be? Well, it can't be longer than the distance between those points, because it has to go in between. Going between. That gives you one bound. And the other is just take your two points, take your geodesic between them, and then just look at geodesics that cross a follow-up. And that will build you something of potential distance in that. Okay. Something that I now this is a slight simplification of something that Slight simplification of something that you can make work for any hyperbolic space. Here I actually tucked things up with geodesics, but by doing a slightly tweaked version of it, you can make this work for any hyperbolic space. And in general, you'll get something quasi-symmetric to that bolt space you started with. And that tells you that this thing has to give you something weaker, something more less rigid than the K0Q complex, because it's going to be working for all hyperbolic groups, including those property T, which can't act on the Q complex. So it has to keep itself a But it has to give you something less rigid, but it can still give you something interesting. It's going to give me a body packet functionality. Well, taking more time than expected first. First statement in our film here, the next series that you broke. Yes. And in this particular context of Our next one, I think, with lots of words. Uh forces the convergence to a single point so the sorry? How should one think of the heavy property of six initiatives? So I don't know if this is the best way of thinking about oh oh. Um so being a heligraph is about balls in this metric that In this metric that intersect pairwise. And at least I think of this, so this space XC, its underlying set is something bigger than the hyperbolic plane. You can think of it as sort of having lots of sort of corners of tubes kind of sticking off it somehow. And then the balls will be... Well, yeah, no, I haven't thought about what the balls actually look like in the world itself. But maybe, yeah. I mean, if you want to make something quasi-social. If you want to make something quasi-smith with a hyperbolic plane where a Heli property holds a ball, then there's an easier way to do it. You could you could do just something like tile the hybrid plane by squares and then put the element convention on that. So if the hybrid plane, there are much better things than this. It's doing something that's locally uncounted than you. Yeah, right, right. It's going to get quite full in version. If there's anything yeah, yeah, so yeah, you c the commonality of the set of things that I wasn't setting it it's yeah still, yeah. Yeah. You see it more from the I'm gonna say something in a second which is which if you change the constant to zero will give you a proof of this. Um but um it's r it's really coming out of the the median and the wall structure this this this dialogue section. Questions? Yeah, so okay, so what we're gonna do now is uh Do now is just describe how this machinery of ultra filters. So, like I said, if you want to just make something quasi-symmetric to H2 that's median, which is much better, you just do. But this perspective with ultra filters is useful and makes certain arguments quite straightforward. That's kind of the thing that I said was the point of the introduction at the beginning. So, I'd like to illustrate an example of somewhere where. An example of somewhere where that happens. So the main kind of simple tool that you have that makes ultra filters nice is the ultra filter lineup. And this just says that every ultrafilter on some subset of P Subset of P extends to an ultraviolet on P. And why this is useful is it means that if you want to produce a point that has a certain property, you can be a bit lazy and you can just look at some walls and do the right thing on those, and then you say, oh, there. On those, and then you say, Oh, there exists someone that satisfies those things simultaneously, and if you cook those things up in the right way, then that will satisfy the property that you want. So, for instance, we can give a simple proof of the coarse injectivity of the dual space and making the possible zero force of this thing. So, definition. A metric space is coarse and injective. It's force and injective if for any collection of points xi and radii Ri such that Ri plus Rj is at least the distance from xi to xj for ij. For IPJ, there exists some point X such that the distance from X, I to X, is almost Ri plus delta. So in words more similar to what Abdul said when he was designing injective spaces, if you have a geodesic space, then it's delta coarsely injective if whenever you have a collection of balls that have Whenever you have a collection of balls that intersect pairwise, you can thicken those balls up by delta, and there'll be a point that lies in all of those thick conductings. Now I'm going to state a property of a choice of C that you can use here. Subset Subset C of the set of all change P is ungluable if basically this picture happens. So if you've got some element of C here, C1, and you've got another one here, C2, then So that together they're forming a chain. Their union might not be in C, but I want that after I throw away M things, it is in C. So C1 and C2 in C form a chain. There is a V obtained in a union, obtained by throwing away. Obtaining a union obtained by throwing away a next M. So it's that B is a C. So, as an example, this collection C over here is one global. Over here is one global because if I have a chain of walls defined by geodesics, where they're all at distance one, then I have another one where these ones are all at distance one. These two in the middle are going to be a distance one, but if I just throw away one of them, then these two will be one. This example over here is one before. What does it mean for C1, C2, and four? It means, so C is a subset of the set of chains, so C1 is itself. Set of chains. So C1 is itself a chain like this. And C1 union C2 is some collection of walls. And I want that to be a chain. Are chains finite? They don't have to be. But I want it to be in this order. So, in order for this to make sense, this could be infinite that way, but it couldn't be bi-infinite. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uh object in that order. Yeah, so I I don't I don't want it to be interleaving or anything like this, I want it to be C1. Okay, and then here's the tool is that if C is M global then X C is 2 M. Is 2M costly injector. Okay, yeah. And so if you take C to be the set of all chains, then that will be zero global. And then that will turn into the Helograph statement that was there before. Okay. And the proof of this is pretty straightforward. It just uses this old. Pretty straightforward. It just uses this old filter button here to do the thing better. So let's sketch it. I don't want to provide details, even though they're not difficult. So given a set of points and radii, as in the definition of cost and injective. Each i let Qi be the set of all walls that are sufficiently far away from Xi so that there exists a C in C. No, that's not the way I want to phrase this. Oh no, this is the Oh no, this is the way I'm operating. Yeah. There exists C and C such that are separating X from H with length at least Ri plus 2m. So it's just a set of walls that are far away because there's That are far away because there's a long special chain in between. Yeah, yes, yes, thank you. Thanks. Yeah, so okay, so the picture is here's here's xi and then just here's h over here. And if I want h to be a qi, I have to be able to find some c and c of length. C of length Ri plus 2m. And if I can find such a thing, then I throw H into the collection. Okay, so now, having done that, for each H in QI, set phi of H to be the half-space. To be the half space containing Xi So Phi is an ultra filter on QI. That's something to be checked there, but that's true. And actually, as well as being an ultra-filter on QI, As well as being an ultra filter on QI, something that you can check using the gluability is that it's actually phi is a well-defined ultrafilter on the union of the QI and again, that's not so difficult to check. Difficult to check, straight from the definition. And so by the ultrafilter lemma, it extends to an ultrafilter lump P, in other words, an element of x hat. Right, and then this phi is going to be exactly the point that I wanted to find in the definition. That I wanted to find in the definition of costly injected. So, in order to check that, I just need to check that it's a distance at most ri plus 2m from each of the hexi. But it has to be, because if this phi was really far away from hexi, what would that mean? That would exactly mean that there was an element of c that separated it from hex i and had length more than the big number. The big number. But the way I define qi means that that's not possible because there aren't any long things that separate this algeb filter from xi. So it has to be in the ball of radius ri plus 2m around each x. And then in particular, that tells you that it's actually inside xc. It's a finite distance from this point xr. So it's a finite distance from the point. Yeah, so and yeah, um and the proof and the proof I was very slow. Well, yeah, I'm kind of running out of time now, haven't I? So my plan was to tell you how you do this for HHSs. I'm not going to be able to do that in a sensible way, but maybe I can just write something very brief to outline how you do it. So, I mean, Abdul kind of hinted at it at the end of his talk. So So, what do you need in order to be able to apply this construction? You need two things. You need a collection of walls, and you need a choice of C. And if I want to end up with something cost injected in the end, then I should have a wall like this. The interesting part of that is choosing the, is making the set of walls. And that's pretty much, well, it's using the Well, it's using the cube, you can think of it as using the cubical approximation, or you can think of it like Abdul said, of projecting into one of the hyperbolic spaces and looking at which side of some geodesic there that you project to. But anyway, there's a couple of different ways of cooking it up. But walls come from cubicle approximation. Cubicle approximation in some form or other. So, given some other points, so I'm going to take a section in the middle of this that's kind of long, and then the way I'm going to make a wall on this is This is if I take any other point y, then its median with A and B lives in this hull. Then, if I take the cubicle approximation, I just look at which side of this orange bit in the middle it ends up on. So, take the median turn up in here, do the cubicle approximation. If you have it on this side, you're in one half space. If you have it on the other side, you're in the other half space. The way I said it, there's actually three half spaces, so there's a small fiddle here. Spaces, so there's a small fiddle that you have to do there. But that's essentially how you make the walls. And then once you've got the walls, the way you make C is you do something that's kind of similar to the example with H2, where you take chains that are kind of far apart from each other. You don't want to have everything kind of bunching up too much at the dinner distance as well as C is basically Far apart ends. And then once you've cooked it up like that, it's fairly straightforward to check that the C satisfies the various, for example, this combinatorial condition being global. And so then you just plug it into the construction that I said, and you end up with some costly objective. Of course, the objective, and yeah. And it's fairly that the other part of the dimness I stated was that this space that you've got out Xc is quasi-symmetric to the HHS you started with. The distance part of that is fairly straightforward. The com the slightly complicated part is checking that um the map from the HHS to this X C is costly surjective. Xc is costly subjective, but not so hopeless, but anyway, I should stop rambling now. The time's up. So, in this case, can you tell from the HGS structure which M you get so that C is M global? I think that the way we did. I think that the way we did it, M was like 5 or something like that. It was just a number. Is it 2? Okay. It's a small integer. Okay. And it basically depends on something else, but actually. So yeah, so where do all of the HHS constants go? They go into the thin. They go into how wide. Like they go into how wide this thing is, and then you see them in what the quasi-osomatic constants were. So, for the gluability itself, that's just something combinatorial about these walls and stuff. So, you will get a small machine in that H2 break. Yeah, it's basically the same as an H2. Okay. Yeah, the place where you see the ADHS constants is how to choose the walls and then what constants you get for the quasi-medium. I think the quasi-medium is actually just small. So, other good C's that you can take? So, another C that you can take, so if you take C to be all of the chains, that's what it appears, another one is if you overuse the word second. To overuse the word separated again, two walls are L separated if you can't find another chain of walls like this that costs them both of length L. So if any such chain like this has some length L, then you call these two guys L7. Now, if you choose L big enough, then if you take Then, if you take C to be the set of L-separated chains, then the space you'll get out of this construction will be a hyperbolic space, and it will be quasi-symmetric to the ABD top-level curve graph. So, you can remake the curve graph in this way. Those are the two interesting ones that we have. Yeah, and a more general version of that, you can end up with well, in a more general setting, you can make a different set of walls in a different setting and use something similar to this L separated guys and make a space that sees the contracting elements of platforms. Oh, yeah, something I didn't say here was: if you choke, if you make things, make it so that the set of walls. You make it so that the set of walls you have and the set C is invariant under some group action, then the space you end up with at the end will have an action in the same group. I mean, I'll talk more about it, but finally, can you say go ahead or quickly like how, I don't know if something happens. But like why this gives you a byte control. But there are also byte-hired controls. Is that easy to say how that works? How to get that? Yeah, so right, so in this space, which I didn't completely define, one thing that's again not too tricky to show is that balls are gated. So if I take all about point X, then so X C is a median algebra and it's Xc is a median algebra, and it's actually gated in the sense that whenever you take some other point Y, there's some gate G. So that for any other point in the ball, the median of that point G of Y is G. So it gives you a good projection to balls. And then the way that you build the paths is you just take larger and larger balls around X and gate Y to those balls. Gate y to those balls. And that builds you a path. So if maybe I put y over here, and then the sequence, and then my sequence of balls looks like this. And if I gate y here, then I get this point. If I get this, then I get this point. And this builds you a path. And if you were in a cat zero Q complex, this would be exactly the Nibeluri's normal Q path. But just because the But, or just because the balls here were gated, you can just say the same instruction. This builds you, this builds you a path. These are the normal wall paths that I say. And the fellow traveling is essentially just because the gate map is one which crossing, if the image of two gates were separated by some wall, then the two gates have had to be separated by a wall. Hierarchy clouds because Hierarchy path because it's a median path. Um so yeah, so the path was cooked up by just doing gates to the same thing every time. So it's simple to check that the median of three of these points is just the one in the middle. And then the fact that this space that you built is quasi-median, quasi-osymmetrics in the HHS of Starting with tells you that this path is a quasi-median path in the HHS. In the HHS, and therefore a hierarchy path. This is not a symmetric construction. It's not symmetric, no, but the Nibra Reeves normal Q paths are also not symmetric. So it's no less symmetric than that one was. But yeah, it's not symmetric. But it's a by coming out of coming, right? So it depends. Yeah, you can perturb. Perturbing both ends, it stays, it's still, yeah, so. Right, so how do you see that? Because it's not symmetrical, I mean, it's coming. How do you see that? Okay, so let me perturb x to x prime, and let me perturb y to We just even leave y where it is. Well, so what's the difference between a ball around x prime and a ball around x? It's only really going to be different, roughly it's only different with the ones that in between. So as I start making bigger balls, once I if you think about it in terms of which walls you've crossed, like Of which walls you've crossed. Like, the gate, this ball is exactly: take all of the walls that are far, that are distance two from x and point them towards x. And if I start progressing away from x prime, at some point those walls are also far away from x. Right, I guess the point. So x and x prime only differ by a small number of walls and then you've done it, okay. Like that the gauge buttons. Like that the gate part is lip sheets and the team of the parts of like sheets. I should just so one nice thing about this space is that all the coarseness disappears actually. So the gate maps become one of the trends of the north, which is very clean. And that's why the fact it gives us like a rough geodesic as opposed to everything that quasi geodesicity. Okay, so let's thank Eric again. Okay, so we're going to come in now for the next hour with smaller group discussions. So we're going to have two simultaneously. The one in this room is going to be about commentarial interjections, and the one in the room next door, 202, is going to be about tubulation in the halls, so more about wall spaces, tubulation. Spaces and stipulations. And the idea of the discussions is there's going to be one person sort of moderating those discussions, kind of an expert in each of those respective areas. Greg, you saw those questions.
