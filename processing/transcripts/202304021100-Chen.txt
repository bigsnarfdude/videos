All right, here we go. Good to go. So, Jan Zuchen is going to be talking to us about theta liftings for dual prayers of loops. So, go ahead and take it away, Yanz. Thank you all for coming. And I'm very sorry for this delay on this care list. Yeah, so today I'm going to talk about data networks, GR and GR and your pairs of groups, and this is a joint work. Groups, and this is a joint work with my supervisor Yung Chang Zhu when I was a PhD student. And we start with the introduction on graphical data lifting, and then we move to the group case. So let F be a local field, and for some reason, we suppose F is not equal to the complex numbers. And for simplicity, the global aspect will be over the rational numbers Q. So we can just assume F is a. We can just assume F is a local completion of Q. And let's, oh, I'm sorry. And let's perceive the non-trivial additive character of this local field F in order to do harmonic analysis. And we introduce the space of Schwartz functions on f to the n. And I need to explain this because if f is the real numbers, then this is just the usual Schwartz space we learn in a course of functional analysis. In a course of functional analysis. And if f is a pi-i field, we cannot mimic the definition of Schwabart's functions because of the difference between the topology, the nature of the topology of pi-i fields and the real numbers. So the space of Schwabz functions will simply be defined to be the space of functions that are compactly supported and locally constant. And this definition respects the totally disconnected nature of the code. Disconnected nature of the geodes topology. And the so-called single-shell way representation is a projective representation of the symbolic group over the local field F on the space of Schwartz functions on the field F. And this representation is somehow related to quantum physics because it's originally defined as symmetries of representations of the Heisenberg. Of representations of the Heisenberg group or the Heisenberg-Lie algebra. But I will not record a rather involved definition of this, and I will give you a working definition in the next slide. And because this is a projective representation, it can be lifted to a central extension of the symbolic group. And in this case, the central extension is just a two-fold cover, which is the best case you can imagine. And so, this two-fold cover will be called. This troubles cover will be called the metapathic group. And now I will tell you what the projective W representation looks like for some special types of elements in the semantic group. So first of all, if A is an invertible matrix, then I can consider this specific element in the semantic group, which is just block diagonal with two blocks. And for this kind of elements, the Of elements, the v representation x, like a translation of the vector x. Recall that the value representation is defined on the space of Trivat functions in n variables. So GLN will act on this. And here, the GLN acts on the right, which is because of the convention in way representations, we always take the vectors to be row vectors rather than column vectors. And here the vector of determinants is used. Of determinants is used to make the action unitary. So the whole way representation can be extended to a unitary representation on the L2 space rather than the Schwartz space, but we will not use this fact. And the second type of element is element like this, which is a blockwise upper triangular and the block elements are just identity matrices and the rest is a symmetric n-by-n matrix. Symmetric n by n matrix. And for this kind of elements in a sympathetic group, this way representation just multiply this function s by a quadratic character determined by the character P C we fixed previously. And finally, for this specific element, which lies in the while group of the synthetic group, the way representation. Group, the way representation acts like a Fourier transform on all the variables, where this gamma is a certain wave index, which is an eighth root of unity. It's some constant, actually. And for other viral group elements in the synthetic group, you can imagine it will act by partial Fourier transforms on separated variables because we have unvariables. And this types of elements will generate the whole. Types of elements will generate the whole sympathetic group. So actually, we can read off the whole productive way representation from the action of this kind of elements. And I should remark that all of these operations are unitary. And also, there is a global version of the wave representation. And for simplicity, I will work over the field of rational numbers and let A be the ring of Adele's. The ring of adeus, and we also take a global non-trivial character which can be factorized as a product of local ones. And as we always did in the theory of monomorphic forms, we can define global objects by a restricted product of the local objects. So we can define the base of Schwartz functions roughly as the restricted tensor product of the local. Restricted tensor product of the local spaces of Schwartz functions over all the places. And the global wave representation is also defined as a restricted tensor product of the local components, which are the local way representations we defined before. And this also lifts to a two-fold cover of the syncretic group over the Adels. And the important thing is that this central extension splits over the Sympathetic group over the rational numbers, which means that we can define automorphic forms on the twofold cover, the metaphoric cover of synthetic group. So recall that an automorphic form on a group actually write something here. So let G be some algebraic group and automorphic form on G is G is roughly a function G over the adios, which is invariant over the rational, g over the rationales and satisfying some other technical conditions. And even if G is not an algebraic group in our case, and it has the discrete subgroup, SC, or synthetic group over the rational numbers so that we still can define automotive form. That we still can define automorphic forms in this way. And there is a data distribution on the space of Schwartz functions simply defined by summation over the lattice q to the nth power in the adequate to the nth power. And this data function, this data distribution is variant under the action of the rational sympathetic group. And this is, if we replace this A. If we replace this A to the real numbers and we replace the discrete group Q to be some discrete group the SP2 over the real numbers, then this will give the classical data functions or data distributions. This side of the board? Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, so towards us, towards. So, uh, towards us, towards me, towards you on the other side of the monarch this way, over where we started. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Annie. You're good, perfect. There we go. I'm sorry, Annie. And then I will introduce the concept of dual pairs in a symbolic group. To do beta lifting, we need a dual pair of reductive subgroups in the symbolic group. And a dual pair is a pair of subgroups that are mutually centralized. That are mutually centralized of each other in a certain sense, but it's not very important for us, so I will not recall the concrete definition. And the most important example of that is let W be a sympathetic space, let V be an orthogonal space, then their tensor product will carry a natural sympathetic form. Just by you multiply the sympathetic form on W and the symmetric bilinear form on V. Symmetric bilinear form on V, this will give us sympathetic form because minus one times one is equal to minus one, sometimes something like that. And so you can verify that the synthetic group on W and the orthogonal group on V both acts on the tensor product space, and the action preserves the synthetic form on the tensor product space. So this gives an embedding of G times G prime into the Of G times G prime into the sympathetic group over the tensor product space. And this will give the sympathetic orthogonal type of dual pairs, which is the most important type of dual pairs in the theory of morphic forms. But we will not use this. We will use a GL and GLN type anyway. And data lifting is a method of constructing automorphic forms on one of the groups in the dual pair. Groups in the dual pair to the other. So let's so we fix a dual pair and we recall that omega is the way representation. So this is a typo. This means that sympathetic group acts on this space rather than there is a map. I'm sorry. And let theta be the theta function of defined before by summation on the lattice. And the theta lifting starts from an automorphic form on the group G prime. form on the group G prime and it is defined by integration against the theta kernel. So this is a general way of defining things between two function spaces. So if you have a function on a space X and you want to get a function on another space Y, the way to do this is you find some kernel on the space on the product space X times Y and you integrate And you integrate with respect to that kernel. So here the kernel we use is the kernel given by the theta functional and the way representation. So for a pair of points g and g prime in the product of g and g prime, we first use weight representation to act on some Schwartz function. And then we take the theta function so that we get a number. And this gives theta This gives the theta kernel. So this theta lifting also depends on the Schwartz function f as is indicated in this notation. It turns out that at least in good cases, this will give us an automorphic form on the group G or on the central extension of the group G. And this gives us a method of construction of automorphic forms on. Automorphic forms on one group from another. So I will give you two classical examples of this method. The first one is a famous thing called Shimura correspondence. In a paper in 1973, Shimura finds some way to start from a modular form, a classical modular form of half integral weight, to construct an ordinary class form out of a modular form of half integral weight. Modular form of half integral weights. And his method is rather invoked because, first of all, he writes down the Fourier coefficients of this modular form of half integral weight, and he tried to guess what should be the Fourier coefficients of this curve form. And after finding the correct answer, he used some very complicated theorem called converse theorems from Andrew Wei to prove that these Fourier coefficients will give a custom. Coefficients will give a task form. And a more conceptual explanation of the discovery of Shimura is to use theta correspondence. So a modular form of half integral weight can be explained as an automorphic form on the metaplatic cover of the group SL2. And the ordinary class form is done by doing theta lifting with respect to the dual pair SL2 and pair SO2 and SO21 inside the fixed matrix group. And the second example I'm going to talk about is the Ziegler wave formula. It is for the dual pair SV2 and OM. Here I take the compact ones. So this is the orthogonal group that is compact. In order to make the integration In order to make the integration converge. And the result is the data lifting of the constant function on the orthogonal group to the synthetic group is an Eisenstein series induced from the single paramodic subgroup of SP2N. And the power of this formula is that after taking constant terms of both sides, this will give the classical mass formula of a weighted sum of quadratic forms in a certain genus. Forms in a certain genus. And this work dates back to the work of Minkowski and I believe also Ziegler and maybe some other people. And here, a weighted sum means that we count the quadratic forms, modulo the size of their automorphism groups. And this will give the orthogonal size because you can imagine that. Imagine that quadratic forms, the quadratic forms have some automorphism groups, symmetries, have some symmetric groups like the orthogonal group. And on the other side, it comes from a computation of the constant term of the ziego-parabolic Eisenstein series, which is also something standard in the theory of automotive forms. And this is the dual pair we will consider today. We will consider today. So we start with the sympathetic space W, which is a sum of two copies of the vector space of n by n matrices. So this sympathetic space has dimension 2n square. And there is a usual sympathetic form defined by this formula on this syncretic space. And we have two copies of GLN, which acts on this. Which acts on this sympathetic space by this, by a formula of this type, is just roughly just left and right actions of two GLNs on the space of matrices. And this section will preserve the semantic form by easy computation. So this gives an embedding of GLN times GLN into the big semantic group of size 2n square. And it also satisfies the calculation. And it also satisfies the technical conditions so that GR and GRN is a dual pair in the sense before. Okay, so now we can roughly talk about the data list things for loop groups. So I first of all still let FBA local. Still, let F be a local field as before. And loop groups are groups, are somehow classical groups over the field of Laurent series with coefficients in the local field. So we have the loop group, and we now have a space of so-called Schwartz functions on this infinite-dimensional vector space listed here. And I have to say, the working definition of this is that the restriction to any finite dimensional subspace is. Dimensional subspace is a Schwartz space in the usual sense, but this is only a working definition. Maybe there are some better definitions. Also, this can be found in the same part of some later part of this talk. And my supervisor proved that there is a generalization of the way representation. And there is also a global version of the wave representation just by placing the local pieces together as before. And also the data function converges on a certain subspace of the I'm sorry. The theta function also converges on a subspace of the Schwartz space I defined before. So we can consider the theta liftings for the GLN, GLN dual pair. And we start with a classical task form V. Our group GR. This is a finite dimensional group. So we can talk about a casp forms, caspier automobic forms in the usual sense. And we pull back to the subgroup of the roof group. And then we use this pullback to do the theta lifting integration. And our main theorem is that the theta lifting of this guy is equal to a certain Eisenstein series induced from this complicated functional. This complicated functional. And this is similar to the form of my Ziegler wave formula, but the proofs are entirely different. The Ziegler wave formula also says that something theta is equal to something Eisenstein, like this. Okay, so I will put some time to introduce our idea of computation of this guy. The difficulty is that the loop group of this type are highly infinite dimensional. Are highly infinite-dimensional. If you view the loop sympathetic group as a variety over the local field F, then this is very infinite-dimensional. So, how can we do harmonic analysis on such an infinite-dimensional object? There is another model of the wave representation in the loop case, which is essentially due to the work of Kapronov and also inspired from the work of Parshin. From the work of Pershing. So, in order to motivate this definition, I will tell you this easier case of defining the space of Schwartz functions on a narrow-median local field F. And this F is and I recall that the Schwartz functions mean locally constant complexity supported functions on a non-like media local field. I will give you the description. The description of that. So let M be the maximum ideal in the ring of integers of F, and then the powers of this M, including the negative powers, will give a filtration of the local field F. And for any, and let small F be the residual field. So for any finite dimensional vector space V over the residue field, V is a finite set. And let F B be the same. And let Fb be the C vector space of complex valued functions on S V. So, for any linear map between F vector spaces, we will have two induced maps of pullback and push forward, where pullback is just the pullback of functions, and push forward will be the summation over the fibers of the map. Here, the fibers are all finite, so there is no analytical problem. And for any triple of integers, we have this easy short exact sequence of finite-dimensional vector spaces. And the observation of parting is that the space of Schwartz functions can be defined as a double inductive limit of the sub-quotients of the local field f. So you will have four ways to take of combinations of taking limits because you have go back and push forward. Because you have go back and push forward. So you can take inductive and projective limits on each level of i and j. So there are in total four ways. And one way will give the space of Gravana's functions. The other three ways will give some other function spaces such as distributions or compactly supported distributions. Something like that. So this totally algebraic description of the Schwartz space will be the blueprint of our model. So in our model, we will So, in our model, we will, instead of the filtration on the local field itself, we have another parameter t. So, we can define the filtration by using the powers of t. So we define Li to be t to the i power, and this will play the role of the ideals m i before. And we can also define a double limit of the quotients. So, here each quotient, each. Here, each subquotient is a finite dimensional vector space over the local field. So, we can take the Schwartz spaces over the subquotients and we take the double limits of this guy. But there is a problem because now when we take push forward, namely integration on fibers, the fibers are finite dimensional F spaces. So, in order to do integration, we need some hard measure. And it is measures. And it is measures that can be pushed forward canonically rather than functions. So we have to make a correction by introducing some compatible family of hard measures. And finally, our model will be compatible families of elements in this tensor product for all the IMJ, satisfying some natural compatibility relation so that they give an element in the limit. Perfect. That might be a good time to. Yeah. Yeah. So I do not have time. Yeah, so I do not have time to discuss the computation, but this is not the important part I want to emphasize. Thank you.
