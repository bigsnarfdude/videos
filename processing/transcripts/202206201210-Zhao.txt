Hello? Hello? Do you hear me well? Yes, yes, we hear you. Yes, yes. Okay, okay, very good, very good. Yeah, so well, thanks for the invitation. So this is mapping I'm going to talk. And so this is just a very simple complex web mapping. And this is a very simple mapping. This is a very simple mapping which does quite some wonders in classical and social mechanics. So just to name a few. So this is essentially the reason that it does so to the first place, that it induces a correspondence between the Hooke problem of a pair of harmonic oscillators with same frequency and the Blanner-Kepler problem. And by doing so, because the Hooke center is irregular, while the Kaplan center is singular, it simultaneously brings regularization of the Kapla problem, and this extends to regularly perturbed Kaplan problems. So one can add perturbations to this Kaplan problem, and with this procedure, the collision singularity can be regularized. And also this And also, by this very mapping, it separates a class of natural mechanical problems, including in particular the capital problem. So this, for example, provides one way to show the integrability of the capital problem as well as its class of problems. And for example, for the capital problem, this brings also one way to solve the problem, actually. So there are some variants of this complex problem. So there are some variants of this compact permitting. Instead of Z2, Z2, of course, we can consider Z2, Zk. And this is known to regularize also, so in a more or less similar way, some homogeneous potentials with this Mikey exponents, as has been studied by Mikey. But it was actually known much before, as I will come through towards the end of this talk. And so, and also there is this mapping. So, this goes, so that goes to Z plus Z minus one over two. And so this is mapping for which Birkhoff regularized simultaneously the two double collisions in a restricted three-body problem in the plan. And precisely speaking, this brings a simultaneous regularization of the perturbed two center problems. Sorry, two center problems with two Kepler centers at one and minus one respectively in the complex density. And then by replacing complex Z by a quartenium and taking this map, so Q goes to Q bar IQ for Q being a quartanium. This is a well-known CUSA-HIMO steefer regularization mapping, which can be used. mapping which can be used to link the spatial Kepler problem so the Kepler pro so the Kepler problem in three-dimensional space to four-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillators so to the four-dimensional hook problem and this brings a way to regularize the spatial three body problem there are actually more as I also received some from feedback also some matrix so by some kind of clever matrix multiplication multiplications and so on. There are actually more. But these are the streams which somehow appeals to me. And to explain this mapping, I would just recall this Hooke-Kepler correspondence. For my purpose, it's maybe best to do it in this Hamiltonian formalism. So I'll just take the Hamiltonian of the Kepler problem and then I The Kepler problem, and then I fix it to some energy level. So, in the phase space, this then defines some hyper surface. Here we have P and Q just canonical complex variables. So P1 plus IP2 and Q1 plus RIIQ2. And so the energy of the Kappa problem is then like in this form minus F and the mass factor. And the mass factor is in this case S. And then I can multiply on both sides of this equation by the norm of Q. So this does not change this hypersurface in the phase space. And therefore, it does not change its allergy its Cauchy characteristics. And in particular, this just reparametrizes the flow of the type of... The flow of the type of problem on this energy hypersurface. And then I one can pull back this complex square mapping. So this is just a lift of the mapping to make it canonical, canonical in the QP variables as well, as in this Z, so canonical, so from the QP variables to the Z W variables. that w variables and then plug everything in we find that this is uh this is just the hamilton of the um of the of the hook problem now with this uh with this uh um so with this parameter f with this string string constant f with energy s so by by by doing this very simple project you one one one one gets from the kepler problem to the to the to the hook problem And now with the very same thing, one can try to regularize the capital problem with some regular perturbation added. For example, one can add a perturbation of the capital problem with this additional perturbation on the potential. So V of Q, assuming that this is something regular, at least locally around the at least locally around the Kepler center. And then we just do the same process. We do this time parameterization and then we pull back. So what we see is that the first two terms describe this hook problem, this isotropic harmonic oscillators, with the center it has some strength, but it's completely regular. And S is a constant. And then we pertube this with some additional term. So this norm of that square times V of that square. times V of that square. When that is very small, meaning that the particle stays very close to the capital center, then if the norm of V is bounded in this region, then the perturbation will become very small. So this procedure transforms the problem of perturbing a singular center to the problem of perturbing some center with regular With regular behavior, but with some strength by something which is very, very small in the neighborhood. So, anyways, the singularity at the center of the perturbed capital is now regularized. And everything is now regular. One can just use usual tools to study it. And a slight extension is that this can also be used to regularize fourth capital problems. So, for example, one can take So for example, one can take a Hamiltonian, which is now, so the perturbation depends also on the time t. And this is a standard method that one can consider the problem as so this time-dependent Hamiltonian system as an autonomous system with one degree of freedom higher, which is addition of a variable tau. Variable tau, which is going to be conjugate to the variable t. And in this extended phase space, one would rather consider this time variable t rather as a space variable. So the time variable is something else, rather 52s. And here, everything is just a space variable. So Q and T are just variables for the configuration. And T and tau are the momenta, let's say. Let's say. And because the time in setting is already fictitious, it does not cause anything to change it again, just by the same procedure. But now we are changing some fictitious time. So it's again fictitious and so it doesn't matter, but we get such a system which if we pull back again by this corresponding transformation based on this complex query mapping. Based on this complex quality mapping, then again, we get this problem for which we're perturbing a regular center by something which is very small. So this is essentially the procedure. It's again regularized. And I'll try just to mention some applications of this regularization method. There are actually many, many, many of them. This has been used extensively for many, many years. For many, many years, essentially after the work of Levi Chivita in uncertain mechanics. For example, personally, I learned this transformation first from the thesis of Rakferos. And this has been also recently used extensively by synthetic topologists, well, by synthetic topologists when they try to apply methods from synthetic topology to the problem of The problem of so most, so in most cases, the restricted three-body problem. And in order to use all these kinds of global methods, the first thing that they should do is to regularize the problem. And so, and in particular, this procedure also enables to search for periodic orbits of the periodically forced capital problem with some double collisions allowed. And this essentially is well. essentially is uh well consisting many research works of many of my friends and colleagues and also well and myself included so in in 2019 uh with uh alberto bosscatin and rafi otica we applied this regularization in extended phase base method to the periodically forced kept problem and we we showed the abundance of generalized periodic Abundance of generalized periodic orbits, intimation two and three. Essentially, so you get as many periodic, so periodic orbits as you want, as long as the perturbation is assumed to be sufficiently small. And then later with Rafi Ottica, we made some completion, and in particular, we explained that this result applies to the restricted free body problem. So you get many of such obes in the restricted free body problem. Or be in the restricted three-body problem with some possible double collisions, which you should consider as recognized. And then there appears this very interesting work of Barrotero, Vercini, and Ottiga, which they apply regularization in a variational setting. And they are in particular they showed that when the fourth term is globally well defined, then actually there exists infinitely many generalized periodic orbits. Generalized periodic objects. So, I think, so Vimina will talk more about it, but I'm very much inspired by this work. And then I was asking myself whether this approach of doing regularization on this extended phase space can also say something or something similar in this setting. And indeed, it can. And by some analysis, the result I can get is that there are actually infinite many of In fact, many of such hobbies already in an arbitrary small neighborhood of one of the centers. And this result applies also to the restricted three-body problem, implying that in a elliptic restricted three-body problem, then you can have infinitely many periodic orbits accumulating to both of the primaries. To both of the primaries. So, with the same process, you actually once sees that this set-to-set square mapping also separates the Kepler problem. So, again, with the same thing, which we consider the Kepler problem with some additional perturbation. And then we do the same type of transformation. But now, what we see is that the first two terms are already separated. So, this is just a is just so some small Hamiltonian in the variable Z1W1 and some small Hamiltonian in the variable Z2W2. So as long as this additional term is separated in Z1 and Z2 coordinates, then the whole system will be separated. And therefore, the system will be integrable and so on. For example, one of the quite interesting example which falls into this line is just this star problem in which V of Q is something In which V of Q is something linear in Q1. So some term times Q1. This is for me maybe the simplest way to see the interprabability of this problem. So separability of a system under such a mapping will have quite some applications. So later we'll talk about some of this, but maybe with a slightly more complicated. Slightly more complicated setup. So, the next thing I'd like to talk about is the, well, it's a mechanical billiards. So, by a mechanical billiard, we refer to a model that a particle moves under a force field, a conservative force field on the rebellion manifold, which in addition gets reflected elastically against some reflection wall, so one-dimensional line. so one dimensional uh line or one one dimensional curve in this romanian manifold and according to this law so the the the angle of uh of um so so so the the angle of uh um uh yeah so the right so the this incoming angle equals to the to the to the reflection angle when they are measured with respect to the tangential direction and then when the force field is zero then this The force field is zero, then this reduces to the Euro-Bikov free period, which has been carefully studied by many, many mathematicians and also has had a lot of recent progresses, very rather remarkable progresses. And let's consider back to this more general, a bit more general setting of mechanical billiards. So due to the conservation of kinetic energy at a reflection, because only the direction of the velocity change, so the norm doesn't change, a mechanical billiard in the plan will always have its energy as a first integral. Will always have its energy as a first integral. And this is a two degrees of freedom system. And such a system is called integrable if one can find an additional first integral independent from the energy. And in case one can actually find such an additional first integral, then the dynamics of this integral mechanical billiard system are in principle rather regular, while more general non-integral mechanical billiards may expedite. integral mechanical billiards may expedite rather chaotic behaviors which we have some well-known example already in the case of free billiards so and then we move to this topic of integral hook and kepler billiards the starting point is a rather trivial observation it's just a conformal correspondence between two mechanical systems will also preserve elastic reflection walls reflection laws since Since the angles are preserved. Therefore, if you have two equal angles in the first system, you also get these two equal angles in the other system. And thus, the billial trajectories will be transformed also by this conformal mapping. And then one looks at the literature. Apparently, there are a lot of integral hook delayers which has been identified and studied. Essentially, those with Essentially, those with conic section reflection walls centered at the hook center. And indeed, one can also take arbitrary combination of all these reflection walls. So one can get system with more complexity and so on. But all these systems will be integral. And it is rather recent for some reason to look at integral capital VRs, starting from the rather. starting from the rather rather interesting work of Galavoti and Jose Lang, who say that if we add a line in the plant to a Kepler problem, then the corresponding beta system is integral. This is a highly non-trivial example, which also disproves some statement of Boltzmann, assuming in particular that such a system should be actually chaotic. But actually, this is an integral system. Or we can also add, for example, some circles. also add for example some circles centered at the capital center this this so due to the invariance of so by due to the invariance by rotations would be rather so rather rather easy to see that they are also integral so there's some kind of mismatch we have many many examples of integral hook b layers and relatively few examples of integral kepler b layers and now what we can do is just to transport all these integral hook b layers by the complex grade mapping By the complex grade mapping. And this we've done with Ari Tateuchi from CAO school. And by doing so, we get more integral capabilities. The result is also rather clean. So essentially, actually, you can take any combinations of conic section reflection walls with a focus at the Kappa center and all these all these. So, well, but if you take combinations, then But if you take combinations, then they have to be confocal as well. But if you take one, then it's just any conic sections focused at the Kepler center, then all these systems will actually be integral. So then one can recover this Galavoti Yoslan case and this circle case by some limiting procedure and so on. So then the Kepler problem is known to be super integral and maybe there are more freedom to find. there are more freedom to find non-trivial so this so integral reflection walls in a in a super integral system than as in a in a in an integrable non-superintegral system and to understand this point we also investigate this um this two-center problem and uh with aritakuchi we what we found is also something actually not so not so trivial um so uh the result is that those with a confocal conic section With the confocal conic section reflection walls, so when these conic sections have both of their 4G at the two centers of the two-center problem, and you can take any combinations of them, and all these beta systems will be in the group. The reason for that is that this system is separable in polar coordinates after being transformed by Birkov's mapping. So this Birkov's mapping is a map to that. So that to that plus that minus one over two, and if we do so to uh well, and if we use this mapping to transform this Hamilton here, then and and then and then we can go to polar coordinates, and then what we get is something like that, which is now separated in these polar coordinates. We have terms, so R, P, R and so on, but there are no mixing terms of R and theta. And for such a system, and also Also, also, this Hamiltonian is quadratic in Pr, which is also quadratic in P theta. So, for the conjugate variables to R and theta, respectively. And therefore, if there is a reflection against some coordinate line, then one of this momenta will be invariant, while another one will just be reflected, so change its sign. And therefore, the square remains to be invariant, and therefore, this. invariant and therefore this will be so all these coordinate lines will be will be integral reflection walls for for the corresponding billiard problem and thus all these centered circles and lines so so circles centered at the center or lines passing through the center are actually integral reflection walls for for this transformed system which if one transforms back one gets this result so we get this uh confocal conic sections and so on Connect sections and so on. And also, I just would like to mention that many of these results concerning integral mechanical billiards can also be established alternatively via the method of projective dynamics and projective billiards. So, this is something very different. But still, I think that this conformal approach is rather easy to understand. Okay, another thing, what lies behind all these transformations and a bit is this so-called Dabu inversion. In 1889, Daabu actually wrote some very short note, I think one page and a half, which presents a forgotten theorem, which has been ignored for a very, very long time. In one case, one can just state it like such. So assume U, which is a... So assume u which is a force function, so negative of the potential to be positive, so just for one case, then the two natural mechanical systems defined on a manifold M with remaining metric G and U, and by the force function U, and the natural mechanical system defined on M with Riemannian metric UG and with force function 1 over U, they will actually have the same orbit up to time parameterization in the configuration space. Time parametrization in the configuration space. So, really, they always are the same, just time parametrization might be different. And then this explains somehow this whole Kepler correspondence through additional double gover procedure. Try to explain this with this kind of awkward drawing. So, this is supposed to be the Kepler problem with a red center, the Kepler center. And this one can think of as... and this one can think of as some kind of orbit for example and then one can apply this double inversion to this problem and then what one what one sees is that because the Kepler force function is singular at this red point it will make it into a non-smooth point but it is regular elsewhere therefore therefore it therefore the transformed surface will be regular Transformed surface will be irregular elsewhere. And because everything is rotational invariant, so the transformed system will be rotational invariant as well. And therefore, this is actually supposed to be a cone with a center at this red point. And then one can compute the curvature of this cone. And one can see that actually this cone is, well, has curvature zero and therefore is actually flat. So in good coordinates, it's just a flat cone. And this is in particular developable. So we can. is in particular developable so we can cut cut the cone with a with a scissor and then just develop it to put it into the into the plane and the angle we can compute from the precise data what we get is actually half plane something like that which one should so which uh which adds so on this uh uh white white line one should understand that the antipodal points uh should be identified yeah so this is like like one copy of the problem but then it's very necessary But then it's very natural to add another identical copy to it and then we can check out so what is the false function and so on. So by doing so, we get this way to go from capital to hook by first applying this double inversion to the capital problem. the capital problem and as application we look at these so-called double systems so the setting is the following we assume that ng is some abstract surface of revolution then a rotation invariant system is called a dau system if a neighborhood of circular orbits are filled with closed orbits so it's essentially a generalization of this question of benefit This question of back home in the plan. And this problem has been studied precisely by Dabu in 1877, so on the existence and classification and so on, so as a reaction and generalization to this problem of this question of Bethong. And after this study of Daibu, the subject has been further studied by many, many other people, including, for example, Seoul, Fister, Funk, Hairy, Xantopridge, Xantopridge, Sagri Yatuki, Kuriyatsheva, Fedoseyev, and so on and so on. From the time of Dabu till nowadays, many of these authors had more emphasis on the case of free motion, so the case of geodesics with no force. But of course, in general, I can consider the problem with force and the classification. The classification result is very vaguely speaking the following. So there exists at most two of such non-trivial potentials on the abstract surface of revolution. And when there are two of them, then the coverage of the surface is constant. And moreover, there exists family of such surfaces which actually admit only one of such potentials. Such potentials. So then, so we have checked. So, with Anabui, we have checked that actually, somehow Dabu has never applied his own inversion to this problem. But on the other hand, it is just also an obvious fact that if we start from a double system and we take a double inversion, then the double inverse of this system will again be a double system. So even though, well, yeah, double never applied this inversion to this study of double system, which we have carried out with Anna Bui, just try to see whether there are some missing cases or whether there are cases which we cannot cover by this theory. And then the result is that actually all double systems can be derived from the Kepler problems on some constant curvature spaces via double. Curvature spaces via double inversions and up to some domain restrictions. So locally, this also holds. So locally, this always holds, while globally, maybe one has to consider, well, maybe one also has to allow some regional government stuff. So this is a result. And then here's a very short timeline of this mapping Z2Z2. In 1742, Michael Hawking Michael Lawing has already studied this problem of duality of homogeneous potentials. So he actually also found this Zat2Z2 as well as that to Zk essentially. So this correspondence between certain homogeneous potentials. And then in 1889, so Guxa established this Hooke-Kepler correspondence by this conformal transformation Z2Z2. And then Daho. And then Dau add his notes to this notes of Guxa, stating his forgotten theorem. And then in 1903, and then in another, so I think this is ICM announced 04 and in an after paper 06, David Chibita used this mapping as a, so, and this method as a way to regularize collisions, so double collisions in the planar restricted three-body problem. And in 1953, Fog applied this complex ground mapping and in general a conformal transformation in a quantum setting. So as to establish a Kepler correspondence in a quantum setting. And in 1964 and 1965, Kusa Heimer and Stiefel, they generalized this Hooke Kepler. This hook-Kepler problem from this 2D hook-kepler correspondence to the case of 3D Kepler and some 4D hook. And these are some references which as I've mentioned and went through. So I think that's out here. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. So, is there any question? Yeah, yeah, I have a question. So in in one of the analogy between uh mapping Z Z goes to Z, the power K and the Magida exponents, right? The Maguire exponent, right? Yes, my clash was not very good. So, so what was your question? Yes, so in one of the slides. Yeah, I cannot hear the analogy between the mappings and components. Sorry, but I cannot hear you clearly. Hear you clearly. Yeah. Yeah, write the question. Is there something in the chat? So, can you write the question in the chat? Yes, I'm writing the question. Maybe in the meantime you can ask if there is somebody that has other questions. Yeah, okay. The question is then somebody else? No, so there are no more questions. So, there are no more questions, and there is no something written in the chat. Okay. So, we will stop here, and sorry about that. Okay, thank you very much.
