 And I yeah, I thought about this problem in this month when I saw some talk by uh Andre Munaro. Andre Munaro, he presented some work with some of you. Right, so there was something about, okay, so there was something about 3 alpha, which is a 3D composition where each pack is measured by the alpha. And then there was some 3 mu, which is maximum induced matching tree width, where you measure the width by Uh you measure the width by the uh size of matching makes size size of induced matching covering your back. And then there's something called cligwith or rank with and I'm trying to throw some emulation. So if you have so this means this is has a Is this Hasa diagram? So if you have a small frequency or request, then you have small big myths. Then you have small big myths, you have small sing myth. And it turns out that they all they, well I mean they, it's written there Andre Isrami, Gielensky, okay, I have no way to pronounce all these names. Joseph McCarty, Martin Milani, and So they proved that graphs of bounded tree mu have bounded seamless. I don't think you know what symbol is. Oh yeah, so okay, I will explain. But anyway, I knew that these classes are chi-bounded. So this is their TRM and this is chi-bounded by Denkla and Janet Pochak. And Bolchak. And when I was writing this open problem, I thought these two are open problems, whether or not they are high-minded. But last week I visited Ozong, and Ozang said that he worked with Mike Natzel and Sebastian Petere in 2018 or 19, that they believe that they have a proof of this by modifying the proof for this case. By modifying the proof for this case. So my question is so the question is is the class of graphs of bounded symmetric high bounded and what is same with so you can you look at different You can look at the branch decomposition like thing where leaves are labeled by the vertices of your graph G. So, your graph G, you're considering a tree with internal vertices having degree 3, and leaves are labeled by the vertices of your graph. And then, whenever you have a card, you look at the partition of the vertex in the original graph. And possibly. For simmer, you measure the maximum induced matching crossing this cut. But you also have to avoid edges like this. You are not allowed to have a. So really induced, not induced. Yeah, really induced. And mean width, for mean width, you ignore edges inside here. You don't want to have edges. So you want to have an induced matching. So, you want to have induced matching without any edges crossing. Any other edges crossing along this? So, what is S? Simple. I don't know. I mean, they string or yeah, I thought simple was strict. So, you really don't want to have any edges inside this. So, no edges here, no edges here. And we knew that, so if you can prove that. So, if you can prove that this class has chi-bounded, then this will imply that this is chi-bounded and that's chi-bounded. Chi-boundedness, like it doesn't matter whether you look for induced matchings or these kind of matches. Yes, because if the size of a creek is bounded, then always. Always apply one side or possibly. So it may be simple. I didn't try very hard, so it could be good. I was saying what you said again? I'm just saying that the question is the same for concern with the click. Oh, and maybe you repeat the argument. Why isn't that? Because if we forbid a click, yes, we bound the size of the. Ki-boundedness, we bound the sides of a click. So, if we have a large matching such that whatever can appear on the both sides, then we just apply lambs a and you get large matching where we have independent sets of both sides. So, that means if you have a low KT and then bound the symmetric C, you will have to find bounded minus that's one-tier when Yeah. If that's true, then then this implies that everything is chi-bounded. There are no connections between zimbits and red bits? Oh, right, it's only one direction. So you have a class of graphs where, yes, so this containment. So if you have a bounded rank width, then you just have a bounded link width. have a bounded linguist. Bounded linguists implies bounded signals. But not the other way around. And the standard proof that bounded transport implies sky boundedness does purpose in it? I shouldn't say standard, but the very clever proof that I like very much. So I can tell you what Ozong said to me. So Ozong said the proof of this extends well. Proof of the So unfortunately the camera is pointing in such a way that I can see you. Oh, now I can see. But now you're left. I can only see the order of the portal etcetera. So proof for the graphs of bounded rank width can be. Oh, are we recording? So maybe it's not following you because we didn't have to record the recording. I just clicked the recording button. Oh, please click record. Just stop off how we are in. Oh, recording in progress. Oh, recording in progress. Yes, it's being recorded. So, yeah, so according to him, the proof for the graphs of boundary rank width can be modified to prove for the mean width, but you are not able to modify for single. Yeah, so he for me he had some lemma that whenever you have a card, you can cover the neighborhood by a small number of vertices on the right-hand side, and that was what he was using to prove. So he didn't think of the Ramsey type algorithm. So maybe by combining it could be useful. Yeah, uh autumn and mica. Micah and Sebastian. I don't remember whether we ever considered the method or actually we did try to prove this method. So I asked Martin Milanek whether this is open and this one and he said I think it's open. Otherwise there's no need to prove that this is chi-bounded because they already knew that this implies that's bounded. So there's no need to prove that this is chi-bounded because we already knew This is Kyle Let's already know this is a kind of thing. My name is Finny Haxall. I'm just going to start here with a public service announcement. Public service announcement. If you find yourself in need of a small amount of Canadian cash, I might be able to because there are small things that you might pay for if you don't have any. Certain useful currencies, I can each. But I don't want to say which ones exactly online, anybody's not. So, my question is about triangle packings. Triangle packing in Graf G, I'm going to name an edge disjoint. So set of triangles pairwise edge disjoint. And that's maybe denote by Î¼ of G, the maximum size. Animal size of triangle packing. So here's the question. If I take a simple, let's say, planar graph. Simple, let's say, planar graph, G. So the question is, true or false? For every planar graph with G, there exists edges E and B prime so that if you So that if you just remove E and D prime, delete E and D prime from G, the triangle packing number is down. So obviously, with at least one triangle, are there two edges that you can delete and reduce the triangle packing number? The triangle packing number. Okay, so why do I ask this question? If true, this will actually be a special case of a conjecture of Loas from 1975, I think it was, upon which there's been basically no progress at all, no non-trivial results at all. So what is that conjecture? Today. If we are part of our uniform center, say non-empty. Well, say non-empty with some edges at it, has a set, let's say C of vertices, C of vertices of size r minus one whose removal makes the matching number go down. Now here, of course, I'm using mu in a different way. This is just, so this is the matching number. Ordinary matching numbers, so maximum size of a set of disjoint. It could be a disjoint. Basically, our apartheid, R-uniform high-party. Okay, so R partite R uniform hypergraph. R partite R uniform, as you use your vertex class, can be partitioned into R parts, the R parts, and every edge contains exactly one for each part. Okay, so that's an R partite, R uniform hypergraph. And this is a conjecture that you can find R minus one vertices whose removal would make the matching number go down. Obviously, Obviously, you can find R vertices whose removal makes the matching number go down, any R that form an edge. And so there's the question of whether this can be R minus 1 if you are R perfect. So this conjecture is a strengthening of another famous conjecture, which is very much open, called Reiser's conjecture, which says that. Which says that every R partite, in every R partite R uniform hypergraph, there's a cover of size at most R minus 1 times the matching number. The strengthening of that, because it would be saying that really you can find R minus 1 for distance that make the matching number go down. Okay, so why do I ask this thing in planar graphs? Well, it's just from the observation. From the observation. So planar graphs are more colorable. So if this is a coloring of G, then all of the edges are going like that, and you can partition the edges into those of color one, those of color two, and those of color three, so that every triangle is multi-colors. Multiple colours. So the line graph of the well, not the line graph, but the edge, the triangle hypergraph of G, edge aversion, is 3-partheid and 3-uniform. So there should be two edges whose deletion makes the matching number go down. So, I'm asking this in planar graphs. Why? Of course, you could ask in any for colorable graph. But in planar graphs, it's almost true. First of all, it's almost true. And secondly, in planar graphs, you have a hope of having, because of planarity, much more control, much more structure, maybe. That might allow you to prove this. And it's not at all difficult. Not at all difficult to show when I say almost to, well, all right. So quite easy. Either there exists, exist E and B prime as required or four edges that reduce. That reduce the electronic packing number by 2. That's pretty close. If I can't remove 2 and make it go down by 1, I can remove 4 and make it go down by 2. In a planar or in a full colour? A planar, planar. No, just planar. No, no, not in. No, I can't say that for full colour. So the riser version, so not looking for two that make it go down by one, but really just covering, that is true for info colorable. Well, it's true, it's true in fact, well, riser for r equals three is true. And so it's true, that's true in even a core political context. So that's my question. Just looking for two edges. So it would be very interesting to get any kind of a non-trivial result on this conjecture. It would be even more interesting if you can find the counterexample. The next person on the list is Jeff Supper. The next person on the list is Suckler. I think you have two questions. So, my name is Sebre I JV. And so let me tell you what the statement of the problem is. This is a conjecture of myself, but it came out of my joint work with Botton Oliver Marines and I was thinking of Sophie Spirit. So anything from 2022. And so the statement is, the statement that's conjecture is that for every integer t of Today's trip and every graph page that is Google and K4 fleet. There is some constant depending on these guys such that if G is G is an even-hole-free graph. So the graph is even-hole-free if it doesn't contain an induced cycle of even length. So it's going to be 4, 6, 8. Use an even-hole-free graph of tribute to a tribute that is bigger than this constant. Then Either it contains a key vertex clique, board contains H, and I mean as an end to separate. So, okay, where is this coming from? It comes from some kind of, you know, it's very much like the geoperson conjecture, for instance. You know, so where's that conjecture coming from? Are coming from. ErdÅs's result says that there are graphs with arbitrary large curves and arbitrary large chromatic number. So if you have a graph of a huge chromatic number, it may contain a big group. And if it doesn't contain a big group, if you want to guarantee one more graph that's going to be containing the graph, as an individual subgraph, that graph must be a false. Because if it contains a cycle, you have a counterexample by yourself. And so for this result, for this conjecture, it's the same situation. It's the same situation. H must be a K4 free roller graph if it's going to satisfy this state. Because there is a construction by, so this is a theorem by Synthiorian Tritinian, I think from 2019, that there are even holes. You can hold A4 free graphs of every trap, really large tree width and no short forward. Short forward. So here you cannot say no short cycle because the graph may contain a triangle, and that's necessary because even volcanic 3-free graphs have triggered at most 5. But if you have an even low-free graph of a bounded clique number, it doesn't necessarily have bounded pre-width. It may have large pre-wig, and it can actually require the length of the shortest hole to be as big as you want. So if you want to contain another graph here, that graph must be chordal. That graph must be portal. It should be containable. And it should be K4 free because this whole instruction is K4. So let me tell you what are the known partial results. So there are two things, two strongest points. So again. So statement one is the following. So statement one is the following, that for every integrity t, positive integer t every forestf and every j4 free portal graph there is an integer C depending on all these. Such that if G is even hold free with three width bigger than this constant, then it has to contain one of the following, as in a new subgrid KT or H so so for its type is or So, so for it's like this. Or so here's your fart staff. And what you're going to do is you're going to add a dominating vertex. So somebody suggests enterprise. And then you're going to do it again. So then one of these things is contained in G as an induced. And the reason this is, I mean, this may sound a little technical because of this one outcome. Because of this one outcome. But this implies that. So let me say it implies implies the main conjecture when A A t equals to four and inches arbitrary. Okay, why is that? So because let's set t equal to 4 here, and let's choose f to be just the two vertics complete red. Then if you have an even multi-graph of sufficiently large 3 red, it's going to contain either K4 or your favorite K43 chordal graph. Or your favorite K4-3 coordinal graph, or this thing where F is the two-wheeled simple graph, which is just K4. And the second thing it implies is that if T is, so let's say, when H is obtained from a forest by adding a dominating universal, whatever you would call it, perk. Universal, whatever you would call it, vertics. And T is general, like the exact rate. And this is a specific case of a K-4 equal graph. If you pick a forest and you add someone who's adjacent to everyone, that's a K-4. And this, by the way, is a characterization of forests. I mean, there's no graph other than forests with this property. That the reading, hopefully a graph of sufficiently large tribute contains either a big league or that guy within the neighborhood of the grapes. And these two had previously been proved by Vaggan Oliku, Maria Shadnovsky, myself, and Sophie Spirkel. Sorry, this is 2023. And this doesn't rely on any of those results, but there's a good 50% of. Results, but like there's a good 50% of the safety stars. So that's the first partial result. The second one, it's okay if I rate. The second one, which to me is a more interesting one, is that the conjecture is true. So, true when H has height 2. So, let me tell you what I mean. You know, I mean, if you want to work with, if you want to try to prove this condition, you should have this systematic way to produce larger and larger gate-for-free portalograms. Give for free portal graphs. And one way to do it is you start with a niche and then you stick on new triangles. So this way you're introducing new edges, new edges, like this. And so for every single new edge, you're going to stick on new triangles as well. And then you're going to be keeping. And it's easy to show that every K43 portable graph is then just some. K4 free portal graph is then a new subgraph on something like this. And these are all K4 free portal graphs. So you might have to split the conjecture to these. This is the same as if you want to work with trees, you just think about a regular tree of a given height. So everyone has the same degree downward, and you're going to grow it until you reach your favorite depth. And height to here means I have to start with an. means I have to start with an edge and then I have the first level of triangles and then I have the second level of triangles. And this is not covered by the previous result. And the reason I find this interesting is that, I mean again, I like the analogy within this and GFR Sunder. And as far as the height vision goes, this is exactly where GFR Sunder is. Stop 2. So people know how to do it for these kind of trees, but not for. And not for those. And from what I know about the proof of this, if anyone could possibly get to the next level, I would say the conjecture is true. Or it's going to be false for the variables that we need. And if anyone of you is interested in thinking about it, just come to me. I'm happy to tell you about the proofreads. Okay, so that was the first problem. Maybe I'll stop for now. And if there was more time, I would talk about the second one. Yep. Okay. We will turn pages over here. Okay, so I have a generalization of planarity to higher dimensions. Of planarity to higher dimensions and some problems about it. But let's start with dimension one first. What's the dimension one case? That's early graphs. I know some people here that have been studying them, in particular Rose's thesis. I'm going to say some very interesting things about them. So what's a circle graph? It's an intersection graph of chords of the circle, this one. So I just pick some chords here. I just pick some chords here. The vertices of my graph are these chords. This is a vertex. Maybe let me make it a color. This is another vertex. And whenever two chords intersect, I join them with an edge. If they intersect inside the circle, that's important. So yeah, this. All right. This is dimension. This is dimension one. Let's generalize it to higher dimensions. Take the n-dimensional sphere, let's start with the two-dimensional sphere. Here it is. And any hyperplanes cutting through it. So this is one plane, this is another. This is another. And again, the vertices are the plane. And again, the vertices are the planes, hyperplanes, and I connect them whenever they intersect inside the sphere. So this restriction that the intersection is inside the sphere plays a role. The sphere plays a role. Otherwise, I could just say, let's take any hyperplanes in Rn and connect them whenever they intersect. The only graphs you can. Intersect, the only graphs you get like that is complete multipartite graphs because two hyperplanes are parallel or they intersect. So independent sets are just bunches of parallel hyperplanes, that's not interesting. But with this restriction, if the intersections are within the sphere, it becomes interesting. So let me now define the The sphere dimension of a graph as the smallest dimension where I can represent my graph like that. at the smallest dimension such that in the in R to that power inside the sphere I can represent my graph as intersecting hybrid lanes. Is the definition clear? Definition clear? Okay, this raises two immediate questions. Is this well defined and meaningful? So does every finite graph have finite dimension? And maybe it trivializes after a while, you know, you have planar graphs, and then you can say, okay, graphs embeddable in R3, but then we know that's all graphs, it stops in dimension 3. Here it doesn't. Okay, both these are not obvious. They're intuitively maybe easy to believe, but both are not obvious. This is, I can tell you how to prove it. This turned out to be very difficult. So I'm using antipodes. I'm using a tip result of Biliamini and Schram about infinite graphs that uses a lot of potential theory. And I've been studying infinite graphs for 21 years and feeling quite lonely sometimes. And for the first time, I have an obligation. Something about finite graphs I cannot prove without using infinite graphs. Good. So yeah, I I'll not tell you about the proof here, but I I'm very excited about this. Very excited about this. Let me write one other statement and then maybe I just catch a proof of that. Okay, first, to begin with, this tells us we have a reasonable notion of dimension of graphs that goes, you know, all the way to infinity. It gives every graph a dimension, that's great. Dimension, that's great. It's also monotone. As we increase the dimension, we gain more graphs because once you have represented a graph like this, you can extend each line to a plane perpendicularly and you can represent it in the next dimension. So it's more notable. Sorry, do you have an explicit graph on the number of n vertex graph? Yeah, actually. If your graph has n vertices, it has square dimensional at most n on the count, so the number of graphs, n vertex graph that type. Number of graphs and that is rather than dimension D, you know? No, that's a good question. Yeah, I don't know. It's a good question. We understand the asymptotics. Every planar graph has dimension at most two. So not only is a non-trivial notion of dimension. A notion of dimension, it gives the planar graphs the right value. Now, this is very nice to see the proof of this. We know that every planar graph has a circle packing in the plane or the sphere. So, you just unlock the plus or minus one. Do circle graphs have sphere dimension one or two? Sphere dimension one means. Sphere dimension one means exactly means exactly certain graphs. But is the dimension one or dimension two? Certain graphs is dimension one. And this is dimension two. Two-dimensional sphere inside R3. So this is S1 inside R2. R2 and so on. Alright, so linear graphs allow, we know they can be represented by circle patterns. What's a circle pattern? It's an arrangement of disks in the plane and they define a graph like this. The vibrances are the discs and you join them with an edge if they are tangent. If they are tangent. And the circle pattern theorem says that every planar graph can be represented that way. So once you have represented your graph in the plane like this, you want to represent it on the sphere, also as a circle packing. That's easy. Take a stereographic projection, touch a sphere on top of that plane. On top of that plane, let the sphere rest on the plane. So your graph it will project your graph. It becomes a circuit pattern on the sphere. So I have my graph circle pattern on the sphere, and now every vertex becomes a circle on my sphere, cut through with a plane intersecting the sphere exactly on that circle. And those planes now are an incident touch. Incident touch if anyone leaves the circles touched here. So this gives us this theorem. This generalizes to higher dimensions. If you sphere pack your graph in Rn, then do a sort of graphic projection embedded in Sn, same trick with hyperplanes. This proves the first item. Once you know that every graph speaks. That every graph sphere packs in some dimension, and we know that's possible. And dimension, the number of vertices suffices. This stereotype graphic projection business is nice because it allows you to move things around. For example, let me prove to you that the disjoint union of any two graphs of dimension D also has dimension D. Dimension D. So I have a graph represented on my sphere somehow with hyperplanes. Do a stereographic projection down here. Then take a much, much bigger sphere and stereographically project it up there. This moves all the stuff, they're very small. To a very small portion of this larger sphere. And then, if I have another graph like this, I can project it to some other small portion. And so I have embedded my two disjoint graphs here. And I can do one sums and possibly two sums and maybe in higher dimension k sums. Right, this is what I know. What I know. Now, some it raises many open problems. You can ask your own, but here are some that may be fit well in this meeting. Expander graphs have unbounded sphere dimension. What is n? So, this is a sequence, a sequence of expander graphs with fixed expansion constant. My conjecture is the sphere dimension divergence So, if you have a sequence of expanders, you cannot embed them all in dimension 3. Are they all getting bigger? Sorry? Does Gn have N vertices? The number of vertices of Gn grows to infinity. Just a standard setup of expanded graphs. Just say non-isomorphic than it's of vertical vertices. So I said before that it's very difficult to prove that no dimension fits all graphs, and this would be. Fits all graphs. And this would be one way to prove it. And this is the first way I tried. And the intuition is you have your sphere of some dimension and some expander graph embedded in it. Cut through the middle with the hyperplane so that separates lots of vertices on either side. Find a hyperplane that cuts the graph really to large pieces. Then, if this middle part meets few vertices, Few vertices, you have a contradiction because expanders by definition would not do that. If you cut two or positive proportion of vertices, this needs to have a positive proportion. So if you have a few vertices here, you are happy. If not, shift it a little bit or tilt it, I don't know. So i i it somehow looks obvious, but then you your the situation you can I could not avoid is that all the vertices accumulate. That all the vertices accumulate towards one point in the sphere, and then I could not find a good hyperplane to play this game. So, yeah, I think it's a good problem. I asked when I wrote this whether for a fixed atmosphere, they mentioned the Graphs Achai Bar. Mention the graphs are type-bounded, and James told me no, but maybe they are type-bounded if you exclude a Berlin graph, James said. And more news from James. It would suffice to prove the following, which is one of my questions. Those are graphs of bounded sphere dimension have bounded asymptotic dimensions. Some of you know what this means, some of you will not, but. Means some of you will not, but then please wait until my talk tomorrow. For those who know, that's a good problem that would answer the problem using what James is telling me about chi-bound. Okay, yeah, you can ask many questions again about any fixed dimension. You can ask specifically for dimension two, generalized. For dimension two generalizations of theorems about planar graphs, we have seen dimension two, sphere dimension two generalizes planarity. So, for example, do graphs of shear dimension two have bounded code number? And final problem. What if you exclude a minor? Does it bound the square dimension? Okay, that that's it. I've I've written another section about problems on force graph here, but I think it's better if we wait until tomorrow where I define things properly and then I will ask those questions in my talk. Thanks. Question. So you uh you You maybe indicated the answer to what I'm asking, but so is there a kind of separator theorem? I don't know. Yeah, I suspect, yes. This is another interesting question to ask. Yeah, I don't know. That would relate also to this other question. So there is a separate such a theorem for sphere packages. Such a theorem for sphere packability NR three and maybe as I mentioned there is a classical paper by Thurston and co-authors. So maybe that's generalizable to this. My name is Luis Firet, so it's just a question for people. For people who like coloring and also extremal set theory. Maybe there are some people like this in the audience. So the question is the following. So you have a graph which is not very far from being too colorable. So say you take a graph which is 2k plus 1k colorable. What does it mean? It means that the the colors are 1, 2, 2k plus 1 and you assign And you assign k-element subsets. These are k-level subsets of 2k plus 1. And when you have adjacent vertices, you really want to have disjoint subsets. Okay? So you're going to assign k-dominant subsets, and adjacent vertices get distinct k-demon subsets. And seeing that you're And saying that you're 2k plus 1k colorable means that you have okay. So this is very close, just a bit stronger than two colorable. If you're two colorboards, you're 2k colorable. And the question is, so assume G has this property, what is the maximum size? Is the maximum size of a two-colorable induced subgraph in G. Okay, a graph which is close to colorable, but not quite, and you want to two colour the maximum si maximum fraction of vertices of this graph. Okay, so that's the question. Okay, so that's the question. And it you can rephrase it in terms of uh so that's not scarf, that's not scarf. No, inducer graph, yeah. Or induced, yeah. So you can rephrase it in terms of finding a bipartite inducer graph of the Knesset graph. So this is the same as saying that you have a homomorphism to the esser graph 2k plus 1. 2k plus 1k. This is the graph of all k-element subsets where you have an edge, the subsets are disjoint. And so this question is equivalent to what is the maximum size of a bipartite induced subgraph. Of the Kenser graph. Okay, so this is really, I mean, if you only care about independent sets, this is really a very classical question. What's the maximum size of an independent set in this graph? You can find the right answer with Erdos-Corado. And this is a bit just this is the next uh level. What's the maximum size of a two-colorable separate. Colorable separate. Okay. So, what is the possible answer? So, it's a question of why they are a two body. Sorry. Why the two vertices? Because if you can answer this question, then using the homomorphism, you would find the same fraction of vertices in any graph that has, like, the fraction that you will find here, you will be able to guarantee the same fraction in any. You will be able to guarantee the same fraction in any 2k plus 1k color remote route, right? But just transferring... It may map somewhere this is denser in one part and not sparser in a different part. That can change the fractions. Really? Okay. Yes, yes. So you will always be able to So my partner did use a set of bipartisans that use some cards. Okay, so what's the possible candidate? So it's a problem of Jan van Len Hoiber and his student Shu. So they they conjecture that the They conjecture that the right answer is given by the following construction. So take k order for simplicity. So you have numbers from 1 to k minus 1, then you have k, and you have numbers from k plus 1 to k plus 1. So here is how you construct a very large bipartite inducer prof. You just You subpoena, you just remove all k-element subsets that contain k that contain exactly k minus 1 over 2 element subsets here and exactly k minus 2 elements here. You remove all k element subsets that consist of k minus 1 over 2 elements here, this element, and k minus 2, k minus 1 over 2 elements here. K minus one of our two elements here. And then I claim that if you remove this, then this is bipartite. Why? Because you always have more than half vertices here or more than half vertices here. The bipartite. And they have run a number of computations for small values of k and this is seems that this is the best you can do. But the difficult thing is that there are many other constructions than this one that give the same answer. Gives the same answer, not just by just changing the value of k. So it's maybe that's a bit difficult, but yeah, they they don't know how to prove it. I think it's a nice extra program. Any questions? I would say for even k, you can do something similar, but it will be unbalanced because of so the you will have to take one of these parts, which is a bit smaller than the other. How big is this? So, like how many, so we in total we have these many things. So, you have to remove, so you have to pick just so this is so this is the exactly the number of vertices that remain. So, the total. What is it that remains? So the total fraction is this, right? I just wanted to get the k. Ah, sorry, you want a small value? Sorry, sorry, sorry. You want values for small values of k? How much this team is? I just wanted if you got the assets. Ah, no, I don't know yet. So yeah, um that's a good question. But uh already for small values of k I think it's stopped. Already for small values of k I think it's not known that this is direct. Maybe think of I think of k at least uh from from here at this time I think it's not known. I should check this at the end, but okay. Or are you open for smaller supposed to be balanced, the two sides of the dot just here? Yeah. We have k minus one on one side and k plus one on one side. k minus one on one side and k plus one on the other and just checking if this is just oh sorry one k minus one k it's it's a oh it's you're right yeah yeah sorry yeah the middle should be k plus one make the middle point k plus one oh it should be k plus one sorry yeah oh really oh no sorry this is one k this is k plus one and this is this is thank you Did you want to throw your second one? Or maybe to do the next round of description. The next person on the left is this Pumo. This ErdÅs Korado is so many papers on this that I doubt that people should know better about him. So many papers. The difficulties that Adelscorrado, I mean, the there's just one extreme There's just one extreme example, and here you have lots of different options. Okay. Oh, yes, my problem is about directed graph colouring. So you take a diagram B, K, etc. And the colouring, a directed colouring of D, it's any coloring of the vertices of D, not necessarily proper. Let's say using K color, it's a K. Using K directed colouring, such that there is no monochromatic cycle, directed cycle. So, for every C directed cycle, the number of colors used on C is at least two. Okay. And so the general question. Okay, no, first one more definition. Now I say that uh a digraph D is K a D. D is k direct equals or directive critical if for every okay if first d is not k minus 1 decorable and every proper subdigraph is okay so it's the minimal subgraph which is dot k minus one decor for every h. For every h proper sublime of t h is t minus one dichotom. Okay. And so now the question is, if I have a k-diacritical digraph on n vertices, what is the maximum number of uh parts I can have? And so there is a conjecture. No, sorry. Now I restrict myself to Now I restrict myself to oriented graphs. Now I take D with no uh no diagonal, so no cycle of n2, and now I ask this question: what is the maximum number of edges in the k-di critical quantity graph? And so the conjecture is the following. I think it's by push in no and kernel diagnosing. Okay. And uh the conjecture is that for every k uh there exists epsilon and n zero such that for every uh n zero every k diacritical oriented graph on n vertices. uh on n vertices as at most one minus epsilon k times the total number of arcs you can have in a multi graph on n verpic, so n to the two arcs. I think that actually they conjecture uh some specific value uh given by one of them there. Okay, so this is one thing This is one thing. And something uh weaker than that is just for the specific case of tournaments. So if you take D to be a tournament, so an oriented graph, an orientation of the complete graph, then you should have only finitely many scaled critical tournaments. Sure. But okay, there are finitely many. They're pretty cool torments just because tournaments have interest to work in their own graphs. And so it's known, this is known only for k at most 3. So for So for k equal to k the critical range graphs are just cycles. Okay, cycles are less than these numbers. You have finitely many two moments which are cycles. For K-code 3 it was proven by PrÃ©dÃ© CavÃ©, Freyan Horf and Cassibia. And for K you gotta use three. And let's maybe start the coffee break a little bit earlier because I think there's still not too little time to do a lot more. But show who's starting after the break.  So, what does it say? What does it say? Fine? Five. Conjecture was it? Other than any? It's a large K, other than either. Yes, yes, yes, you can do in the TV you start with a triangle, then you take two triangles because of this. And then you repeat it, you take Tk minus 1, Tk minus 1, and calibrate as Q. I think this is great automatically, but I think it's critical to check as well. That's critical in diverse cells, contour cells, but it says that removing edge will be pretty simple. I think if you remove an edge, it's uh it's k minus one k. What if you remove an edge between the two big tones? Okay. So you remove edge. Okay. So I think you're taking a concurrent short. I want to read those. I want to read I know okay so I can then use the colouring where here it is their text is one uh is alone in this curl fast like for example the colour here is one and no other text is curl one second  Well, so that like there's just like a few people like no one's sorry they gave you like just but I mean you can just uh I mean we both be tracking the groups or editing just like uh they said like all the information and I think this is quite nice as a junior person when I was a PC student I quite like the subscriptions that's yeah you don't know anyone and it's kind of nice you're too shy to go maybe this time to do is that this you write I mean I have been to organize this so basically they do it some of these you write a phone board and people can just write their names if they're interested in it. People can just write their names if they're interested in it, just so people are aware of who's interested in which problem, then they can get together and do it. But I mean, like I said, it would be completely optional then if there's only the six people left that wants it to ask me about this or without. Well no, I think it's what I'm saying. It doesn't have a regular structure, but if you change the nature of the action, it was not an actual action. And there was like a problem whether this existed. And actually, we also And actually, we also put this on the screen. So, this is the remote. No, no, no. I mean, this is the remote. I think it's better than the other one. Like, we have to pay five. About this on this one, it's actually inside of the moment. Type two out of options. It's the same one, it's like you have to score. Yeah, yeah, it's like even more than that, but yeah, and big enough to go. Yeah, but we've shown some other stuff as well, but the palace is definitely not big. And it gains three, I don't know what it's like. I give the quick to go for you, start with the market. Or you got started with the market saturated. Oh, yeah, we're going to have a little bit of a tiny object. We started the older. I'm always a number of surprises take random architects. Random set of transformation architecture.
