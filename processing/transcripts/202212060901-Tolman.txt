Perfections of um but last time I was starting with sort of functions, I'm looking at the flows, and today I'm just supposed to reverse and start with group actions and look at the method. So go ahead and make it set up. So we have an M, and this is for the whole tie. We'll need a 2M and magnitude. Only a two hour dimensional impact. You have to angle and we have America symphylactic form. I remember what that means, but it's closed and non-teverette. And Maddie Freverer, those are two important properties. And for now, I will let P be a compact k-dimensional for us and let this be Hoover algebra, which is isomorphic. So last time we were looking at completely inequal systems, which in our Systems which are the actions of your two dimensional nature. Some of us relate a lot on the so-called if it generates a Taurus, right? That's a nice case if it generates a Taurus, but to start with, I'll allow. generates a torus but to start with I'll allow lower dimensions so let T act on M by symphonomorphisms and then I'm going to reverse the calculation we had last time this implies that the lead derivative So, this is going to be for all C is T, a money as the usually they hear C M and 5 M is induced by psi. So if you take an element of all the outer dots with the X, it induces a vector field on M. I'm just going to call that because I am. So that's the unit spectrum field. And this, remember, And this, remember Cartan's magic formula that I use all the time, X C M V omega. But since B is closed, this tone vanishes, so we get D I X V M will be equal to zero. Sorry, not only mutant omega. So I C M and closed, close flow. Close one. And now we're going to define a moment map. I'm going to say that a map phi from M to T star is a moment map. If I C M omega equals V C L C So we know this form is common, and we just need to read that. Which affects everything in this area, which is that P is a critical point of P C. B C if only if C is in the Leon status. So since C is not, since omega is not a generic, this is obvious. I'd see M omega is zero if it only is. C is zero if it only is zero, if only if it's critical. All right. So my main goal today, I think, is to talk about Galf and Scotland. To talk about Galf and Setland, how it looks from a symplectic perspective, and how that ties into Turkey generations. But another thing I want to emphasize a little bit is this space between the symplectic and the panic and how that's sort of an interesting driver of questions. So, this is a little bit of an aside. Hurry up, I've done a lot of research in. Area I've done a lot of research in. We have a question describing them: great, you have a symptomatic torex action. Does it have a length? And the answer is yes, if the manifold is simply connected. And that's because, of course, if H1 is zero, then the fact that IC omega is closed implies it's a fact. Close implies it's a fact. There was no other obstruction. But now if the fixed set MT is equal to the empty set. So if it has a moment map, it must have fixed points. And the read that is the minimal value of Of some component peak C. So M is compact. So we take the function peak C, it must have a minimal value, right? And this is going to be is critical by fixed. So maybe you should take a generic direction. So this tells you that if you don't have fixed points, it can't have a moment. Yeah. The compactness is important in the sense that H1 end being zero. Sense that H1M being zero, that's not good enough, but M is not compact. Okay, yeah, so R2N acting R2. Yeah, there's a bunch of places where I'm using compatiness, but yeah, that is one of them. You're using compateness of the force. Okay. I had thoughts in there. Often you can extend them to properness. Most everything I think I say will be true for proper, but yeah. Anyway. You sort of need something. They start falling apart if you don't have anything. And yes, also, if MT is non-empty. Is non-empty and going this way, the circle action is Kler. So I want M omega to be KL, but I also want the action to preserve all three structures. And that just uses the hard lipids. Right, is this be your model? MT, is MT or Mario? Yeah, okay. Thank you. So, in the calculator case, it's Hamiltonian if and only if it has you say it's Hamiltonian if a moment map exists. Um, I think it's a very good idea But this is one example where you can see that the Taylor result does not dictate what's true in the black of world, not necessarily. If otherwise, so Michael produced the first example of this, I produced. I produced the first example of isolated fifth points. And I've been working with my students to prove that you can get on some of the two essays. So the non-color world looks really different than the symplectic world. Sorry, the non-color world, symplectic, looks very different than the color world. That's just sort of the main, I'll just point out a few cases where that's true here. Because that is what we're going to be seeing as the difference between these universities. And so that's a question which is not so obvious. Then there's an easy question, which is important to keep in mind if you've never seen this, which is the question is, is C unique? And the answer is up to translation. So if I take three and add any constant, right, then it's going to have easy to see, but just like important to keep in mind. Questions. Okay. So The examples we've already seen, one example. So we look at the phase space that we saw in physics, with omega is the sum of dpi wage to the qi. S1 acts by rotation. By rotation, set it around the z-axis. Then a moment map is just the third component of the angular momentum. So we saw this last time that then we're less worried about it being a circle. Then we're less worried about it being a circle. Now I'm really caring about the fact that it's a circle. So we have a theorem which tells us about the behavior of these moment maps in these cases, which is that if I let delta equal to the moment image phi of m. The moment image phi of m, it's a convex polytope. In fact, I can tell you which convex polyotope it is. It's the convex polytope, which is the convex whole moment image of the fair flux. Very easy to compute. As the fiber phi inverse of lambda. Phi inverse of lambda is connected for all lambda t star. This is true for any dimensional torus, and as we see, it's especially nice when we have a large torus. Nice when we have a large torus. So given lambda in peak star, the reduced space is a mod T is defined to be equal to the inverse of lambda divided by T. Lambda divided by T. And at regular lambda, it's a 2n minus 2k dimensional symplectic orbital. So basically, so we're losing two dimensions for each dimension of the torus. So, in particular, this is another way, it's not the best proof, but it's a nice way to think about the fact that the torus has to be at most. In fact, the torus has to be at most n-dimensional, right? Because you can't have a negative dimensional resistance. And in that case, we do say that they're all points. Points are easy to classify. I understand some collective organs are points, so I can declare victory. Which leads us to the next case. There's some work involved here, but that's the basic idea. So m omega phi is a A complex oric manifold. And these are the classified ventilators that fight else. And I may sometimes just say some platoric venom because I know it's not a category, but this is always what I mean. So, the theorem by Delzot is that two symplectic torque manifolds. And from or equivalently, some thoughts of work. Only if P of M prime equals P of M plus the constant. So only if the power terms are the same of translation. And moreover, a race and plastic torque metaphold is a natural co-instructor because they all arise as reduced spaces of Cn. Spaces of Cn. And there's more that's true. Maybe I'll say it in the note, or if you like it's part of the theorem, the lambda and T star is regular if and only if Lambda is in the interior of a moment image, which is true if and only if It's a Lagrangian. Those that would be a Lagrangian tori. These are the only Lagrangian tories. That's important. This actually follows from this fact, or you can think of this separate fact. There exists a global action angle coordinates on the frame of the interior. Image of the interior. All right, so this is way better than what we have for just regular intervals. Much stronger result. It's not surprising. We ask a lot, so we get a lot. That's fair enough. Okay, this is the end the animal boolean case question. Okay. So now I want to talk about the non-ability of pay. About the non-ability case. So, I want to let G be a compact connective lead loop. The Lie algebra is where I write the Lie algebra. And T now is the maximal torus. And I want to let G X on G star by the color joint action and And I will include T star into P star as the team varied olives. Let E plus star contained in P star be a positive vial chamber and given And given lambda in G star, I let O, which is, it depends on lambda, but I'll usually drop it because I'm lazy. Define this equal to be G times lambda is a college. So these are what we're looking at. If anybody, I don't know, we're also looking at Child Stella. I'll spell out what happens specifically. If you're not super happy with the general lead theory, it doesn't matter. And in fact, if an O has a natural constant here, the Taylor structure. So, I told you why I talked more about the parallel structure on CPN. It is a cold orbit. That's where it comes from. Okay, so that's the general example. And like I said, we are going to be looking at two specific examples as I sort of build this out. And the first example is. If this SO3 can dual of all the algebra can be identified with R3 and VX by rotation. So this is the standard action of SO3 on R3. It's just the set. Sad o z so it's a positive z axis. Of course, there's some choice, but this is my choice. And the follow-down orbit is equal to s2. That's one important example to keep in mind. And the other important example to keep in mind is G equals Um. G equals u m if I can identify g star the set of A, which are their own conjugate transpose, so we said the Hermitian matrices. It's really anti-Hermitian, but I can identify it this way, and I will. P at my conjugation. So T plus star. Plus star, I'm going to identify this as needed with the subset of Rn. But this is just the set diagonal matrix. So these are real entries. These are the eigenvalues. So every Hermitian matrix has real eigenvalues. And this is, so there's a unique one of these in each orbit. Such that lambda one, it is red and black. It is gray and blue. And oh, long is a flag. So, those people have obviously complex structures. So, two advances. So, most of what I much of what I'm saying will work for any. At some point, I will for us. Okay. Great. So, that was just the So that was just the introduction to non-abelian groups. Now we have to let the non-abelian groups act all the symplectic manifolds. And I did the Taurus case first because the Taurus case is the blur and sort of what we care about the most. But many of the same statements are true for the NAGO. So let the Let be at symplectically on M. Now we need two conditions for our moment map. So we have a moment map, not surprisingly, is a map of G star, and it's a moment map. So this back-end condition is the same. As we've had it before. So that's not too surprising. But the first condition is now we need to assume the phi is equivariant. In the torus case, this is invariant. And the theorem needs to cure it that the analog of what we had before is still true. What we had before is still true. So, if I take the moment image and I intersect it with the positive body chamber, it's a convex polytope. And the fiber phi inverse lambda is connected by lambda. Thank you, stop. So this is basically the same, but what you notice is I haven't given as nice a description of what the complex politics is. And that's it's harder to describe. But okay, well, we still have competitive. And we can still define the reduced space. So M lambda energy star the reduced space is again moment M mod mod lambda G is defined to be equal, well, I might like to define to be favors of lambda divided by g. Lambda divided by G. But that doesn't work because G does not fix Lambda, right? The equivariant, and only some subgroup G sub lambda is going to fix it. So these n-words is lambda divided by stabilizer, mg. This is the most you can do. And so now, if you think about it, If you think about it, lambda regular implies the dimension of the reduced space, the dimension of m minus the dimension of g minus the dimension of the stabilizer. So we lose two of the questions. Oh, okay. So the first thing you were like, well, okay, so it turned out the toy. It turned out the tourists of all the reduced spaces were pulling, everything was super beautiful. There's still a lot you can think of for classification, so it is hard. I want to point out a theorem reader would work. So even if the reduced space is a point, self-called multiplicity zero, for all lambda in the moment image, The G action on M may not so in general is a complicated story but depends how the walls of the polytope hit the walls of the glass. It's an interesting story, even in the more quickly free case, which in some sense is trivial. It only depends on the image. So did he rely on your Did he rely on your example? Yeah, so it wasn't my example. I don't quite know whether he was like, Yeah, I don't remember the details of his proof, but yeah. He used my which I had proved that there was a two-torth action on a six-dimensional manifold. So just one short of torque. Even the high side of fixed points, everything nice still does not need to be equivalent to. So these are all. So, these are all examples of how you just drop a little bit of lag of the simplest classification case, you lose tailor. Evidence of my second statement that hardly any manifold will tailor. So, great. So, I want to head back just for a moment to the case of the M-body. To the case of the n-body because just for various reasons, where I am flat are the non-reployed groups. Let me just put out my bias. So you're talking to the right audio. So there was no Bernie Hawkins joke when I was in grad school, but all these different professors and their different opinions. Different professors and their different opinions on groups. And they know, like, say, I think there's only one group, G, someone outside, there's like dozens of groups, right? But I think there's only one group, S1. I'm like, yes, that's the only group. So the examples, so I want to give you an example of a non-abelian group for the Hamiltonian fashion. But SO3 is three remember x on t star are three to the n and the moment map is just angular oops is just the angular momentum right there's some sum here supposing um right and so the first thing i wanted to point out let's do a dimension count if i reduce Dimension count. If I reduce it non-zero point, my stabilizer, right, if I look at the rotation action, of course, the stabilizer of the origin is all of SO3, but any other point, my stabilizer is just S1. So I expect to be losing four dimensions when I go to the reduced space. So this is kind of more equivalent to two circulations. But the count works right for it to be two. Count works right for it to be two, not three. This is pretty much just fixed. And we saw, again, this is a little bit of view. We saw last time that if I pause on ix and iy, I get iz not equal to zero. And we also check that i squared equals zero, but i squared. But I squared, so this is the length squared of the angular momentum. And this goes back to what Adam was talking about. So I'm repeating what he said, but in a specific example, doesn't generate an ask-lon action. So you might be writing a little too part of it, right? Oh, you're right. Part of it. All right. No, I apologize. So, what you do is you rotate around I at speed the length of I. So the bigger your angular momentum, the quicker you're rotating. Like this flow. So that's like. Like this flow. So that's like again, back to what Ellen said. Every orb is a circle, but they're not the same length. So how do we fix that? I'll just get a square. And I guess I did IZ last time. I mean, it hardly matters which component you take off. IZ is the length of time equals zero. Equals zero, and this does generate an S1 action because you rotate around I at speed one, but what's wrong with this? It's not smooth at zero. And I would just like to take a moment to look at this example because it's very important. If I've added two functions, so we can look at this and see this is constant on the coexoid point. Both of these are constant on the coexistence, so they're invariant under the coexoid function. But what that Well, what that tells me, if I look at any of the components here, or really any function in any of the components here, it's going to be acting by the co-joint action. So this action will preserve this function, which means that they'll commute. This is, I'm going to talk about Billeman and Sternberg's theorem, but I'm not really going to, I'm sort of giving the proof now, as much of a proof as I'm going to give, is it all comes from this idea that I can. Comes from this idea that I can bind communities in functions by having this called collective functions. So, this is called a collective function because it's a function, it's a function on G star, project G star onto the last component. Which is invariant under the project. Especially we're just linear functions here. That's the idea. And I noticed I did this. And I noticed I did this for the particular example, but this think about this. This works for any SO3, any Hamiltonian SO3. It's really not special for this case. Any questions? This is actually kind of the key idea. Yep. This word collective function, I don't think you heard before. Yeah, well, St. Gilman and Sternberg. So I don't know how much more widely it's caught on, but that's what they call it. And the title of one of the papers. Yeah, I want to put it in that change itself, but it's in your papers. It's in a title of yours, too. Well, that's how it's right. You may not. I'm not sure we use it. Oh, maybe, I don't remember. But that's what we can struggle. Although there's a subtlety here, I mean, here, this is even not smooth. Maybe this is right, but that's the problem. We lose smoothness and we gain periodicity. That's the fundamental trade-off. That's the fundamental trade-off you need to keep in mind. Okay. So that's one example of a notable refraction that has a Hamiltonian or a moment map. Here is another example. So let O be the color joint orbit. Through lambda and G star the inclusion map picking O entity star in its middle. So it's a very nice example, and that's the other sort of final piece with Landy. Okay, so I'm now ready. Okay, so I'm now ready to define Gavin Gelpon-Satlin systems from a symplectic perspective. So I'm maybe not going to say this quite the way it's normally stated, it's the way I like to say it. So there exists a continuous map by from the college. From the college orbit into half the dimension of O or the complex dimension of O, so it's half the real dimension, which is what we were using last time, such that the moment image is a convex polytope delta. Moreover, on the freedom of delta naught phi is smooth and regular and phi I and phi j plus occupant. Plus on continuous. So, all this pre-image is an integable system in the classical way. But globally, it's only continuous. Some people call this sign, some people call systems like this, like an integral system, completely integral, which tells us, or maybe there exists no action angle coordinates, which is really. Which is really special and not something you expect from a random pinnacle system. So it's really, it's kind of just different. You didn't include periodicity in the statement. Maybe you want to replace the PIPJ equals zero by saying it's a Q million? Yes. So I do. Thank you guys for what I'm about to say. Thank you. That is what I want to say. Yes, thank you. So I, in my effort to put things in, I let things out. Right, so we generate set. Let's just generate a T action. So on an open dense set, this looks exactly like what we now have. It's like some plastic torque metal. But there are these bits on the boundary, which are a bit weird. Which are a bit weird. So, when I was, I hope to talk about why they introduced this, they call it the Galfa unfast. But I thought I didn't have time to go into it in detail, but I just want to at least imagine what was their goal here was to study geometric quantization. study geometric quantization oh so what does this mean these are various ways that you can take a g action on a symphactic manifold and turn it into a representation of g on the vector space and so they're important representation theory this was their goal i'm not gonna get I don't know if you get the details, but at least let me say that. So let's look at an example. I sort of solved, I said, my goal for these two talks was to solve mysteries. So let me explain to you how as a graduate student, I saw this and was like, what? So let's follow me the flag on scene three. So first we have a maximum torus T2. T2X on the flag on C3. And let me call the moment map U and draw the picture. So of course I get a new of O to T star, the moment map. I can draw the moment image, but I'm going to also just decorate it a little bit. I'm going to draw all the singular values. Over undercross things, okay. So you get a picture like this. I've drawn the armored undercrossings to indicate that those don't meet. Right? So that's what it looks like. Maybe, maybe, sorry, or it's a picture in R2. Yep, it's a picture in R2. And I can prove to you that it's a picture in R2. That's okay. The picture, not to. That's okay. No, I would. I can't extend to a T3 action and why? It's easy to prove. So each interior line would be on the top or bottom, right? If you sanded it. If you extended it, this would be a picture of a three-dimensional positive, right? Clearly. And each of these lines would either be on the top of the bottom, because it's an impossibility. And because it's smooth, they're not allowed to cross. I just want to make a shout-out, a little frown-face, to my sitting taste, Lee, who feel who's coming the other direction. In the other direction, but like if you don't have a equation like this, you can accept. Um, but sorry, what are the clear lines? What do they look like? So try to look at the three-dimensional picture, right? Just imagine it, and that you're looking at just the shadow picture, yep. Yeah, so he's going. So these singular lines, these are these are places where the map is not regular. Oh, yes, sorry. There's a place where the map is not regular. And what does it mean that one is going under the other one? They're wrong with images, right? Get on the wrong one image of the same, but they're different points. So we have these are CP1s, which are fixed by a circle, and they're disjointed. You mean, aha, yeah, yeah, yeah. So the frame of this thing is the balloon sculpture. Yeah, yeah, each of the creatures is really just is larger than right, okay, okay, okay. Yeah, each of these. Yeah, each of these is an S2, and everywhere they meet, the S2s join out of vertex. That's, sorry, S2, which is fixed by an S1. And the direction of it tells you which S1. Everyone's talking about conceiving, but it's non-conceived. So basically, what do yellow disturbers do? They say, oh, what if I just took this? Jot there. I'm going to shave my over under crossing, but that's allowed. That's clearly. That is that, and that's clearly a projection of the pre-metropolitan community, right? Nothing that theory says that you can just say, and I was like, I'm like, what? That's just so weird. To me, like, where is it coming from? Why didn't you just add dots to your pie cup and look things that you don't think can do? And the answer to that comes from perfect generation. The answer to that comes from what? For a few generations. So. So the question that came up, how come you can draw this polytope that sort of comes from a completely integral system on your flag manifold? So what they do. So I guess the question is, is that it was not the one skeleton of a three-dimensional polytope, but if you had this point in it, then it becomes the one skeleton of a three-dimensional polyphone. Yes. And this is the image of the Gillamonster. Gill has dropped that. But what's this to dimension of Polly? Oh, can you see it? Yeah, I can see it. What is it? What does it mean? Well, so it is the image of the Gaup and Sattland Poly. It is the image of this system. You take the flag of C3 and you can define this map, the Gilman Sterfra defined. The image you get is this polysope, where now it's in three dimensions. So it seems a little weird, right? I think the danger of talking about a mystery that seems mysterious. So yeah, so what you had said so far had nothing to do with that theorem there. It's just you have a torso action on it, and you can form a small mark, and you see this part. The part that has to do with the theorem is that if I do this for the example of the platonic rate, this is the polytope I get. That's theorem. So I was going to construct the fly, but I think I don't have time. So I'll skip that. So the question is, how So, the question is, how do they? And oh, another thing is: so, warning: the T-action here, so this torus is not holomorphic. So, they get an action which is not holomorphic. And so, where does this come from? And it comes from a torque degeneration. So we need to have the generation. It's how you define this path. I am through it has the power. That's not the previous, but it's perfect. You're going to explain this. Yeah, that's how I started again. So for Taylor Astomaga, so we need a little bit more than what we've seen before. We need a flat family. Family of algebraic varieties and we need an embedding of our family into PM such that, first of all, the First of all, the embedding commutes with the natural projection map. This projection, we need the pi inverse of C star. This is X cross C star. And then we need this all to respect the symplectic form. So, what does that mean? That's the third condition. Let omega tota be a scaling form on the EPF plus the standard metric on C. C and we need X omega tilde. Sorry, chi. No. X1 omega tilde, restricted to X1 is symplectomorphic to X omega and X naught omega tilde resulted to X. Omega tilde restricted to X naught is a Kayler or a Glamatical. So it's more of a thing that you need to add in this function. Okay, so that's maybe not for surprising. Here's the surprising part. So let chi smooth be the smooth part. And let the tilde be the Hamiltonian vector field over the imaginary part of pi. So pi is a map to c so the imaginary part of pi is a perfectly well-defined function. So I can look at its Hamiltonian flow. Since pi is holomorphic, if I take the gradient flow for the real part of pi, I get minus b tilde. So if I flow along v tilde, I'm just reducing the real part of pi. And then I want to let v, I want everything to flow together. Want everything to flow together. So I'm going to make it unit speed. So it's not flowing at different speeds and different points. And the theorem, which is really what makes this work, though in some ways it's after part of the rest of the work is the theorem. So the flow along V. So I flow along V, so I'm reducing the real value of pi. So I'm mapping, I'm going to map the one fiber to the zero fiber. So induces a symplectomorphism. Psi from an open dense set U contained in X1. So open dense set of the fiber over X1, which I'm going to just identify with X. So the smooth part, the fiber over the intersection of the smooth part with the fiber over zero. So, moreover, it extends to a continuous projective map side. So, sorry, not go to core because we know what this one side from X to X. So, we have a continuous. So we have a continuous map from x to x naught. It is not smooth everywhere. But it is smooth, and in fact, it's a symphomorphism on an open dense set. And another thing you should notice is the warning. This map does not Does not respect. And you shouldn't be so surprised, as I just thought it by the norm, but the norms are depth to complex structures. They're not so I have a little together. Yep, you want the speed upstairs or downstairs to be constant. Downstairs to be closed. Okay. So I got this from a paper. I copied this exactly from the paper. It's 70 speed downstairs, but then if what it says, they only need to. I mean, exactly, this is what's claimed. It's also true. I want it to be one downstairs. Okay. So, great. So, great. So, and this is generally speaking where this liminal space comes from. Because we see we have a big complex structure everywhere. So both X1 and X0 both aren't pillars. And they sit inside this pillar. But the mat between them is not pillars. It's only some fabric. That's, I think, that's a big source from the simplest. From the sympathetic point of view, a sort of interesting and surprising fact. And why is this relevant in this case? It is because we have a theorem which is sort of, I think, the work is done, but. Work is done by Ishanao Nohera, both of the work, but then it was sort of formalized and stated, but choke him all, which is there exists a toric degeneration or the color to an orbit. Color to our orbit and this form that we'll be looking on it, such that the following diagram can be used. So you can take a color dark orbit, and we said this has this map psi. What are the essence? Are you back the flag here? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So, oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm sorry. I want you in posting and. I want you in forcing me and I was kind of I skipped some stuff. I have a little restrict to UN. So various things are known in other cases, but just to simplify exposition, I'm restricted to UN for most is known. Right. So right, so we have a dark administration of the color going forward, the flatty flag, so it's not necessarily. Any flag, so it's not necessarily complete, any flag to subtorp variety. And we get following Harada Kappa, we get this map psi, which is a continuous map. And the claim is that if we let this be the map that Gillim and Starberg construct, this is the Galfran-Statland map. And this is the moment map. So, in general, it's singular, but you can still define a moment map. Just because you have a moment map on CPM, you can restrict it. It makes sense to call it a moment map. This diagram changes so that this Galvan-Settlin system comes from this torture perhaps in a very real strong space. Very real strong. We're taking the curve of the generation and we're just pulling it back, and we get a completely angry system. That's the Delphin satellite system. I'll just say one more word. So with the goal of their paper is to study what Lagans, the Lagrangians are super important in geometry for many, many reasons, and we can get the And we can get the Bronchians and the boundary of the Palatine. So there's something. That's important. And another, I just want to mention the Hamilton Ploto. We deal with the geometric quantizations. I told you, the Gilman's, the Gilman-Sternberg's main goal, was sort of understand different polarizations, sort of geometric quantization, and they also understood that in terms of these. They also understood that in terms of this torque. So I think that's what the punchline is supposed to be. This thing that seems like a story is strange ends up totally making sense because people get it from Torque Generation. That's the thing that's in the middle of the city.
