All right, so first, of course, is I want to mention some of my collaborators. You think this has been long going? And so Jean-Eric was a student finished, now is in TU Munich. And Yuwe is now assistant professor in UC Riverside. All right. So now you. Uh, so so now you see it's a this is hello tag that you can write on the blackboard. So, uh, the whole problem is uh suppose you look at a two-mixed fluid. So, basically, you have a whole domain, you have omega one, omega two, the two occupied by the two fluid, and the whole domain is the union of these two, and of course you have the free interface, it's the intersection of these two. All right, so uh, in this talk, currently, uh, I do not talk about the concentration the Talk about the concentration, the contribution of these boundaries. So, this is also connected later as well with all those moving contact line you're talking about. So, I should draw another picture. I should draw the omega 2 is inside there. Anyway, so you can have a different row one, row two, mu1, mu2. So, this is the kind of things that like in the fluid with all navigators will all come from there. And also, so this gamma. Um, now, so this gamma t is the moving interface we are talking about, all right. So, if I'm a PDE guy, so usually what you do is you write on the Navier strokes in the each individual domains. And of course, you write on the gamma t, you write a kinematic boundary condition. We just saw, so this kinematic boundary condition actually has nothing to do with your fluid or solid. It just means you do not go close, you do not change type. So, this is actually, they always call that emissibility. Actually, they always call that immisibility. So, this is Daniel also wrote this earlier. And of course, with this kinematic bond, you can also need a force balance condition. The force balance condition usually is the stress. So, if you write in the stress on a normal direction, it's balanced out by surface force. This surface force can be anything. If a surface force is the motion, is the mean curvature, we're on the normal direction with the constant, you call it a surface tangent constant. The constant, you call the surface tangent constant. Then, for such kind of thing, you actually have the energy law. So, the energy law actually is very easy. You just write omega one half rho u square plus the surface area times this one is due to the so if I don't throw this out, if I throw this out, that means for any one fluid, I can draw a fictitious interface, right? So, in that case, this surface tension is zero, right? So, that means surface tension really tells. So, that means surface tension really tells the difference between the two fluids. That's how you talk about this. So, if you have the two fluids, then this area, then you have this one. This is like a Navier-Stokes equation. And how do you prove that actually is very easy, right? So, you have, so for Los, you always have this verified formulation. You have a moving interface, you take a derivative of that, then this is you can take a derivative inside and then take the derivative on the surface that give you this, right? So, this is what. This, right? So, this is what yesterday was some formula like this. So, you just add it up, add it up, and you have that. Okay. So, of course, you choose f is equal to one, that gives you the mean curvature, x squared. So, that is motion by mean curvature talking about. Actually, such kind of things have been doing a lot. So, in the PDE in numerics, but actually, there's something ambiguity of such kind of formulation. So, do not think about sharp interface as the most accurate. All right? accurate all right so for instance if i have a two interface if i have two fluid if i have the two fluid incompressible incompressible here is that incompressible on the surface if you think a little bit about that okay so do you have that information here so mixing of an incompressible with another incompressible if you have mixing is that incompressible not necessary right all right but anyway so i'm going to talk about another Anyway, so I'm going to talk about another approach. It's a little bit different. So it's the basically is, I hated to talk about, I hated to do something like this of a shop interface. So basically is, I'm going to say it's a label ring. So basically you label this minus one, plus one, and a minus one, and then you created the two things, so-called mixing energy. So this turn tells you everything is to do the same. Everything is to the same. This is philic. This thing's one epsilon zero. You want to separate. So this is a phobic and a philic, right? If epsilon is bigger than one, that's phobic, that gives you purely invisibility. If a lesser or less than one, it's a philic, you totally mix together. So say if this is zero, then it's just one fluid. They totally mix in together, right? So, and of course, we know this one. This is a typical, the most important thing of all these gamma convergence, whatever. This is always an example. Epsilon times this actually. Example epsilon times this I should converge to the area. I should write a constant in front of there, right? All right, so if I'm doing that, immediately the first ones I'm going to say, I'm going to write this condition. So what is this condition? This condition really means if we're on the trajectory, it's the same as the initial data. So the particles do not change type when you move. So this is a kinematic boundary condition, like what we talked about earlier before. And then the total energy now will have a kinetic energy, like a fluid. Kinetic energy like a fluid, but plus a mixing energy. But remember, there's no surface now, right? Save, everything is a bulk. So I'm doing this and of course, you just cramp the machinery. So this is again, we saw a little bit yesterday. So basically, you create the flow map, and if you have a density, then there's always a determinant come up. Come up. So you so basically that's what you're having. You basically have a Navier Stokes equation with this extra stress and coupled with this transport equation. So this actually is the really, this is the water wave equation. This is the water wave equation with the surface tension. And of course, yesterday we have some example. We have some question about the dispersive property of the surface tension. This is where you see because nothing here is dispersed. Because nothing here is dispersed, there's no dissipation mechanism here, everything is dispersive, okay? And actually, this is almost like a wave equation. So, and so that's basically tells you the energy law is a kinetic energy plus this mixing energy zero. So you see, there's no dissipation. Okay, now how do you put in the dissipation? You can put in the dissipation like strokes. So then you have a navy stroke, you have this equation like You have this equation like a conhelier. Sorry. So you have this, and of course, you said, okay, that only gives you the dissipation on the velocity. How about to put the dissipation on the phi? Then you put in this one that give you this kind of like Alan Khan coupled with the Mavi-Stokes equation. This is like, we're assuming expert people doing this. Xiaomi has all the codes, and the Jesuit has all the codes solving this equation. So now you see where this is. All right. So now, what I want to say a little bit So now, what I want to say a little bit, so it's great. Danielle already did all the introduction below. So now I want to take out that's all about the fluid. So let's talk a little bit about elasticity. So what is elasticity? Elasticity is always talking about the energy depends on the deformation tensor. This is WF. And so the linear elasticity means you have F squared. Then you just write it. But I remember one thing. Elasticity is always in the Lagrangian coordinate. Always. Lagrangian coordinate. Always. So immediately you point it out. Kooking theorem is in the Lagrangian coordinate. Fluid is in the Orlandian coordinate. That's where all the difficulty is. All right. So I'm going to write an energy law. One half rho square plus this one. This is this. And of course, you derive, you had a wave equation, okay? And incompressibility, you actually can do incompressible elasticity. Determine is one. That'll give you this equation. This is very hard to do. So that's the reason very, you have very difficult you solve the Lagrangian elasticity. Because you solved the Lagrangian elasticity with incompressibility because look at how bad this is. All right. But however, you can write everything in the Olean coordinate. You can write elasticity in the Olean coordinate. We heard a lot about doing the Lagrangian for the fluid. You can do Olean in the elasticity. So you actually, with all this, this has been done many times. And actually, look at this equation. You have a transport equation with F, which is the matrix. And this looks like a vorticity equation. And this looks like a vorticity equation, right? The vorticity is exactly like this. Divergence U0, almost like a Navi-Stokes equation, but no viscosity, like Euler equation incompressible, but right-hand side, you have the Cauchy-Green tensor. All right. So this equation, if you don't like to give a student, they said, oh, this looks like a fluids, complex fluid. This has nothing to do with complex fluids. This one is a pure elasticity. This is incompressible elasticity for this equation. Okay, so now I'm going to. Okay, so now I'm going to do in the 2D divergence f is zero, you can prove. Then f can be written like gradient per phi is a vector. You come back, you plug everything into this equation, you come back. And what does this equation look like? This equation is that you look like what I write here. This is exactly the equation I look at like what I write here. Okay? So this is the equation I'm writing. Equation I'm writing that. So, elasticity, really, so this is my punchline. Free interface motion in incompressive fluid is really an incompressible elasticity problem. Of course, you knew that. So, people always talk about the surface tension is like elastic force, right? So, that is elasticity, not only like, it is, but form by form. All right. So, in fact, in the many of you in the conference. The like in the complex free, there's some order ray, whatever. It's all in this case. So, this is very important because that's how we do PDE. For such kind of system, actually, you have an energy law. Immediately said, okay, I'm going to do the Larry-Hoff solution. In fact, this problem is still open. Don't let anyone tell you they know how to do the viscous elasticity, Larry-Hoff solution. For this one, actually, this is still open. There's no such kind of result. No such kind of result. So, in fact, so I derived something like so, basically telling you, give you some flavor. This is the Navy Stokes equation with Cauchy-Green tensor. You have stokes, but however, this one is pure transport, right? Pure transport is always a difficulty. So, what I do, of course, you guys said, okay, I'm going to add in something like this one here. Okay. And as soon as for any fixed epsilon, you can prove whatever you have, Larry-Hoff solution, Galagian method, everything works. Okay. Method, everything works. Okay, that can be done. But now the whole point is why epsilon goes to zero, which you're having. Why epsilon goes to zero? Velocity actually has no problem because we know all this Orban-Leon's competitiveness. It still works here. And in fact, you can prove F also converging to the F, but in this L infinity out to in the weak form, that basically give you the, so basically this equation, I know how to do that, plus to the limit. Actually, it's a difficult lemma. Okay. Is a difficult lemma. Okay, but however, I want to point to you: is the difficulties here: weak times weak, weak times weak converges. There, you do the Fadou lemma, there's a positive definite. And now the whole thing is that, can you prove this one zero? That's the whole thing. If I prove this zero, everything's done. All right. So, what you do? So, first is you do energy method. I just want to show a little bit of energy method. It's like variation, like Daniela did earlier, that is spreading the. Earlier, that is better in the PDE way. So, this equation you multiply by u, this equation multiply by f, then with the limiting equation, you then you subtract, then you crank up the machinery. Now, let me show you what is the end result. This trace of this M. Remember, this m is a positive symmetry matrix. Trace gives you everything. So, the trace is integral 0 t. This is the L infinity like that. This is the Bill Cardomaida, right? This is exactly the Buil Kardomaida. That means if we. That means if you have the built-kind of my, I have this one here. Okay? But however, you also know you can, it's a can you do a different form of the built-kind of my, then that's a different story. But again, I will tell you this is not necessarily worse than nemistokes. It's also not better than nemistokes in this case. Okay, so global existing energy solution, Larry Hopes, is open. It's totally open. For small data, you have a bunch of results. Actually, we have been doing. Result actually, we have been doing this for the last now, it's 20 years. So, this is Fang Hua Leng and Ping Zhang. And the first work in the small data globalization is 2004. And in 205, this is the Lei Zinger. It's OE, and this is the Fudan people. So, we prove some for the small string. That means you are allowed to rotate. So, this kind of result is already there. I don't want to get into more about this. Getting to more about this. I want to tell you. So, many of you heard recently. So, yeah, so you're in the cost. So, the first time I heard this question, David Keys was telling me 40% of the money is in computing MHD. But it's not the regular MHD. The MHD, this one cannot put the dissipation like a Laplace here. That is 10 to the minus 8, the useful one. So, basically, the MHD equation has a Navier-Stokes equation with the Lorentz force, divergence. Lorentz force divergence-free with this kind of magnetic field transport. This is like how do you solve this equation? So, this is the many, many works on this. But I want to tell you is for such kind of equation in the 2D, you can also write into the flow map. Basically, if in 2D, because the divergence B is zero, you can write this one. And this Lorentz force is exactly like this. So, basically, it's the same equation as before. Basically, it's the same equation as before. Free interface motion with surface tension is the same as the MHD equation. That's my function. All right. So how am I doing? I'm okay, right? So my friend knows if you give me time, I can use all the time. I can talk fast. All right. All right. So that is all the things before, right? So today I wanted to say a little bit about different perspectives. About different perspectives. This is the lateral what we're talking about. It's recall Alan Khan to Kangili. So, phase-field equation, we always said, what is Alan Khan? Alan Khan, basically, this kind of equation, parabolic equation, it's a gradient flow. It's a d over dt is energy is due to the gradient flow. The right-hand side is phi t squared with some boundary condition. Usually, the boundary condition is just the integration by plot. You get rid of all the boundary terms. You have this. And what is conhelion? Conhelia is to do also see a lot is instead of only have this, you have a divergence of m times gradient of that one. And it's the same energy, but the right-hand side is gradient of the Laplace squared, right? So this is everyone knows. Actually, almost all the times people think about that, these are always related. I mean, Jiang Kang used this both for the phase transactions. Okay? But these Okay, but this boundary condition I'm writing here, I use these things just to try to get rid of all the boundary terms. So, this is the usual way. Okay, but however, what happened if I wanted to look deeper? Then, what's the difference between these two? Instead, I say, oh, one's a phenomenological, one's, I just changed the mathematics, put in some dissipation I know how to handle. This is what I'm going to say: free energy, both of them is the same. Free energy, both of them is the same. When you have a free energy, if you have a phi, you do the variation on that we call the chemical potential. So, I think Jing Guoliu used the same word. So, for the fastest descent, you write phi t as minus gamma mu. So, this is like an L2 gradient. Okay, but right now, I'm going to say, what happened if I talk about a diffusion? What is diffusion, by the way? Diffusion first, because the diffusion thinks you have a conservation law always. That's the diffusion. Always. That's the diffusion, yes. For such a kind of conservation law diffusion, if you write in the flow map, it just row on the trajectory is the initial data divided by the determinant, right? So the density is the determinant. This is exactly the diffusion is. Okay, but suppose my energy only depends on a rho, and the dissipation is eta times u squared. So immediately you see this is very, very specific. The energy only depends on a rho. Depends on rho and the right hand side is u square. Then I crank up the machinery. What is the ground? Because rho is depends on this. You just plug it in and there's a determinant because you change the coordinate from OLA to Lagrangian. And the right-hand side, you also put it in. You have XT, you have this. Okay? That's the VASA step you're talking about. So basically, diffusion is a gradient flow. Diffusion is a gradient flow on the flow map, not on the function itself, not on the density. So, if you do this one, if you look at this one, and for the L2 gradient of the flow map, you do the variation with respect to X, that will give you the pressure. In fact, the pressure will certify exactly the Lagano transform. So, I know many of you are doing the Wasser study. You see this all the time. Okay? Okay, and this equation, the force balance equation looks like Darcy's law, right? Gradient pressure is something like U. You call this, yeah, basically Darcy. If energy is rho log rho, it gives you the diffusion. If energy is rho to the gamma, it gives you the cross-media equation. Okay, what happened if energy is h1? It's like this. That exactly gives you the cohelion. So that is what I'm saying. So, that is what I'm saying. Conkelia, you should think about it as a diffusion equation. Congelia is a real diffusion equation. If it is a diffusion equation, that means congelia has a transport, has a particle, has a trajectory. Okay? But Alan Kind, they are two gradient. So that's a diff one is a diffusion, it's a gradient. Okay, now let's play a little bit more. So one thing, so many of you know, when you do the clan helium, let's say I learned this from numerical. I learned this from numeric. Actually, I learned maybe actually Jishin for me. Or she want one, you guys. So, so, what do they do is if I don't have alpha, that's conhelier. They plus alpha phi t here. And they know this is great for numerics. Okay, so all of you do know. And so, for the PDE way, how do you do that? And in all the time, just look at for a PDE way, yes, and it makes sense because you. DE way, yes, and it makes sense because you still multiply by the chemical potential both sides. The energy, the same energy, now you integration by part, you find you still have two squares, but however, you have this one, but you have extra this one. This is extremely good. Why is that? Because originally, if you look at this equation, the original energy law, where's my energy law? Anyway, it doesn't matter. So if you originally, without for the energy, you originally up without alpha the energy law gives you the control on the space on the phi right the three derivatives up but you do not give the time control this one automatically give you the time control so this is the priority so suddenly when you use the the when you you you do not need the orbile lens you see oval lens is try to use pde such that you constrain the space you change into this time and here i'd give you time in a plural and i In a plural, and if you look, look at the linear linearizations of this equation, actually, like this is equal to this times this. Immediately, you can see if alpha is small, it's zero, it's by Laplace. As alpha is big, it's like a Laplace equation. It's like a heat equation. So, this is extremely good if you are doing like for analysis. If I'm doing like a Bessel space, you change it into high frequency, low frequency. Okay, high frequency, the Byla plus decay much faster. The bi Laplace decay much faster, and the low frequency you see the Laplace. So, this is much easier to do to do this analysis. So, this term is very good for PDE. Okay, but from the mechanical point of view, what I just said, this is still diffusion, is diffusion equation satisfy this. But at the energy law, what is this energy? What's the meaning of doing this? What I'm saying is that you remember that in the conhelia, conhelia, The congelia earlier, I just write it, right? You remember? The conhelia here is eta u square. Now, what's this new things plug in here? It's a phi square u square, but it has another term of divergent phi u. Okay, if phi is one, this is divergence u square. It's almost like a Stokes, part of the Stokes, divergence U square. That means you're doing this actually is instead of doing the This actually is instead of doing the Darcy, you actually have a kind of information in the derivative. It's like a Stokes. So when you're doing this, you crack one of machinery, you recover what this is. Okay. So that, of course, we always know the Stokes is better than Kanhe, right? So that is what this is. But however, this is not 100%. This is not a full Stokes. It's only partial information on the Stokes. That is the important thing here. All right, so this is the beyond continuum mechanics. What is the beyond continuum mechanics? So, mechanic, continue, actually, the definition of the continuum mechanics means you can do flow map. You can do Lagrangian or Lenien both. Okay, so when you cannot do the Lagrangian and the Orlando together, you're doing something beyond. Structure, fluid, structure interaction is one on that. All right, so actually, in engineering, they do a lot of so-called Alan-Kon-Konhelium. Okay. Kunk conhelier. Okay, what is the allen conheli? You just put allen conhelia together because and you can use the same energy law, it's still dissipation. Actually, what I want to say is, so this is the this page is the talk I was planning to do here. So now it's only one slide. So this you should think about, this is the effusion. Actually, you should think about the alam kong as a chemical reaction. Okay? Chemical reaction. Okay. So this actually is a reaction diffusion equation. So usually in all the time, in the PDE, where you have the reaction diffusion, this is a diffusion equation. It's like a parabolic diffusion equation. This is like a polynomial something. That's it because the energy is not H1. If you do the energy is H1, this is a Kanhe Alan Khan. Okay, so we have a bunch of work I'm doing here. So this is something I'm going to just put in your mind. Okay, so this. Okay, so this is the one thing I want to do: the so-called boundary effect. So, everything what I did earlier is in the bulk. Okay, how about to do the boundary? So, recall, if you do the gradient flow, you have this one, this, this is a gradient flow. If I do the variation, you got the parabolic. Actually, yeah, I don't know how you call that. It's diffusion equation, but with this kind of boundary condition, either differentiated or nouma. Okay, you give it. Dereciated or Neumann. Okay, you give it initial data. Okay, what happened if I have bulk plus surface and the dissipation also bulk plus surface? Okay, then of course suddenly, if you do the variation, you find that this energy correspondent in the bulk is the same equation as before, but a surface has a dynamic there. So this is the dynamic boundary condition. And more importantly, look, if a gamma one. Importantly, look, if a gamma one is infinity, that means this term is gone. That means only transport, only dissipation is on the surface. And so you saw Laplace equation and this equation. And what is this kind of thing? If you have this initial data, it's only on the boundary. That's a Dirichlet data. This is Neumann data. This is Dirichlet to Neumann. This is Dirichlet to Neumann semi-group. Okay, so that's the reason you saw all these kinds of things. All these kinds of things, and our friend Rudeme has been always talking about eigenvalue of this. This is a sticker of eigenvalue problem. So, this is naturally here. And if you write this one into here, this is a Laplace half. So, there's a frictional Laplace equation if you do the surface. Do you see any frictional Laplace? You never see that. You increase the domain. This is Ricardo is doing. You increase the domain. Every frictional Laplace becomes a Laplace with some dynamic boundary service. Plus, with some dynamic boundary surface. So, this is exactly where that comes from. That's where the cafferelli comes from. Okay, so this is how PDE way you look at this. All right, but anyway, this is not what my point is. My point is, how about to go back to the conhelium? It's a diffusion. So, you have a diffusion in all the time, I have surface energy and a surface dissipation. Okay. And with this one, you have to have this kind of boundary condition, non-flux boundary condition, and the kind of Flux boundary condition and the kind of natural boundary condition. This is actually the consequence you do the variation. Okay. So now I'm going to change my energy law. I said for the diffusion, I also have bulk plus surface. So this is the exactly moving contact line, which we have heard a lot about yesterday. This is what you have in because this is that bulk with the interface. And this is on the surface because you have that ring, you have a contact ring. That ring, you have a contact ring now. Of course, you do 2D, it's a contact point. You don't have this, but if you have a 3D, the contact ring, that's what this energy is about. Okay, you have a bulk surface and the dissipation is also. You can have the bulk like a car head. You can also have this one. By the way, this is exactly what the Xiaoping Xiaoping left. This is Xiaoping Wang, Chen Ji Zhen, and the Simping. This is their work. Their work is that the corresponding energy has the dissipation. One of the energy has the dissipation, like a conheli on the block and this allenkan on the surface. But why alenkan on the surface? Alankan on the surface is not a physics. It's a phenomenological. So actually in 2011, this is a ghost named Maronville. This is Jay, your friends, and this is Alan Moronville and his collaborators. Actually, they already have this kind of thing. They said, okay, I'm going to have the service and dissipation. Dissipation and surface dissipation and the bulk dissipation almost the same form. But, however, unfortunately, when you do that, you find on the surface energy, you actually have a choice. It's not uniquely determined. So, what they use is a kind of like surface, the trace of the chemical potential on the surface from bulk is the same as the surface potential in the summer surface. So, they put a such kind of boundary condition and then they exchange. And then they exchange. So, this is what the GMS model is. I couldn't do this when I first see that. Actually, I don't believe that because this one has later telling you violate some of the mechanics. It's a pure PDE. So this corresponded because they got the motivation from Windsor boundary conditioning probability. So conservation law is this kind of thing. So this actually in Physics has some problem. This actually in physics has some problem because the trace of the density is not the density. You think about what is density? Density is a number divided by the volume. You take a trace, it's not divided by area. Okay? So the trace of the density is not a density. So I learned this for a long time ago. So that's the reason if you do probability, of course, here, I just said it's a probability, something like that. But if you're talking about density, you actually have a problem. All right. So 2017 with Wuhao, this is my. Oh, this is my closest friend collaborator and very nice young guy. Now he's not young anymore. 2017, we look at exactly kind of, it's still the same kind of dissipation, but with different kind of boundary condition. So we have this kind of non-flux. So basically, bulk and surface cannot exchange. And then you derive another kind of system, and we did a web post. System, and we did a web post on this. And this, and with the GMS models, is exactly same manageable. So, why this is difficult? So, that's a reading in 2020. So, I have this, this is my former postdoc, and this is a student of Gaki. So, yesterday, I think someone you said about Agaki's work. Exactly. So, he's a student of Agaki, Harold Gaki. So, all of them were with me. So, we spend something. were with me so we spend something we crank up the whole model actually can it turns out the gms and the things what we did at hau is exactly is exactly uh the limit of this more general case so uh it's a it's a whole page but let me explain to you what this is it what this is is actually if you are the using the uh mausland's language you want to talk about any mechanics as a flow To talk about any mechanics as a flow map, if the flow map without a boundary periodic, you don't have a problem, but with a bonded domain, you actually have a problem because you're from a bonded domain to bonded domain. You can only define the flow map from inside to the inside. So that's a non-flux boundary condition. If you have an exchange, you don't have such a kind of flow map. It just doesn't exist. Okay, so this is very similar to what you said yesterday. Okay, so this is a you called what a ying set. This is the exact, but however. The exactory, but however, you introduce another thing. So, basically, what we did here is you have a three-flow map inside to inside, boundary to boundary, that can all be determined. But inside to boundary, it's a chemical reaction. So you think about it then as a different species. So from bulk to the boundary, from boundary to bulk, has nothing to do with trace or whatever, it just changed particle. So that is called a chemical reaction. So for a while, So, for a while, we actually develop a theory for this thing actually corresponding to the pre-Gaussian so-called reaction trajectory. So basically what I'm doing, what I'm saying is for such a kind of thing, you need a three flow map, box to box, surface to surface, and the exchange. It's a different flow map. You have three flow maps. So in that case, you can handle all this. Okay, so you can see if L infinity goes to infinity, you recover. Go to infinity, you recover this mere with a Hawus model. With zero, you have it's almost like a Robin-Bunge condition when one end you have a Neumann, the other end you have a Dirich. So this actually corresponds to this. And all this fell into the Ansaga's linear response. Okay. And in fact, Ansaka has this two famous paper. We always use the second one. I never understand the first one until I did this. So now I know what exactly what Ansaka is doing. Okay, so all these. Okay, so all this paper has been out. So if you have that. So I don't think I have time. So I just mentioned a little bit to you. So as soon as they talk about a chemical reaction, you know you have to talk about temperature. Okay. So how do you do the chemical potential? So you do the hemmy, you throw the two things together, you do the chemical reaction, suddenly temperature raise up your battery, right? So in that case, you have to. So, so in that case, you have to use the temperature as a parameter, you have to derive the temperature equation. So, this is so-called a thermodynamic. We call it a thermal effect. And in fact, this business is quite evolved. So, it has already been almost 10 years what we're doing this. But let me tell you a little bit of what we have. So, for instance, the ideal guess we know how to do. Ideal guess, what do we know how to do? Diffusion, we know how to do. Uh, diffusion we know how to do, and the chemical reaction we know how to do. Okay, and uh uh and in that case, and this is so-called entropy production with the energy, how do you correspond to the second law of the thermodynamic with the entropy always increasing? Uh, this actually uh is quite interesting here, but anyway, so I think I run out of my time, I'm a little bit too ambitious. Of my time, I'm a little bit too ambitious here. Thank you.
