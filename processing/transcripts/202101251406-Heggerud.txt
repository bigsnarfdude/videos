The water that's going to, of course, influence cyanobacteria abundance. But then, of course, in the example of Pigeon Lake, there's going to be some social pressures and financial costs that are associated with the cyanobacteria and mitigating it. And then, of course, those costs are going to play into how many people around the lake actually attempt to mitigate it or who's going to push back. So, kind of just like Yo was talking in his previous talk. Just like Yo was talking in his previous talk about cooperation versus defection. So that's the type of dynamic that we're looking at. Now, of course, all of these aspects have kind of been studied in the past. So for example, Yoawasa, who I have the pleasure of following up with right now, he talked about a discrete time model that had that kind of considered the nutrient pollution and this social pressure feedback loop and cooperation defecting dynamics. And this dynamic was actually quite, quite. And this dynamic was actually quite rich. There was a lot of different scenarios that can come out of it. More so, Stephen Carpenter in 2005-2008, he studied the eutrophication mainly to do with agricultural soil runoff. So excess phosphorus in the soils and it would leach into the lakes. And he kind of had this classical hysteresis type curve. That's actually a quite interesting study. Interesting study. And then, so my co-supervisor Hao Wang, he, among others, so Sellerberger, Jeff Heisman, studied the cyanobacteria abundance and its dependence on light availability. Of course, in those models, they also considered nutrient, but they weren't focusing on it as being a pollution factor. They were just considering it as a droop growth term. Okay, so all these. All these, so I should mention as well, of course, there are many other studies on these things. These are just kind of the three main ones that I'd like to highlight. And I'm sure actually many of you are listening to this talk right now thinking, oh, I might have done something similar. So I'd love to hear about it, of course. And so what I want to look at is, of course, this whole picture. And I don't think so far anything has been so cohesive to connect all five of these aspects. So that's what I'm going to attempt to do. So, that's what I'm going to attempt to do here. Now, first off, though, before I connect it all, I want to make sure I have a really good ecological model down pat. So, I'm just going to take a couple of minutes and talk about just the ecological dynamics. And then we can get into the full system here. So, for my ecological dynamics, I want to consume or assume three state variables. So, B being the carbon biomass of the cyanobacteria, Q being the cell quota. So, that's just the So that's just the internal nutrient content of the cells. And then P being the dissolved mineral phosphorus. So that's the phosphorus that's available for the cyanobacteria to actually uptake. And then so some biological restrictions on the cell quota. So of course there's a minimum and a maximum. The maximum is where they're just full. It's impossible for them to uptake more. And the minimum would just be when they are basically almost starved to death, but they're still existing. Still existing, right? So we assume now that cyanobacteria is going to depend on light and nutrient. So we'll put that into our model. And then we also assume this well-mixed assumption. And we only assume these dynamics are in the epilimnium. So this is the top layer of a lake that you can kind of see in this cartoon. So in the epilimnium, there's going to be some exchange from rivers, inputs, runoffs, and there's also going to be an exchange between the hypolimnium. Going to be an exchange between the hypolinium. And so, really, what I want to focus on is these inputs. So, a quick introduction of the model. So, for the cyanobacteria, we have some growth term, and that growth term is going to depend on the internal phosphorus via some droop term. And then the H function here is going to be how light is affecting the growth. And then we have some respiration. And then we have some respiration and mixing loss. And so this is how kind of equivalent to the death rate. Although we don't really assume they're dying, we just assume that they lose mass through respiration. And the loss is outside the epilumnium. And then we have some replenishment term. So this is for the internal phosphorus content. So there's going to be replenished at a certain rate. And then as it grows and uptakes carbon, we see it. Takes carbon, we see it is diluting that internal phosphorus content. And then in the p equation, we have some input and exchange, and that exchange, of course, is through the hypolymnium or the inflows and outflows. And then the P in is going to represent that pollution term. And then, of course, as the cyanobacteria are replenishing themselves, there is a consumption happening of the environmental phosphorus. Of the environmental phosphorus. Okay, so I just wanted to circle this guy to remind you I'm focusing mainly on this one because this term is going to kind of represent the eutrophication. Okay, so now a quick little picture of a sample dynamics. So there's four distinct phases. The first phase is this initial spike in the cell quota followed by a growth to some high value of the cyanobacteria. And I'd consider this like the bloom phase. So, this is some high sustained cyanobacteria density and cell quota, of course. And in the analysis, we've actually were able to show that this is the dynamics restricted to some slow sub-manifold. And then eventually, we bounce off that sub-manifold and go to another sub-manifold, which is three, which corresponds. Which is three, which corresponds to a crash in the bloom or the cyanobacteria density, and then phase four is just going to some equilibrium, some low-value, sustained equilibrium. And I should mention as well here, it's non-zero in the biomass. So it still stays positive. It's just some low, low value. And so it was nice to actually be able to connect these manifolds that I just kind of discussed to some ecological interpretation. And so if you'd like to see more about that, I suggest you take a look at my paper. Suggest you take a look at my paper that was just recently published in SIAM Applied Math. Okay, so now we have that ecological dynamic set aside and well understood, both the long-term and the short-term. Although I didn't really discuss long-term dynamics, I only discussed the transient, but we have a good idea of what's happening in both of those scales. So now I'm going to go ahead and introduce these human interaction. The human interaction and see if we can get a better picture of how a human influence and cyanobacteria are connected. So, actually, a lot of this work kind of builds off what Yoa Wasa has done in the past. So, I still have these two possible strategies. So, I call it Fancy C. That's the cooperator, denoting it this way. And so, the cooperator. It this way. And so the cooperators are going to pollute at lower rates than defectors. And I'm going to say that F, so I'm introducing another model parameter, F is going to be the frequency of cooperators at our given lake. So of course, defectors, they're going to face a lower base cost. You could think about this as like, how do they treat their sewage at the lake if you own a cottage? So a defector, they might just dump it into the lake, or a cooperator might invest. Where a cooperator might invest in some sort of sewage treatment or pay for a septic tank to be cleaned out or any types of those examples. But the defectors will pollute at a higher rate and they will face additional social pressures that are going to be based on the environmental concern. Okay, and then we also assume that there could be some additional external costs that are associated with some social norms. With some social norms. So, Mark uses this example sometimes where if you're interested in buying some sort of electric vehicle, but you live in Alberta, some people might say that you buying an electric vehicle means you do not support the oil and gas industry and you'll get your house egged or something like that. So, that would be an example of an external social norm cost. Even though you might think you're doing the right thing, you still might have some pressure to sway you away from that. Sway you away from that. Okay, so how that looks in the actual model is I can come up with these equations to say this is the cost to defect. So the first equation here is cost to defect. So that has that base cost. And then it has the social pressure that is based on the cyanobacteria density. So I have that B term right there. So if B goes to zero, then there is no social pressure cost. There is no environmental concern because there is no cyanobacteria. There's no cyanobacteria, where if that goes large, then there's going to be a concern, and that concern is also going to be dependent on the frequency of cooperators. And then there's just some other cost based on cyanobacteria. For example, this could be like a property value cost. So if you have lots of cyanobacteria, you know, your property value might decrease, or just the recreational value you get from that lake would also decrease. And then that delta D is your social norm cost if you are defecting. Norm cost if you are defecting. And then, as the cooperator, you have the same couple of terms. There's that base cost, which is going to be higher for the cooperator, the same cost based on recreation or property value, and then a similar social norm cost, but only in the social norm cost if you're going to cooperate. And then I won't spend too much time on this because actually it was fortunate that Yo talked about this. So, same type of dynamic here. I assume that these populations are going to make a decision. Are going to make a decision on which strategy to choose based on the difference in costs. So that would mean if beta goes to infinity here, then it's a fairly deterministic model. They just pick the cheaper one. If beta goes to zero, then it's just a random variable, like uniform random variable. And so for some intermediate value, which is more reasonable, there's some stochastic choice with a probability distribution. Okay, so time. Okay, so tying that all together, we get just the differential equation for the frequency of cooperators, so F, and that's just a rate as they switch to become a cooperator or leave to become a defector. And I'm coupling that to my cyanobacteria dynamics via this equation, and that's that P in term. Now it depends on F. And so, just to remind you where that actually fits into that equation, I'll just throw it up there for a second. Okay, so let's try to get into some of the dynamics here. So I'm just thinking about a single lake. I'm going to start with my non-dimensionalization, and when I do that, I can actually see there's a pretty easy separation of time scales. And so that would mean the cyanobacteria dynamics and the cell quota dynamics actually happen on a faster time scale. Actually, it happens on a faster time scale than the nutrient and the human dynamics. And that's kind of logical, I think, as well. But it's nice it shows up mathematically as well. And so also another fortunate aspect of this is that we can actually just study our system in a two-dimensional phase plane rather than a four-dimensional space. And I just wanted to highlight this eta parameter here is what's going to kind of represent the cost differences, the base cost differences, and the Differences, the base cost differences, and the external pressures, so that social norm pressure. So, I'm going to focus on eta as kind of being a bifurcation parameter, so to speak. Okay. So, in our phase plane, we have three, see, I see a question. Yeah, Fritzoff, definitely it will. And actually, in a second here, I'm gonna think about a network. Second, here, I'm going to think about a network and I'll actually address that question for you. Okay, so I'm in the phase plane now. Similar to what Stephen Carpenter had, we have this bi-stability type dynamic. So in the leftmost phase plane, we can see we have a bi-stability case. E1 is going to correspond to the low frequency of cooperators. Frequency of cooperators and a high phosphorus equilibrium point. E2 is going to be unstable, and then E3 is going to be our high frequency of cooperators, but a low phosphorus. So E3 in this case, I think, would be favorable in terms of environmental concern, at least. Okay, and so here's two other shots as we increase. As we increase the cost of cooperating or making the cost of defecting being cheaper, we'll lose our high equilibrium through some bifurcation and we'll be left with just E1. And again, it's stable. And then if we go the opposite way, so decreasing the cost of cooperation or increasing the cost of defecting, we'll be left with just E3, which is again stable. Okay. Right, so I have that bi stability system going on, and so now I want to expand into thinking about a network model. Okay, so I'm going to assume I have a network of n lakes, and they're connected only through social interactions. So the environmental connection, I just assume right now, the lakes are not connected by any rivers or any boater traffic or anything like that. They're very kind of distributed. Kind of disjoint lakes, except for there is some social interactions. Okay, and then I assume that you have five minutes. Yeah, thanks, Simon. So I assume that I have K lakes that start in the high cooperation regime. So that would be K lakes start in E3 or near E3. And then the rest of these lakes are going to start in the low cooperation regime, which is E1. So when I make this assumption, K over N is actually going to become a model parameter based. Based on that external pressure. And so then I already mentioned ecological parameters are going to be the same at each lake. So I'm assuming all the lakes are pretty much the same, but they're disconnected except through some social interaction. And we can actually simplify that type of assumption down to a system of just two equations. And so the cooperator dynamics. The cooperator dynamics are going to be pretty much the same. And they have this external pressure function now, this delta function, which is going to be a function of the cooperators, the average cooperators in the network. So the cost of defecting through social norm is going to be dependent on the frequency of cooperators, where the cost. Frequency of cooperators, where the cost of cooperating is going to be dependent on the frequency of defectors. And that's in this delta term. And then so F bar is now just the average of the proportion of cooperators in that system, in the network. And that's a bit ambiguous. I know it seems, it's not the actual number of, so if a lake was bigger than another one, that wouldn't be represented here. It's just the proportions that were the. Here. It's just the proportions that we're looking at the average here. And so then that function u star is going to be a function of f, and that u star is given by those cyanobacteria dynamics discussed in the first part. Okay, so now I'm looking at the phase plane again because we have these two-dimensional equations. And I'm just graying out the top triangle here. And so that comes from that assumption that I have a frequency of cooperators in a high regime and frequency in a low. High regime and frequency in a low regime. So if F L was greater than FH, that would actually go against my assumptions. Okay. And so again, I have a few stable states. So EM is this mixed state. So that's basically, I assumed I have K in the high and then N minus K in the low. So that's my EM, where there's a mixture of both. And then I want to look at how do I destabilize EM, so that middle ground equilibrium. Middle ground equilibrium. If I move some parameters around, will I have everybody jump to the low regime or will everybody jump to the high regime? And so I have these two plots to show what happens when we adjust certain model parameters that we can actually destabilize EM or have it disappear through a bifurcation. And then, in certain senses, we'll go to the higher low. So, in the bottom left, when EM disappears, EM disappears. So we were starting right around here. Now the phase plane is going to force the dynamics code to go to EH, which is the high frequency regime, which would be the favorable regime. But if we get rid of that middle steady state through a different bifurcation, we might actually go to a low cooperation regime. And so all that can kind of be summarized in a two-parameter bifurcation. Summarized in a two-parameter bifurcation plot. And I just pick these two parameters as an example. Although we can get this two-parameter bifurcation plot for any parameter that we would like, we actually can show that there's regimes or there's regions where the outcome is variable. So for example, if we start with a really low proportion of cooperating lakes, then it'll actually take. Then it'll actually take quite a bit of social norm cost. You have to increase the cost of defect quite a bit before you actually get into a high cooperation regime. Or on the counter, if you had a low cost of defecting, you would need to start with a lot of lakes cooperating in order to get a high cooperation regime in the long run. Okay. And so, yeah, this type of two-parameter bifurcation plot could give some good implications in terms of what parameters or what policies we should tweak in order to get to a favorable outcome. So just a quick summary and conclusion here. We've extended an ecological model and we've accounted for sociodynamics of stakeholders around that lake. And then we were able to actually extend this a little bit to think about. Extend this a little bit to think about a network of lakes and how that actually is going to depend on social norms as well. And so now we're able to kind of get a better picture of potential management perspectives, what levers you could pull to get a favorable regime shift or to get a less favorable regime shift. And these bifurcation points would give some meaningful insight to the efforts that actually be required. So which ones are feasible and which ones are. Be required. So, which ones are feasible and which ones would not be feasible? And so, some future work would involve giving loosening up the assumptions on this network, allow for lattice or weighted connections, for example. Consider some stochastic fluctuations in the cost parameters or some perturbations even. And then we'd like to apply this model to some real-life examples. So, I started off with the motivation of the Pigeon Lake case study. So, trying to attain some sort So, trying to obtain some sort of data from that and matching it to that system, I think would be quite powerful. And then, in my last five seconds, I'll just thank my advisors, Hao Wong and Mark Lewis, as well as the research groups and all the funding. So thank you. Thank you very much. Before we get into the questions, let me ask you one. Could you say again exactly how a cooperator is defined? Yeah, so that's a good question. So the cooperator was just a good question so the cooperator was just a was just the strategy that was polluting at a less rate but had a higher cost of um but how was the less rate defined was it a social optimum or is it it can't be arbitrary how did you decide what the level of of of the lesser rate uh yeah so i think i just put it in the model as like uh one function so i'll go back to here It basically comes from here. So I'm saying that there's two pollution rates: one where one is high and one where one is low. And so the cooperator is going to be taking that low pollution rate and the defector would have the high pollution rate. Yeah, I mean, one way to do that would be to find out what the social optimum is and have the cooperators operate at the social optimum strategy. One could ask, and Andrew Tillman's on here. Ask, and Andrew Tillman's on, he may have something to comment on this. Um, of whether there's a second best solution that would say we'll raise the level that we uh um that we operate at, but we uh that may allow us to achieve cooperation more easily. All right, okay, yeah, it's a good point. Thank you, Simon. Um, Friedoff, you had a question my question was already. My question was already answered during the talk. Oh, yeah, okay. That's right. Good. We have about two or three minutes for other questions. Is there anyone who would like to raise questions? I think it's okay just to speak up. I have one. This is Rebecca. Hi. Hi, Chris. I was just curious: are you working with the municipalities, and do you have any sense? Municipalities, and do you have any sense of how your results translate into policy? No. So, right now, like the Pigeon Lake one is pretty much set in. So, they don't really have like they have their five-year plan to commit to these policies to see if it makes a difference, basically. But there is like some data that comes from what they've done. And actually, a lot of it is like indigenous data as well. So, that'd be quite interesting to actually get hands on just based on how many people. Just based on how many people moved versus that's when the bloom started. And then, as well as anecdotal evidence, knowing that a lot of the time when these people moved in, they were actually just pumping sewage into the lake rather than treating it or getting it pumped out via septic system or something like that. So, yeah, right now that would be kind of what the data would look like. So, it would be hard to cache through like actually being quantitative data, but State of data, but yeah, that's what it's kind of looking like right now, at least. Thank you. We have time for perhaps one more question if anybody would like to chime in. Yeah, I had a question, Chris. Does your model assume that everyone knows who the cooperators and defectors are? Like, it could be that you're undertaking a behavior which other people don't know about, perhaps. Other people don't know about, perhaps. Like if you're not treating your sewage, for example. Yeah, right. So I guess it technically doesn't. So this isn't like it's not like the replicator dynamics or anything like that where you're actually interacting with people. It's just, I guess you'd be reading news articles or something and saying that, oh, this is what I'm doing is actually bad, rather than knowing the proportion, I suppose. So yeah, that's actually a good question. I haven't really thought about it. So I think. Good question, I haven't really thought about it. So, I think the answer would be no, they not actually are aware of who is actually cooperating or defecting, but rather just the overall pressure coming from cooperators or coming from defectors. Yeah, thank you. All right, so we are now into the break when we're supposed to take our picture. Into the break when we're supposed to take our pictures. Let me turn things over to you, Mark. I don't know if you want to say something about the Sokoko and about the picture we're going to take, but yeah, so yeah, so I guess.
