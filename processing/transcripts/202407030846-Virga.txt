And I'll make it clear what I mean by soft shells toward the end of my presentation. And I hope if I be good enough in timing myself, I hope to be able to show that this is a kind of circular shape, even if it doesn't look so. Doesn't look so at the beginning. So let us start. And the starting point is a paper, a paper that I enjoyed very much reading, reading the paper by Stuart Hantman, which was published well, almost 40 years ago. At the time, he was talking at two currents, and he wrote this very interesting paper, which I don't think has received that much attention. Have received as much attention that we deserve. But I'll tell you why. So, the problem he wanted to attack was the variational theory for playing up rods, but rods which were extensible. So, the idea was to go further and to expand and and and better Euler's theory for the elastic. Theory for the elastic by adding this extra degree of freedom, which is the extensive both everybody knows and is familiar with the classical theory by Euler, but Euler elastica is inextensive. So we'll see what are the delicate issues at the fundamental level that arise when you want to move this very, apparently very little step from inextensible elasticity. Inextensible enough to case to extensible ones. And this is what Antoine tried, and this is what is, of course, what he said is that you need measures of strains. You need to measure in this new setting what you mean by straining the ball. And this is his proposal. He proposed, well, this is a very simple choice, the extension data, which is, as you can see, is just the difference between. Is just the difference between the dilation. Little S is the arcaline is the presence contribution, big S is the archelineut is the resence continuation. And of course, were this DS over big DS bounded to be one, you would be, of course, in a case of the inextensible elastica. And of course, what you do, you simply measure the difference between this ratio and one. But this, of course, this is a pretty But this of course, this is a pretty pretty common, and the novelty doesn't lay there. But what is actually interesting is his suggestion for the bending measure, for the bending measure of frame. And he proposes one plus delta times little kappa. And little kappa is a present 20 degree. It's a curvature in the present 20 degrees. Big kappa is a curvature of the rod in the reference configuration. So the idea, this is a curve. So the idea, this is a curved rod in the reference manipulation. So the idea is that you start from something which is already curved in its natural state and you deform it a bit and you want to measure properly what the strains are in this case. And so, I will see in a moment, this is innovative. It is not completely, it is not at all traditional, it's rather innovative. And the Stuart was. Innovative and Stuart was aware of the novelty that he was trying to introduce and make people familiar with. And so he says, all right, I call this measure of bending, I call one plus delta, which would be just the longitudinal strain of the rod, times the curvature in the present configuration minus the reference curvature, the one in the reference configuration. Reference configuration. And this is what he does. And then he simply realizes that this novel measure of bending can be written as the S derivative, the B S derivative of the difference between the two inclination angles. This would be, little C would be the angle that the tangent to the curve makes in the pressure configuration with the given direction in the plane. In the plane. Big phi, there's the angle that the tangent to the corresponding point in interactions configuration might with the same reference direction. And so he realizes that there is a direct way of interpreting geometrically this measure of bending, and which is just by taking the big S derivative of this angle difference. So, this actually, what this difference does is to Difference does is to measure the deviation, the angular deviation between the two candidates and the two configurations. And he realized, actually, this might have been his original motivation to introduce such an unusual measure of ending. He realized that this was precisely the derivative of this disinclination angle relative to the arc length in the reference configuration. Reference configuration. So, of course, this is just a proposal, a way of describing how the material that composes this rod reacts to external actions. And of course, he says, what we need to do in order to posit a variational theory for such a model, what we need is just to come up with a good proposal for the three leading energy. The three leading energy W. The strain energy W would be a function of mu and delta. And of course, if I compute the derivatives with respect to the two strain measures, I get the moment, the bending moment, mem, and the normal force to the rod. And of course, here it goes. You just computed these quantities and possible, and you computable balance equations. You develop balance equations, you set up what is needed analytically to prove existence, stability of default configurations, whatever. Of course, he was a bit hesitant because he was aware that he was introducing something new. And of course, most people must have suggested to him that the only reasonable choice would have been to measure To measure the bending strain via the difference between the present curvature and the reference curvature. And of course, he tries to justify his choices. And alright, you have the quotes there. Essentially, what he says is: it isn't a reason, well, the main reason is elegance. I get a I get a better theory. My equations are much better. It must have proved, must have checked, that the other theory, the competitor, was less elegant. Well, elegance plays a role in mathematics. Simplicity, elegance. But there is another issue that he raised. And he says, well, suppose that I have a curved rod in the reference configuration. Suppose it is a circle, an arc of circle, and suppose that. Markov circle. And suppose that I subd it to a uniform dimension, what he calls a uniform extension. This, of course, would be transformed into another arch of circles of a different radius. And of course, the curvature would change. And if I had adopted the measure that everybody suggests me to adopt, I would have introduced a kind of bending strain. But when I But when I imagine that such a process takes place, all fibers get dilated, I cannot imagine any bending action on the fibers that compose the bacterium. So this is the reason. It is an invariance reason. So again, we come to mathematics. It is an invariance reason. We say essentially, well, between lines, between lines, we need to introduce a strain. Introduce a strain which is invariant under uniform dimension because I don't attach any mechanical meaning in terms of bending any to a uniform expansion. So this is what Antman did. And of course this issue was forgotten for almost fortunately and it has been recently revived, of course in connection with novel theories for shells. Novel theories for shells and particularly for soft shells and plates. And people have asked the question: what would be the analogue of a straining measure such as anti-in the context of surfaces? Of course, you might ask, well, I know precisely what a minimal requirement that I needed to impose, and the minimal requirement is again variance under Is again in balance under a uniform stretch. Is this enough? And of course, many proposals have been made to rescue what I call the pure measure of spending, as opposed to impure measures of spending. And there has been quite a debate. I'm just quoting just a few papers and which are with different proposals. There is anti-engineering and the engineering community, there is a bit of bitter debate just going on at this stage about what would be the most appropriate way of introducing measure of bending that would not be, that would be really describing the bending that takes place in surfaces. All right, but I will not enter this discussion. I don't want to debate at all today. And I want to find a mathematical way. I want to find a mathematical definition, which, of course, would incorporate as a special case a requirement that an antonym be introduced for a product. And what I will do? Of course, I try to introduce a general invariance requirement, and this is what I'm going to do. I need a notion of information. Of deformation, which I call a special class of deformation, that I call bending neutral deformation. And I'll try to explain in geometric terms and algebraic terms what it is actually now to. All right, reference configuration and continuum mechanics, what it is. And this would be the present configuration, and this would be another configuration of this surface. Of this surface. And there are two deformed configurations that, in a way, come together and they compete in a way. All right, I call this F the primary deformation and I call G the secondary deformation. And what is in between is the incremental deformation. All these deformations are finite. I don't really care about little things. Alright, I know what to do. I introduce the deformation gradient. I know this deformation, all these gradients, of course, are relative to the variable that runs in the reference configuration, that flat S surface. And, all right, I know that this is a general representation for my reposition gradient. These lambdas are the principal stretches, and these principal stretches. Stretches, and these basically stretches are simply the eigenvalues of the two Cauchy Green tensors, the right and the left, which are, of course, defined in terms of the gradient of F relative to the variable in, and this I think I stress this because these gradients that appear here are relative to the variable in the reference configuration. Other gradients, many other gradients, Other gradients, many other gradients are going to appear in a moment, so this is the reason why I am insisting on this, which appears to be at first glance as unnecessary. All right, polar decomposition, everybody knows about it, in computer mechanics. It means that the gradient of deformation can be uniquely decomposed, and the product of a rotational member of the SO3 group. Of the SO3 group, and one of these two principal symmetric tensors, U and V, which are simply the square roots of C and V, respectively. So these are essentially the in-plane stretching tenses that, of course, could be written in two different but equivalent ways. One on One on the reference cross plate, on the reference surface, and one on the default configuration. So these are two tensors that live, that are planar, actually they represent in-plane extension of the surface, and these are relative to different configurations. One is a stretching, say, in the Say in the X plane, and the other is a stretch in the tangent plane to the present current edge. Alright, and these are the stretching tensors, and this formula for the polar d contribution is actually due to Mannon Coin in 1986. And well, it is different from the one that, for example, other schools used, but this is something. But this is something that, again, would be the start of a debate. I don't want, as I said, I want to avoid debate too. And all right, the idea is that actually there is one way, only one way to decompose this rotation component in the polar decomposition into other rotations. Other proteins. One which has axis along the normal to the reference configuration, and another which has axis on the plane of the to the reference configuration. You see what I'm trying to do? I'm trying to, of course, decompose the rotation into two subsequent rotations, one about the normal and the other about any appropriate line on the plane of the rest. On the plane of the reference configuration. This, of course, it is clear what I'm trying to do. Of course, I will assign the meaning of bending only to the latter. And the first is something different. Because it would be something that ideally would twist the fibers, the other would bend them. And so this actually is something I would like to draw your attention to. But in the notation, which is But in the rotation, which is the intrinsic component of the depotion gradient, there are indeed two sources of different rotations that should be kept simple. Because we should imagine that the material, whatever it is, that composes the film or surface, has different capacities to respond to the two types of different film. So you should just imagine. Well, well, you should just imagine situations in which the response to bending is different from the response to the other type of rotation. This type of rotation actually is called driven and I found the first reference in a paper, in a numerical analysis paper actually, by Tom Hume and Franco Brett in 1989, where for the first time actually introduced and considered finite elements in which Finite elements in which this drilling degree of freedom was independent from the bending degree of freedom. So, this is these are very old ideas. I'm not inventing anything. I'm just taking the dust out of all these very old ideas. All right, there is another very old idea which I use, and this Rodriguez formula for the representation of SO3. Everybody, I think, is familiar with Euler's representation. representation. We represent essentially the SO3 group with a ball in R3 of radius pi. But there is another, I mean more useful for the purpose of my talk, another representation that actually maps SO3 into the host space. And this is sometimes called the vectorial representation and is given by Roderig. And this is given by Roderig, 1860. It is a new year's paper. And this is how it works. Essentially, A is a vector that represents the rotation. W is a skew symmetric tensor associated with A. So the skew symmetric tensor that has A as axial vector, and this little A is just the norm of A. So you can prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between membranes of astrophysic and S of E and vectors in the translation space are easy identity, of course. And these are the two ways to go back and forth. If you have the rotation, you construct the vector. If you have the vector, you construct the rotation. So there is a one-to-one correspondence. Very old stuff. But Rodriguez did more than that. And this is what I'm trying to take advantage of. He said, suppose this is known as This is known as the composition formula. Suppose I have two rotations, each described by two different vectors. How do I describe the rotation that comes by combining the two of them? Here is a formula. Of course, this is not symmetric, and the exchange of A2 and 1 cannot be, because the commutation rule does that. Mutation rule does not apply, so not always the two rotations could be used. And in fact, if you exchange the order of the vectors A in this formula, you get a different answer. And what is interesting is that this actually can be done in an unique fashion. Because this is precise as the lemm I need. Actually, I drew the lemm there. But do you get it? Actually, I proved the lemma, because you didn't care about it. But it's a very simple lemma. The lemma says, suppose I have a location and have a specific axis, which in my case is going to be the normal force of the surface, that is a unique way to decompose a given rotation into the product of two rotations. One with axes along the direction M chosen, which I like and love, and the other on a vector which is orthogonal to the, which is pretty. To that, which is precisely what I need. I have my rotation for the decomposition theorem, and I want to extract in a unique fashion, this is important, I want to extract in a unique fashion the drilling component of the bending component. All right, this can be done, and actually there is a nice variational characterization of the rotation about the preferred axis. This is actually the rotation in the subgroup. Rotation in the subgroup of all rotations about the dead axis, which is the closest in the Frobenius norm to the given rotation. So it is actually, it is a projection in Frobenius norm. What could it be? But anyway, all right. And here are the explicit representations. Well, these are a bit messy formula, but the idea is very simple. Now I have a mild decomposition theorem that says that. Theorem that says that my gradient of the information can be written as a rotation time stretching back tensor, and I take the rotation and decompose it to a really handy. Good. And what do I do with this? Well, I'm ready to introduce my definition of bending neutral deformation. What is a bending neutral deformation? Well, a bending neutral deformation is one that doesn't affect the bending component. The bending component, whatever it is. So a bending component is there. I started from my reference plate, I deformed it into a shell, S, and then I consider this additional deformation Y. And what I say is that this additional deformation Y that comes on top of X is bending neutral if it doesn't touch If it doesn't touch the bending component of the deformation, whatever it is, so it means that the rotation component of this additional deformation is only drilling. I can play whatever line with a drill. This makes sense. I mean, to me, it's a very simple deformation. And of course, now it is clear what I'm trying to do. If I'm able to characterize these deformations, then the pure measure of bending would be a measure of bending or measure of deformation, whatever. Bending or measure deformation, whatever it is, which is invariant and bending for information. Because if I do not alter the bending content, the measure should stay put and quiet. Good. All right, this is the idea, and this is a formal definition. My Ry, Ry is the rotation component of the deformation gradient of the incremental deformation, has to be a member of Be a member of SO. And SOM is a one-dimensional group of rotations about to the normal to the present configuration S. So the reference configuration is gone. Now I'm on the shell and what I'm doing is just to introduce the deformation which is bending neutral relative to the additional changes I do geometrically. Geometrically. All right, well, clearly I could always apply a change of observer, and this, of course, would make my rotation, to have a different axis. But this is, of course, is a kind of secondary remark because changing the server is not going to change. Is not going to change the definition of benefit in a moment. All right, of course, what is important to remark is that such an information, the way it has been constructed, is such that normals are sent into normals. So the gauss map is invariant under this class of information. All right. Alright, and then bending neutral deformation, as I said, is a deformation which doesn't alter the bending content. So it means that the two deformations F and G must have the same bending content, which is that vector that identifies the bending rotation. Alright, but this is my definition of pure measures of bending. A pure measure of bending is a measure or deformation of a measure Or deformation will major, either scalar or tensor, vector, whatever, the same direction. Is it important to do the intermediate information can just bending information from the beginning, from the reference state? Well, the reference state has no bending. It is not bend. So you need to introduce, you need to kick in some bending and then say, well, look, whatever it is, I need it very good. All right, examples. Well, if you take this tensor A, it is not immediately clear, but it is true. If you take this gradient of the normal transpose times the gradient of the normal, this is pure. But if you exchange the order, it's impure. All right, question is, do these deformations exist? Exist. It is nice to introduce something, but a mathematician would say, well, look, it's nice. But do they exist? Well, for the existence of these informations, you must actually obey two conditions. One is a geometric compatibility condition, and another condition that I'll discuss later on is analytic compatibility, integrability condition. Integrability condition, because at the end of the day, you should also always keep in mind that this is a gradient. So you cannot play with gradients as you wish. You need to be sure this stays a gradient. Alright, the first condition is very simple, actually, to state, but difficult to handle. Of course, once you have produced this deformation, you have produced another surface, the S star surface ion. Surface eye by talking about analytically. And of course, once the deformation is there, you can always immediately compute by the chain rule the curvature tensor of the new surface. It must be symmetric by New York and theorem. So this is a condition on the gradient of the normal, which is a curvature in the S configuration. S configuration and the present configuration, and which guarantees that the curvature in the default configuration is actually promoted. And of course, as you will see, and this is already an indication that you are on the right track, this condition is not a condition that only involves curvature, but it also involves stretching. The UY is simply the stretching tensor of the EY. The stretching tensor of the incremental difference. All right. Well, it takes a while, but at the end of the day, you boil down, this condition boils down to this scalar condition. Mu1 and mu2 are the principal values of the stretching tensor. So these are the principal stretches. Kappa one and kappa two are the principal curvatures of the surface S. Of the surface S. And this, and theta, is the angle that the principal axis of curvature make with the principal axis of stretching on the surface. So it is a complicated geometric condition. But you see how the first stop in our germane comes about. If kappa 1 plus kappa 2 is 0, this condition simplifies enormously. And when kappa 0 is 1, And when kappa 1 plus kappa 2 is 0, when you are in the presence of the minimal surface. So if the default, the primary default surface is a minimal surface, what you get? Well, you get a very simple representation for the neutral bending information. It is just mu times, because the ratio between mu2 and mu1 is 1, it is just mu times the projection. times the projection onto the plane tangent to the surface multiplied by the drilling in the picture. So essentially it means that you are stretching uniformly in the plane, so the stretch changes from place to place, but it is uniform at each point. It is the same in both directions at each point. And then there is this extra drill rotation that you superimpose to the uniform stretching. All right, but actually, you can do better. You can prove that if you start from an hyperbolic surface, so a surface such that kappa 1 times kappa 2 is always strictly negative. If there is a bending neutral deformation on a surface like this, it will produce an effect. So this is not true, but you can do it. But you can do it. So, this would be, in a way, a means to produce minimal surfaces starting from microbiotic ones. Of course, this lemma implies that if you start from a minimal surface, which is of course hyperbolic, you get another linear surface. So it means that these bendy neutron deformations, if they exist, are simply changing minus surfaces into linear surfaces. So, this is why minimal surfaces actually come about and how they are related to this invariance property. Good. All right, this is not enough. In order to guarantee the existence of very neutral information, I need to be sure that this is the gradient. So there is a necessarily sufficient condition for surface field, which can be written in this form. Which can be written in this form, actually, which says that, of course, this is a gradient, this is a second-order gradient. And the compatibility condition is a condition which involves a third-order tensor. Anyway, this is classical. It must be that the skew component, skew in the last two legs, the skew component of this. The skew component of this third-order tensor must be equal to this other third-order tensor part of this other third order tensor. Sorry, I don't know this notation. What's the skew mean? Skew means this is a third-order tensor, and we take the symmetric part relative to the last two layers. And you do the same for on both sides. If you have an equality, then you are guaranteed that the tensor field, big F. The tensor field big F is actually created, which is precisely what you need to do. All right, in our case, things are a little bit simpler, nothing mess, because after a big mess, this is quite a messy condition. Everything boils down to something very simple. And this condition is actually equivalent to say that the alpha angle, alpha is an emission angle of the delivery. So it is a surface field. Field, surface scalar field. This scalar field has to be such that each surface gradient can be written as mu, which is a normal to the surface, cross vector, the surface gradient of the log of mu. This is precisely what this condition boils down to again of a log day. But if you But if you it is much easier to see that this condition is in turn equivalent to a pair of the field equations, namely the surface Latin of phi and the surface Latin of alpha must be zero. So these must be surface harmonic functions. They must be uh solution of the Laplace-Bertrami equation. I need to quote Bertram-Bertrami because of my department. And uh, five minutes. Yeah, sorry, sorry then. All right, anyway, to make a long story short, we go to minimal surfaces now. And actually, you can parametrize a minimal surface by use of isothermal. Of isothermal parameters. And this is quite classical. And what we know now is that if phi is a surface harmonic function, it's also harmonic and the even valuable to the isothermal coordinates. But this is not the main point I want to make. The main point I want to make is that minimal surfaces can be represented by a Binance class formula in terms. For the intent of holomorphic functions. And actually, what comes out of this endeavor is a possibility of characterizing minimal surfaces in terms of surface of bending neutral deformation. So actually bending neutral deformation, due to that theorem, to that representation theorem, theorem are really abundant. Theorem are really abundant. There are infinitely many. And actually, what you can prove is that if you take a minimal surface and subject it to a bending intra-information, you get infinitely many other minimal surfaces, all with the same bending content, because they are all characterized by one and the same universal bending content. So the bottom Concept. So the bottom line is, and I come to, oh right, there is lots of math here. What you can actually do is to start from a minimal surface, produce in a rather practical way a bending neutral deformation, and induce another minimal surface. And this can be done by simply. And this can be done by simply multiplying Bayernstrass functions. It is explained here. You simply take a Bayern stress function, which represents the pristine surface, by this field, e to the phi i alpha, where phi is precisely the phi, which is the log of mu, and alpha is precisely the Gillian angle. Provided you have two functions, phi and alpha, which are And alpha, which are surface harmonic, you construct this allomorphic function e to the i alpha plus phi, multiply it by the holomorphic function that represents a minimal surface, and you get another holomorphic function that represents the minimal surface that has been obtained by applying the corresponding bending neutral. Bending neutral deformation to the given function, surface X. So at the end of the day, you might ask, well, why don't we compute the bending content of a minimal surface? Well, it should be the same, it should be universal, because we have divided all minimal surface into classes of surfaces which are obtained one from the other variable bending metal. That variable bending means of invert. Well, sure enough, if you compute the drilling content of a minimal surface, this depends, of course, on chi, and chi is a phase imbinance of function. So it depends on the particular surface you are considering. But if you compute the bending content, this is universal. It is just a field which is tangent to the Tangent to the circles, the family circles that are center in the origin, and whose models decay like one overall, which is a distance from C. All right, my journey stops here. If you want to continue, just ask other details in a separate meeting. But of course, this idea is now at put to the test Put it to the test of theory for shells, and how this is done is very simple. You have now identified your independent measures of heavy and genius. So you are ready to start a new theory, which, surprise, surprise, when it is applied to a surface which is cylindrical in shape, which is Which is generated by just drawing a curve parallel to itself, it reproduces Andman's energy. With this, there are very interesting features that I will not enter end, but this is the only picture I want to show, and this is. I want to show, and this is when you apply this theory, you get as energy precisely. The bending content is precisely antimony timid proposal, and of course there is no drilling because in the geometry of code, it's prohibited and drilled. Sorry, my journey was incomplete, so it is not simple, it was just the CD's single point that end in. Point that end means nothing. So this is one example. And well, thank you for your attention. Any questions? Very beautiful. I have a question. You had a movie, which you zoomed on. Thank you. Yeah, yeah. Thank God. Five minutes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Five decks. I want to see the question. I have a question about the movie. I come to. In order to appreciate the movie, sorry. That's great. We'll have to worry more stuff. In order to appreciate the movie, I need just a very short introduction. And it has to do with Boole's surfaces. All right. Goo introduced a class of surfaces in Surfaces in 18, I think, 64. And the family of Bohr's surfaces are defined in this way. So the Prian's class function, Bohr of course was aware of Priansklas' work goes back to 1824. So I mean, Bohr won actually a competition at the Académie des France in In 1867. So Boole's theory is phrased in terms of Weinenströp's wonderful work. And he says, all right, this is the class of function I want to consider. A constant C, which is a complex, times W. W is the complex number which has U and V as real and imaginary R. And if you play R and if you play with m in R you get the whole family of those surfaces. And for m equals 2, you get this spectacular surface, which is Enneper. Enneper is spectacular because nobody knows how he invented it, but when Anneper work comes before Weinenstrass, when Weinenstrass proved his theorem, it was clear that this some tessemate can The samites of the Kennedy first surface corresponded to the valence lap function f identity 1. So that was a miracle. So if you set m equal to 2, of course you get an curve. Alright, and now I say I have an curved surface, I have booze surface with m equals 3, two minimal surfaces. What I want to do, I want to go from m equals 2. from m equals two to m equals three my way with a bending neutral deformation. So there should be a family of bending neutral deformations that keep the normal unchanged and do the job. And this is a movement. You see? This is Elliper. And then you see it is a gliding movement. Movement. All normals go into normals. And this is boost. Actually, this is not completely, well, in this form is new. But there is another transformation like this, which is very well known. And it is a transformation that goes from catenoid to varicole. But that is a transformation. That is a transformation in which, which is a special case of this one, it is a special transformation in which, first of all, mu is one. So, because that is an isometric different region. These are not isometric. Bendy neutral differentiations are not isometric at all. And the second property of that classical transformation that goes under the name of Bonnet's transformation is that the angle of Information is that the angle alpha is constant. But you change the constant alpha from 0 to pi over 2 and you go from a catenoid to achieve. Well, what this theorem shows is that, well, that is a very special way to go from one linear surface to another. The most general way to go from one venomous surface to another is by penti-neutro information. So it was Anathema's way. So it was And my spray before. Sorry I. I didn't get to ask my question. So this set of surfaces intersect, they're self-intersecting, so they're not embedded. But the catenoid and the helicoid, at the two ends, they're not self-intersecting. When you do the transformation, they go through each other. And then there are these triply periodic minimal surfaces which do the same thing. Would you do the same thing? So I wonder if, like, what's that guy's name? Alan Schoen, right? He knew there was the P surface and the D surface, and there was the bottom transformation between them. And he somehow brilliantly figured out that there's another surface under the charlotte. So I'm wondering if you could find new embedded minimal surfaces easy to be. All right, so where the two ends are embedded, right? Because you can. It right because you can take you can provide stress temperature, you can find many examples, and then can you find transformations? Right, the bonnet transformation is just a simple angle. Here you have a whole family. This is very cool. It is a family which is parametrized a two-harmonic function, phi and alpha. And you go wherever, I mean, you go in many places. I don't know whether you can go wherever you want, but I well, the short answer to your question Short answer to your question is most ornaments, I don't know. Yes, a question I think is for ladies. Is there any sense of preserving self-intersections or lack thereof in these minimal services? Well, this is a delicate issue because we in this approach we don't care about self-interception. And of course, as a continuum mechanism, As a continuum mechanist, I am under a kind of penalty because I shouldn't allow mechanical surface to affect. Of course, these arguments are local. And in fact, the necessary and sufficient condition that I presented is a local condition. To make it local is asking what would be What would be the most general bending neutrality from which you does not produce something perfection against the mantle? But if you go back, you can show, show again, the Weierstratts Menopause representation. The point is, is that the I mean the interval formulas, yeah. Yeah. The point is, you have to make sure that when you do those intervals, whatever f is, you have to make sure that you get periods, right? That the functions give you nice periods so that when you come around, you get back to the same part of the service, but coming to a different place. So you have to make sure, so not all functions f will do that. Do that. That's part of the trick. There's an extra constraint on the f functions. And of course, by the way, the fact that normals are preserved is actually intrinsically built into Leibniz representation. Because Leibniz representation actually starts from the stereographic projection of the normal, of the gas map. So, which means that all which means that all surfaces which are represented within the same pair of isothermal coordinates must have the same image of the data. So they clearly, in retrospect of course I can say so, they clearly are eligible to be transformed one into the other by the bending neutral reforms. That isn't culture and the normal.
