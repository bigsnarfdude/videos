In fact, I worked in the department of engineering mechanics for many, many years. I stayed in this department for nearly 40 years. And my background is concrete, concrete mechanics. I do damage fragment mechanics and instability of solid materials. And some years ago, I moved to the field of bio. Move to the field of biomechanics. I would like to use some basic methods of solid mechanics in the cells tissues. And in recent years, we have been studying the morphology mechanics of TCU from the cells and the tissue scales, which including the healthy development of embryo, brain. Of embryo, brain, and other tissues and organs, and also the development of some diseases, for example, tumor. And today I want to talk about something instability. As you know, instability is a fundamental issue in engineer mechanics, not only in solid mechanics, gluon mechanics, and also dynamics. Dynamics. I don't want to use this theory in Bell. And in the classical solar mechanics, the stability of structures, for example, a bar, shells, occurs, when the load applied to a material structures, reaches the critical condition, the ola buckling occurs. So, one originally equivalent different Originally, equilibrium deformation mode will be transformed to another mode with lower free energy due to some inefficient perturbations. And as the micro scales of materials, for example, the materials can be softened, can come unstable due to microstructure evolution. For example, the cracking, the wall. For example, the cracking, the volume changes, and so on. On the other hand, in the field of dynamics, such dynamic structures can become unstable. It transforms from one original stable dynamic mode for some such rotators to another dynamic state. This also occurs in bio. And so, And so, in the recent years, we have been studying the instability phenomena occurred in many biological processes from the molecular subcellular and to the organs and system scales. These phenomena usually involve complicated mechanical, biological, and chemical mechanisms. mechanisms. And for example, if you put a cell on a substrate and certain conditions, the alteration occurs in these cells. It can rotate or alterate in different manners and different conditions. And in addition, for such a cell, you can observe dynamic waves propositions in the cells. And also in the scales of the tissues, it's when also observed. The tissue sheets will also observe some formed rankles and other bifurcation modes. And we want to start these things. And some years ago, we wrote a book on the surface rankling of soft materials. This book usually discusses OLA buckling, which is dedicated by mechanical energies. For example, the rankles on our skins. on our skins. And this is a ramcose on the skins. You use a pen, push on the skin, and then rotate it. Then such a run code occurs under certain conditions. And also on the surface of tumors, we can also complicate patentes. And these things are discussed in this book. But today I want to discuss some phenomena. Some instability phenomena which involve complicated coupling between mechanical, biological, and chemical mechanics. And the disability phenomena in our bodies can be classified into three main three key modes. This is the OLA buckling, and second one is tuning buckling, and third one is the bell chemomechanical coupled instability. These things cannot. instabilities. These things cannot be explained by the traditional series of instabilities, for example, OLA series or Turing series. And if you want to understand some dynamic interpretations in the tissues, cells, and other things, we can consider the different features of these things from the following four aspects. The first one four aspects. The first one is energy, which is dictated by the mechanical energy, chemical energy, entropy, and their transformations. This dictates the type of instability. The second one is the mathematics properties of the governing equations. For example, the Ula Buckling is dictated by the electrical partial differential equations, but in the case some chemical Some chemical mechanisms are involved. Then the things and the features of the equations will be changed. You have to resolve them. They have different verification properties. The third one is the temporal fatalities. Because the elastic waves, chemical waves, and other waves have greater different speed of propaganda and other things. The last one is the special feature. The last one is the special features. You can consider the pattern of tissues or cells from the periodicity, symmetry, polarities, charities, and the temporal and special evolutions in the TCOC, and also the correlations between local and global patentes. For example, check and show this one here for this one. Here, for these patterns, if you have some perturbation on the pattern, then the total global patterns can be changed. But in this case, this is the tuning disabilities. If you have perturbations on this local pattern, it involved on the locally, this local properties. Okay, in the past years, we have studies the we have studied the integrities from the molecular scales and the cell scales and the collective cells and other things. I will give a few examples in the following slides. Another example of our study is the immune systems. I will give examples of the leaf nodes. The node has very complicated compartresses. During its flammation, the volume of the mission the volume of the node can be expanded for example 10 times 20 times or even more and during this processes the many many of the cells immune or cells can enter and get out from the the node these are different node different cells from t cells b cells tend to cells and so on they have greatly different three-dimensional Three-dimensional evolutions in the things, which is very complicated. And for example, if the information occurs in such a node, a lymph node, then the cells can enter into the node from the lymphophytic vessels, it's into same things. And the cells, some cells are moving along the three-dimensional network. They have followed greatly complicated patterns in the three-dimensional network. So, the flux, hot flux, migrations, propulsions, and also the momological reactions is self-organizations and remodeling of different types of cells occurs in such a things. We made a theoretical multi-scale model to simulate these things in recent years. And for example, in a three-dimensional network, in the leaf node, the network can deform very largely. And the networks, the fibers can expand and also relatively sliding, and even the bricks. And after the inflammation processes, it can repair. And the cells, these cells, And the cells, these cells move along 3D veneral network and very complicated pattern, very interesting. And they interact with other immunological cells, T cells, B cells, and then get in reaction. And then the cells will get out to the body to make repair or body. And this is only some curves of the results. And this is an example of my theory. Of my theory, and the inflammation can be divided into four stages. This status is the beginning of the inflammation, and then it reaches a relatively stable state, and then it will be repaired. And finally, it takes two months, even three months to return to the static state. And during the formation, the stresses, the stresses have two peaks: this is first peak. peaks. This first peak and then is stable and then finally to a second peak and then repaired to a theory. And also the buckling things, the basis also have important applications in the clinical things. For example, this is cooperated with a hospital in Shanghai and the picture was given by a doctor. And even the doctors cannot distinguish whether the shift of the blood vessels is caused by the tumors, by cancers, or other inflammation things. And another important diseases is this one, veracuths. The blood vessels involved into very complicated three-dimensional charity patencies. And also, this thing also happens in three-dimensional... Also, it happens in three-dimensional bioprinting technologies and also organs on tips. Because you want to make organs by two or three types of cells, and then you imagine that we want to get such a tumor, such a tuple shapes or other shapes, but in fact, those cells are active, they can move, they can become unstable into such a complicated pattern. And so, let's discuss discuss the instability which involves mechanical, chemical, and biological mechanisms. The first example is the olive buckling of actin filament in cell. This is important mechanism for the cancer metastasis. Okay, this as we know that metastasis is very important mechanism for the cancer that causes the greater number of that causes the greater number of the diseases of patients, which involve very complex mechanisms. These are two pictures of the metastasis from collective cells to the liver. And this is another example. And as you know that the cancer cells are very soft, but it can't pass through a large number of different types of obstacles. of obstacles from the, for example, blood vessels into the blood and then move to another organis to get a new tumor. And a can cells can pass through a very narrow spacing from here to here. And in the three-dimensional environment, you can find that this is a tumor, it's a cancer cell, it can move in such a very complex. Move in such a very complicated pattern. We want to add these things. We make a model, make a simulation. Okay, this week, the cell is very complicated shape. For example, you have standard branches, and the branches want to move forward and to pass through from three-dimensional environment. And in oscillation, your model, multi-scale model, we put two obstacles. This is obstacle, this is another obstacle. Obstacle, this is another obstacle, and then we have a narrow spacing, we call it a door, and we observe how such a cell passes through from the narrow spacing, and how can the things happen. And this is a real model, a real three-dimensional large-scale simulation model. And first, the cell move forward. They have to sense the mechanics. How to sense the mechanical forces and make a mechanical transduction into the cell and get the skeleton feedback and have a biochemical feedback to the forces to change the structures of the skeleton. And then it will activate the cell to move forward. And it has two obstacles. This stiff region, another stiff region, the only half here. The only hair here, and how can be as sensitive to the forces here and here, and differences, and then how it can pass through from the narrow spacing and detour the hard obstacles. We want to answer these things. Okay, we made large-scale cost-grant MD simulations. This is the action filament. The action filament is as RR. When the forces When the forces is applied to the arm is very large, then our arm will bend it, rebended. Then the will open, will open. So here, something will, molecular changes. This three ARP complex will compare it here to make a new arm. We use two arms, these are new arms of branches here to improve the To improve the forces to push the forward of the cell. So here, this vector filament is buckled, this OLA buckling, and then a certain set position will be opened. Then the cell can move forward. But, for example, if we want to get move, get alt from the get move get out from the room and we we we don't have airs we just use our arms to push forward and when if you push it on the door on the doors you can get some forces and we get it so we use two two arms to push it increase the number of of action filament but if we all arms are pushed on the concrete wall even you increase the 100 of action filament you cannot pull partial you cannot pull part from rock here and then the things will be buckled collapsed then totally will totally collapsed the molecule will disassembled disassembled and then the all the exit filament were used to push the door to open to pass through from the narrow spacing this is the mechanism the the the first stage is the positive feedback the next stage is the negative feedback and this is similar Feedback. And this is a simulation. And we have two obstacles. Okay, these two obstacles meet the obstacle, and then the action filament will be decreased. And the structure will be collapsed. And then the door will be opened here. This is the RP, complex number of RP. And this is the comparison between the theoretical result and the compression. For details, you can refer to this PNS. To this PNS article. So, in the work, we found a new mechanism of how a kind of cells pass through from narrow spacing, and this has a positive and negative feedback to adapt the driving forces and the morphology of the cells, and the pass-through from narrow spacing. This is the first example. The second example is the chemomechanical waves in cells. You have found that. You have found that on the side, we have very complicated, so complicated patterns, these dynamic behaviors. And you can call this as a clock, or clock. The clock is more important because the waves is slow, relatively slow. This means that it's not elastic wave, it's a chemical wave, but it's not a part of chemical diffusion. Diffusion is not in this pattern. The geometric. This pattern, the geometrically is different. So we want to understand these things. So the biomechanical mechanisms can be written in this form. And this cell membrane. And it has a cortex layer. When a force is applied to the cell or the perturbation, then it will activate the following. Activate the following pathways. It can increase, it can cause action positions, action sublations, and myosin activities. And all these things are coupled together with the forces. And we give mathematical equations for these things. And then, this is the mechanical and the chemical coupling mechanisms. We use a We use equations to formulate these things. And then we introduce this coupling into the classical active shell theory, the shell theories in solid mechanics. And then we analyze what happened. In this sense, the cell can evolve into different shapes. This example, this is exosymmetric deformations and third conditions. And this is And this can be observed in starfish oocyte and different conditions. And in this case, the cell can become unstable and you have different verification mode. The first one is the hopefully verification. Hopefully verification is a subcritical verification in mathematics equations. And another one is the pitchfork verifications. And different conditions, they can involve different patterns. They can involve different patterns. And also, the classical tuning patterns can be observed in these regencies. And also, the cell oscillations can be observed in these regencies. And in this here, the cell will be stable. Okay. And also these things come that observe the rotation of the cells, the special patterns observed in the experiment. In the experiments. And also, you can observe that in these ranges, the cell is stable, have a spherical shape. In these ranges, the cell can oscillate, shrink, expand, and repeatedly. And here we have can observe traveling wave width and standing waves. And then in these things, we can observe that. And third condition is. site and third condition is we can simulate the patients occurred in these things it have a good agreement with observations this can be found in this pina's paper and this is second examples occurred in the molecular scales first exam subcellular second single cellular the next one is the collective cell oscillation the And you can find that on the TCUses of drosophilia dorsal closure, we can confirm such waves in the TCOCs. This is a collective cell oscillation, which plays a similar role in the embryogenesis. It can make the the development healthy into a smooth shapes. Uh, smooth shapes, and we simulate these things is that the development of the tissues into these ranges, and finally, it can be closed. And we understand this in a very simple manner. This is the mechanical activation, mechanical cell stretch and the chemical reaction, their feedback. And for example, this is the tissue, a single layer of cells, and it has many, many perturbations. Many perturbations is this cell can be divided into two, and this one has some deformation, and this cell can move. They have different types of perturbation, but finally, they can evolve into a regular oscillation. Why such things happen? When these cells have perturbed, it can activate the filament evolution, and then it can get some. It can get some forces in the cells. And these forces will transform into the neighbors. The neighbors can transfer others. And also, these perturbations also transform in the sinks. Each cell has the perturbations, and finally will become colonials. And this is the hopeful verification in the dynamic theory. Theory and it's a sub-cladical verification. And normally, in this case, it's stable. This stable state, we call it chemo-mechanical state. If some perturbations happen in the things, and the perturbation will disappear in the things and become stable with time. And in this case, the alteration workers have such a limit circle with A limited circle with time and third conditions, the things can become collapsed. So, this is our simulation results. It has a good agreement with what we have observed in the movie. And this is a third example of instability. This is the verification of mathematics. Oh, I'm in time. Okay. Okay. So the last part is the collective selves in the things. And in our labs, we made some theoretical and experimental results to observe dynamic behaviors. Okay, this is through the movie. And this is the two type of cells. This is the two types of cells. We have a more wall between them. And at the beginning, we remove the walls, and then the two types of cells can interact with each other. This is the left part of the cells. This is the cell skeleton, and this is the right. and this is the the red part the red part we can recall them and then we calculate the velocity the shape and the energy the stresses and the strategy of each cell with a long time for example two days three three days or even longer and this is the interface of the two types of cells involved with type Types of cells involves with time. It takes a long time. And this is the stress distribution in the tissue. This is a high concentration of shear stresses we calculated from the cell shapes. And this is the strategies of some representative cells in this time is removed from here to here. Here to here, and we record all of the cell rules. Okay, and then we made some simulations of the things. And this theory, I don't give the details of the equations, I just give some results. And in the results, we simulate. In the results, we simulate the dynamic behaviors of a large number of cells, for example, 1,000 cells or even 10,000 cells. And in some cases, the cells can bloom like bloom dynamic behaviors. We defined a cellular Leynes numbers using these equations, and we can calculate the critical conditions for different. uh conditions for different for the occurrence of different patterns for example if we have 15 cells 50 cells limited in such a circular shapes the cells can rotate together together the velocities is linear from the center to the outer surfaces but with increase of the number of cells The number of cells and the little odds should increase the speed to have a uniform rotation. But in this case, the outlays cannot run so fast. So the shear stresses occurred in these circles. And with a further increased number of cells, then the things will happen. The inner layer can... The inner layer can rotate together and the outer layer rotate in another speed. And finally, it can evolve such a complicated pattern like turbulence in fluid mechanics. And so we have such a phase diagram. This is in the short, in the small regions, it behaves like a solid, but in the large scales, it can behave like a... Behave like a fluid. And there are some other different patterns into the narrow layers or different patterns. Okay, these three-dimensional simulations is on on on a spherical shape, sphere shape, or even on such large scale simulations on a three-dimensional cases. Three-dimensional cases. This example has several thousands of cells. They have different, greatly different dynamic behaviors on the different regencies. And finally, we discuss another basic issue. That is the static laws of collective cells. Because these cells contact each other and become Each other and behaves in active ways, and what is the basic fundamental statistic laws and the entropy and the asterisks, the entropy of cells. And we, in fact, we compare various type, different types of cells. They have different mechanical shapes, different dynamic behaviors, and different mechanical properties. And can we find some universal law? Find some universal laws for their motion. And how can we calculate the entropy of collective cells? These are basic issues we are very interested in. And we compared these different types of cells, MDCK and so on. And we found some universal static laws for the velocities, energies, and other things. And we also use some theory to interpret the results. And for example, we compare the two types of cells. They have different speed and they have different shapes, they have different velocities. And we calculate their probability density functions of the speed. And they have some greatly different patterns. And we calculate their probability distribution functions of these things. Functions of these things. And these summary sources, different times, the three hours, six hours, nine hours, and so on, they put together. But according to the classical theories of entropy, we can find some basic distribution functions. For example, the Gaussian distribution is to have such a form. Another one is the K. Another one is the K-gamma distribution. This has this form. And this was derived from the traditional theory of entropy or statistical laws. But in fact, if we put the two curves with our results, they cannot fit. The first one, the Gaussian distribution, is how it's greatly different between all Great difference between theory of experiment results in the high ranges of velocities. But K-Gam distribution does not work in this region. They are good different. Why? Something happened. And we spent a lot of time to find the reason. And finally, we found that, we conclude that the classical Berlin-Gibbs entropy does not work. This entropy does not work for the active cells, for the active molecules. If we want to entropy, what we want to explain these things is we should use the higher order theory of entropy. We use the theory of status entropy. The studies, Professor R. Status, is a famous Brazilian physics. It developed It developed such a theory in 1988, but it does not find a good example to use for this theory. And he found that all results have a very good agreement with his theory, such as the theory of entropy. So he's very happy. And according to the SARS entropy series, we can derive a new. Series, we can derive a new distribution. This is Kaussian distribution. It has a such form. This is directly derived from such theory. K is defined as a search index. This can correspond to different types. So you can find that this theory can have a very good agreement with all types of cells, all types of cells. and and the entropy of the index however it nearly a constant with time and one on different type of the soft or hard stiffs and this this different type of cells they all have a good agreement with the theory so this is very important for us to explain some dynamic behaviors of collective cells in maybe in your In maybe in your instruments. Okay, this way we compare these things. We can get some a large number of the relations. We can find the universal stick laws. We have the different types of cells, different times, and so on. They have a good agreement. Maybe this theory can be used in all your work. Okay, this is a Okay, this is my conclusion and we made some dynamic series for explaining some dynamic behavior of cells and tissues at different scales. So finally, I would like to thank the support from the National National Science Foundations and my colleagues and my students. Okay, thank you very much for your attention.
