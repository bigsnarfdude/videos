And uh from uh fightagon and uh uh the fight on this talk is the interplay of two more ecotels, TEG, OLINO, HBN and LIDACOR. Thank you, thank you Arik for the introduction and thanks for to the organizer for inviting me to this wonderful workshop. So my talk will be let's say slightly different from the previous one of this session. From the previous one of this session, we will be a little bit more physically motivated, and all the talk will be about interesting effects that can emerge when you have the interplay of two Moripathens. And I will essentially quickly talk about in these 20 minutes about TBGRN on HPN and Heritage Layer Graphene. So let me start with this Heritage Layer Graphene. Graphene. This is essentially a system that acquired recently large attention since it has been also shown to be possible to realize. And in our original work, essentially, we were interested in understanding the properties of this system that will show some interesting topological structure. Now, okay, what I'm talking about, Ellie Calcrade, this is a configuration where I do a Is a configuration where I apply a consecutive twist to the three layers. And we will see that the nearby layer develop a More pattern, the two More patterns are not commensurate. But however, we will also see that there is a hierarchy of landscape, at least a small twist angle. So there will be a landscape much longer than a short mode. Now, so Now, so let's say what we pointed out originally was that if we look at the real space structure on the Moreof-More Lactis, you actually find out that there are valleys churn regions where essentially there are isolated lenses with total share number and domain goal lines where essentially topological transition takes place in the map. Okay, so why there is Okay. So why there is hierarchy of landscape? There are two modulations that connect the on at the first chapter, two modulations that connect the Dirac ones. So these two modulations are essentially not collinear. You can define, if you want, average modulation and a slight deviation. And the slight deviation scale is parametric. The slight deviation scale is parametrically smaller in theta. So, therefore, it's a little bit like you have a bidding pattern. So, you have an envelope long periodicity and a short one, but it's your model. So, if you do plaque numbers at 1.5 twist, you get almost to order of magnitude separation. Okay, so our physical intuition was the following: why don't we develop a Develop a method that treats adiabatically the slow periodicity. This idea is actually not new in the past. There was work by Latin Gerkohn, also Bastard, solving problems of electrons in a perturbed periodicity. And the method is essentially to introduce a local American that depends parametrically on a slow variable that is a relative shift between the two more repactants. Shift between the two mode patterns. And Hamiltonian is here, essentially, is a canonical continuum model with three dirac cones, tunneling. The tunneling now takes into account only for share, and the phase essentially is this relative shift between the two models. Now this if you want, you can take it as adiabatic parameter that can code the dependency on the relative stacking, okay? Relative stackings. Now, so let me just explore the phase space of the model. I can do it, and there will be on the model more scale isometry stackings. Now, the first one that is actually the most interesting one, because it's also a germonic development relaxation, I'm going to mention about that later, is this ABA. Anyway, ABA, but the funny thing is that this tack can locally break CTC. And we'll see that. And we'll see that essentially, we'll discuss only this one because the other VAB stacking, you can get it just applying a simed that is locally broken. Now, the model is this one. You can think of it like you stack the three-layer ABA and you twist around this atomic registry, as already Miguido mentioned on Tuesday. And well, the spectrum we find is two isolated bands, the gap is pretty. Two isolated bands, the gap is pretty large. This is 1.79, then an atomic corrugation realistic value. Now, what you realize is that essentially, if you take the two bands and you compute Wilson loop at the center of mass finds, total shaped number equal one, the bands have three dirac points, one at gamma, k prime k, and these three giraffes are protected by the residual symmetries of the ball. Now, then okay, you can move uh parametrically here, you you get fully connected spectrum. You get fully connected spectrum. This point restores even z, and without number of diracons, you get fully connected spectrum. And this was also discussed in other works. Now, then, okay, you can move away. There are domain bore lines for a different region, for a different region, so you can prove that the spectrum is again fully connected. And as soon as you move away from this isymetary region, so you split these two bands. Okay, they are separated and unstable. Separated and unstable. And these two bands still have topological characters as long as you preserve this gap. So, therefore, what we show is that there is a robust, let's say, sort of Windows long-lens scale, a robust topological bands. These are separated by 70 milli volt. Even if you deform the structure, you need to overcome this energy gap in order to change check number. Change that share number. And this is okay, you can think of it like a bad anonymous or shared mosaic in the art space. Now, there are actually parallel works by other groups, among them the one by Nikito, the one by MIT that involves also Patrick, another one by Flarco Guinea, and all of them they were essentially observing that: okay, if you include lattice relaxation in this model. If you include lattice relaxation in this mosaic, this region with the interesting topological character expands, so becomes somehow hegemonic. It tends to shrink as much as possible the other stacking configurations along domain walls. And so, therefore, okay, this just if I even further, let us look at what's the origin of the topological bands. So, we can do that. So we can do that in a simple limit, is this chiral limit. And so let us focus on this region. And so, well, if you focus on that region, you realize that at the magic angle that it's okay, pretty large, let's say, compared to other twisted systems. You find that twofold the flat band, so two bands, let's say extensive degeneracy, so all of them are zero energy volts. So all of them are zero energy modes. And the two of them you can split them. One is sublattis polarized A, the other one is B, and one share number two, the other share number minus one. And actually, when the flatband takes place, the trace condition is met. The tris condition we heard about it by Patriarch is a very nice condition because it allows you to build correlated states that resemble pretty much quantum all states. Quantum on a whole state. Now, what's interesting here is that you form also this share-to-band. Okay, and so our contribution was also to figure out to solve the zero-mode equation for the share-to-band. Now, to connect also with the mathematicians, this is a problem that is similar to the one also discussed by Simon. And so, you have like a current form. These essentially species. Essentially, two spin or belong to the two sub-lattices. Each one is three-dimensional in the three layers. You have three layers. Now, you need to solve these equations with some boundary condition, the relicity. And then essentially, you know that there are always three protected zero modes by some symmetry. Okay, so this essentially is the problem. The differential operator is, okay, in this case, Is in this case holomorphic derivative complex notation. And then you have a U3 non-abider and HP. Now, so this is detailed in our works, but it's possible to figure out what is the solution. The wave function is actually in this form. Now, what you have is that the two-dimensional degenerate manifold can be decomposed in two bands. A plat is polarized. One is a rank two band, another one rank one band. I'm going to tell you. Another one, rank one then. I'm going to tell you. So, rank means in order to span the A sub lattice polarization subspace, you need at least two spinners in the layer space that are linearly independent. So, the space, three-dimensional, breaks down in a two-dimensional subspace, in a one-dimensional subspace. The two, okay, I cannot show you, but the two subspaces are october, and but in one, they can. But in one decades sector, so you need at least two of them, and these are the lowest van Dau level wave functions. These coefficients are expressing in terms of Jacopi theta functions. And the total shared number of this band is shared number two, as I was anticipating before. The other one has shared number minus one, and this very much resembles to the is analogous to the uh uh um expression obtaining twisted binary graphing, for instance. Twisted bidiog graphing, for instance. The only thing that changes is the spinoff structure that will have three components, some specific possibilities of this model. But what we realized is, okay, the rank of the flatband is equal to the total shared number, so number of independent vectors that span the subspace. Now, let me just leave since we were particularly interested in the properties of this wave function, I will tell you a little bit more. I mean, there are some, let's say, interesting properties. Now, the the Interesting properties. Now, the magic angle condition is related to the vanishing of the velocity of the Dirac currents. Typically, in TPG, this vanishing of the velocity of the Dirac current is tied to the vanishing of the spinner at an isymetry point. Now, the magic angle condition instead is a condition about in this wave function, there are no zeros if you take the all-absolute value. The probability distribution is pretty. Is pretty homogeneous, and the magical condition is just an equality between the function of k and k1, the two Dirac nodes. And then, okay, if you look, if you break this into pieces, you look each component, each component is periodic, a share number two, but the point is that each component is singular, because the lowest random level here has a singularity one over z. You take the linear combination to satisfy, to remove the singularity, such that there is. to remove the singularity such that the residue uh is zero. Then uh the the other thing is that if you do uh uh k uh case base uh boundary condition you you realize that this is essentially colour and tangle band that actually was classified, this plus of wave functions being classified by Patrick in a nice work. And the total share number of this band is two. This is essentially you can directly read out by looking at how the wave function advanced by a rigid shift in This is a sort of ring function around the dots. Now, okay, this is related to what I was saying. Okay, rank two. So if I look at the layer projected component of the wave function, I always have two nodes. This is a fixed position as a function of k. So this is the Brillen zone. Now if I sum over all of them, these are since the two spin or are linearly independent, run two. Independent, run two. These two zeros essentially are located in different positions such that the total density does not show any z. So this is the conclusion of the first part of the talk. Second part of the talk is about TB German and NGB, and there will be another more interference pattern. And this work is really joint work with an effort by Evan Rey Group at Ragher University. Okay, so the main point of this is essentially that there is a Is essentially that there is a very interesting state that feeling true in twisted ballet graph in this quantum anomaly resolved state. And this state requires two conditions in order to be analysed, let's say. Okay, you still need to be at magic angle such that interaction effects are dominant, but you also need aligned HBM. You need a line HBM split the two bands in the two suppliers or shared sectors. Now, okay, you Sectors. Now, okay, you have eight bands being degenerate. Now you reduce the feeding. By interaction effect, you want to have a churn thermometer. This state is a churn insulated or driven by interaction. Very much similar to integer quantum state. And now the total Chern number is one, essentially spin polarized, valibolarized. So if you want this spin and orbital ferromagnet, and there was this very nice work. And there was this very nice work, experimental work by Andre Jang, that shows perfectly one ties anomalous or the conductance signature of this integer quantum state. But the point is that this state was this phase was reported only by another experimental group, by David Darbert Borton, and it seems extremely difficult to realize and to observe in twisted milaria graphene. And the one motivation for this, Motivation for this was actually pointed out by Jalan in this work, where he was saying, Look, HBN induces a more repotential. Graphene and HBN, there is a lattice mismatch. This gives you a quasi-periodic structure. And the periodicity is recovered only at these bright spots, like okay, the discrete set of angles. If you are a random magic angle, you just have now, okay, commensuration. Now, okay, commensuration in the moire sense, so is I forgot about atomic scale. And so now, okay, so therefore, what's going on here is like that you have specially varying regions of differential number, and this is also pointed out by other authors. And essentially, what you realize this actual intuition is also confirmed. This actual intuition is also confirmed by experiments, this by Eli Zerdo, where you actually see at feeding one regions domains of differential polarization that were able to be observed by SWID measurements. And so therefore, due to this importance and relevance of the effect of aligned HPN, so Iba was really interested in understanding what's going on. So what's the effect really of which plan? So therefore, we start looking at that, or specifically, they start looking at that and they see, okay, well, you see two more patterns when HPN is aligned. One is a triangular pattern by TPG. So bright spots are energetically unfavorable. In STM, those black spots are energetically favorable. So APA, PA are energetically favorable, and you format Jangora. While in Grafenbar on HBM, On HBN, give you a non-equal lapis, where the stable configuration is when essentially nitrogen is at the center of the hexagon. And basically, the self-alignment process is such that PBG wants to really align to this black spot, such that it's this minimum energy configuration. But this is not always the case. There are cases where essentially you form a perfectly aligned lattice when you control the tweet twist and is when you control the two-dimension standard and this is pretty remarkable is 1.10.55 that is the configuration essentially where everything perfectly aligns and the quality of the grids that you see from the fact that you have first shell of bright peaks also signature of second shell of bright peaks well you both you change the this tangible and here you see you have multiple bright peaks you don't have any more structures Structure, it seems that there are multiple periodicities. So, therefore, by tuning, you can essentially modify the DPG lattice, the angular lattice, by the interference of the room. Now, let's say, okay, what we do, I mean, our contribution is taken up with a simple model to study relaxation, and this is really a phenomenological model. So, don't be angry, it could be a little bit too much for you, but A little bit too much for you, but okay, it's just the simplest model that you can that you can do is essentially you take, you know, TBG is a stable structure. If you make small deviation, you will have an elastic term with dynamical matrix that is positive semi-definite, and it wants to restore the T V G. And HPN is just a non-common. Non-commensurate potential that they form the lattice. And these class of models are known as two-dimensional Franker-Kuntorova model and were studied for studying relaxation in commensurate systems. And so we will see that as long as this length scale is different, the system, so graphene wants to self-align to boron nitrogen, well if the two are really off, you lose a pregnancy. Are really off, you lose a pregnancy, essentially. It is more or less a physical mechanism. So, when you run large-scale simulation, each one is a more unit cell. What you have is that as long as, so we twist, so we set the twist to magic angle, and as long as you have a separation of length scale, let's say you form domains where you restore Moiri commensuration, at the edge you accumulate strain. Strain. And then, okay, you you there is a perfect here is a perfectly match, is this spot? And as long as you have this structure, you get brag peaks that are spreaded out because essentially you have a finite size system. But when you go away, really, when you tune away, and actually we were able also to see shear and okay, here you cannot see much, but at the edge of this domain you can see also potentially than shear deformations. Shear deformations that essentially accumulated at the edge. When you tune really away, you basically lose any periodicity and you have multiple brackets in your structure factor for the lattice. Now, this essential Frenkel-Controva model was also nice to understand that there actually, if you plot the two-length scale, graphene graphene and graphene BN, there are commensurate lines where you Lines where you essentially, if you are on them, you tend to restore the periodicity by self-aligning and accommodating strain. But there are also regions, and for instance, this sample is a perfectly match periodicity, but there are also regions that are really away, like this sample, where essentially you have multiple periodicity. So it might and therefore you get an interest completely different. Completely different real-space structure. So, with that, I would like to just thank my collaborators. First part is a collaboration with Christophe Moran and Michel Mau. The second one is a work with Evan Ray, Shingwan Rai, that was an experimentalist doing all of these sample measurements with STM measurements, Jet Pixley and Justin Wilson. So with that, let me go to the conclusion. So in the first part, I discuss serical twisted tralayer graphene. Serical twisted trial graphene is show shared mosaic region with the band of total shared number and a triangular quark of domain volts on Moriov Morris key. Now low energy bands are characterized by superposition share two band minus one band and in the current limit we found actually the expression of the share two band that is a non-trivial superposition of two random levels with intriguing properties. So it goes beyond if you want the random level and a Beyond, if you want the random level analogy, and then actually, band topology and value domains are actually confirmed. A very interesting recent experiment that came out just last week. So, it's not really crazy. Actually, it can be realized. And then, the second part was about commensuring-commensurate transition of TBG and HPN. We were interested in understanding the relaxation stability of this germ insulating state at filling three. General insulating state at filling three, and somehow we see that in certain regions you restore insulation. And we also claim that this can be a platform to realize more equal distance when you dis due to the interference of HBN and PBG. And with that, okay, thank you for the attention.
