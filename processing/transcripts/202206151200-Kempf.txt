For the kind invitation. So, I'm going to talk about information theory versus quantum gravity. I think there are at least two attitudes that one could take towards that question. And the two attitudes are these. The first one is that we think about information as being naturally very versatile. That's because That's because information theory doesn't really care about what the subject matter is of the information that it studies. So information theory is naturally very versatile, and therefore it's no wonder that it has applications from engineering to physics, and therefore no wonder that information theory also has applications to quantum gravity and black hole physics. In this attitude is In this attitude is the attitude of expecting that information theory will provide at most tools to quantum gravity. But then there's a second possible attitude, and that is that information theory is not merely versatile and therefore useful, but that it is actually universal. Given that information theory doesn't really care what the subject matter is of what it studies, what the information context is. What is the information content? Well, maybe it is truly universal and can describe literally everything. In this case, even quantum gravity would be emergent from a deeper information theory, a theory that's purely about information. So the question is, is information theory just versatile or is it universal? So in this presentation, I would like to give an example of both. Of both, of both attitudes and see where it takes us. So I start with an example of information theory being useful, showing that it is versatile and providing tools. Here is a tool that we can take from information theory that maybe is not as much known as other tools. And that tool that I'd like to talk about is That I'd like to talk about is Shannon sampling theory. Shannon sampling theory is central in information theory. Why? Well, it is because Shannon theory establishes the equivalence of discrete and continuous representations of information. For example, music recording on your PC is purely digital, purely discrete, but the music that But the music that is played, that you hear, is a continuous signal. And it turns out that Shannon sampling theory can explain how the two can be exactly equivalent without approximations. How could Shannon theory be a new tool in physics? Well, Shannon sampling theory has been generalized to curved spaces and curved space-times. And as a consequence, we can describe space-time as being similar. As being simultaneously continuous and discrete, in the same way, in the same mathematical way that information can be described as simultaneously discrete and continuous, the way that engineers, communication engineers have been doing for half a century. I mean, I'm not saying that space-time is necessarily of that kind, but we have models in which it is. So, how does this work? Work. Here's the basic Shannon sampling theorem. The Shannon sampling theorem concerns functions that have a finite bandwidth. In physics, that would be functions, that would be fields with an ultraviolet cutoff. So in the simplest case of Shannon sampling, we assume that we are dealing with functions f that have a finite bandwidth, which means technically that our function f of x is the Fourier transform of some function f tilde. form of some function f tilde with finite support. So it's a Fourier transform all right, but we only have frequencies from minus b to b that's what it means that it's band limited. The band limit is b. The Shannon sampling theorem shows that if we know the samples of a band limited function at discrete points, then we can reconstruct what the function is. We can reconstruct what the function is at every point using this reconstruction formula. These discrete points have to be taken, though, these discrete samples have to be taken though at a grid whose spacing is pi over b or smaller spacing, but it can't be a larger spacing than that. And what's important here is that this is an equality sign. We get the function not approximately, but exactly. But exactly for all x, out of knowledge of only what the function does at these discrete points. Also, what's important here is that it doesn't matter exactly which grid you're sampling from. Any lattice of this spacing or shorter, smaller spacing is good, is a valid lattice from which to sample the function and from which we can then exactly reconstruct the function. Can then exactly reconstruct the function. This shows that the discrete representation of a signal, such as a band-limited piece of music, is entirely equivalent to its continuous representation. You can sample on one grid and then reconstruct it continuously, from which you can sample on another grid and so on. For example, if you have a music recording and you listen to it, the continuous version that you listen to does not remember on which grid. Does not remember on which grid it was sampled and the sample values were then stored on the computer. So there's a complete democracy between all those sampled grids. And this also means that a sampling theory does not break translation invariance. You have lattice representations, but a whole family of them that are democratic. And overall, we are not breaking translation invariance. That's nice because it means that also for space-time, we can have lattice representations without. Have lattice representations without breaking, for example, symmetries that are due to killing vector fields. So I said, these things, this tool of Schein and sampling has been generalized for curved spaces and curved space-times as implemented in quantum field theory. And for example, we published work on what that would mean in inflationary cosmology. So we implement a covariant ultraviolet cutoff in inflationary cosmology, and then we obtain that there is a signature. Obtain that there is a signature of this cutoff to be expected in the cosmic microwave background. It's a very small signature, it's about 10 to the minus five of the fluctuations that are regularly predicted, which might be too small to be measurable, but who knows what experimentalists come up with in the future. So this is an example of information theory trying to be useful. But let's now explore. But let's now explore the other attitude. Maybe information theory is not just versatile, maybe it is universal. So could information theory be truly fundamental? Well, why would we expect that information theory could play such an important role? Well, the one reason that one could put forward is that information theory works even in the most counterintuitive regimes. Counterintuitive regimes, even if we do not know how to measure distances or time distances or masses, because the scales that we are considering are so extreme that things are quantum fluctuation and quantum fluctuating in wild ways that make our usual concepts of what we measure untenable. Even then, we can always ask, well, how much information goes into it? Ask well, how much information goes into it? How much information comes out of it? And it appears, therefore, that the language of information theory is more robust than any other language that we have so far come up with. So it might just be that information is the basic currency of physical degrees of freedom. Or is it? Well, let's just, for the heck of it, explore where this. Explore where this sort of attitude might take us. So, in this case, if information theory was truly universal, well, then quantum gravity would be emergent from it. Quantum gravity would be emerging from information theory. Now, let's see how that could work. What are the building blocks of information theory? Well, the building blocks, it could be argued, are the endpoint correlators. endpoint correlators, endpoint correlation functions. If n is equal to one, well then these correlators are just probability distributions, right? So n equal one correlators are just probability distributions. And what we get is the entropies, for Neumann entropy, Shannon entropy, Renier entropies, and so on. For n equal two, we get correlators, two-point functions, something like propagators. But in any case, for n equal two, Case for n equal to the natural concepts are mutual information, coherent information, and from those we can calculate classical channel capacities and quantum channel capacities. For n equals three and four, things become much more complicated. There is work on this, but it's really very difficult. What we obtain for n equals three, four, and higher is a web of informational relationships generalizing the notion of Generalizing the notion of kernel capacities, classical and quantum. So let's explore the possibility that fundamentally nature might be describable by a collection of abstract endpoint correlators, just because these are the basic building blocks of information. So let's explore the possibility that the basic quantities are endpoint correlators, abstract endpoint correlators, and I Endpoint correlators, and I want to stress the word abstract here because let's not try to refer already to a space-time or matter. No, just abstract correlators, not assuming even the existence of matter or space-time. Then, in some low energy regime, of course, we haven't defined at this point what energy means, but let's just say in some regime, this set of abstract correlates. This set of abstract correlators may be approximately mathematically representable as quantum field theoretical correlators on the spacetime manifold, in which case, you know, quantum field theory on curved space-time emerges. So let me now stress that again. So the idea is that we have abstract endpoint correlators that do not describe anything in particular. Anything in particular that have nothing to do a priori with matter, with fields, with space-time or manifolds, have nothing to do with this. They're just abstract correlators of correlating whatever. But their mathematical structure may be such that in certain regimes or in a certain regime, this structure of endpoint correlators might be mathematically representable as quantum field theoretical correlators on a curved space-time. Curved space-time. So, in this sense, then quantum field theory in a curved space-time could emerge from what might be called a web of informational structure. One might even call it a worldwide web, right? From a web of informational structure. Let's see if that could possibly work. Let's start with matter and then consider space-time and so on. Could matter actually be describable through correlators? Well, that's actually easy, right? The answer is yes, of course. In quantum field theory, we know that we describe matter with nothing else but endpoint correlators. Quantum field theory uses endpoint correlation functions to describe what matter does. So yes, the behavior of matter can definitely be described in terms of correlators. And what have we gained? What have we gained? Well, from this perspective, we can just add some information theoretic perspective to it. For example, we can view these correlators as constituting quantum channels and generalized quantum channels. You see, if we have just two points, then it's a quantum channel. If we have multiple, then it's an informational web. And I mean that in a very And I mean that in a very concrete way that we are dealing with quantum channels here. What I have in mind is that when two particles scatter of each other, well, then each particle learns about the other. They exchange classical information and they exchange quantum information. For example, if two particles A and B scatter off each other, and let's assume that A was previously entangled with some ancillary A tilde, and B was previously entangled with some ancilla A tilde. And B was previously entangled with some ancillary B tilde. Then, after the collision, A might be partially or even wholly entangled with B tilde, and B might have acquired some entanglement with A tilde. And that's, of course, what quantum channel capacity is about. So what we can do is we can now try to review what a particle interaction actually is. Is it fundamentally Is it fundamentally, as we have always thought, all about exchange of mass and momentum and energy and angles and so on? Or alternatively, we can presumably describe the same processes information theoretically. And we can just say, oh, okay, we have an interaction. In other words, we have that temporarily a quantum channel was established. And we can describe what the classical channel capacity was and what the quantum channel capacity was. The quantum channel capacity was. And I would like to just make a remark here. It's not part of the main thrust of the argument, but as a remark, I wonder whether it is possible to reformulate the interactions of the standard model, the interaction Hamiltonians, in terms of their information-carrying abilities. So instead of describing vertices, describing interaction Hamiltonians in terms of Describing interaction Hamiltonians in terms of momenta and quantum numbers that might be exchanged, maybe we can even completely describe these interactions in terms of their quantum and classical channel capacities. I think it would be just cool to be able to reformulate the standard model as a web of quantum channels. I mean, we know that one way is clear. I mean, we know that one way is clear, right? If we started with a traditional description of vertices, we can definitely check what, as a consequence, the classical and quantum channel capacities are. But maybe we can also do it the other way around. Maybe from just knowing what the classical and quantum channel capacities are, we can work backwards and find out what the traditional representation in terms of vertices is. Okay, so. Okay, so the answer to the question of this slide: is matter describable through correlators? Is well, duh, yes. We've been describing matter through correlators for half a century now. Now, is also space-time describable through correlators, though? Well, it turns out that space-time is also describable through correlators. Namely, in particular, the metric tensor is expressible through metric tensor is expressible through the two-point correlate. Andrew talked about this yesterday as well. Yes, so this formula was derived by two students of mine and myself, starting with the following intuition. The propagators are divergent on the light cone, which means that if you know the propagator, then you know the light. If you know the propagator, then you know where the light cones are everywhere on the manifold. But we know from a theorem of Hawking and Ellis that if you know everywhere on a space-time manifold where the light cones are, then you can reconstruct what the metric is up to conformal factor. So it was clear that knowledge of the propagator, let's say of a scalar field, to keep things simple, gives us the metric up to a conformal. Up to a conformal factor. And we thought, well, maybe it gives us the metric including the conformal factor. And it does. And here's the formula: you take the two-point function, take it to a certain power, capital D is the space-time dimension. And then you differentiate it with respect to both of its arguments, take the coincidence limit, multiply with some normalizing pre-factor, and you get the metric. This means that space-time. That space-time is expressible in the traditional way as a differentiable manifold and a metric, or also as a differentiable manifold and an affine connection, if you like, and so on. But we can also describe space-time as a differentiable manifold with a propagator on it. Let's say the scalar propagator. Other propagators work too, but it also works already with the scalar one. One so both matter and space-time are encoded in the correlation functions, in the correlators of quantum field theory. So here's the summary so far. Matter and space-time are expressible through quantum field theoretical endpoint functions, that is to say, through correlators. And these correlators, as we discussed at the beginning, can be described information theoretically. Can be described information theoretically, right? One-point correlators are probability distributions, two-point correlators give you traditional classical and quantum channel capacities because they give you mutual information and coherent information, and then you can extramize over them, and that gives you the classical and quantum channel capacities. And then the higher point functions give you an informational web of correlations. Okay, so then you might say, well, this is all good and fine, but it's just a mere review. Fine, but it's just a mere reformulation. We haven't really done anything yet, right? It's just a reformulation and another perspective of things, looking at it from an information theoretic point of view. And another criticism you can levy is that these endpoint correlators are still space-time correlators. They are correlators, correlation functions in space-time, which means. Space-time, which means we are assuming that there is a space-time manifold to start with. We are at least assuming here a differentiable manifold structure. But that's not what we set out to do. We were wondering whether information theory could be truly fundamental and space-time and matter would just be emergent from it in some special regime. But here we seem to be assuming that there is already a differentiable manifold to start with. Ferentiable manifold to start with. Let's see if we can go beyond that. So, to this end, we generalize now to basis-independent sets of correlators. So, let us consider again our endpoint correlators. And now, without the arguments, let us consider them as abstract operators. Take, for example, the two-point function. What's a two-point function? It's really an integral kernel. You use a two-point function to map fields. To map fields of the kind that we sum over in the path integral, to map fields into fields. So you take your final propagator, for example, you multiply it onto a field and you integrate over the argument, and then you get another field out of it. That's what a two-point curator does. Now, you can do that in the position representation, in momentum representation, in any representation, and you can also view it as just a linear map acting on a Hilbert space. So you have an Hilbert space. So you have an operator, the Feynman propagator, as an operator acting on a Hilbert space of fields and mapping field into field. If you have a three-point function, you can view it again as an operator, but now of a new kind, because it's an operator that maps multiple fields into a field. Like a three-point function can be viewed as an operator that maps two fields into one field, or three fields into a number. Into a number. So, what we have is these operators, abstract operators. Let's view our endpoint correlators as abstract operators from vectors in a Hilbert space into vectors in a Hilbert space. In the case of quantum field theory, we can certainly do this. And concrete bases would be positional bases, coordinate systems, but also momentum space and many other representations. But we don't want to have to assume. We don't want to have to assume that there is a space-time. So let's just assume that our correlators are acting as operators on a Hilbert space of fields, such as the fields that we might be summing over in the path in the code. But let's just consider this abstractly. So let's consider the possibility that the fundamental theory is the theory of correlators, which are given as operators on On a Hilbert space of fields. Now, these correlators can always be interpreted as some sort of web of informational structure, right? One-point correlators would give us probability distributions over that space of fields. Two-point correlators would give us classical and channel capacities over that space of fields. Not really space of fields, just vectors of. Space of fields, just vectors of the Hilbert space. And then the endpoint correlators that map multiple vectors of the Hilbert space into themselves describe in some sort of web of informational structure, generalizing the notion of classical and quantum channel capacity to multiple senders, multiple receivers. Just like in a scattering process, you have multiple particles in, multiple particles out. So if we So, if we consider the possibility that there is a fundamental information theory that is all about abstract correlators without reference to matter, without reference to fields, without reference to space-times, just correlators that act on some Hilbert space. Then we can ask, well, can this bunch of correlators, of abstract correlators, can it always be represented as n? Always be represented as endpoint correlators of a local quantum field theory on a curved space-time? No, of course not, right? If you just write down some abstract wild correlators as operators on some Hilbert space, there is no reason that they should have a mathematical representation as endpoint correlators of quantum field theories on space-times. In general, they don't. They don't. But when can they be represented as quantum field theoretical correlators on a space-time? And therefore, the question is, when would therefore a space-time and fields living on the space-time emerge? Under which circumstances could they emerge from such an abstract structure? And here's how it could emerge. So if we Emerge. So if we start with a theory of just abstract correlators, Gn and if at least in some regime for n larger 2 these correlators are diagonalizable, then we have a representation in the form of quantum fields on a curved space-time. And here's how that works. See, if these high See, if these higher endpoint correlators are diagonalizable, then let's call such a diagonalizing basis a coordinate basis. Why call it coordinate basis? Well, consider quantum field theory as we know it on a curved space-time. And let's consider a three-vertex or a four-vertex. We can write it down in momentum space, we can write it down in position space. Here we want to write it down. Space. Here we want to write it down abstractly. But in any case, for a quantum field theory as we know it, we have locality. All our quantum field theories obey microcausality, therefore strict locality, which translates into the mathematical statement that these operators, these correlators, like this three-point correlator, four-point correlator, must be diagonalizable. Because that's what it means. Because that's what it means that we have locality of the interaction. It means that the endpoint correlator can be written in a suitable basis, namely a coordinate system, in a positional basis. It can be written as a product of zero deltas, which force particles to interact at the exact same point to implement macrocausality. And you see, that is non-trivial. We know. Trivial, we know from two-point correlators that they may or may not be diagonalizable. And similarly, three-point correlators, four-point correlators may or may not be diagonalizable. Mathematics doesn't guarantee that they are diagonalizable. There is not necessarily a basis in our Hilbert space such that this abstract correlator takes a diagonal form. But if it does have a basis, if Have a basis. If these higher point correlators, abstract correlators, do have a basis, an eigenbasis, so to speak, remember that these are not just operators that map one vector into one vector, they can map multiple vectors into one vectors. If they are diagonalizable, then let's call such a diagonalizing basis a coordinate system, a coordinate basis. And in such a basis, we then have that these endpoint correlators are diagonal. Correlators are diagonal, just like a local quantum field theory's Feynman rule for a vertex. And the point here is that once we have identified such a positional basis, we can then write down the two-point correlator in that positional basis. But you see, in the positional basis, if we have the two-point correlator in a positional basis, then we can use that older formula here. Can use that older formula here and calculate the metric from the two-point correlate. So, what that means is that if the abstract higher-point correlators happen to be diagonalizable, and mathematics is not forcing that, it's the physics that generally forces this because it requires strict locality and microcausality if they are diagonalizable. Diagonalizable. Then we get positional basis. And in the positional basis, once we write down the two-point correlator in the positional basis, we can then calculate what the metric is that corresponds to that, which means that if the higher-point correlators can have a diagonalizing basis, then the higher point correlators and the two-point correlators can be represented as local quantum field theoretical propagators and correlators on a curved. On a curved space-time, and the metric can be calculated. In general, though, in general, though, we have to admit that this is not necessarily the case. It's not necessarily the case that the higher point correlators are diagonalizable. There might be a regime in which they are. There might be a regime, therefore, where they can be represented as quantum field theoretical propagators on a curved space-time. But in general, we cannot expect this. The math is not. Cannot expect this. The math is not forcing it. And what would that mean? That would mean we don't really have a clean positional representation. We don't really have clean locality. We have a fuzziness of the space-time structure. At best, we get an approximation to this formula here. At best, we get some approximate description of a metric. But really, we have to say, no, it's not really the higher vertices are not really diagonalizable. So, therefore, that formula is not really. Therefore, that formula is not really accurately applicable, which means that generically, we cannot represent the informational structure of these higher point abstract correlators as a quantum field theory on a curved space-time, but in a special regime, it might be possible. So, in this sense, then space-time and matter could be emergent from an understanding. From an underlying informational theory. So, fundamentally, we may have a web of informational structure, abstract endpoint correlators that are just abstract operators that map one or multiple fields into a field. They are operators on a Hilbert space. The existence of a space-time or matter is not assumed nor is it guaranteed if we start with such an abstract information theory. Abstract information theory. Only in some regime that we may call low energy regime, these higher point correlators may be approximately diagonalizable. But that means that we can then also write the two point correlator in this diagonalizing basis. And then from that, we can calculate a metric. And in this case, we have approximate representability of our abstract correlated. Our abstract correlators in terms of quantum field theoretical correlators on a curved space-time manifold. What I find cool about this is that all we start with is the assumption that we have a theory of correlations, of abstract correlations, and nothing else. We are not assuming quantum field theory, we are not assuming the existence of The existence of a space-time or matter of a particular kind. And yet, we are naturally guided towards the possibility that, you know, if these guys are diagonalizable for n larger two, then this whole structure is representable as a quantum field theory on curved space-time. Of course, there are tons of loose ends. What about the dimension? What about the signature? What about probability amplitudes versus probabilities? Amplitudes versus probabilities. Yeah, I don't want to overstate the case here. I'm just saying it nicely fits. So, in this way, quantum field theory in the space-time could emerge from a web of informational structure in a low energy regime, whereas in the generic case, high energy regime, we would still be able to describe everything in terms of these abstract correlators. It's just that they would. It's just that they would no longer be representable as correlators on a curved space-time. So we would have a description of what's going on beyond the Planck scale, but it would not be a space-time and matter description. It would be just correlated. So coming back to the initial questions here, I asked at the beginning: is information theory just versatile and therefore? And therefore, useful, or is it also universal and, in fact, underlying quantum gravity and the emergence of space-time and matter? In fact, we can even push it further and say, as a follow-up question, if information theory is truly universal and underlies even quantum gravity, then is it even still information theory? Can we really think of it as information in the sense of the quantum mechanics? Think of it as information in the sense of, oh, I didn't know it, and now I know it. You see, not that sense of information. Um, because these abstract correlators would be correlating what? There would be correlators, but not clear what they correlate. It wouldn't really be events, because before we have a notion of space-time, we cannot have a notion of event either. So, maybe what we would have is that the underlying information theoretic structure. Information theoretic structure GN should rather be considered to be just a structure, just an abstract structure. And the label that it is an information theoretical structure may only be justified in that low energy regime where we can talk of events and their actual correlation. But before that, maybe it's just structure and information theory, being as versatile as it is, is just a natural language. It is, it's just a natural language to describe structure. Okay, so I think I have five minutes left. I'm happy to spend that time on discussion, but I could also show you the beginning of actual calculations that one can do in that framework. Maybe I could ask the chair: should I show a few more slides or go into discussion right away? We have 10 minutes after. I mean we have 10 minutes after your five minutes for discussion so so I guess you can take a few of them and show in some calculations all right okay good so let's see what could possibly determine the abstract correlators what what could be the theory behind the abstract correlating now here's the thing if we want the g n to be correlators then i mean remember we are not assuming space-time here we're not assuming fields or matter Here, we're not assuming fields or matter or any of that. We are just assuming, well, there ought to be correlators because information theory is built out of them. So, then what? Well, the correlators, being correlators, by the nature of being correlators, they have to have this form. They have to be the product of random variables times some weight function, which gives us probabilities or probability amplitudes. And then here's the integration metric. Every correlator is of that form, right? Data is of that form, right? And we don't know from abstract considerations only what the w of phi, this weight function of probabilities, might be. But we know that this is of the form of a path integral, right? Because path integrals are the prototype of correlators. If you want to write down a correlator, you write down a path integral. It's in one-to-one correspondence. And we do know, at least in what might be called the... At least in what might be called the low energy regime, what the w is. It's e to the power i action of phi, right? Where this is the standard model action and with gravity added if you want to. So in the low energy regime, we can write the action in this way. For example, for a scalar massless Pangoden theory, this would be the action here. But remember, we want to free ourselves from the shackles of having to... From the shackles of having to use a space-time. So instead, we write it in this way. This is the space-time description of it. We could also write the action in momentum space, but we can also write it basis independently. Here we have field, field, and operator. So field, field, and operator. And then the integral is the trace, right? If you insert a resolution of the identity in here, in the positional representation, and you just get back that. But for our purposes, it's important to... But for our purposes, it's important to write things in this way because it's basis independent. We do not assume, we don't want to assume that there exists such a thing as a positional representation to start with. So hence the basis independent description of an action, like in this case, the simplest action. Well, and then that's the Klein-Gordon action. Let's assume we want to add gravity in the action as well. Well, there is a way. Assume, for example, that there is a sharp ultraviolet cutoff. Let's call it Lamp. Ultraviolet cutoff, let's call it lambda just for simplicity. Then, with Gilke and Hawking, we know that we can write the following action, namely the integral over a cosmological constant, which of course is way too big, but can't be helped, plus the Ricci scalar plus higher order terms. So basically the beginning of the Einstein action. I mean, it's just the Einstein action with a cosmological constant and highly suppressed higher order. Cosmology constant and highly suppressed high-order curvature terms, according to Gilkin-Hawking, can be written as the trace of the identity. Because, as they showed, the number of eigenvalues below the cutoff is given by an expansion like this. But the number of eigenvalues is the trace of the identity. And what that means is that we can augment our Klein-Gordon action in the basis-independent way by Independent way by this whole thing, this shebang here with the cosmology constant and then higher order curvature terms, highly suppressed. But essentially, this is the star, the Einstein action. We can write all of this just as the identity here with the suitable pre-factor mu such that this times that times mu is exactly the Einstein action. So the gravity action can actually be viewed in a basis independently. Viewed in a basis-independent way simply as a leading constant term in an expansion of the action. And this is the parameter that you have to choose such that the pre-factor of the Einstein action is just right. So then we can calculate things. We can integrate over all fields phi abstractly in the Hilbert space, and we can integrate over all possible spectra. Remember that the spectrum would be in correspondence. The spectrum would be in correspondence to the shape of the manifold. And so, and this is all very simple because we're not even assuming any interactions for the Klein-Gordon field except through gravity. And then we sum over the number of dimensions of the Hilbert space. So we sum over the number of dimensions of the Hilbert space. We sum over all spectra. So we sum over all possible values of the eigenvalues. And we sum over all the field by choosing a basis. We just choose the eigenvalue. Basis, we just choose the eigenbasis of the Danenversion because remember, we are not assuming that there is a positional basis or momentum basis. And then this partition function can actually be calculated. It's this one. Now, in work with my collaborators, Barbara Schroeder and Marcus Reitz, we built on that. We extended this model and calculated expectation values of the dimension of the manifold and Manifold and the volume of the manifold, and so on. And that paper is coming out soon. So this is the last slide, just to summarize. What would be the case if information were universal, if it were underlying everything, including quantum gravity? Well, at low energies, the notions of rods and clocks would be replaced by something information theoretic, namely the correlation strength. Namely, the correlation strength, the two-point correlator. Remember that the two-point correlator determines what the metric is. So we can forget about rods and clocks and the metric and instead just work with the two-point function. The more correlated two space-time regions, quantum fluctuations are, the closer they must be in the sense of space-time distance, not spatial distance. It's a covariant. After all, this is a covariant expression, right? And then the metric can be replaced by, as I just said, the correlator. As I just said, the correlator, and the metric can also be replaced by the abstract two-point correlator, along with abstract higher-point correlator, whose diagonalizing bases then provide us with the positional bases for the propagator, which then gives us, which is this, which gives us the metric. So that would just be the low energy regime. But we would then also be, under this assumption that this all makes sense, that nature does this. That nature does this, we would then also be able to describe what is beyond the Planckscape, beyond the space-time is a stage and matter is actor's picture. Namely, what we would find is that abstract correlators are still well defined. They're just operators acting on a Hilbert space. But beyond the Planck scale, these higher point abstract correlators may no longer be diagonalizable. And therefore, the set of correlators may no longer be. The set of correlators may no longer be representable as field correlators, quantum field theory correlators on a manifold. So we could still do the math, we could still do the information theory. It's just that the notions of space, time, and matter slip between our fingers in this case. And then at the end, I discussed that the abstract endpoint correlators are automatically arising from path integrals. Just by virtue of being correlators, they have to be in this form. The W. From the W, I don't know where it would come from. I cannot tell you, I don't even have any idea of how to derive the standard model action. But this is what would go in there, of course, in the low energy regime. If you wonder what happened to diffeomorphism invariance, well, it was replaced by basis independence here. Basis independence is much more general than diffeomorphism independence. Diffeomorphisms are just mapping coordinate systems into each other, but Coordinate systems into each other, but basis independence that would also allow you to do Fourier transforms and things like that that are beyond coordinate system transformations. But we need basis independence because we do not want to assume that there is a manifold to start with. It should only emerge. And then we saw that the gravity action can be included in an elegant way, going back to Gilke and Hawking, as a leading identity in the action, if you write the action as a trace. And for more. As a trace. And for more details on this, I would like to refer you to a soon upcoming paper by my student Barbara Schroeder and my collaborator Markus Reitz, who is currently a postdoc at Krakow in Poland. Thank you very much. I can't hear anybody. Okay, so let's open for questions here. There's a question in the audience. There is a question in the audience. Yes, probably you mean me. So, first of all, Ahim, nice to see you online. Well, I have not really a question, it's more comment. So, it seems to me that many of your ideas and concepts are very similar to what is done in causal fermion systems. For example, I mean, you talked at the beginning, you had to have these two-point correlators, and then called the causal structure, and maybe also the geometric structure, the conformal structure. In fact, it's Formal structure. In fact, this is precisely what is implemented in the causal fermion system approach. I mean, there's a kernel of the fermionic projector, which is similar to a two-point function. And this encodes the causal structure and all of the geometry. So all this is already there. I mean, so also some of your ideas later on where you say, or where the idea is, how can I formulate quantum field theory no longer relying on a space-time? We have. Space-time, we have this already for causal Fermi systems. I mean, we have this causal action principle which works for a general quantum space-time, so there's no manifold structure or anything needed. And we can also get like a quantum state out of it. I mean, this is fairly recent. In fact, I talked about this a little bit in my talk yesterday. So it seems that there are really like close connections, and that also some of the things which you explained in words are already. In words, they are already implemented there in a mathematically clear way. Felix, please send me the latest papers on this. Okay, sure. I'll be happy to do that. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Hello, Kim. Hello. Hello. So this is more a comment than questions. For me, and I guess many for many people. And I guess many for many people that it is clear that everything can be described through information. And then the question that you raised at the beginning is, is it that it can be described or can it be just information in a way? Everything comes from information. And you started with this example with music. And if I have the orchestra in front of me, but I have a screen and I cannot see the orchestra, maybe. Orchestra, maybe it is a recording, and I will confuse it with that. So now that you go to quantum gravity, if or any field theory or something, I have a part of the system where I have a field and everything, and it interacts with another part of the system. And everything is those interactions. Everything that happens in physics is interaction. Happens in physics is interactions between subsystems. And for example, if I have a description of a subsystem in terms of information, like a recording of that, and I present it to the other subsystem, if it's complete information, I will confuse it with the system. There is no, then in that sense, like for example, if I have two subsystems, A. Two subsystems A and B, and have a state of the system or the field at B, and another, so phi and phi prime that are confused by other, their interaction with A is indistinguishable, then I will call them gauge-related or something. So in physics, everything is modeled by Model by in physics of these gauge systems or fields model or gauge, then everything is information. So already that notion of, I think Dirac invented this notion, description of what's gauge. It just says that things that affect others parts of the system in the same way, they are regarded as equivalent. So if what travels is just inform describes. Described by information in a completely in a faithful way, then that's it. World is information. And so I like very much the beginning of your talk, but you just put it as a question whether everything will be information. And for me, that's clear that things are information, but this But it's an arena that is too big, no? And then you came at the end to this thing: if I have these correlators and then I ask for diagonalization or something, then I come back to what I want to talk about. So for me, that's the very tough job that you have in front of yourself. You are in the area of information, and then you want to not be talking about music or. Not be talking about music or literature or something, but you want to be talking about field theory and this kind of filter. So I really like your approach, but this is going to be very tough of saying what you really want. For example, in the sense of classical field theory, you may have to say something or quantum field theory in curb space-time, something about your correlators, but when you Relators. But when you want to go to other regimes like quantum gravity, it's going to be very difficult to say what you really want to have correlators to satisfy in what sense to say more things than just being diagonalizable or something. So sorry to take so long. Anyway, but I agree. This is at best a beginning here. I don't know yet. I don't know yet why there ought to be a regime in which these higher-order correlators are diagonalizable. But I mean, if we knew what the reasons are why there ought to be a regime like that, then we would know why space-time and matter can emerge from this. And I mean, imagine it could be that if you start the way that I described today, you start. I described today. You start with the assumption that there's just a fundamental information theory. It deals with these endpoint correlators. And it could be that generically, these endpoint correlators happen to describe, happen to be generically of a structure that can be naturally mathematically represented as the recordings of an orchestra. It could just be that. I mean, it could just be that. But instead, what we find is that, no, they can be represented as quantum field theories on a curved space-time. But what forces that? Why would it be that these endpoint correlators are diagonalizable or at least approximately diagonalizable? Why would that be? I have no idea. The math doesn't force it. There's got to be some other reasons for that. For that, it's a good thing that channels this into a low-energy regime. I mean, it could also be that anything that is possible is somehow realized in there, and we just find ourselves in the representation that is that of a quantum field theory on a curved space-time by the entropic principle. But I'm not ready to give up on it. There ought to be some other explanation for that. Explanation for that. Okay, let's go to another question that Danielle Brown has. Yes, thank you very much, and thanks for this very interesting talk. I actually have several questions, if you permit. I mean, the first thing is, if I hear about information as being the fundamental thing, is information about what, right? I mean, so I mean, I see your point to some extent that you start from a correlator, which has initially some positions. So we're essentially talking about detecting. So, we're essentially talking about detecting particles at certain positions and creating these events. Then you say, okay, we can abstract this and go to just abstract operators in Hilbert space. But then, somehow the Hilbert space is the fundamental thing. And normally, the Hilbert space is not a unique universal thing. It depends on what kind of system we look at. Is it spin one half? Is it one oscillator? Is it well, whatever system you come up with? So, single particle field. So, many different Hilbert spaces. many different Hilbert spaces and so without talking about where we started with the Hilbert space I feel like we still have to make some assumptions about what kind of matter we have what kind of systems we have so that's that's the first question and maybe I first let you answer that before I continue yes a very very good question very appropriate and I don't know the answer to that you see from what I told about from what I spoke about um the universe could have chosen to just have The universe could have chosen to just have one field, like, I don't know, a Fermion field or a Klein-Gordon field or whatever, and that would be it. But no, apparently there are a lot of them and they have very sophisticated structures and finite dimensional sub-Hilbert space or factored Hilbert spaces, which have to do with spins and isospins and all of that. And I don't know what the origin of that structure might be. It requires extra. It requires extra input. Yeah, I'm only talking about a container and then what is in there. Then I would also say that the claim that information can describe matter is a bit exaggerated. I mean, we know, for example, nothing about the masses of the particles or the spins of particles and so on. As you say, ease of spin, whatever these properties are of matter. It's just you correlate some events, but we don't say what kind of events these are. Are these electrons? What kind of events are these? Are these electrons that they're detected somewhere and correlated with positrons appearing somewhere else? So, these properties of matter, I would say, are not described with such correlators. You have to assume some particles somehow that define what the events even are that we can talk about, even if we say, okay, we make it basis independent. I agree with the concern, and that's what I had in mind when I made this remark in the middle of the talk. This remark in the middle of the talk where I said that it would be very interesting to try to reformulate the interaction Hamiltonians, for example, of the standard model, in purely information theoretic terms. See, on one hand, if you are given an interaction Hamiltonian, then you can calculate what the classical and quantum channel capacities are. But the question then arises: if you know Then arises, if you know all about the classical and quantum genetic capacities, can you reconstruct what the interaction Hamiltonian is? And if you can, then it means that, yes, everything would be encoded in this information theoretical perspective. And of course, yes, it would not be just scalar to scalar. Yes, then you would have to consider that the Hilbert space structure is more complicated. It factorizes in ways that... In ways that whose origin I don't know. But ultimately, I still hold out the hope that even, I don't know, the gluon-gluon-4 vertex, complicated thing with lots of indices, even that, I think it could probably be described in terms of the quantum channels that it establishes and their classical and quantum capacities. So it's a kind of reverse engineering problem. You can go from this correlate this to the reverse engineering, exactly. And if we could reverse engineer it, then we could say, oh, but maybe the informational view is the primary one. And the traditional view is the derived one. Okay. And the reason being that if we have it in the informational description, then we can free ourselves from assumptions and we can just say, well, Assumptions. And we can just say, well, even in regimes such as the Planck regime, we are no longer a low-energy regime, we can still have that informational, purely informational view. Okay. I will interrupt here. I think we are over time and we are in a tight schedule. So this is a very interesting discussion and I think there are many questions still for whenever the next discussion session is. So I would ask everyone to thank Ahim again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
