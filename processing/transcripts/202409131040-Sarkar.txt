And he will talk about intertwining of some Markov semiconductors of current groups of step two. Thanks, Masha, for the introduction. And thanks to the organizers for ending this wonderful workshop and giving me the opportunity to give the talk. So I'll talk about the intertwining of some work of semi-groups on corner groups of step two. The work is still in progress. And in fact, this problem originated from many insightful discussions with Masha Gorina, who is also my With Marsha Gorina, who is also my postdoc mentor, and I'll talk about some result service and defunct. So, let me first start with the definition of corner groups, but I'm pretty sure that most of the people in the audience are familiar with corner groups. So, they are connected Nilpoton Lie groups of step two. That means if you look at the Lie algebra, then it has this decomposition G1 plus G2, where G2 equals the commutator. Where G2 equals the commutator of the first component, G1. And then the group has step 2. That means if you take any Lee bracket of second order, it vanish. Now, such groups can be identified with this kind of product of Equivalent spaces, Rn times Rm, where N is a dimension of the first layer, G1, and M equals a dimension of the second layer. And the group operation can also be written explicitly. It has this form. So if we take an element, if we take two. if we take an element, if we take two elements, x, v and x prime v prime, then the group law equals x plus x prime. So the first component is the usual addition. And then in the second component, we have an additional factor where these quantities are equal to some skew symmetric bilinear forms. So a1 through a n, they are all skew symmetric matrices. And the zero is the identity element. And also, because of the skew symmetry, the inverse of any element becomes the negative of. Of any element becomes the negative of that vector. Now, many things are known about these Carnot groups. For example, all these groups are unimodular, and the hard measure coincides with the Lebesgue measure on this space, Rn times Rm. Now, these groups can also be equipped with dilations, and the dilation acts in this way. So, if we dilate by a constant C, then the first component is the usual dilation. Is the usual dilation. And for the second component, we have C squared times V, the square dilation. And the representation theory is also well known for these groups. In fact, for any null potential group, there's something called Kirlov orbit method, which gives all imitary usable representations on the group. And for these two stable potential groups, the computations for Kirlov orbit method is simple. And you can see these references where they did. Where they did for the two-state important groups. They are very explicit. Okay, so now here are some examples. The first example is the Heisenberg group, which is the most famous example for two-step corner groups. And this group, Heisenberg group, also appeared in many talks in the workshop. So it's a Heisenberg group of dimension 2d plus 1, where the group operation looks like this. First of all, this group is realized. Uh, this group is realized as the d-dimensional complex plane times the real line, and uh, the second component of this group law is uh, this is the skew symmetric part, you take the half of the imaginary part of the dot product of Z1 and Z2. But then there are also other examples like H-type groups, which are generalizations of Heisenberg group. And so they are realized as R to the power 2D times Rm. And the group law is. And the group law is given by this expression. And here, the skew symmetric bilinear forms are given by orthogonal skew symmetric matrices satisfying this condition that if you take E well times E well prime, that equals negative of E well prime times E well. Then there's also a non-isentropic Heisenberg group, which also appeared in Yang Ling's talk on Wednesday, where she talked about the locksable of inequalities on non-isotropic Heisenberg groups. Groups. Okay, now any such group, any such corner group of step two, in fact, any corner group can be given a sub-Riemannian structure. So if you look at, so we know that the Lie algebra has these two components, G1 and G2. So if you look at the first component, G1, and take an orthonormal basis there, X1 through Xn, and we consider the corresponding vector fields induced by these Lie algebra elements. Elements. Then, from the definition of kernel group, it easily follows that if you take the span of all the brackets generated by these vector fields, they span the entire tangent space, which means if we consider the span of these vector fields x1 through xn coming from the first layer of the d-algebra, it defines a sub-Riemannian structure on the group. And therefore, we can define a sub-Laplacian corresponding to this sub-Riemannian structure. Sub-Riemannia structure. So, this is the definition of sub-Laplacian on the Carnot group, where we take the sum of squares of these vector fields. And this sub-Laplacian, it does not depend on the choice of the orthonormal basis, because for any Lie group, if we take any particular horizontal distribution, then the sub-Laplacian is determined by that. It doesn't depend on the choice of the orthonormal vector fields. Of the orthonormal vector fields. And because of this condition, which is also known as Hormender's condition, this sublaplessin is a hyperlytic operator on the counter group. Okay, so here's the, like I show like what happens for the Heisenberg group. Again, this is, I think most of you are familiar with what happens for the Heisenberg group. So these are the vector fields left and right. Left-in-grain vector fields on the Heisenberg group X, Y, and Z. And then, if you consider X and Y to be an orthonormal basis for the first layer of the Heisenberg group, then it defines a sub-Riemannian structure. And the corresponding sub-Laplacian is the sum of squares of these vector fields, which is the second-order differential operator. Now, so what are the main objectives of my talk? So, first, I'll talk about the spectrum of the sub Laplacian on any corner group of step two. Any corner group of step two. So I'll give a complete description of the spectrum. And I'll use some intertwining relationships. So I'll define what I mean by intertwining relationship. So I'll define intertwinings. I'll prove intertwinings of the Saplaplessian with some other operators defined on Euclidean spaces, and that will give the spectrum of this operator. And then I'll talk about how the spectrum of this of Laplacian. Spectrum of the sublaplacian behaves under some Levy-type perturbations. And finally, in the second part of my talk, I'll talk about like some Australian big type operators coming from these Levi-type perturbations of the suppliplacium. And I'll talk about the isospectrality of those operators. Now, when I talk about intertwining, this is the kind of definitions. If I have two operators, P and Q, defined on different Banach spaces, the P is. Different Banach spaces. P is defined on B1 and Q is defined on B2. They are called intertwined if there's another operator lambda, which is defined from B2 to B1, such that this holds. P lambda is lambda Q. Now, under some conditions on Lambda, one can transfer the spectral properties of Q to that of P. So that's the mean idea. So now that we're going to be able to do that. Now that we want to talk about the spectral properties of the sub-placious, that's an unbounded operator, but we can go to the corresponding semigroup, which becomes bounded, and therefore developing a spectral theory for bounded operators is much easier than unbounded operators. So, which is why I considered the horizontal heat semigroup, which is generated by the sublaplacian. So, this is the sublaplacious on the Carnot group, which is known to be essentially self-adjoint with respect to. Be essentially self-adjoint with respect to all test functions on the Condor group. And L2G denotes the L2 space of the Condor group with respect to the hard measure. Then because of this condition, of this property, essential self-arginase, we can define the horizontal heat semigroup, which is the exponential of T times V sublaplacium. Now, this semi-group has all the desired properties like we have for the classical. Like we have for the classical heat semigroup on any Euclidean space, it's left translation invariant. Then, Haar measure is the unique invariant measure of this semigroup up to multiplication by constants. Then it has these scaling properties in time and space. And moreover, due to the Hormanner's condition, Qt has smooth transition densities with respect to the Harm measure on the group. However, these transition densities, they are not Gaussian. Transition densities, they are not Gaussian, they are different. And these transition densities, they are also translation invariant in this way. So essentially, if you take the transition current and G and H, that is equal to 0, G inverse H. Okay, so I want to describe the spectrum of this semi-group, but that also gives the spectrum of this operator due to the spectral mapping theorem. So now, when I talk about spectrum, I mean the spectrum in the classical sense, like when a complex number lambda is in the spectrum of an operator B when lambda i minus b is not invertible. And based on this definition, we have like three types of spectrum. Like it's actually like the number of ways an operator fails to be invertible. So we have point, continuous, and residual. Point means it has eigenvalues, continuous means Continuous means they are not eigenvalues. And at the same time, the operator is not injective. Lambda minus p is not injective, but it has dense range. And residual is like whatever depth from outside point and continuous. So this is one of the main results that we have. So recall that any corner group of step two can be identified with Rn plus M. N is the dimension of the first step. n is the dimension of the first layer of the algebra and m is the dimension of the second layer. Now this is the theorem we prove that we can find a closed subspace of the L2 space on the Carnot group such that it has an orthogonal decomposition with infinitely many orthogonal components. And we also have a collection of strongly continuous contraction semi-groups Pn defined on some L2 space of the Euclidean space Rk. Of the Euclidean space are k plus m. So I'll mention what k is. k is a number which is bounded by bounded above by n. So we have this decomposition paired with this collection of semigroups defined on this L2 space such that we have these three things. First, if I look at the horizontal heat semigroup restricted on each of these components in the orthogonal decomposition, they're invariant. They're invariant. Secondly, the collection of contraction semigroups I have here all have purely continuous spectrum, and their spectrum equals the interval 0,1. And the third one is the most important one. It says that for each of these orthogonal components, there is a unitary operator, which we can construct explicitly. So we have u n defined from this L2 space to this orthogonal complement. To this orthogonal component Ln, such that the restriction of the horizontal heat semigroup Q on this orthogonal component Ln is inter-equivalent to Pn. So that's kind of intertwining relationship or inter-equivalence between two operators. And so what about this closed subspace? Well, we can also construct that explicitly and the Also, constructed explicitly, and the construction comes from the Fourier analysis on G, which essentially is the representations on the Carnot group. And what is this K? So, K, it also comes from the representations on this Carnot group. So, K is the dimension of the so-called radical of the representations. So, and that number is bounded between 0 and n. Now, from this theorem, one can easily deduce that. Theorem: one can easily deduce that the spectrum, if you look at the spectrum of the horizontal hitch semi-group, that also equals zero, one. And with some additional argument, we can show that the spectrum for Q is also purely continuous. So if you look at this result, it says that, well, this is the same result that we have for the Euclidean case. You look at the heat semigroup on the Euclidean space, it has purely continuous spectrum and the spectrum equals 0, 1. But this theorem shows that it also holds for any current group. Also, holds for any count group of stable. Okay, so now, so here are some remarks. So, for example, so here, the collection of semi-groups that we have, so I wrote them as founding continuous contraction semi-groups, but they may not be Markov all the time. So, but they are Markov in some cases. For example, when you take the H-type group that I mentioned to you in the second slide, then those semi-groups Pn. Then those semigroups Pn, which intertwines the horizontal heat semigroup, they are given by the Pointson semigroup on Rm. So Poisson semigroup means that they are generated by the square root of the negative power plus n. But in general, Pn's may not be Markovian. They are non-Markov operators. So now I talk about the Levité perturbations and I'll talk about how the perturbations affect the spectrum of. Affect the spectrum of these operators. But before defining these perturbations, let me try to give you a motivation like why you one should consider those perturbations. So, horizontal heat semigroup, they are Markov semigroups, and therefore they also have some stochastic processes associated with. So, they are called horizontal Brownian motion. So, horizontal Brownian motion can be realized in this way. So, the first component, like if you look at the first n components of the If you look at the first n components of the horizontal Brownian motion, they are standard Brownian motion on the Euclidean space Rn. And then if you look at the last n components, they are given by the levy areas. And these levy areas, these matrices A1 through AM, they are the same matrices defining the group operation on the conjugate group. So now from this representation, it's clear that if we project the horizontal boundary motion on the first n components or the horizontal variables, then it Horizontal variables, then it coincides with the standard Brownian motion on Rn. So we can write this same statement in an analytical way that if I define a lifting operator pi from C0Rn, that means I look at continuous functions defined on this space, then I lift this function to the Carnot group. So I define pi f x comma v as pi as f of x. That means it does not depend on the variables in this direction. Variables in this direction. Now, if pi is defined this way, then this projection result says that if I look at the horizontal heat semigroup Q and this Q written in red, which is the classical heat semigroup coming from this Brownian motion, then they are intertwined by this lifting map pi. Okay, so they're the same statements. However, so this equality here. So, this equality here, this is not specific about the horizontal semigroup. It can also be true for many other semigroups. So, I'll show you another example where it's true. So, now if I consider the full Laplacian on the corner group, so by full Laplacian, I mean the following. So, I have the sub Laplacian on the corner group, but then I'm adding the horizontal, sorry, then I'm adding the vertical Laplacian to the sublaplacium. Okay, so that means I get a Okay, so that means I get a full Laplacian on the Carnot group, now which becomes an elliptic operator on the Carnot group. Now, if I consider this operator here, this is also left translation invariant, and we can show that it generates a Markov semi-group on the A2 space of the Carnot group. Now, a simple computation shows that this operator here, it also satisfies the same relationship like in the previous slides. If I look at delta times pi, where pi is a lifting map. times pi, where pi is a lifting map, then it becomes pi times the delta. So this delta is the generator of the classical standard Brownian motion on Rn. Okay, so they are intertwined by the same map. So the natural question is like, what is the class of processes or what is the class of semi-groups which has this property? See, I want to classify all these semi-groups Q here such that if I use this lifting map, then I have Q pi. Then I have q pi equals pi times q, where this q is the semiconductor corresponding to the Brownian motion on the gradient space. So we have a characterization for this property. So here's a result. So suppose q tilde be any left translation invariant mark of semigroup 1g such that we have this intertwining via the lifting map. q tilde pi is pi q, where this is the Pi Q, where this is the heat semigroup on the Euclidean space, then the generator of this Markov semigroup Q tilde, it has to be of this form. So it has to be of the form delta H, the subla plus N, plus some additional operator. And this operator is the Levy operator or the generator of a Levy process, but this operator is acting on the vertical direction. Okay, so and Okay, so, and what is Levy operator? So, it's an operator, it's an integral differential operator defined this way. So, it has like the Killing term, then this is the Gaussian term of the operator, this is the drift term, and this is the jump part of the operator. So, this integrates the jump of the process. Okay, so now from now on, like if I parturb any subplapless, if I part of the sublaplessian by any levy operator. Of the Saplaplessian by any Levy operator, I denote the corresponding perturbation by delta L. So L is the Levy operator, and this is the notation for the perturbations. Okay, so now we can also obtain the spectrum of these perturbations in a similar way that we did for the Saplaplacian. Now, these operators are not necessarily self-adjoint, but they're always normal operators. So the spectrum is still not difficult because spectral theory for Not difficult because spectral theory for normal operators is also known. And we have like almost like we have kind of a partial description of the spectrum. So before that, let me recall that for any Levi process, there's something called Levik engine exponent, which characterizes the process. So it's a function psi defined from the real line to the complex plane. And it's defined this way. It has some linear part, some quadratic part, and it has Quadratic part, and it has some integral part. And these parameters, sigma, b, and kappa, they are coming from the definition of the Levi operator that I showed to you. They are the same parameters. So, here's a theorem about the spectrum of the perturbation. So, first of all, any such perturbation, they also have purely continuous spectrum. And, moreover, if you look at these imaginary part of the spectrum of the perturbation, Part of the spectrum of the perturbation that is given by the range of the imaginary part of this function. And in particular, when this function is real-valued, that means the underlying Liby process is symmetric, then the spectrum equals the negative half-line minus infinity to psi of 0. So this result says that, well, the spectrum of the perturbations, it depends on the perturbations as expected. Expected. Now, I highlight this statement because when I'll talk about the Australian vector operators via perturbations, I'll show that those operators, the spectrum of those operators, they are not affected by perturbations. They will be isospectral. So, that's the next part of my talk. So, first, let me define like what I mean by Australian semigroup on Carnot groups. So, I have the heat semigroup Q. Have the heat semigroup q, horizontal heat semigroup on the Carnot group. And then if I perform this kind of time change, time sorry, this kind of time change of the semigroup, then due to the scaling property of the horizontal hit semigroup, one can easily show that P is also a Markov semigroup on G. And the generator of this semigroup, it appears to be this one. It's given by delta H minus D. So delta H is the sublaplacian, and D is the Laplacian and D is the generator of the dilation group delta of e to the negative t. So you can compare this operator with the orchestral operator for the Euclidean space. We have the Laplacian minus x dot the gradient, which is the generator of the dilation on the Euclidean space. Now, these operators or these semi-groups, they're also ergodic, and the invariant distribution or the limiting distribution is given by the heat constant. Given by the heat kernel at time one-half. Now, in a paper by Louis Pickert, he showed that all these operators, the Australian operators on Carnot groups, they are non-set-fair joint. Unlike the Euclidean case, the Australian operators on Carnot groups are non-set-fair joint. In fact, they are non-normal. But still, he managed to obtain a complete description of the spectrum of those operators. He showed that the spectrum of the oscillation will be. spectrum of the Australian rube on this weighted delta space is given by e to the negative t times set of all integers, non-negative integers. And the key idea in his proof was to use the scaling property of the suppliplace here. By scaling property, I mean the scaling property of the Hitsim group. Okay, so now I talk about the perturbations. I can consider the same perturbations for the Australian limit operators. So what I'm doing here, instead of looking at the sub Laplacian, Instead of looking at the sublaplacian, I look at the perturbation of the sublaplacious, perturbation by some Levi operator, then I subtract the generator of the dilation. You can also think of it as the osteopathic operator A on the Garner group plus LAV operator. Now, here, if you look at this operator now, now this one here, it does not have the scaling property again. Like we have the scaling property for the subject. Scaling property for the sublaplacian, but it we do not have it for the perturbations. So, the first we have to make sense of this operator. We have to show that, well, this operator makes sense, like it should generate a Markov semi-group. And all these questions are like affirmative. So, indeed, AL is a generator of a Markov process, is the generator of a Markov semi-group, which you denote by P L. And under some mild condition on the Levy measure, we can show that, I mean, when the Levy measure has finite log moments. I mean, when the Levy measure has finite love moment, then this Markov semigroup is ergodic. And we can also obtain the explicit formula for the invariant distribution, for the mining distribution. And therefore, we can talk about the string on the weighted data space. So I think I'm already running short of time. So here's the result we have. We have, like, they can intertwine all these perturbations with the ostrich of the Konnak-Carnot group. And then, this is the result we have: that under some mild condition of the Levy measure, we have the same spectrum for all perturbations. So, if we perturb any oceanic operator by a Levy operator, then the spectrum does not change. It remains the same. So, yeah, so it's very different from what you have for the sublaplacium. The sublaplacium, where the spectrum actually depends on perturbations. But if you go to the australibic, the spectrum remains the same for any perturbation. So I think I should stop here. Thank you. Anyone very quick question? Maybe not this time. Sorry, we're we are on a very tight table. Thank you. Thank you. Talk to you soon. Bye. Thanks.
