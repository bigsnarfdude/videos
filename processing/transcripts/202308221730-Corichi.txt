Okay, so thank you to the organizers for inviting me. As you can see, I will talk about more the gravity part of the conference and a little bit about non-commutativity. Since I am a physicist, what I mean by quantum and non-commutative may be different from the May be different from the non-commutative gravity geometry part of the audience here. So I will try to clarify that. Okay, so I'm going to talk about black holes. So black holes, these are very well understood in the classical theory. So Chandra Sekar, who was a very distinguished astrophysicist and then theoretical physicist. Astrophysicist and then theoretical physicist wrote in his black holes book that black holes are the most perfect objects there are in the universe. The only elements in their constructions are our concepts of space and time. And since general relativity predicts a single family of solutions, they are also the simplest as well. One can say that these are the crown of classical physics, because these are this very beautiful. This very beautiful prediction of what one can consider the queen of the physical theory, classical theories, which is general relativity. So this is the crown of classical physics. But we know that the universe is not classical, right? So it's quantum. So we know also from a long time ago, from the early seventies, that Early 70s, that if we look at some geometrical relations between for black holes, this has to do with the mass of the space-time with a black hole at infinity. This is a geometrical quantity called the surface gravity, and A is the area of the horizon of a black hole. They satisfy this relation, which looks very much like Which looks very much like the first law of thermodynamics, where the mass of the space-time is obviously related to the energy of the system, kappa is somewhat related to the temperature, and area is somehow related to the entropy. These are concepts in thermodynamics. Okay, so when one invokes quantum mechanics, this was the insight of Hawking in the 70s. Then one finds exactly the relations. So the energies, of course, the mass of the space-time, which is what one expects. The temperature is related to H-bar. So for me, quantum is whenever H-bar is present. And And an entropy is proportional to area and inversely proportional to H-bar, right? So, this suggests that when we take quantum mechanics into the play, black holes seem to be thermodynamic systems. And also, we know that if we have a thermodynamical system, which may have some relations for macroscopic observables, there should be a problem. Observables, there should be an explanation for this relation coming from the microscopic degrees of freedom. So that's the next question that we would like to ask, right? Okay, so if black holes behave like thermodynamical objects, then what are the underlying degrees of freedom responsible for this entropy? So this is the question that I'm posing, and I'll give the answer that Luke Quantum Gravity provides. Provides. So, but what one normally says is that it's only when there's a full marriage of the quantum and gravity that we will be able to answer this question, right? And of course, quantum gravity, for me, quantum gravity means trying to find a quantum theory with H bar for the gravitational field. There are many approaches to this quantum gravity problem, which is, of course, string theory. Which is, of course, string theory, most popular Causal sets, entanglement entropy, which is curiously what most of string theorists are doing nowadays. And of course, non-computative geometry and the one I will talk about, which is loop quantum gravity. So first thing I want to say is how do we characterize black holes in equilibrium? So if I want to build a model, then first I have to say exactly what I mean by black holes in equilibrium. What I mean by black holes in equilibrium, because we're talking about hopefully systems which are in the equilibrium for which we can assign these thermodynamical quantities. And then, of course, what are these classical horizon states, meaning what are the classical degrees of freedom that we can assign to the black hole horizon? And then hopefully we can think about quantum horizon states, also now, states in the quantum theory. States in the quantum theory, and then the question I'm posing just to make some contact with the other part of the workshop here is whether we find that whether these degrees of freedom become non-commutative. So that's that's part of the question at the end, right? So, okay, we are basically interested in describing black holes in equilibrium, that is, equilibrium of the horizon. Is equilibrium of the horizon, not of the exterior. This is just like when we look at a thermodynamical system, we only are concerned that the system is in equilibrium. We don't ask that the whole universe is in equilibrium, which is not. So still, we can study systems which are in equilibrium, but just themselves. So this is the same idea. And here the question is whether we can characterize this or Characterize this or capture this notion by imposing some boundary conditions. And the answer is yes, and this is precisely the area of or this topic of isolated horizons. This is what Tatiana Wukashinak was talking about last evening. And this is basically the idea is to impose boundary conditions on an inner boundary of the space-time region under consideration. Of the space-time region under consideration. In this case, the interior of the horizon, so what is normally called the black hole, is cut out from the region that we are considering. And then, of course, the question is whether this is a physical boundary. Of course, it is not, because we can always throw things into the horizon, but this is just a way of characterizing or trying to give some description. To give some description, self-consistent description to this horizon and treating it as a boundary of the region, right? This is what I'm talking about is complementary to what Jurek and Ed were talking about yesterday. They were considering models in which one looks at the collapse of matter or dust or whatever. And so looking at the exterior, interior, and the singularity. Interior and the singularity. I'm just looking at a formalism that is defined outside the horizon. So I'm not talking about the interior nor the singularities. So this is the picture. This is what physicists think of black hole forming by collapse, for instance, of a star, of a shell, or something. So this collapses into the singularity at some point. Singularity at some point, there's an event horizon forming here. First, oops, I say, oh, okay. What I'm supposed to do? Think twice. Double-click. Double-click. Double-click. Never double-click again. Oh, shoot. That's double-click. Okay. Okay, so the Penn Horizon grows at the beginning, but then at some point it stabilizes and becomes isolated, and that's exactly the region we're looking at. I'm calling this delta. So we look at the late time. The late time evolution of a horizon of a black hole when it's already not growing anymore, and one can think of it as an isolated case. So that is the physical situation we are looking at. Now, the boundary delta is a three-dimensional isolated horizon. This is giving us, as I was telling before, an effective description for the degrees of freedom of whatever is inside and which is cut. Inside, and which is caught out of the formalism. And the idea is this boundary condition should capture the intuitive description of a horizon in equilibrium, and it should allow for a consistent variational principle and a three plus one decomposition of spacetime, which is what I'm going to talk about. Now, the quantum geometry, now, when we go to quantum theory, has the property that it has independent degrees of That it has independent degrees of freedom on the horizon that fluctuate in tandem with the bulk degrees of freedom, with the bulk quantum geometry. So that's how we are going to understand the quantum degrees of freedom, the quantum boundary degrees of freedom, corresponding to a microstate, which is this space-time with an isolated horizon as an inner boundary. And that's how we, for instance, And that's how we, for instance, give explain the degrees of freedom and the entropy of these objects. Okay, so now let me just summarize very briefly what isolated horizons Tatiana was giving, well, was talking about this and gave more much more precise definitions of what we are looking at. So these are classical horizons. Classical horizons in equilibrium, which are characterized by these isolated horizons. First, we consider a non-expanding horizon, which is a null surface, which is non-expanding, so the cross-sections, area cross-sections is constant, and it has an extrinsic geometry which is lead-dragged along some null generators L. Now, a weakly isolated horizon involves a choice of some equivalence class of generators. Of some equivalence class of generators that are such that the induced connection induced the preferred derivative operator on the space-time when we look at it on the horizon, and that gives defined some connection omega, that's leadracked also along the node generator of the horizon. Okay, and then further one can fix an internal node tetra that she was describing and As she was describing, and some horizon generator together with some internal tetra through the field line, which is normally the variables we consider, field lines and connections. So once we do that, we get these boundary conditions. I'm not going to give more details. Here, the idea is that the action we start with. The action we start with is some Palatini-like action, which is a first-order action. Here, the variables are the fear binds, which can be combined into this object sigma. And F is the curvature of this connection, right? The connection has the symmetry of Lorentz symmetry, so it's O31 connection to begin with. And we consider this kind of Consider this kind of action, right? Now there's one very nice classical formulation, which is called the covariant Hamiltonian formulation, in which one just looks at how this is when we vary this action, we get some boundary term, which has this term. And from there, one can construct a symplectic potential and then a symplectic structure. And that Structure and that gives us some Hamiltonian formulation for the theory without having to do any decomposition. So that this is very covariant. And that's why this is the covariant Hamiltonian formulation. And if we add to this, for those who know, there's another term which is called the Holtz term, which is important for loop quantum gravity. That doesn't change this construction in this covariant Hamiltonian approach. This covariant Hamiltonian approach. Okay. So that has been done a lot. Every time I have this thing with a star inside some brackets, this means that there's some controversy in the literature about this top, about this point. And my viewpoint is contrary to most of the people. So this is a disclaimer. So if I'm contradicting. So, if I'm contradicting what you have heard before, it's for a particular reason. So, that will show up a lot here. Okay, so now, but the quantum theory, the one that we are considering, is obtained by a canonical quantization procedure, which requires a classical canonical description, which means a three plus one decomposition of the space-time and the action, therefore. So, we cannot use covariant techniques, however. Techniques, however beautiful they are. So, the procedure for obtaining this symplectic structure is particular and is distinct and different from the covariant formalism. This is what Tatiana was talking about last night. And again, this is something that we sometimes disagree with the colleagues, right? The important lesson here is that we should not use the covariant formalism and pretend to have the canonical simplicity. Pretend to have the canonical symplectic structure. And this is something that most of my colleagues do nowadays, which I think is wrong. Okay, and you see that when you look at the details, you get something which is different. Now, the simplexity potential in our case depends on certain choices. That's what Tatiana was explaining yesterday. There happen to be several different possibilities and choices one can make, and one gets different descriptions. And one gets different descriptions, right? And in some cases, we do have a contribution from the horizon to symplectic structure, and this is something that we need for the quantum theory. So somehow we have a quantum theory, and of course, we want to arrive to this using some quantization procedure. So it's important for the quantum theory to get a horizon symplectic structure, right? So that's what we will do. This is what Tatiana was talking about. This is what Tatiana was talking about. This is her case three from yesterday's talk. Okay, now, an important remark here is that we do not need a boundary contribution to the action to obtain this, right? So the action here I only wrote a boundary part and maybe add the, well, one needs to add the host term, but no boundary term to the action. This is also. This is also contrary to what some colleagues say: that they add boundary terms to the action. You don't need to do that. Now, in the case of the particular case of spherically symmetric isolated horizons, which is not the most general weakly isolated horizon, but this is the one that this the this is only for these horizons that we do have. For these horizons, that we do have full control and we can go to the quantum theory. This is so, for this case of spherically symmetric and fixed area, weakly isolated horizons, but with this restriction, one can show that the original gauge symmetry that we had at the beginning, which was the Lorentz symmetry of the action, at the end of the day, the boundary, the degrees of freedom, which Degrees of freedom which leave at the boundary are given by one U1 connection, which I will call W. And this turns out to be closely related to the one form V that Tatiana was talking about yesterday. So there are like two degrees, two components to the connection on the horizon. One is V and the other is omega. And it turns out that this is the, in this, by taking this, this particular But by taking these particular choices, the degree of freedom that remains, which is independent and remains on the horizon, is this V. Now, this is also weird because in the covariant approach, it happens, seems that it's the other one, that this is something that we don't understand very well. Now, this is, of course, compatible with the SU2 connection on the bulk. So, if we look at the standard Archdecar bar base. Standard Archikar Barbero connections on a three-dimensional slice. This is one gets that this W is consistent with that one and the foliation and the three plus one decomposition. Okay, so now the interesting thing is that, okay, we do have a U1 connection. We know it's a U1 because the way it transforms and so on. And this resembles a U1 churn sign on steering. As you want Chern-Simons theory for the connection, the way. Okay. So it has the same degrees of freedom as a chair and Simons connection, has the same symplectic structure. So it looks like, talks like one, works like a chair and Simons connection, even when we do not have an action, Chair and Simons action directly, right? Just looks like a Chern-Simons connection. Okay, so let me summarize so far. So far, there are two main consequences of the boundary conditions. Yeah, because no, that means if you start with the churn-simons action, you get a U1 connection that with particular symplectic structure, and you also get F equal to zero, which we don't have. So it looks like. Have so it looks like a you want connection, we don't have the action, the churn-simons action. So, in essence, it's not in the quantum theory, looks much more like a churn-simons, but at least classically, no. And this has to do with this comment that we do not need a boundary contribution to the action, because sometimes people just put a or have Or have historically added a Chern-Simons action to the gravitational action. And then, of course, you do get a Chern-Simons connection, but it's not necessary. But still, you get something which looks very much like that. Okay, so let me just summarize here. We have two main consequences of these boundary conditions. First is that the gravitational degrees of freedom induced on the horizon are captured by a U1 connection. By a U1 connection. And if you look at exactly what this is connected to, this is just connected to the spin connection on the horizon, just contracted with an internal radial vector here. So we can see that this is okay. This is a gravitational degree of freedom. And then the total symplectic structure of the theory, and this is true also when we include most. When we include most kind of type of matter, which is decent in its energy conditions, the total symplectic structure has a bulk contribution, which I'm not writing. And the horizon contribution, and precisely the horizon contribution, is the one that is exactly the same as in church times. That's what I mean by it looks like. Okay. Now there's a Now, there's a second consequence: that there's something which is called the horizon constraint. And this connects some boundary on some horizon and bulk degrees of freedom. So on the left-hand side, we have horizon degrees of freedom. This is the curvature of the U1 connection. And on the right-hand side, we have this object is this two-form, which is dual to the triad. Two form which is dual to the triad. Now we are in three dimensions. So the field bind is a dry bind, a triad, and that's dual to a two form. So this is this two form precisely here. And here again contracted with the radial internal vector. So this is, if you look at this classically, it turns out to be precisely Gauss's law. This is what generates gauge transformations on the horizon. This is something that one needs to This is something that one needs to, I mean, one finds simply this condition, which is called the horizon constraint. So we have a horizon on one side and bulk degrees of freedom on the other side. Now, what happens with the Poisson brackets in all this? Then, of course, if we look at the bulk, so inside outside the horizon in the three-dimensional hypersurface, so for any other two-sphere, for instance, which is the To a sphere, for instance, which is embedded in this three-dimensional space, we have that this connection, which is, I mean, we just got from this, right? So we look at what happens to the Poisson bracket between any two of these guys, this of course commutes. And if we look at the Poisson bracket between these two form Two form the pullback of this two form to this surface with the connection, this again Poisson commutes. This is just the ordinary Poisson relations of gravity, right? So if we were to promote these two operators, quantum operators, of course, these guys should all commute, right? So that's what we expect. Okay, so now what happens on the black hole horizon? On the black hole horizon. On the black hole horizon, there are two things happening. The first is that now we haven't induced Chern-Simon's type symplectic structure on the black hole horizon, which means that these two connections no longer was on commute, right? So now there's this Poisson bracket between these two guys different from zero. And one can check that this implies that now the Poisson bracket between the curvature and the connection is also different from zero. Is also different from zero on the black hole horizon. And now, if we impose this and say, okay, but remember that the curvature is proportional to this triad, this area two, four. Then what happens is that these guys, this area two four and the connection do not commute on the on this on the black hole horizon. On this, on the black hole horizon, okay, and then if we expect quantum theory to represent via this Dirac procedure to represent Poisson bracket relations and promote them to operators, then all these quantities which were commuting in any two sphere in the bulk do not commute when this two sphere is the. This two-sphere is the horizon of the black hole. Okay, so now this is just a consequences of having imposed this isolated horizons boundary conditions. Okay. Five minutes. Okay. Five minutes for the my half an hour, my total half an hour. Okay. So let me just summarize the classical theory. Classical theory. And maybe should cut this short, no time for the quantum theory, but the only thing that, okay, so the summary of a classical theory is that this canonical Hamiltonian formalism tells us in a natural way which are the horizon degrees of freedom. Again, this is no agreement on this. The relation between curvature and triad, the horizon constraint, mixes bulk and horizon degrees of freedom. And now the induced symplectic structure on the horizon induces a non-commuter. Horizon induces a non-commuting Poisson relations on quantities that commute on the bulk. And this is also a disagreement because there are some claims that even in the bulk, without imposing the horizon boundary conditions, should get some non-commutativity. But I again disagree with those statements. And so now in the quantum theory, we have to implement these facts, all this, and we This facts, all this, and we are going to get this quantum non-commutativity of this operator. So we do get that. And I mean, if I had gone faster, then I would have explained to you all the quantum theory, but I'm just going to flush it. This is just a nice picture of what people think of these quantum black holes. So this is they are the quantum. They are the quantum geometry is on the bulk is contained in these one-dimensional objects, that's what is called loop quantum gravity. And they, when they pierce and puncture the two-dimensional surface, they excite the geometry there. So in the quantum theory, actually, what we have is a puncture sphere. And now it looks much more like a Cheren-Simons quantum theory because now curvature everywhere is zero except at the punctures. So now Except at the punctures. So now we actually use the quantum Chern-Simons theory in order to do the quantum theory and compute the degrees of freedom. So in that sense, quantum mechanically, it completely looks like TOX and everything like Sharon-Simon's connection. So I just stop there. And this is what quantum theory is, Hilbert space is. Theory is Hilbert space is a tensor product of the volume and the horizon Hilbert spaces. And the classical relation now becomes a quantum condition on the states. So the states that satisfy this are allowed states. Yeah, yeah. But now it's imposed on quantum states, which are of this form. And those that satisfy these are called the horizon quantum states. And those are the states that Those are the states that one would count for that and then compute the entropy, right? Okay, so that's basically the conclusion that we do have this Dirac quantition implies that the connection entry no longer communes on the horizon as a consequence of these boundary conditions. And we do have this is what I already told you. Now the boundary condition modified excommunication. Now, the boundary condition modified its commutation relations, and this now the quantum degrees of freedom, which I didn't describe too much in detail, but these are also inherently non-commutative. Okay, and I'll just leave you with some references. This is the same paper that Tatiana was talking about yesterday. This is the classical analysis. And an example of the standard literature, which where I could disagree in all these points, I told you, is given. Points: I told you is given by this, which is a most recent review article by experts on this field. Okay, thank you. When you say you disagree conceptually or with the statements, yeah. I mean, I will agree with my statements. There is a proof that can be done to show, I think so.        And uh stop leaving uh without even if I Uh depending on the conditions to this more question from here. Some questions from Zoom. This is the chat. Oh, I can't see that. Does this have a good question? Yes, we lost audio. We lost at some point. Okay, then thanks.
