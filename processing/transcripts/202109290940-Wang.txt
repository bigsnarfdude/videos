Okay, thanks, Paul. First, I'll send the organizer for the invitation. You've seen a very nice conference. So I'm going to talk about one of the pneumatic crystal flow model where we're trying to stretch the effect of kinematic in the transport. In transport. So, I think yesterday, you already give a very good background. So, I'm trying to give a very brief introductions. So, we know that the crystal phase is kind of in between the fluid and solid. So, like in At each point, the molecule prefers to align in the same directions. So, which will give us the optical properties. And because of that, it has lots of applications in the liquor device. So, there are many studies. So, from the modeling point of view, it turn out there's two approach, you know, depending on how you want to describe. Down how you want to describe the orientation or you know, like uh distribution. So, the uh the older one, probably oldest one probably is the uh go back to Osam Frank, where they are using the so-called unive field to describe the orientation. Uh, so uh then I think later on the uh you know the genes in 1970s uh provide another sort of like a universal. Sort of like a universal framework in which using this code, you know, like Q-tensor, which is like choiceless, you know, three by three symmetric matrix. So which kind of like describe the second moment of the PDF of the molecule at each spatial point, something like this. So of course, those two approaches Those two approaches, in fact, are relate. Because if you want to do the eigen decomposition of the Q, so then there's one scenario where your Q might have two equal eigenvalues. So that will reduce to the uniaxial phase. So in that case, you see there's a principle, like a director D. So that's go back to the Osen frame. Of course, if the this. Of course, if there's another parameter S, which relates to the eigenvalues, so that one kind of like describes how much at each point your molecule, you know, sort of lying in the average direction D, you know, what's the percentage, what's the degree. So if the degree is constant, that really reduces the oscillation frame. If you allow the degree S to be variable, so that is the Ericsson modifications. And you know, like modifications, all right. So, that's that. So, then for either of those two models, it turns out they always like associate free energy. So, for instance, in the Olsen-Frank case, you have this Olsen-Frank energy density, which is taking this form one, right? So, then the so then if you depend on if you allow the U, you know, remember that these things have all. Remember that these things also have the flow properties. If flow is quiet, so then you have this static theory. So, by the way, I should mention that this density have like three different patterns. The first one, K1, corresponds to splay, K2 corresponding to the twist, and K3 corresponding to bending. So, then also in other terms, K4, so that's the low-agranding. Okay. So the static case, people are interested in studying the, you know, like the minimum solutions, you know, in particular defect structures in the defect sets. So although there's not very clear picture yet, but I would like to mention there's two kinds of series. The first one, very general series done like in the 1980s by Hartley. 80s by you know Hartley Kindler and Lin basically say that if you look at the minimizers, so then the defect set, which is the set of the point where the solution is discontinuous, has like a relative small size, meaning that the host of dimensions smaller than one. Of course, that series can be sharp if we consider so-called one constant case in which the osm. In which the Osen frame reduced to the, you know, minimizing how many maps. So, in that case, much more can be said. For instance, the singular set is points, and each point you have this asymptotics. Okay. So, that's the quick tour of the static theory. So, then my talk, you know, mainly I try to discuss the hydrodynamics. So, this model actually was in the web valid case. model actually was in the vapor value case has been deduced you know as proposed by Ericsson and Leslie in the series of papers you know basically if we're assuming the you know like the crystal is homogeneous you know those density you know and the density mass density equals one you're also assuming the fluid is incompressible so then the equation can be written like this so basically Like this. So basically, it's kind of like a linear momental balance and also the angular momental balance. So those are constituting equations. All right. So then the main thing here is you have these interactions between the fluid and also your molecule director D. So U and D is highly coupling, have strong inducting B10. So therefore, Inducting p 10. So, therefore, if we look in the fluid equation, kind of like a force like Stokes equation, so then you have this, you know, like induced stress coming from this disruptor and also come from the induction between the rapid and the fluid. Okay, so then you also have this angular momentum balance equation. So, where this, you know, like a first order variation of your Oscar Frank energy density acting as your force terms, okay. Your force terms. So then you have two kinds of time derivatives. So then, of course, if we consider the model is like a module equal one, you have this Lagrangian multiply properties. So here is a bunch of notations. The sigma hat is the total stress, you know, consists of two parts. One is arrogant stress, the other is this lesser stress. Leslie stress. So, you know, Ericsson's stress is kind of, you know, like easy to derive, but the Leslie stress really, you know, they came up with this expression, so which general, in general consists of six terms. So only the first term came from the viscosity of the fluid. So then the next five terms come from the inductions. So there's, you know, two kinds of like derivatives. One is this called, you know, like Is this called this material derivative with this rigid rotation? So here A is kind of like this symmetrical part and omega is like an anti-symmetric part. So then you also have this, you know, like you know, this coefficients here. All right. So this is the model equation, which is very complicated and involving lots of, you know, like In lots of, you know, like parameters. So, people, you know, are really interested in trying to study this model, this system, what kind of solutions you can have, whether you have regularity, singularity, or uniqueness properties. So to study this, in fact, people are do very kind of, you know, various kind of simplifications. Various kind of simplifications. For instance, I mentioned that one of the simplifications to always take is just consider this, you know, like this one constant approximation case. In that case, you know, the Osman Frank really reduced to simplest form. So then your equation, your system, you know, previous system, you know, somehow reduces slightly simpler form. So for instance, the Ericsson's just become this gradient T squared. Become this gradient t squared, and again, you still have this Leslie stress here. So, then if you get rid of this Lagrangian multiply, you can write down this third equation like this kind of generalized, you know, like a transport heat flow of Honey maps. Okay, so those are coupling systems. So, you will see that the main difficulties in the process to answer. In the process to answer these questions, really come from the right-hand side of the first equation. So, this total stress tensor will be the monster of difficulties. So, let me mention that there is always some kind of global energy qualities, so energy spatially. So, for instance, in the general case, So for instance, in the general case, you can deduce this rate of change of energy along the flow. It's obeying this identity here. Suppose your solution is nice. So then in order to have this energy decay, you usually assume this artificial coefficient satisfy this algebraic condition. So in that case, you can see that because suppose solution goes on forever to the eventually. Go on forever to then eventually Ericsson Wesley should converge into Olsen Frank. So that's kind of the original, you know, like motivations people have in mind. But of course, the system is highly non-linear. So therefore, you might, you know, the solution might break down somewhere. So if you were trying to understand what happens. Okay. All right. So let me mention that, you know, actually. But actually, to now, there are quite a few research activities concerning these systems recently. But I will just mention a couple works. So there's a long list. So I think the most common version of this Ericsson Leslie people took to study actually was first proposed by Fan Huang. Actually, it was first proposed by Fang Hua, which, you know, taking this very simple form, you know, I mean, still complicated, but compared to the previous two, it's much simpler. So the first one is this, you know, like really forced livestock situation. And the third one is really just the transport heat flow. Of course, he make the very, you know, like brutal simplifications. Just take the Just take the let's say just one term. And also, you know, just simplify this large molecule derivatives into just this simple material derivatives, things like that. So in that case, so the system in 2D actually, you know, by now, I think we understand this system in 2D pretty well. For instance, the, you know, like unique global Uh, unique global solution, almost smooth, has been established. And also, the this you know finite time singularity example has been constructed. And also in high 3D, actually turn out the, just like LabStocks, it turned out to, or heat-flow harmony maps turn out to be much more complicated. In 3D, concerning the large data, large solution, in fact, pretty much there's only one result. much there's only one result basically say that if assuming these director initial director have this geometric condition so then you can construct the global solution weak solution which satisfy this kind of Leroy-Hoford condition that's it okay so then also we know that in 3D there is a finite time similarities turn out of course that is much easier than the 2d finite time similarities all right so that's a concerning the the like uh like uh simplest you know lessly stress and uh you assuming this is uh like a unive field so that's what we know but but of course uh we want to uh you know actually uh when when when when i give talks people always you know like critical criticize in some sense that your sigma only uh taking this sigma like if this only like a mu four uh you know some sort of like a little distance from Like a little distance from the physics. So, therefore, we want to really want to see if I restore the general form of less distress, what happens. Of course, then the problem became much more complicated. There are two things you need to worry about. One is the moduli people want that's not any constraint. The other is this, you know, like the other file induction terms. So, so, so, so, so, uh, at this moment, I will focus on the trying to address the sigma. Trying to adjust the sigma and try and relax this modular D vote one. So that will go to the next, you know, like slide. So that is, we sort of like actually this, this, this consideration, in fact, not just mathematical simplification. In fact, this consideration actually is the, you know, like an expansion of Ericsson Wesley done by, you know, Ericsson in the late 80s. You know, late 80s basically say that you can modify this original model because remember that beside this director, you also have this degree parameter. So if we allow this degree parameter to come in, so then really you should have this general awesome frank energy functional. Okay. But then, of course, this because S degree can varies from time from place to place. So then really, you also you need to also you need to uh have this so-called uh you know this you know this uh bulk potential function f which kind of you know uh detecting the uh different phase right because it's taking different values that you see different phase okay so this will be the modified osm frame okay so then uh so so so so then of course uh you can derive the corresponding election lesson so in this case if you uh just combine case if you just combine this in a scalar s and d so then you will see that you can replace the original like uh Olsen-Frank energy function by this so-called Gentlendo approximation forms. So then of course you know you sort of get rid of the modulo of D equal to one constraint. So you make this energy function less non-linear. know less you know non-linear so then you can write down the corresponding you know uh uh x and lessly so now really still taking the same form the only difference is that this uh you know this uh this first first orderation came from this uh osm frame uh instead of to be the uh you know like a quasi-linear second order operator come this semi-linear second order you know operator Second order in the operator. Okay, so that in fact reduces the degree of nonlinearity. So presumably should improve the property of the solutions. But I still want to keep the Leslie as the most general form to try to see what happens. So that's the main motivations. So here is just So here is just like a couple quick remarks. The first one is that of course, from analyst point of view, it's easier. But on the other hand, if you let the parameter go to zero, in fact, what do you know about this system? In fact, should give you some information about all your systems. And also, I should point out, in fact, this problem, in fact, reduced. this problem in fact if we do actually relate to the uh you know general Q tensor system you know so-called you know first edward systems uh so so so so so therefore you know understand this system in fact should give you some you know information of the general Q transfer system as well okay uh so so for this you know like this interval analog type approximation in fact was That approximation, in fact, was also studied by Chen Yu and Feng Hua many years ago. So they actually took this simplest form again, only taking sigma, this lastly stress, only one term. So they can understand this system pretty well. So for instance, this is probably most related to my talk here. So that is, you can, they actually can build up the construction. And they actually can build up and construct a thing called suitable weak solution whose single set is like have one-dimensional host of major zero. So kind of like similar to the Lev Stocks equations. But here, you know, I want to really cook up as many Leslie stress terms as possible. Okay. You turn out that so. So that's so-called kinematic transport effects. It turned out that what we can say now is that we can include five coefficients, not six. So I would mention that what's the six we cannot handle. That is the mu1 terms we cannot handle yet. Okay, but before the talk, I only present three terms and sigma five, sigma six. five sigma six you know we can in the paper in the second paper we allow that but uh you know like have more like a technique difficulties but it can be handled okay so so in our case in this case in fact you can write on the system like this in the system number 10 here so basically uh you have this uh in like uh these two terms uh add on so those two terms in fact this is all like the uh the bracket but with uh you know like uh But with different coefficients. So this is like, you know, this you can check. This is really, you know, like sigma mu 2 mu 3. The other way to write. All right. So compared to the, you know, like Chen Liu and Fengwa's work, we have these two additional terms. Okay. All right. Okay, all right, so so I should also mention that this uh parameter alpha here also have like uh you know so-called shape shape parameters, you know, different value corresponding to different shape of your molecules. Okay, all right. So this is the system I'm going to study and we're trying to say, you know, construct a global solution which shares some partial regularities. So here is our main theorems. Uh, main theorems. Okay, so this is a joint work with my former student in uh Karung Du. Okay, so basically say that uh given the energy initial data, of course, with the uh you know influenza energy is finite, so then the uh there exists a global weak solution, actually we call suitable, so which you know is uh smooth away from a singular set. Singular set. The singular set, we can have some, you know, like a rough estimate, basically say that this is host of dimensions 15 of seven. So compared to Chen Liu and Fenwa's work, you know, this, I'm guessing this estimate is far from sharp. Okay. So then I should mention that they always some, you know, like intrinsic structures of these systems because Of these systems because they're coupling, so they are interacting, they are interacting in the you know, in the most feasible way. So, that means you have this cancellation properties. That's the key. So, that guarantee you have this global energy dissipations. Basically, the total energy along the flow is decreasing. This is rate of decreasing. Okay. One is come from this, you know, like this, you know, risk of stress. The other comes from this. The other comes from this, you know, like a molecule, this tension field. Okay, so that's that. Okay, all right. So let's just mention what is suitable weak solution. People are talking about that a lot. Basically, just say that besides this global energy spacing, also with local energy spacing, of course, local energy inequality should not say dissipation because not really dissipating, because depending on what's this, you know, these error terms. You know, these error terms, right? So, so this is sort of like the global energy inequality, but because you truncate, so therefore, you have all these, you know, kind of non-linear effect come in. Okay. So, so, so that's the error terms. So, if you can control this error term, this inequality is a pretty powerful in analysis because kind of give you this kind of like a, you know, reverse holder or. You know, reverse order or catch polytyping quality, you control high-order norm in terms of low-order norm of your solution. So that's already give you some regularity property in some sense. All right. So then the, actually, maybe I saw in this a few remarks, but maybe just mention those two. The first one is that compared to the original one and the The original one and the you know the expanded version, really there's a key difference, you know, because in the original, like I'll only consider this a transport Pincho-Lando equation for the D, then you have very nice maximum principle, okay? But if we add in this in like rigid rotation and also the stretching terms, the T alpha, then this one, there's no way you can have. There's no way you can have maximum principle. Okay, so then if we look into local energy quality, this error term really becomes not necessarily an error, it might be a dominant. So then we're trying to say something how to say it. So that's basically what we're trying to do. It turned out that if we can still construct global weak solution. Like global weak solution which enjoys this energy quality, right? We still can construct, okay? We still can construct something, a weak solution which enjoys this energy quality. But now, as I just said, that because you don't have maximum principle, even you assuming initial boundary values modulo less than equal to one, your solution may in a module of D might become infinity because there's no maximum principle. So then you can see that all So then you can see that all these terms, you know, all these terms, so might become the, you know, like, you know, might not be able to be under control. So how you can say some, you know, like regularity things for that kind of solution. So it turned out that we sort of borrowed some ideas for the purpose. For the parabolic systems, without you just looking at parabolic systems, in particular, you know, like classical works by Mario Japunda and also Craig Evans, you know, like they, of course, they study this so-called Maury classic convex function or the critical point or minimizers. But then, of course, you can also study the corresponding time-dependent version. So then I turn out that there's true. Basically, that if Basically, that if I look in the generic point where my average is bumped, my mean oscillation is small. So then you can now those point still be a good point. Okay. So, but now because I also have always left stocks, kind of like I look in the quantity, which sort of coding both. So one is just from left stocks, right? And the plus this, you know, like, you know, like. You know, like a gradient D, right? So, so this is a quantity if you're assuming this bound, so that's it. But now my D may not be bound. So I put a point, kind of like the bigger point, okay? So then I also have like a small oscillation. So then I claim that this quantity here, if it's starting small, then in fact, it decays. Okay, so like again, kind of like a small excess then. small excess than implied decay things okay so so so then the uh this is uh the uh you know like our main uh technical like uh uh tools to study these problems okay so all right so bob you know how much minutes i have left uh good question um do i still have a few minutes i think so yeah let me check um I think so, yeah. Let me check. Seven minutes. Seven minutes. Okay. All right. So, so I think I can, you know, just maybe point out, you know, few, few, few technical details. Okay. So this is the key. Okay. Once we have this, then we can, you know, the decay will somehow give you this as kind of like in the Moray space. So then which will imply, you know. Which will imply you know high unique ability of your solutions. Okay, so we know that if U and gradient D have sufficient high unique ability, so then of course you can go kind of treat like linear systems. So then you can use the standard regularity techniques to boost up the solution from this point to the really smooth point. So then, of course, we have to estimate what's this size of the set. Size of the set where those conditions violate. So, like the exceptional set, so that we can do some kind of like a covering argument to get, you know, 15 or 7. Okay. All right. So, here is just using the blowing up argument. In fact, this idea, in fact, probably first was brought up in the infan hua simplified proof of CKN. So basically, said I suppose. So basically, say that suppose this computer fails. So then you will have like a kind of like have like a sequence of scale, okay? And where your LV is still bound and this total energy goes to zero, but no matter how you shrink in the ball, you still don't have this decay. You know, don't have this decay, okay? So then it's now you only need to consider these radius compared to the energies of much smaller scale, okay, to begin with. All right, so then you can, you know, uh, scale your, you know, like a solution from small ball to unit ball. Then you're also shrinking the size to the unit size of your magnitude. So then until this blow-up sequence will satisfy this blob equations, okay, the sequence blow-up equation. Then you can see that blob equations. Equation, then you can see that blob equations are still non-linear, but now you see that all these non-linear terms are small magnitude, uh, the key is small. Okay, so then the listings, you know, have like all this quantity can, you know, drop out. So you should have some kind of very nice linear system as a limit, okay? Right. So, for instance, you have this limit equation, okay. Okay, right. So, the limited equation looks like a linear, but of course, here, because of this kinematic, you know, like transfer effect, you have those two terms left. And like the simplified case where you only have this linear stokes plus linear heat. So, decoupling. So, then we can say the limiting equation have very nice Muslims properties, but here they are still coupling. Okay. But, but then. Okay, but but then in fact we can prove although it does not follow from this standard theory, but we still can prove this linear system is really in fact smooth. Okay, so now you have the blob sequence band limit is good. Then we're using local energy quality to connect bridge to those two, basically say that they are remaining close. So, you know, so that's that's kind of like violate this kind of properties. Of properties, right? So, so here is, you know, like, you know, about limit, we have this little lama say that, in fact, solution smooth, you have this decay. But here, one of the tricky thing is that this, you know, pressure equation satisfy this Poisson equation with the right-hand side, but depending on the location of your solution, kind of like the Director's equation. Uh, the Diracus equation. So that's really something we have to take care of. But the whole thing can be proved by establishing an actual order energy equality, the local energy quality for the linear systems. So then you're trying to argue that, in fact, the block sequence and limit, in fact, they are convergence very nicely. So those data, you know. So those days are several different states of convergence. First, of course, using energy quality, local energy quality, because we have this bigger point, so average is bound and mean oscillation small. So then you can control all these terms involved this kinematic transport effect terms. So basically, this is the, you know, come from the kinematic transport effect. Kinematically transport effect, so now this still can be controlled. Okay, so then you get higher order normal control. So that will improve your convergence from initial conversion to basically to L3 of U, you know, L3 of gradient D, then this L6 of DI to D, to this limit. So here we sort of using this, you know, like a, you know, like a soble, you know, in. like uh soblif you know interpolation equality so basically you can control you know if you know the hessian and h1 control which resulted from here you can control the solution di up to you know turns norm l10 can be controlled so therefore you can guarantee this mean oscillation also convergence in l6 okay so so then the uh the the most difficult estimate in fact come from the pressure okay right if you you want to prove Okay, if you want to prove the pressure, the L2 over two norms still converging to limiting pressure. So you really need to write down the equation for pressure. You turn out the this is a term really is headache because without this, then you can see that this nonlinearity here really have this small coefficient. So therefore, you should have this pressure, you know, L3 over two convergence. Convergence to dk, but now you have this, okay. And this one, you see that this one really not small anymore, right? Because just if we just ignore this term, this is kind of like Laplace DI times DI, right? So this should be a di hat, okay? So then this guy really proportion to Laplace D, right? So there's no way small. So therefore, how you want to say this is still like a dk is unclear at all, right? is unclear at all, right? Because this guy really like, you know, P really like Laplace of D. So, right? So we don't know Laplace of D have the corresponding DK. So therefore, how we achieve this? Well, it turned out there's some kind of observation we had. So we try and compare this pressure equation of the sequence to the pressure equation of limit, right? We already know the limit. We already know the limit is smooth. So the limit, you know, V EQ or D K. So therefore, if we argue that P I and the limit in P are close, then we are fine. So how we can achieve that? Okay. So it turned out we need to bootstrap the convergence from the zero order to first order of U and first order of D to second order of D. Okay, so here we're using observation. Using observations that because the limit of blow-up limit is kind of like linear, smooth. So then we look at the difference between blob sequence and limit. In fact, they satisfy this equation, which is sort of a difference of those two equations. Then it turned out they still satisfy this so-called local energy quality. So I think that this kind of idea was appear in the Hoja's work with Sperk in livestock. Uh, in livestocks. So, you're looking at the difference of two systems and still satisfy some modified local energy quality. So, then it turns out that the right-hand side, you will see this error term convergence very nicely by using the weak strong convergence very nicely. So, then this guy, of course, we already know convergent to zero. So, therefore, the right-hand side convergent to zero tells the left-hand side convergent to zero. So, that's how we put up this convergent to zero. puts you up this conversion to second order for the H and you know for the D. So with that then we can look in the equation for the pressure then we can get this estimate. So with that then of course the final you know at the end of games you're trying to estimate the size of the exceptional set exceptional set. So it turned out here we're using some code like fractional sobler space this Subliff space, this puncture super inequality. So it tells you that how you're going to control this means or oscillation. Now, this control by this norm, okay, with this renormalized factor. So then we just say that if this guy does not go to zero, this guy will be big. So that will tell you how many points you can have and most. So that turned out to give you this post-off dimension estimate, 50 over 7. Estimate, you know, 50 or 7. Okay, so, but, but, but I should just say one more sentence: that is, if we add in these mu1 terms, basically that's kind of like, you know, mu1 terms, right? We still have local energy quality, but then this term we cannot, this, we can estimate this guy still in L1, but just in L1. So therefore, you have sequence, right? So this guy, we don't have this corresponding convergence. Corresponding convergence to the limit. So that's why the result, although I guess still be true for you have all the six terms, but at this moment, this technique, somehow we can only allow, you know, five terms. Of course, this mu one term have the highest non-linearity and the less stress. So probably this is our most. Is uh most interesting terms, so but uh we cannot do it, okay. Yeah, I think I will stop here. Yeah, thank you for your attention, yeah. Okay, thank you very much for the interesting talk. Um, we may have time for one question. Sorry, I more time than I expect. Hi, Tanya. Very interesting talk. So, what are the steady states for this problem? What are steady states? Oh, I know you're trying to construct blow up. I don't know what there is like a good, good, like, nice solution. Like, you know, in a module equal one case, we have a nice solution, right? Yeah, yeah. Canonical explain, but here, uh, Explain, but here, uh, I don't know. I guess maybe a vertex-like solution, like in the other case, maybe, yeah, maybe. But 3D, I don't know what's the concrete expression, yeah. But that's a little bit cross-sembled. Okay, in the interest of time, maybe we should move on to the next speaker, the final speaker. Oh, yeah, yeah, thank you. Yeah, I think I should take. Thank you. Yeah, I think I should. Did I stop the share screen? Right, yeah, you stopped. Yeah. And so next is Angela.
