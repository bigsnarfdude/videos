Biology of Congruent Subgroups of SLNZ. Well, thank you so much for introducing me and inviting me to speak here. I was very excited for two weeks of band conference in the Rocky Mountains in Canada, and now I'm very excitedly talking about the stuff from my apartment in Copenhagen. I'm gonna talk to you. I'm going to talk to you about the top chromology of congruent subgroups of SL and Z. And I'm happy that Jeremy Miller was already giving a talk about chromology of congruent subgroups of this arithmetic group, because a lot of the background that he was giving, I'm going to skip. I am going to hopefully introduce every term that I need properly. So if you have any questions. Any questions, uh, and if you missed Jeremy's talk, please go ahead and ask me. So, I will talk in this talk specifically about the principal level P congruent subgroups. So, this means this is the kernel of the MOT P map from SLNZ to To SLN Z mod P. And for me, P will in most cases be a prime that is at least three. I will, if I want to make a more general statement, I will state that explicitly. To get to the high cohomology of these congruent subgroups or arithmetic groups. Or arithmetic groups in general, I will invoke Borel-Serre duality. And that is that states that the high cohomology of this congruent subgroup Is isomorphic to low homology of the same convergence subgroup, but now we have twisted coefficients. And these are not, this is not even a finite dimensional module. Let me say what this is. This is the Steinberg module. And to define this, I just recall that T spilling is defined for a field F. The Teats building, the nth teets building of F is a simplicial complex. Complex and it has peace simplicities which are flags flags of subspaces of F to the N. This is also the realization of the posset of proper non-zero subspaces of F to the N. Now, this is a space and Solomon And Solomon Teets proved that this space is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of Sn minus two spheres. These are in general, you can say how many they are in terms of the In terms of the cardinality of the field, if a field is infinite, there are infinitely many of these spheres. And in particular, this means for us that the homology of this simplicial complex is indeed concentrated in the degree n minus 2, and let's say the reduced homology. And that's what the Steinberg module is. Modulus. So it's just a free Abian group on with the basis these spheres. If you were to pick some choice of spheres here. Of spheres here. And I call it, we call it a module because it's a module of gamma and p. It's more generally a module of the general linear group of F by virtue of GLN acting on these flags and thereby functorially on this homology. As a quick corollary, we see that of this Borel-Sair duality, so I introduced the Steinberg module now, we see that the homology of every congruent subgroup for I bigger than N. Well, I bigger than n choose two is just zero. Just because if we put in a negative number here, we get a number that's bigger than n choose two, and then we get negative homology, and that is plane zero. So this kind of functions as a form of Poincar√© duality. So the big question of this talk is What happens in the top comology? So, what is the cohomology in degree and choose two? Now, this question has already been answered for p equals three in the Three in the seventies by Lee and Charber. They prove that this cohomology group is isomorphic to the Steinberg module of F. F3, which maybe, as a side note, this is 3 abelian and it has the rank 3 to the n choose 2. So it grows quite fast, grows exponentially and or super exponentially, but it has this description. This description, and as we've seen in Jeremy's talk, this is in somewhat a way of saying is a representation stable. It's always the Steinberg module. Now, how would you come up with this kind of result or where do we even get a map? So maybe a general idea would be to consider the Would be to consider the map Tietz building of Q to the Tietz building of FP, where I take a subspace V and I will send it to the lattice and then. And then mod out P so I get a subspace of Fp to the N. Now this is a gamma N P equivariant map. If you consider the gamma N P action on the teeth spilling here as a subgroup of GLNQ and the trivial And the trivial action on the teeth spilling of FP This map induces then, of course, a map from From on homology And because the gamma np acts trivially on this module, this is Steinberg Fp, we can factor. We can factor this map through the co-invariance of this module. Now, this module is, this is Steinberg, and we know that the top chromology of gamma and p through Borel-Sair duality is H naught. is H naught of gamma n p Steinberg module. And that's just another way of saying the coin variance of this module. So we have a map here and we could this is the map that is the gives the isomorphism in the Lee-Sharber theorem. And we could ask, is this always an isomorphism for all p? Morphism for all P. And we can see that this is always surjective. But it doesn't take into account that Fp has less units than the integers. So it's always subjective, but not injective. Injective if P has more units than plus or minus one. So here's a better idea that was already suggested by Lee and Sharper. Take instead the Tietz building, the map from a Tietz building of Q to the quotient. Quotient. This is luckily a good map. So every simplex is being mapped to a simplex of the same dimension and so forth. So this is going to be a simplicial complex again. And this is, in a sense, so this thing is an oriented An oriented version of the TEETS building of FP a little bit more precisely, this means that it includes for each unit up to sign a copy. A copy of the teeth building. Let's say copies of subspaces. So this describes the vertices. And if you think about this as a poset of these vertices, then the poset doesn't care. Then the postet doesn't care in which copy I'm in. The posset only cares about the inclusion of vector spaces. Quickly note that then the teeth building of Q mod gamma n three is just the same as the teeth building of F3. And we also And we also, I also want to note that for all P, it's not hard to see that this is again homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres, albeit more. So, the main theorem of this talk. Of this talk is, and it's together with Jeremy Miller and Andrew Putman, is that the map that we get through the same procedure as here from the top coherent. To the pre-abian group on these spheres is again always surjective. And this is already an improvement for all primes from this more naive map. And it is injective if and only if. If p is three or five, and this is let me say, or p equals two, or n is smaller than one to make it complete, but this is really the important bit here. Important bit here. So, what does this mean? Well, first of all, we have now a new and complete calculation. Of the top homology of the congruent subgroup at level five. This computation is I want to demonstrate how in which way I we find it complete. So So this module, this on a module on the right here is free abelian of rank, let's say Tn and is and it is extremely computable. Extremely computable, and because I didn't want to spend a lot of time writing down a long formula, I put it on here already. I did some arts and crafts earlier today. So, this number can be computed with this recursive formula where you can see Tn minus 1 appearing and Tk times Tn minus K minus N minus 2. Also, aside from the prime P, we have the number. Have the number of, so we have this Grusmannian in here. So, this is the number of k-dimensional subspaces of the n minus one-dimensional FP vector space. And maybe what's also notable is that this is for p equals 3, the first bit will give you a The first bit will give you a recursive formula for a Steinberg module, and the last is for this oriented version of a Steinberg module. And I would like to add that this uses discrete Morse theory, which is a very powerful tool for Showing that things are highly connected and to show what is or also calculate certain homology groups. One could also quite easily compute this with the Euler characteristic, but it showed that this is much slower in real-life computations. For example, Jeremy already showed you T. You T15, and I believe this is around 2 times 10 to the 78. This is a big number and like it was completely computed by my MacBook Air in one second. And I was able to compute All of the first 200 teeth in one minute. So, this should be a stark difference to computing times of such groups if you invoke actual simplicial complexes like the Voronoi complex, etc. So, in that way, I So in that way, I hope you believe me that this is now in this way completely calculated. I would also like to remark that the proof actually gives us a little bit more. Namely, so here, let's see. Let's see. What I've stated, the main theorem, it only shows that the rank of this, of the top cohomology is bigger than Tn because it is surjective onto this, which has rank Tn but it's not injective for P at least. For p at least seven, and the proof actually shows that it is greater or equal to p plus two, p minus three, p minus five, p minus one divided by twenty-four times the number of two subspaces of F. subspaces of fp to the n times tn minus 2 i will get to this number in a little bit again but first i want to say that um schwerma also improved this um result shortly after um i believe um he gets He gets that this part is multiplied by two instead of one. And I understand sort of where it's coming from in his proof, but I don't know why it's not showing up in our proof. It's a bit funny. Yes, So, to give you a little bit of an illustration of the whole thing, I want to look at shortly at n equals 2 at that case. In this case, we find that the modular curve of this congruent subgroup is actually the classifying space of the congruent. Classifying space of the congruent subgroups. So you can use this space to compute the cohomology of this group. And it is a surface of genus P plus 2, P minus 3, P minus 5 over 24 with punctures. And the punctures are exactly. And the punctures are exactly given by this oriented teeth broken. So this indicates, or this implies, immediately, that the first homology, which is the top cohomology. Of gamma 2p is well, you have the cohomology comes from the genus. So that is two times the genus. And you have the cohology coming from these punctures. So, one puncture, if you only take one puncture if you only take one puncture and uh and put a loop around that that will be bounded by the rest of the um um that's not true if you take a sorry if you take a loop around all the punctures that will be bounded and so um to get to the h1 of this punctured surface you have to take the reduced homology of Tomology of this discrete set of points. And this is called the comology in the interior, and this is called the comology. At infinity, and as you can see quite clearly here that for n equals 2, for p equals 3 and p equals 5, we simply don't have any chromology in the interior. So all we get is exactly what we hoped we would get. And for a lot of For larger primes, we will get a chromology in the interior, and this default here will propagate to higher n, and that's where we get our where we get this number from. All right, I have done a little bit more arts and crafts. It's already, it's like on a slide, right? It's almost visible, but not quite. So let me denote by x and bar. The Borel Sayer fortification of the symmetric space S L N R mod S O mod S O N and this is if you mod mod out by the congruent subgroup, this will be a classifying space and so in particular we get that The top cohomology of gamma N P is isomorphic to the top cohomology of X and bar mod gamma N P now I want to give a little Now, I want to give a little bit of context maybe of how to place our result in terms of cohomology at infinity and in the interior. And for that, I will use the long exact sequence of the pair with the boundary of this fortification. So So the image of this relative homology in here, the image is called, this is exactly the chromology in the interior. And I'm not confident enough. I'm not confident enough to say number theory words like cospital cohomology or Eisenstein chromology, but I believe there is a relation between these. So I think this should be roughly the caspetal cohomology, at least if you take complex coefficients. And then I will also reveal. Also, reveal this end, maybe too much glue of the long exact sequence, and so we go to the n minus two chromology. n minus 2 cohomology of the boundary. Then we go to the n choose 2 plus 1 of relative cohomology. And then we see we get the n plus 1 cohomology of this space, which is zero, as we already see by virtue of Borel-Stair duality. Now let's look for a second at these two groups. We can apply We can apply actual Pranco-raduality to these groups. So, sorry, spaces. So, this is an actual manifold of dimension n choose 2 plus n minus 2. So we'll get through prancer duality that this is the same or isomorphic to the homology of the boundary. Of the boundary mod the congruent subgroup. And here we have a manifold with boundary. So we get through Poincare duality to the homology of the whole manifold. Now, what are these? are these what are these these are um well on this side we know this is the classifying space so we get that this is the a n minus two homology of this group that we were considering in the first place and then here i i don't say isomorphic i say there is a map and I say there is a map. And what map is this? Well, there is actually a homotopy equivalence between the boundary of the Brauser modification and the teeth building. And this is a map. I want to make sure that you realize this map, if you model. This map, if you mod out by gamma, this map is not anymore a homotopy equivalent. Otherwise, I would have made an isomorphism sign here. And I'll say this, I'll write this, let me write this down. So I want you to note that this is Is not a homotopy equivalent But we do have our map that we discussed in the main theorem here. Um let's say without reduced homology, but reduced homology is a sub Homology is a subgroup of this. And so at least if n is at least three, this map, this is surjective, as we've seen. So also this map should be surjective. But, and maybe I should have said this earlier: the image of this. Earlier, the image of this map is called the cohomology at infinity. So we see that everything we got out was actually cohomology at infinity. And in the result of Schwerma, he actually That's, I think, what he focuses on. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Now, you can I want to make two more remarks about this diagram. First is that this group is not in general zero. Yeah, I think it's often zero, or whatever often means in the beginning it's zero for n equals two, for example, but not in general. So, in particular, and not even not even rationally. So, it can have positive rank. And so, in particular, rank and so in particular we get that the that the chromology at infinity is less than actually the cohomology of the boundary mod gamma np so that's one way to see that this map here can't uh can't be an isomorphism Wait a second. What did I just say? Is that the opposite of what I wanted to say? I did not say, sorry. For p equals five, it should be then always zero. I'll get back to that later, maybe. And I should also want to mention that the cohomology in the interior. So, this image is not generally zero. Although I believe that it is zero if n is at least four. So I do have some information about the proof idea, but I believe that would take too much of my time. So I will finish by just stating a couple of more questions that one could ask about this. So, in particular, these computations could be extended to. So, one would want to expand these computations. These computations to well, we would like to actually know what is happening, what is actually happening for primes at least seven so is Is, for example, is Schrammer's bound is that sharp, and it very well might be for maybe, for example, p equals seven, but maybe not for higher primes. So there, I think there lies a lot of interesting math still and hard math. Also, completely untouched by our Investigation are composite numbers. In particular, we don't even have the surjection given in the theorem or any kind of balance in that regard. One would also like to, of course, know what happens not just in top dimension, but Not just in top dimension, but in co-dimension one. And Jeremy Miller already talked about this a little bit. And if you haven't seen his talk, I hope it's going to be on the website in due time. So there's some stability results, but also what is it exactly? And one could also ask about congruent subgroups of SLN of other of the special linear group of other number rings. So, for example, some of the methods you would need to do something similar as we've done for this result. This is for this result is already known for rings like the Gaussian integers or the Eisenstein integers. And finally, one could even go to other arithmetic groups. So, what about? Groups. So, what about congruent subgroups? I wanted to say that you should go to Jennifer Wilson's talk that is right after this one, if you're interested in other number rooms. And one could also consider congruence subgroups of other arithmetic. Other arithmetic groups, for example, the symplectic groups. And if you're interested in that, I would recommend next week's workshop. We'll have Benjamin Bruch. There I said it in German. And he will have a talk including some results. Talk including some results about the symplectic group, not about congruent subgroups, so that's further questions. But this should give you some information about where this might be headed. Thank you for your attention. Okay, let's thank the speaker. You have any questions? Have any questions? Do we have any questions? I've been trying to think through the reason, as you said, the Borel-Sar boundary has a homocratopy equivalence back to the Teeth building. And I've been trying to remember why that doesn't work in mod the various gamma of P's. The main problem is that gamma NP acts freely on this, but not on this. So really, this is a homotopy quotient where this is not. So it's a bit like asking asking why is the quotient of xn mod gamma not the same as the quotient of a point mod gamma a point mod gamma is just a point again contractible whereas xn mod gamma is not contractible anymore i think um jenny has a question uh yeah thank you peter you said that you wanted to talk about You wanted to talk about proof methods. Could you give us the like one to two minute version of the proof ingredients? If I could have, I probably would have. But just to spark a little bit of interest maybe to future conversations with anybody interested in this, let me just define something. Me, just define something. And then I'm just going to define a simplicial complex in that and this simplicial complex is a can be understood as a subcomplex. Subcomplex of the nth Vornoy complex generated by simplices in Vornoi two and most concretely, more concretely, the vertices. More concretely, the vertices are the unimodular vectors of Z to the n mod plus minus one. So this is the same as saying rank one summons. Of Z to the N and a P simplex is either I have that so this is these are vectors. So this is these are vectors, or let's say plus minus vectors in z to the n. And this is a simplex if either v naught through vp is a partial basis or can be extended to a basis of z to the n Or v0 is the same as v1 plus v2 and v1 through vp is a partial basis of z to the n and um well this um let's say Church and Putman showed that this is n minus one connected, and it's clear that it's n-dimensional. And this result gives a lot of implications about co-dimension. Codimension as well as co-dimension one information about SL and Z as well as co-dimension zero information about these congruence subgroups. But the connection to, I don't know, I don't want to introduce the Voronoi complex, and I probably use the terminology slightly wrong in this context, but anybody who's interested in those. Interested in those should also be interested in these, I think. That was more than two minutes. Sorry. Great. Any more questions? If not, why don't we thank the speaker again?
