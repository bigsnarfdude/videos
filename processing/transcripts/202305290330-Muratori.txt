Don't worry. So, thank you very much to the organizers for inviting me to give a talk to this very nice conference and venue. I'm very happy to be here. So, I will talk about a recent result obtained with Gabriel Grillo and Fabio Punto from my institution and Kazuyu Shige from the University of Tokyo. Okay, first of all, a short overview of stochastic completeness. Of stochastic completeness. What is this property on, let's say, a complete and non-compact Human manifold? So, a manifold is said to be stochastically complete if the heat kernel, which may be or not explicit, preserves probability. Okay, so for every x, the heat kernel is the integral of the heat kernel is one, it's identically one for all times. So, this function is decreasing in time. So, if it is smaller than one. If it is smaller than one for a certain time, then it will be from that time on. Just for convenience, let me recall what the heat kernel is. The heat kernel is the minimal solution, so the smallest possible solution among positive solutions, let's say, solving the heat equation and starting from a delta delta, from a yeah, delta as an initial datum center at point x. So at the end, you have two variables. So x is the point where the Have two variables. So x is the point where the delta is centered, and y is the free variable, if you want. Okay, so the mass conservation property, the probability conservation property, is in fact equivalent, you can easily check this, to the fact that one, so the constant one, is the unique bounded solution of the heat equation taking one as initial datum. Okay, but we will see in a moment that one is not a special datum. This property of unit. This property of uniqueness will hold for more general data. Anyway, before going back to the PDEs, which is more or less my comfort zone, I have to say something about stochastic processes because the property of stochastic completeness has a probability in its name. So, why is it related to stochastic processes? Well, it's not difficult to check that this property is equivalent to requiring that the To requiring that the lifetime of the Bronyan motion that starts from a given point X is plus infinity almost surely. So in other words, the trajectories of the Bronyan motion do not go up in finite time, almost surely. This is equivalent to requiring the conservation of probability. Why? Well, recall that the heat kernel is in fact the transition probability density of the Bohemian motion. So, So, now I will talk about stochastic incompleteness. I hope this will not get you confused because my talk is focused on incompleteness, so the failure of the stochastic completeness property. This means that this function, this set function, so that the function at set A associates the integral of the heat kernel on A. So, this is essentially the probability that the Bohr motion at time t is in the set A. The trajectory lies in the set A. Setting okay on stochastic incomplete rain efforts, this property fails, so this is not a probability measure, okay. And this means that the integral is less than one, so the mass is not preserved. So one minus this integral is, you can interpret this as a probability that the Berlin motion at time t has escaped at infinity. And once it has escaped, it stays at infinity. So to make it a stochastic process, you need to sort. Process you need to sort of complete it with infinity. Stochastically incomplete manifold sees infinity. There is a way to get to infinity. There are just as an example, there are several conditions of analytic and geometric nature that imply stochastic incompleteness. Just as an example, I write them down. You can find them in this very long survey paper by Grigo Orien, for example. For example, a manifold is stochastically incomplete if it is non-parabolic, so it has a green function, and the green function is in L1. Okay, this integrable. This is a sufficient condition. They are all sufficient conditions. For example, you have a curvature condition, so the sectional curvatures are bounded from above by this function, psi second, minus psi second over psi. And this function psi has the property that this integral is finite. Is finite. Morally, you can also see it from here. Morally, this means that the negative curvatures of the manifold must go to minus infinity very fast, essentially in a super quadratic way. All these conditions are not sharp, of course, as I said. They are sufficient conditions. But if you stick to modern manifolds, so symmetrically spheric manifolds for which side For which psi, once you know the function psi, you know everything. So, for example, the integral of psi to the minus one is the volume of balls, and psi to the minus one of r up to constant is the surface measure. For modern manifolds, this condition, so the fact that this integral is finite, is sharp for stochastic incompletes, only in that case. In general, this property is not. Property cannot be proved to be equivalent to geometric conditions. And let me say that there is another list of complementary conditions for stochastic completeness. For example, in terms of curvature, you can require a bound from below for the curvature. The curvature should be at most minus r squared. This is more or less the philosophy. And you also have a volume. Philosophy, and you also have volume conditions in that case. So, the volume should not grow too fast. More or less, the threshold is a squared exponential, like Juan Luis was mentioning before. So, the volume of VR bounded by a constant times the exponential to another constant times well, the distance to a fixed point squared. This is more or less the threshold in terms of. Less the threshold in terms of volume for stochastic completeness. Okay, let's go back to PDE, which is much better for me. There is a further characterization, as I was mentioning before, which you can also find. I'm not sure this is due to Gregorian, but you can find it in his book, which is the following. So, fix a parameter A, which is the parameter you find in the elliptic PDE. Fix a lifetime, capital. A lifetime, capital T, which might be finite or not, doesn't matter, and fix an initial datum, a bounded and positive. Positivity is not strictly necessary for linear products, but for convenience, I will keep it. Fix a bounded initial datum. Then all these properties are equivalent. So the manifold is stochastically incomplete. The Cauchy problem for the heat equation is badly posed, let's say. So you have at least two different solutions starting from the same. Solutions starting from the same initial data, bounded solutions, or the elliptic equation Laplace of V equals alpha V admits a non-trivial bounded solution. Zero, of course, is always a solution, so this is also a non-uniqueness result, if you want, for the dictator equation in L infinity. So our idea was to try to... So this is essentially the generalization, the second properties is the generalization of the mass conservation for general and infinity data, not just for the constants. Infinity data, not just for the constants. So, our idea was to try to generalize this kind of result, possibly, to some non-linear equations. And we consider the two equations. For that, I have to introduce two classes of real functions, which is the class C. So, functions psi, which are continuous on the positive real line, which are non-decreasing, and they are zero at zero. This is an important assumption. Zero at zero. This is an important assumption, I will mention it later, at positive for positive values, strictly positive. Another class which is a bit more restrictive is the class L, continuous functions on the real positive line, locally leap sheets away from zero, so any power, for example, is fine, and strictly increasing. So the class L is contains essentially, it's contained in the class C, except for the assumption psi zero equal to zero. Psi zero equal to zero. This is not important. And you consider these two problems. So let me write down the problems for future convenience. So we consider an elliptic equation, which is Laplace of W equals psi of W. This is the elliptic equation. And a parabolic Cauchy problem, which is time derivative of u equals the Laplacian of Pi. The Laplacian of pi of u in this is in M and this is in M times let's say zero capital T with the initial condition a given dating so this is the non-linear parabolic problem so in the class for example in the class C you have both the the polarized medium and the fast diffusion regime okay because we don't have restrictions on the power it has to be leap shifted On the power. It has to be lip shift, but away from the origin. Okay, this is the main result, the first main result concerning the elliptic equation. So we can prove that all these properties are equivalent. The manifold is stochastically incomplete. This non-linear elliptic equation admits, well, in fact, infinitely many solutions. Once you have two, you have infinitely many, trivial, bounded, and positive. Trivial, bounded, and positive. Or the last statement is just the existence of a non-negative, non-trivial, bounded sub-solution. So you have one sub-solution, you have infinitely many solutions. So as a corollary of this result, so this is the generalization. If you think of the case of the heat equation, Laplace of V equals alpha V. Alpha V is just a special linearity, linear in that case. The linear in that case. Corollary, so assume that the nonlinearity equation admits one subsolution for a special nonlinearity, then the same equation for all nonlinearities falling into this class admits infinitely many positive solutions. So you have the property for one linearity, for example, the one of the fastest diffusion, you also get it for the police medium for free, more or less, after we prove it. After we prove it. Parabolic counterparts, okay, we consider now the nonlinear parabolic problem. We fix a nonlinearity in the slightly smaller class L. We fix a lifetime which could be finite or infinite and we fix a positive initial data. Then again, we have an equivalence, so the manifold is stochastically incomplete. The Cauchy problem is badly posed. It is very badly because you have. Is very badly because it has you have infinitely many solutions, or the Cauchy problem has two solutions. If you have two, you have infinitely many. Again, a corollary in the spirit of the previous one. So assume that you are able in a way to show that for a specific nonlinearity, the one from the police medium, for a specific choice of lifetime, and for a specific initial datum, for example, zero, you're able to show that. Zero, you're able to show that uniqueness for this problem is broken. For example, because you can find a, I don't know, a subsolution which is, you start from zero, you have a subsolution which is not zero, bounded subsolution which is not zero. Okay, then the problem will be badly posed for all nonlinearities falling into that class, for all initial data, and for all lifelines. Of course, there are, I will not. There are, I will not write them, but there are equivalent results in terms of stochastic completeness. So, for stochastic completeness, things go in the right way. If you have a stochastically complete manifold, then the parabolic problem is well posed. So you have uniqueness in an infinity for all nonlinearity and all the initial data. And the nonlinear elliptic equation has only zero as a solution. Okay, on stochastically completing. Okay, on stochastically completely manifolds, just because this is an equivalent property. So, let me sketch the proof for the non-linearity equation, which, in my opinion, is not so difficult. It's essentially based on Cato's inequality. So, first of all, what is A to B? So, my manifold is stochastically incomplete. I want to show that there exists a non-trivial solution to the elliptic equation. Solution to the elliptic equation. How do I do it? Okay, first of all, I use the local boundedness of psi, because psi is a continuous function, so local is bounded. I fix the parameter A, so the parameter A will play the role of the degree of freedom we want to construct infinitely many solutions. I can find K, which is related to A, of course, in such a way that psi of W is less than KA for all W. Ka for all w between 0 and 2a. I can always do it for fixed a. Okay, first property I can observe. Thanks to stochastic incompleteness, I know that there exists, this is the Gregorian characterization, there exists a non-negative and bounded solution to this equation. Laplacian of V equals Kv. K is the previous alpha. Second thing, very important, I can choose the L infinity norm of this function as large as I like, because this is a linear problem. So, if I have a solution, I can multiply it by a constant. This is still a solution. Okay, I can make the infinity norm as large as I want. Now, I apply Cartoon's inequality. So, I take my solution V, I subtract from it essentially one half of the infinity norm, and then I take the positive part. Positive part. I apply Catus inequality, so this function w underline as a Laplacian, which is greater than the positive sign of V minus A times the Laplacian of V. This is Catus inequality. It's good because this is the positive part and the Laplacian is a function. Then the Laplacian of V is by the equation, K of V. So now I just have to understand better this right-hand side, okay? Well, Okay, well, this is a function, so k positive sine of v minus a times v. What is this function? So, this function in the region where v is larger than a, or if you want, in the region where w underline is positive, this function turns out to be larger than psi, larger than psi of w. Sorry. Why? Why is that? Well, because v is greater than a. So the positives. Than A. So the positive sign is one. So this is exactly Kv. Kv is greater than KA because V, the N-infinity norm of V is in this region. Well, V is larger than A. So in this region, V is greater than A. Ka is greater than psi. Why? Because I am in a region where, of course, V is less than 2a because it's the infinity norm. Okay? And then by using more. Okay, and then I use monotony in the last passage. So, V by construction is greater than W underline. So, this is greater than psi of W underline. This is in the region where V is greater than A. In the other region, the things are much simpler because both sides are zero, essentially, because the positive sign is zero if V is less than A. And W underland is also zero. Okay, here I'm using heavily the assumption that psi of zero is zero. Psi of zero is zero. So both sides are zero. So I have a subsolution. I have a subsolution to the elliptic equation, which is, so this W underline, which is positive, whose L infinity norm is A, a constant that I can choose as I want, essentially. Then I have to pass from a subsolution to a solution. Okay, this can be done in a more or less standard way. What you need That way, what you need in here monitor will play a crucial role. You need a local comparison principle. So, you have some solution, you want to construct the solution which stays globally bounded. This is for free because constants are always super solutions. You can put a constant above. You want the solution to be below above the sub-solution. This will make sure that W, the solution, is non-trivial. Otherwise, you can always perform. Otherwise, you can always perform this construction in which you solve the replay problems on boards, you put a constant on the boundary, but in the end, you could end up with zero because you have a decreasing sequence. But if you have a sub-solution and you have a comparison principle, then the limit solution will be above the sub-solution. So it will also be non-trivial. Again, I'm stressing that here I need monotonicity, which could be removed for some further purpose. I will discuss it later. Purpose: I will discuss it later if I manage. So, we have proved what we have proved that stochastic completeness implies the existence of non-trivial solutions to this equation. And I have a degree of freedom given by DL infinity norm. A is a free parameter, so I have, if I change A, I change the solution. The implication B to C is trivial because B is I have infinitely many solutions, C is I have at least one non-trivial solution, so this is for free. What about the next thing? For free. What about the next implication? So, to cross the implication chain, I need to prove that C plus A. So, what is C? C is I have a solution of the non-linearity equation. I want to show that the manifold is stochastically incomplete. So, I want to go back to linear equations, essentially. I use a similar argument. So, again, I, okay, my solution this time is given, so I don't know what the L-infinity norm is. I only know it is non-traditional, so it's positive. Know it is non-trivial, so it's positive. So I subtract one half of the L infinity norm and I cut it to the positive part. I use again Catus inequality. I use again Catus inequality. It's simpler actually here because again Laplacian of underline V is the positive sign of W minus C halves times the Laplacian of W. So I just have to understand better this term. So first of all, I split in the region where Of all, I split in the region where w is greater than C halves. In this region, you get that the positive sign is one. So here I have psi of w. Psi of W monotonicity is larger than C halves because I am in the region where W is greater than C halves. Okay, and I'm using monotonicity. Then I just use a trick, I multiply and divide by C half, and I observe that in this region, C. Observe that in this region, C alves, well, everywhere actually, C alves is greater than B, than underline B, because the infinity norm of underline B is one half the infinity norm of Tau. And then again, as before, both sides turn out to be zero in the region where the solution is more than one half of the electricity norm. So again, I end up with this inequality, differential inequality. Inequality, differential inequality. So Laplacian of V is larger than alpha V. For specific alpha, for a specific alpha that depends on W, and it is in particular this value. So psi of C alpha over C alpha. It's crucial, of course, that psi is positive. 0 at 0, it must be positive for positive arguments, because I want alpha to be positive. And then again, I have a subsolution, I perform the usual. Solution, I perform the usual monotone construction. I can construct a solution of the linear elliptic equation, which is bounded, positive, and that's it. And non-trivial. Non-trivial, because again, I can put below the subsolution. All right. So the monotonicity is essentially crucial to pass from subsolutions to solutions. Otherwise, in general, you cannot. And once I have a solution to the linear equation, I have stochastic incompleteness. Let's go now to the parabolic problem. And in this case, I will mention only one, the proof of one implication because the other one is far more difficult. For simplicity, I will take an infinite lifetime. This is not strictly necessary. You can make some easy modifications to adapt the proof. First important remark, and again here monotonicity plays an important role. plays an important role. So I am assuming what is E to A. I am assuming that the parabolic problem is badly posed. So I have two solutions taking the same initial detail. I'm dealing with positive solution. It's always possible to construct a minimal solution. So if I have two different solutions, I can always assume that one of them is the minimal one. So the other one, which I call the U. So if I have another one, the other one is larger. One is larger, okay? So they are order, and this is important. Then, what do I do? I just uh so the minimum one is the one you build by diligent problems on the domains, yeah, exactly. In that case, on mainfalls, you need an exhaustion. In general, if you want the smooth boundaries, they don't need to be the balls, but there is also a quite good exhaustion by regular. You're not always working with the model manifolds. No, no, I'm working with general manifolds. No, no, I'm working with general manifolds, general manifolds. So we only need that the manifold is non-compact, essentially, but apart from them, general manifolds. So the idea is just to, it's an idea that comes from the linear, curiously, from the linear framework. So you take the difference of the problems, so you have zero at the initial time, you multiply by the exponential function, so e to the minus d, and then essentially you integrate. And then essentially you integrate. So, this is the identity you get from the PDE, okay, and the product rule for differentiation. Then, you integrate this identity in time. You integrate from zero to plus infinity. In this specific case, actually, you get an identity because you have e to the minus t, the solutions are bounded. So, the term coming from integration by parts is zero, essentially. At times zero, when you integrate, you have. At time zero, when you integrate, you have zero because you have the difference of the initial data, which are the same. But in general, you get if you fix a positive time, you have an inequality. So now I have the Laplacian of the integral of the difference of the nonlinearities applied to the solutions times the exponential factor is greater than the integral of the difference of the solutions. So, in a sense, now I want to close this inequality and to do To close this inequality, and to do that, I need to find a good bound for this term. To make this term appear as a function, in some sense, of this integral. How is it possible? Well, in this case, we discovered it after a long time, I have to say, but we use a simple trick in real analysis. So, if you have a continuous function on a compact interval, for example, you take the modulus of continuity of this function. Take the modulus of continuity of this function, which is well defined, is a continuous increasing function, 0.0. The modulus of continuity, in general, if you take the best possible modulus of continuity, is not necessarily concave, but you can find another modulus of continuity, which may be larger, which is concave. You can always put a concave function above it. This is an important trick because we want to apply it to phi. It to phi. Phi is a continuous function, basically defined on the whole positive real line. So you are not on a compact interval, but your solutions are bounded. So in the end, you can restrict yourself to a bounded interval. So this is this function f, capital F, plays the role of a concave modulus of continuity. You can also make it strictly increasing, so you can invert it. So, you can invert it to apply f to the minus one. This f to the minus one, I call it psi. So, exactly the same function that appears in the elliptic problem for a reason. So, this function psi now is the inverse function of a concave function. So it is convex. Okay? And it satisfies this property. So, psi applied to the difference of the nominalities is less than v minus u, the difference of the solutions. I have in mind the Jensen's in. Uh, I have in mind the Jensen's inequality. Okay, you integrate this inequality first of all, so the integral of ψ in time of the nonlinearities is less than the integral of the difference of the solution. But this guy is exactly the one that appeared. Let me go shortly back. This is exactly this integral, okay? So I want to bound this from below by the function psi. Then I just use Jason's inequality, okay? Just use Jensen's inequality. Okay, so psi is concave. Sorry, it's convex. Psi is convex. So psi applied to the integral of the difference of the nonlinearities against the probability measure, because I have e to the minus e on the positive real line. This is less than the integral of the difference of the solutions. And this is exactly the right-hand side of the equation, of the elliptic equation. Okay? So in the end, I can close finally the PDE. The PDE, I can close the PDE and I get exactly this. Okay, the Laplace of the integral of the non-linearities and so on is greater than psi of the same thing. And this is exactly the fact that I have constructed a subsolution of a special non-linear elliptic equation. So I don't know what psi is, is constructed by the modulus of continuity and so on. I don't care. I have a subsolution of this elliptic equation, okay? This elliptic equation, okay, which by construction is strictly increasing, continuous, and zero, zero. So now I can use the elliptic result. If I know this, I know that my manifold is stochastically complete because of the elliptic characterization result. Just briefly, let me mention that in this case, it's crucial to have strict monotonicity because I am considering the difference of the non-linearity. The difference of the non-linearities. So, if the nonlinearity is not strictly monotone, how can I be sure that this difference is non-trivial? Okay, even if the solutions are different. Well, so much for the proofs. Let me just mention that the proof A to D, so the fact that the manifold is stochastically incomplete, implies that the parabolic problem is badly posed. The open strategy is still to construct. The open strategy is still to construct two solutions, and then you will have infinitely many whose infinity norm is different. This is the global strategy, but to do it's a constructive procedure, it's too long to be told. Let me, well, this is not very interesting, well it might be only for experts. The kind of solutions we deal with essentially are very weak, so we don't need much on the Don't need much on the local energy structure of solutions because we rely on very robust local comparison principles, both for the elliptic equation and for the parabolic equation. They are comparison principles proved by duality methods, okay? And they are very robust. They work for these definitions of solutions, so the very weak definitions. Weak definitions both for sub-solutions or solutions. So, the one where you multiply the equation, you integrate by parts, and you move all derivatives to the test function. So, it says this is the weakest, in some cases, the weakest possible concept of solution. What's next? Well, some comments to finish. Some comments on the on the assumptions, on the assumptions on the linearities. On the assumptions on the linearities, we have different assumptions, slightly different for psi and for phi. So, first of all, positivity, strict positivity. Why is it important that psi is strictly positive? Because zero is zero, but strictly positive as soon as you move away from zero. The answer is quite easy because if you had a zero of psi, which is away from zero, then you can take that zero as a constant solution of the ellipse. Constant solution of the elliptic equation, which is non-trivial. And this you can do it on any manifold, so regardless of stochastic incompleteness. So there's no hope to get a characterization result if it works on any manifold. Second assumption is a bit more subtle, the assumption psi of zero equal to zero. Okay, this is crucial because assume that psi of w is not zero at zero. At zero, it is increasing, so it will be locally, it will be away from zero. In this way, if you had a solution to this equation, it's not difficult to check that this is essentially equivalent to put a positive constant here, more or less. Then you can move also, you can change, you can lift the solution here as well if you want. So you can construct a bounded positive solution to this equation minus that. This equation minus delta G equals one, and this can be shown to be equivalent to the fact that the green function of the manifold, which exists just by a consequence of the existence of the solution, is L1, is globally L1, globally integral. This property, which I hope you recall in one of the first slides, implies stochastic incompleteness, this property. It implies stochastic incompleteness, but in general is stronger. This, for example, was shown in this. This, for example, was shown in this paper by Pesochi, Waleset, where they constructed, more or less explicitly, a manifold which is stochastically incomplete whose green function is not L1. So L1 green means implies stochastic incomplete, but the vice versa is not true in general. So this is a stronger property. So in order to have a characterizational result, you need to require that psi of zero is zero. There's no hope in general. Is zero. There's no hope in general on any stochastically complete manifold to get solutions of this if psi of zero is positive. You cannot do it in general. Okay, what about still commenting size, so the non-linearity of the elliptic problem? What about monotonicity again? So it plays a role, but only if you're interested in solutions, essentially. So if you want to stick with Essentially. So if you want to stick with sub-solutions, so you only consider Laplacian of V of W greater than F of W, you don't want to talk about solutions. Then essentially, you can drop monotonicity up to some further milder requirement on F. So for example, you need to ask that F changes sign around the origin, more or less, but you don't need monopolisticity. Or less, but you don't need monopolicity, then it's possible to show that stochastic incompleteness is equivalent to the fact that this elliptic inequality has a subsolution such that, so you drop sine requirements such that the supremum, if you evaluate the nonlinearity at the supremum of this subsolution, you get something strictly positive. This is related to. This is related to the fact that stochastic incompleteness, more or less, completeness, sorry, is equivalent to the fact that at infinity, where you take a sequence going to infinity, attaining the supremum, at infinity the Laplacian must go to zero on stochastically complete manifolds. On stochastically complete manifolds, this is not the case. You can have a sequence going to infinity, taking the supremum, whose appellation stays away from the supreme. Whose ablation stays away from zero, which is a bit weird because the ablation is positive, you expect a minimum, but this is possible on incomplete manifolds. This improves a little bit a result by Pigo, Arigoli and Setti, who proved several other things. It was not the main focus, but it was just a remark, okay, where they proved a similar result for a more restrictive class of, well, the statement was more restrictive. Let's say I'm not going into details. Yeah, I'm not going into details, and they proved it for C2 subsolutions. Here we just deal with very weak subsolutions. What about, to close my observations, what about the phi? So the nonlinearity of the parabolic problem. So this function phi, as I said before, is deepest away from the origin. While at the origin, it might be degenerate or singular, okay? So both fast diffusion and Singular okay, so both fast diffusion and emposuming. I need it to be locally lips because I want sorry leaps away from the origin because I want a local comparison principle, a local comparison principle for a very weak solution. And to prove that via duality, you need Lipschitz regularity away from the origin. And then I need strict monotonicity. I think I explained why I need strict monotonicity along the proof of. Along the proof of the one implication I was showing before for parabolic problems. Otherwise, I'm not sure that the integral of phi of the difference is non-trivial. Finally, well, final comment is just the fact that we improve ourselves. We proved in a previous paper similar results by assuming the concavity assumption. Tonight, the concavity assumption enter. Another concavity assumption enters only at the level of moduli of continuity. So it was only, that was not the only point where we needed concavity or convex. So phi concave and psi convex. There were many other technical points we took some years to overcome them. That's it. Thank you very much. If there are some questions on the self-improving talk, please point me. Okay, so what you try to do is try to see if the manifold has goes very far away by checking on the Brownian loss. Yes. What is the simplest example of a manifold that is incomplete? So basically incomplete. Well, you have to. Well, you have to see if some temperature assumptions are satisfied. For example, oh, you can take a model manifold, whose model function is psi of r equal at infinity e to constant r to some power a with a greater than 2. This is a typical example so you have a huge growth at infinity. You just have a great growth at infinity, and then particles. At infinity, and then particles disappear. Yeah, in finite time. They can disappear in finite time. They can disappear in finite time. So the volume of motion talks to infinity. But this can happen only along a direction, let me say. So if you want... No, in these manifolds, actually, no. On modern manifolds, it happens in any direction because you have a privileged radio direction. But on general manifolds, so that's the. Direction. But on general manifolds, stochastic incompleteness means that there is a direction which might be very, very tiny. Because you could take a manifold that has two ends. So one end is very, very large. The other one is, let's say, Euclidean. So here you have Rn. Rn is stochastically complete. So on this side, there's no way to reach infinity. On this side, there is a way, because, for example, the medium behaves like this. So that's the good. Like this. So, so that's incompleteness. Incompleteness means there is a direction, which might be very, very small, through which I'm able to join infinity. I thought another question. So, you are trying to check this behavior of the manifolds of infinity by running Bramian motion. No, I'm not trying to do that because I am dealing with non-linear PVs. This is what this is what we're going to do. Yes, yes, of course. Now, now we'll. Of course, yeah. Now, what questions you talk about, right? No, what do you do if you do ladies around? I expect it well first of all, it's an interesting problem because it's a different solution, right? Yes, so there are, I mean, maybe it's quicker, so there will be less manifolds with. Manifolds with levy comprehension. This is the theory that you change the class of manifolds. You change the class of manifolds. So yeah, through non-local processes, it should be. Am I right? You are the main expert of non-local diffusion. It should be easier to get to infinity, I guess. So I think that we have a problem that we can. I think that we have a problem that we can put as a goal problem. Find the criterion for incomplete completeness. S stochastic completeness. Yeah. This is a different, I mean this is different class. I think so. I think so. I don't know, honestly. But will you do it in one year? No. Not enough. Not enough. Definitely not enough. Definitely not enough. Questions? Answers to those questions.
