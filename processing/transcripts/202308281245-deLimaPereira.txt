The presentation. Sorry. Sorry. Can you make the picture bigger? Picture bigger. Ah, yes, yes, yes. Sorry. I don't know how to. Thank you. Okay. It's better. Okay. So I. So, I would like to thank the organizers for the invitation. It is a pleasure to participate in this event. And it is a joint work with Nono Palesteiros from Universidad de Valencia, Orepsio Camuto and Tomazela, both from Universidad Federal de Soncar. Okay, well, this presentation has six parts, and the Bruce Hobberts number is considered. Hubert's number is considered a generalization of the Mueller number of a function germ. So, first, I will talk about the Mueller number of a function germ. In second part, I will define the Bruce-Hubert number and its relative version. In the third, I will define the logarithmic variety and its relative version. And to calculate the Bruce Hubert number, we need to consider. We need to consider our doset analytic variety. Okay, so in the fourth part, I will consider an isolated hypersurface singularity, and we abbreviate by I8S. In the fifth part, we consider an isolated complete intersection singularity. And to finish, I will present an example with an all-isolated singularity. Singularity. So, first, the Muller number of a function germ. Well, we consider O. O n is the ring of analytical function germs from Cn at zero to C. And the Miller number of a function germ f is equal to the dimension as a c vector space of discourse over Jacobian ideal of f. Of F. We have the R group and it is the group of the feomorphisms in Cn. With this group, we have an equivalence relation, Ero n. So two functions germs, F and G, are equivalents when existing element in the group satisfying this condition. So the Miller number of a function germ is finite. Number of a function germ is finite if and only if f is finitely determinate, and the Mueller number of f is finite if and only if f has isolated singularity, and the Mueller number of f is the number of critical points of a morcification of f. Well, now I will define the Bruce Hobberts numbers. So, okay, so we can Okay, so we consider X, a reduced analytical variety, and to calculate the Bruce Huberts number, we consider the set of the vector fields that are tangent to x. And we denote this set by theta x. And it is the set of the elements in theta n that satisfies this condition for any element in this ideal Ix. And here the ideal Ix. And here, the ideal Ix is an ideal in O n of the function germs that vanish on x. Okay? So the Bruce-Hubert number of a function germ f with respect to x is equal to the dimension as a c vector space of this quotient of n over the ideal df theta x. This number generalizes the Mueller number. Generalizes the Mueller number of a functional germ because if we consider, oh, I changed the color. Sorry. If we consider X equal to Cn, in this case we have that theta X is equal to theta n. So the ideal df. The ideal df theta x is equal to Jacobian ideal of f. And in this particular case, we have the equality between the Bruce-Huberts number and the Mueller number of F. Okay, but in general, we have the Bruce-Huberts number of F with respect to X is higher than or equal the Miller number of F. Okay, we also have the Rx group, and it is the group of the filomorphisms in Cn that preserves the set X. And with this group, we also have an equivalence relation ern. So two functions germs, F and G, G, are Rx equivalence when exists an element in Rx satisfying this condition. This condition. So, Bruce and Hubberts, they prove that they prove the Bruce-Huberts number of f with respect to X is finite, if and only if F is RX finitely determined. And the Bruce-Huberts number can be interpreted as the codimension of the orbit of Rx through the image of F in O n. Okay, so now. Okay, so now I will define the relative Brucy-Huberts number and here we continue considering our dossiet analytical variety and the module theta x. And here the relative Bruce-Huberts number of f with respect to x is equal to the dimension as a c-vector space of this quotient, k o n over d f theta x plus the ideal. X plus the ideal IX. So the difference between the Bruce Huberts number and the relative Bruce Huberts number is this ideal here. And sometimes we denote this ideal by the f theta x with this bar. An interesting fact about the relative Bruce-Hubert number, it can be finite even when f has no isolated singularity. Isolated singularity. And we have an example. So we consider x, the isolated hypersurface singularity determined by this function. And we consider this function. So f has no isolated singularity. So the Bruce-Huberts number of f with respect to x is infinite and the Mueller number of f is also infinite. But the relative Bruce-Huberts number is finite. Bruce-Hubert's number is finite. The relative Bruce-Huberts number also can be interpreted as the codimension of the orbit of Rx through the image of F in Ox. Okay, now I will define the logarithmic Kartoishki variety and its relative diversion. Okay, but first I need to define First, I need to define the logarithmic stratification. Okay, so here x is our reduced analytic variety, and u is a neighborhood of zero. Okay, so there is a unique stratification with the following properties. Each stratum X alpha is a smooth connected immersed submanifold of U and U is And u is equal to this disjoint union. Okay? The second property: if we consider a point in the neighborhood, this point belongs in a stratum. We are supposing that x belongs x alpha. Then the tangent space to x alpha in this point coincides with With the X in the point, apply it in the point. The last property, if we consider two distinct strata, X alpha and X beta, such that X alpha meeting the closure of the X beta, then we have that X alpha is contained in the frontier of X beta. Okay? So, So, this stratification is the logarithmic stratification of X, and actually, this stratification is a stratification of the ambient space U. And when exists a neighborhood U such that the logarithmic stratification has only finitely many strata, we say that the variety is holonomic. Is holonomic. Okay, so now I will define the logarithmic character HQ variety. And again, we consider u a neighborhood of zero. And these vector fields are the generators of zero x. And L C U x is the set of the elements in the restriction of the Cotonou bundle of Cn to U that satisfy. To u that satisfies this condition with i from 1 to k and L C x is the germ of L C O X along the cotangent space to Cn. Well, the definition of L C X does not depend on the choice of the generators of theta X and the analytical structure of L C X is given by Of LCX is given by these equations. Okay, so not necessarily the analytical structure is reduced. Okay, the last point is a result proved by Bruce and Hobbes. And if X is holonomic with this logarithmic structure, so the closure of the colour male bundles are the irreducible components of. The irreducible components of LCX. So, as I said, germs we have these equalities. So, LCX is equal to this equality and as a set term. And we have this equivalence. Okay, is our relation between the Bruce-Huberts number and the logarithmic variety. So, the Bruce-Huberts number of f with respect to X. Of f with respect to x is equal to this sum with i from 0 to s, if and only if L C x is cohemable in this point. And here, ni is the number of critical points of immersification of F on X Y and Mi is the multiplicity of the corresponding irreducible component Yi of L C X. Okay, and Bruce and Hubert they prove if a variety has co-dimension higher than one, then its logarithmic characterischi variety is not cohemocolic. Okay, so now we have a question. When X is a hyper surface, is its logarithmic variety for Hema College? And it is our first question. Now, I will define the relative version of the logarithmic characteristic variety. And here, okay, we denote the by stratum x0, this stratum, the complement of x in the ambient space. Okay, and L C x minus denotes the closure of the subset of L C x obtained by. X obtained by dilating the component Y0 coming from this stratum. And as a set germ, LCX minus is equal to this onion. And we call L C X minus of the relative logarithmic characteristic variety. Okay, an interesting fact about L C X ma. Fact about L C X minus, it can be cohemical even when L C X is not cohemable. And it is the case when X is a weighted homogeneous issue. It is a result from Bruce and Hubbards. So now we have our second question. Considering X, any complete intersection, is its relative logarithmic? Is its relative logarithmic characterishki variety cohemocolic? So now we have two questions: one about hypersurfaces and other about complete intersections. We also have this equivalence for the relatives. So now the relative Bruce Hobberts number is equal to this sum with the i from 1 to s, even only if. To s even only if L C x minus is cohemical in this point. And here again, ni is the number of critical points of homersification on xy, and mi is the multiplicity of the course of the corresponding irreducible component yi of L C X. So my objective in this presentation is about these questions. These questions. Okay, so LCX is cohemacauli when x is in a hypersurface, and L C x minus is coherent Macaulay. Two questions. Is L C X minus cohema cauli when x zero is a complete intersection? And these equivalences are so important for us in our work. Okay, so okay, some albums that were. Some albers that worked with the Bruce Hobberts number, and we have Brule Jr., Ahmed Juas and Tomazela, Nuno Balesteros Oracio Camoto and Tomazela, Vivia Ausina and Juas, Corliorus, Vivia Ausina, Corliorus and Juas. So now I will consider an isolated hyperserphy singularity. First, I will consider First, I will consider a particular case, the weighted homogeneous case. So, but when x is an isolated hypersurface singularity determined by phi, we have that theta x is the set of the elements in theta n satisfying this condition. So, exist an element ero n satisfying this equality when the When x is awaited homogeneous I8S, we know the generators of theta x. In this case, theta x is generated by the Euler vector field and the minors of maximum order of this matrix. And with this characterization for the generators of theta x, none of this. Nuno Bolesters, Orezio, Camuto, and Tomasella, they prove the following relation between the Bruce-Huberts number of F with respect to weighted homogeneous I8S and the Mueller number of F. Okay, and also considering the previous result about the generators of theta x, they consider a system of coordinates in this space and they and they and so the and so LCX is determined by this ideal okay and considering this structure they prove that LCX is cohemical for any weighted homogeneous IHS okay in this way they answer the first question for the specific case when the hypers Specific case when the hypersurface is hyper, in the particular case for a weighted homogeneous hypersurface with isolated singularity. And now we want to extend these results for any isolated hypersurface singularity. Well, we know about this equality and we have a natural question. Is this equality true for any isolated hypersurface? Any isolated hypersurface singularity. And we have the following example. So we consider the hypersurface determined by this function germ, and we consider this function f. Here we calculated the Millenni and Trudina number of the hypersurface. These numbers are different, so the hypersurface is not awaited homogeneous. Is not awaited homogeneous and that previous equality is not true in this example. But here, if you plus this side, the difference between the muon or entry in a number, we have the equality. Okay, so our objective. So in this example, we have this relation between the Bruce-Huberts number of F with respect to any isolated, with respect to this. With respect to this hypersurface with isolated singularity and the minor number of L. And our objective now is to prove this equality for any isolated hypersurface singularity. Okay, this equality was conjectured during PAD of Orepso Camoto. And okay, what is our the most difficult to prove? The most difficult to prove this equality. What are the most difficult is the fact that we don't know the generators of theta x when x is any isolated hyper surface singularity. Okay? And so we consider the set of treaty of vector fields and we denote the set by theta xt and it is generated by these vector fields with j from 1 to k to n. From 1 to k to n and the vector fields that vanish the differential of a field. Okay? Well, but here we are considering an isolated hypersurface singularity. And a vector field vanish the differential of a phi if and only if we have this equality. In other words, the vector field belongs the same. belong belongs the CCG of these elements. But by hypothesis, we have that these elements form a regular sequence. So this CGG is generated by the minors of maximum order of this matrix. And in this way, we have this characterization for the elements in theta xt. And so, considering a function germ f, we have that the ideal df del xt is equal to this sum. And this ideal here is the ideal generated by the minors of maximum order of the Jacobian matrices of F and P. Okay, so our first result is this equality. So here So here we are considering x an isolated hypersurface singularity and f a function germ or x finitely determinant and we prove this relation between this dimension as a c vector space and this invariance. And as a consequence of this equality, we have this other equality. Okay and now appears the Bruce Huberts number and Appears the Bruce Huberts number and the Mueller number of F. But we have this dimension. Okay? And to conclude our objective, we need to prove that this dimension is equal to two in a number of x. It was a surprise for us because in this quotient appears the differential of f, but this dimension is equal to true in the number of f. Is equal to the number of x. And we prove this in two steps. First, we prove that this quotient does not depend on the function germ or exponentially determinant that we are considering. And after, we consider a specific function germ and we prove for this specific function germ that this dimension is equal to two in the number of x. Okay, so the first. So the first step is this theorem, okay, and we consider E, the evaluation map given by this way. So we have that E is an epimurphus, the image of theta xt is equal to df theta xt, and the kernel of this map E is a subset of theta xt. In particular, the indexed homomorphisms E bar between these quotients Between these quotients is an isomorphism. In this theorem, our most difficult is this inclusion. And to prove this inclusion, we use the following lemon. The first point is a characterization for the elements in theta Xt. Okay, because if we consider an element in theta X, we have We have it exists lambda in of n satisfying this condition. And we prove that lambda oops, and we prove that the vector field belongs to the xt if and only if this element belongs the Jacobian ideal of a field. Okay, and with this characterization, we prove if there exists a vector field in theta. A vector field in theta x satisfying this condition, then the vector field belongs theta xt. Okay, so the second part of this lemma proves this inclusion. And in this way, we have that this quotient does not depend on the function germ or x finitely determinant that we are considering. Okay um and now we consider P a generic linear projection and we prove that and we prove that this dimension as a c vector space is equal to 200 number of x. So in this way we conclude this equality okay and Corliolus also proved the same equality of us and the works are And the works are produced simultaneously, and we proves this equality with a different approach of us. Okay, well, some consequences of this equality. The first, the Bruce Huberts number is a topological invariant. And what this means? If we have two function germs, f and j, CO or X. Or x. Equivalent, we have that the Bruce Hobberts number of f with respect to x is equal to the Bruce Hobberts number of G with respect to X. Okay, and here X is an isolated hypersurface singularity, and this group is the group of homomorphisms in Cn that preserve the set X. We relate the Bruce-Huberts number of a generic linear projection with the polar multiplicity defined by Gaffney. And we also relate the Bruce-Huberts number of a generic linear projection with the Euler obstruction of X. Well, so we can write this equality this way. This way, okay, because we applied the Legrollio formula in this sum. And considering this equality and this equivalence, we prove that L C X is Kohen-Macaulay for any isolated hypersurface singularity. Okay? Okay. So in this, so now we prove the first, we prove, we answer the first question when X is an When x is an isolated hypersurface singularity, and there is no answer for the no-isolated case yet. And now I will consider an isolated complete intersection singularity. So now x is an issue determined by this map germ from Cn to CK. And in this case, theta X is X is the set of the elements in theta n satisfying this condition with a j from 1 to k. Well, again, I will consider first the weighted homogeneous case. And when x is a weighted homogeneous issue, we know the generators of theta x. In this case, theta x is generated by the Euler vector field. These vectors fields with These vector fields with i from 1 to k and j from 1 to n and the minors of maximum order of this matrix. Okay, well, so with the preview result, we have that the id of the f theta x is given by this sum. So, Bruce and Hoberts they use these. This characterization for the generators of k x when x is a weighted homogeneous isis to prove this equality. And again, we have a natural question. Is this equality true for any ISIS? And again, an example. So we consider the ISIS determined by this mapping germ, okay, and this function. Okay, and this function. Here we calculated the mule and truth in a number of the issues. These numbers are different, so the issue is not weighted homogeneous, and the previous equality is not true, okay, in this case. But again, if you equals this side, the difference between the Munar and Judina numbers, we have the equality. So now our object. So now our objective is to prove this equality considering X any ICs. So it is our objective. And again, what is the most difficult to conclude this equality? The most difficult is the fact that we don't know the generators of theta x. And again, we consider the set of trivial vector fields theta xt. Fields theta xt. And here, theta xt is generated by these vectors fields, with i from 1 to k and j from 1 to n, and the vector fields that vanish the differential of a field. Okay, when x is an i8s, we have this characterization for this module, okay? And we extend this characterization. This characterization considering x and is so this module is equal to the module given by the minors of maximum order of this matrix. And in this way, we have that theta xt is equal to this sum. Okay, is given by this way. Okay, so now we consider this exactly. This exact sequence. And this exact sequence says to us that the relative Bruce Hobberts number is equal to this dimension as a c vector space minus this other dimension. Because of the characterization of the elements in theta xt, we can apply the Lagroill formula here. So we have that the relative Bruce-Huberts number That the relative Bruce-Huberts number is equal to this sum. And here, again, we need to prove that this dimension is equal to Turina number of the ICS. And I will give an idea of this proof. And we consider this exact sequence. I is the inclusion, P bar is induced. P bar is induced by this map, and P is the projection of the J-last coordinate. And alpha bar is induced by this map. And it is the inclusion. We consider an element, you know, n, and we put it on the first coordinate. Okay, so we have that this sequence is exact, and we prove that. And we prove that the dimension as a C vector space of this guy is equal to the dimension as a C vector space of this other guy. So by exactness of this sequence, we have that the dimension as a C vector space of the kernel of alpha bar is equal to this dimension. And this dimension is equal to true in a number. Tuning a number of x. And to conclude, we prove that the kernel of alpha bar is this quotient. And in this way, we conclude this equality and we conclude our objective. Some consequences of this equality. And here again, we relate the relative Bruce Hubert. The relative Bruce-Huberts number of a generic linear projection with the polar multiplicity defined by Gaffney. And we also relate the relative Bruce-Huberts number of a generic key linear projection p with the Euler obstruction of x. Well, here again, we can apply the Legraillo formula in this sum. Okay, so the relative Bruce-Huberts number is Relative Bruce-Huberts number is equal to this difference, and we also use this equivalence to prove that LCX minus is quamacauli when x is an issue. Okay, so now we answer the second question for the isolated case, and there are no answers for this question. Answer for this question for the noise-related case yet. Okay, okay. But now I want to talk about the Bruce-Huberts number of F with respect to an issue. When X is an isolated hypersurface singularity, we know about this relation. So, a natural question for any ISIS, this equality, is true. This equality is true. And again, an example. So we consider these ICE. The ICE is determined by this map germ and this function. We calculated the Muller intruding number. So this ICE is not weighted, homogeneous. And we also calculated the Mullener number of F and the Mueller number of the fiber. The fiber and the previous equality is not true for any issue. But we want to know about the relation between the Bruce-Huberts number and the Mueller number of f when X is an issue. And again, we consider the set of trivial vector fields, theta XT. And our And and our first relation for the Bruce Huberts number of f with respect to x is equal to this sum. And this equality is not so good because we have this quotient and this other quotient. So we need to improve these dimensions. Okay, and first I will consider this guy. Well, if he Well, if we consider p a generic linear projection, we have that the ideal dp theta x is equal to dp theta x plus Ix and dp theta xt is equal to dp theta xt plus Ix. So we have for a generic linear projection that this dimension as a c vector space is equal to Space is equal to two in a number of x. Okay, so now to conclude that this dimension is equal to two in the number of x for any function j per x finite determinant that we are considering, we need to prove that this quotient does not depend on the function j. Okay, and again, we prove this theorem now considering. Theorem now considering x and is okay. So, e the evaluation map, e is an epigramphis, the image of theta xt is equal to the f theta xt, and the kernel of E is a subset of theta xt. In particular, the endoset homomorphism is an isomorphism. And here again, our most difficult is to prove this inclusion and to prove. This inclusion. And to prove this inclusion, we also use the following lemma. Remember that here, C is a map from Cn to CK. Okay, so if we consider a vector field in theta x, we have that the differential of phi applied in this vector field belong this guy, okay? Ix times O and K. X times O and Q. And we prove that the vector field is trivial if and only if the differential of a phi applied in the vector field belong I x times image differential of a phi. So here we have a characterization for the elements in theta xt. And with this characterization, we prove the second point. We prove the second point of this lemma. Case of if it exists an element in theta x such that the vector field vanish, the differential of f, then the vector field belongs to the xt. So, okay, actually, we prove a result more general. We prove this proposition. Okay, we prove. Okay, we prove if we consider a vector field in theta x such that the differential of f applied in the Euler vector field belongs to the ideal Ix, then the vector field belongs theta xt. In particular, we have the second point of this length. So in this way, So, in this way, we have that this quotient does not depend on the function germ or x finitely determinant that we are considering. And now we have the second equality. Okay, so now we need to improve the first dimension. Okay, the dimension. Okay, we have this result, and this result is a consequence of the proof of this proposition. Okay, and it says to us the following. If we consider X and Is determined by this mapping germ, and F a function germ for X finitely determined, if we If we consider if there exists a vector field in theta x satisfying this condition, we have that this element belongs this module. And we also have these isomorphisms. But this quotient appears here. So now I can change this quotient by Okay, this quotient by this other quotient. Okay? Okay, and now we consider a relation between the Bruce-Huberts number of F with respect an ISIS, X, and the Mueller number of F. And here we use the following exact sequence, and it says to us that this dimension as a C vector space is As a C vector space is equal to this sum, and we know that this quotient is isomorphic, this other quotient. And the dimension as a C vector space of this guy is equal to the Mueller number of F minus this dimension as a C vector space. Okay? Okay. Okay, we know, we also know that this quotient is isomark, the first part between these quotients. And in this way, we have this equivalence equal. Okay? And I present the second one because when k is equal to 2, we prove that this dimension in this case. In this case, is equal to two times the dimension as a C vector space of O n over Jacobian ideal of f plus ix. And in this particular case, we have that this relation between the Bruce-Huberts number of f with respect to x and the Müller number of f. Okay, okay, and we have the following conjecture considering x and is determined by this mapping germ from Cn to CK. So the Bruce Huberts number of F with respect to X is equal to this sum plus this dimension. This equality generalizes the case when X is an isolated hypersurface singularity. Surface singularity because in this case k is equal to one and here is equal to zero. Okay, and to conclude this conjecture, we need to prove that this dimension as a c vector space is equal to k times the dimension as a c vector space of O n over Jacobian itel. Over Jacobian ideal of f plus ix. Okay, well now I will give an example with no isolated singularity. And so here I consider x a variety, okay, such that i is generated by these these functions and I will. And I will consider this map germ from Cn plus T to CK. Observe that this map germ depends only the n first coordinates. And I will consider x tilde, the variety determined by this map germ. So x tilde has no isolated singularity and And theta x tilde in this case is given by this way. Here we are considering theta x included in theta n plus t. We complete the t-last coordinates with the zeros. And with this characterization for theta x tilde, we have this. This result. Okay, so LCX tilde is equal to L C x times Ct and if L C x is cohemical, then L C x tilde is also cohemical. We also have this result for the relative. So L C x tilde relative is equal to L C x relative. Relative times Ct and if L C x minus is cohemical then L C x tilde minus is also cohemical. Well now I will consider this function germ capital F okay and capital F is equal to H1 plus H2 and H1 depends on the depends only the n first coordinates and 82 depends only the t lasts coordinate. Okay, we know it is a result from Sebastiani and Tom that the Mullen number of capital F is equal to the Mullen number of H1 times the Mullen number of H2. And we prove a similar result for the Bruce Hubberts number. number. So we prove if the Bruce Huberts number of capital F with respect to X cube is finite, if and only if both these numbers are finite and we also prove this relation between these numbers. Okay, actually to prove this result we prove a more general result. We prove this theory. We prove this theorem. Okay, so here we consider I and J, two ideals in O n, and I is generated by Fi with I from 1 to L and J is generated by G with I from 1 to S. Okay, and we are supposing that Fi depends only the thith versus coordinates for all i. I okay and gi depends only then only of n minus t lasts coordinates, okay, for all i. In this way, we may identify the ideal i with i prime in all t and the ideal j with j prime in all n minus t. And in these conditions, we prove And in these conditions, we prove that this dimension as a C vector space is finite if and only if both these dimensions are finite. And we have this relation between these dimensions. So as a consequence of this theorem, we have this result. Well, some references that I cited during this That I sitted during this presentation. Marje, our counts, we use the software singler to make the counts, okay? Make the calculations. Well, more references. And thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much, Barbara. Thank you very much, Barbara. Is there any question here? Yeah. Thank you very much for this nice exposition. So to be a coin-Macaulay means that the variety is almost smooth. So in the theorems, that the conclusion was that it's Cohen-Macaulay. Was that it's Cohen Macaulay in some cases it is smooth? And if you have singularities, what kind of singularities and why are the singularities involved? Can you have some idea? No, it is an interesting question. It is important to know about LCX is or no cohemacoli because if these varieties are cohemical, it implies us our subjects. As a consequence of this result, is the conservation of multiplicity of the Bruce-Huberts numbers with the respective logarithmic artistic variety. And I think recently, Nono Palestero and I don't remember the other and Other and his students proves a relation between the logarithmic cartridge variety is cohemable and the Mons conjectural. So it is important. I don't know if I answer your question. I answer your question or no. Well, I don't know if you answered my question or not. not know but you know i it was a very nice talk and very informative and particularly for me i have to do some reading about what you mentioned but i but i mean the conclusion that something is coin macaulay for me is that it's almost smooth uh so in that sense uh one would wonder if under some cases it would really be smooth not only coin macaulay and if if And if it is singular, why are the singularities appear? Why is it not smooth? I mean, you're saying it's Coin Macaulay, you're saying it's almost smooth. So one could wonder why is it not smooth or which kind of singularities appear? It's just a generic question. But anyway, thank you very much. Thank you. Is there any question yet? Hi, Barbara. Thank you for the nice question. A nice talk. I'm sorry. You said that from your formula, when X is a hypersurface, from your formula for the Bruce-Roberts number, it's possible to conclude that the Bruce-Roberts number is a topological invariant, right? But in your expression, But in your expression of the formula, it appears the Turin number of F, which is not topological invariant. So I didn't understand how did you get this conclusion, right? Yes, it is because the X is the hyper surface and I think about the functions. Yes. Okay, so if the two functions are C over X equivalents, That's equivalence. So we have the equality between the Bruce Hobberts number. I answered. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Sure. I also keep it. And Jechirino number is the same. Yes. Okay. More questions? No? Online? Is there any question? No? Well, thank you, Barbara. Well, thank you, Barbara. Your nice talk left us a lot of things to think about. So thank you very much. We continue after launch.
