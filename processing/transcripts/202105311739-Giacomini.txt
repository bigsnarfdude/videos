Okay, so maybe we can start. So, I would ask each of you to tell us in 30 seconds to one minute to put your work in a broader picture and or to tell us what you think the next most important thing in your field and your research is. And maybe we can start with Fabio, who has. And maybe we can start with Fabio, who has a limited amount of time. Yes, so the broader picture is the context of combining quantum mechanics with general relativity. So I think the significance of the work is to try to pin down some there is some bad feedback. Okay. So the significance is that there is in general. There is, in general, some lack of clarity foundationally how to make operational sense of the combination of all these things, background independence, causal structure, and quantum probabilities. And I think my work really goes in that direction. So it helps clarify foundationally how these things can really stay together without contradiction. The next steps, as I mentioned, I think the most interesting is to think about, so I remind what I was. So, I remember remind what I was talking about was background independence in quantum causal structure. So, I try to understand how you can define quantum causal structure without any reference to a given background space-time. The next step, so the technical part was invariance under permutations. The next step I would like to consider is invariance under quantum Quantum change of coordinates. That's the part I all catched, and that's a very, very open question. It's not really clear how to define, apart from some particular examples, how to fully characterize superpositions of coordinate transformations. And going even forward, of course, it would be nice to match this conceptual work with more hands-on work on actual theories of quantum gravity. Yes, thank you. And then maybe, Laura, do you want to tell us something? Sure. I think, well, part of it is, I mean, this discussion that we just had about how this indefinite causal order reduces noise and a way of interpreting it. And that sort of goes into a question. Of goes into a question I had brought up during sort of the conclusions is this notion of superpositions of ordering. I don't know, it may be obvious to all of you who have thought of it, but to me, looking at these results and going through this, I realized how little I understand what a superposition actually means and how does this indefinite ordering or how to, you know, in what Or, how to, you know, in one branch of the superposition, there's a certain interaction, but there's definitely you know cross-terms that show up. And I don't know, I think there's some at least philosophical questions to be asked there. Yes, thank you. And Andrew? Look, I agree with what both Fabio and Laura said there. I think there's a couple of different paths to go forward, and building off of what Tim And building off of what Tim said and Laura said about this, still kind of fundamental questions on how do we interpret this? Can we relate it to other things that we already know well, like entanglement? Most of the theory, but not all of the theory I've seen so far on a definite causal order has been just the case of two operations or two paths. And so one of the very interesting things for me is we know that as you go from, say, Bell state to GHZ or W states, you get different capabilities. What will happen theoretically as we go forward with different As we go forward with different multi-part superpositions or in definite causal order. And then experimentally, of course, we now have a new hammer, and so everything starts to look like a nail. So we're going to whack away on a bunch of things with this to see what we can find out. So it's a really, it's quite a fun piece of physics we've all kind of stumbled into. Oh, ignore that. That's sunlight. Sorry. Sorry, yeah, uh, so thanks a lot, and so uh, it seems, yeah, it seems that we are going into two different so there is a fundamental reason for indefinite causality and a more applicative reason. And I think that this is a very good starting point for a discussion. And Rob already has a question, yeah, right. Well, Andrew, partly. Yeah, right. Well, Andrew partly stole what I was going to ask. What about ABC or BCA or ACB in terms of causal order? I mean, there's always two questions. Has anybody really worked on the theory and how feasible is this experimentally? Yes, there is both theory and experiment. Here, there are a couple of works with theory branchard and a lot of colleagues, where we explored multipartite both causal correlations in the process matrix formalism. Experimentally, there is a work, I forgot, I will post it in the chat. There is some work with, I think, goes up to four. So, maybe one note: the work on computational advantage. Work on computational advantage is kind of natively multipartite in the sense there was the first work by Giulio Kiribella on showing advantage in distinguishing commuting anti-commuting operations. So that's a task. If you want to turn that into a computational advantage, you have to scale it up. And so that's defined for a switch that involves n parties, but n becomes relatively large. And yeah, I think there is. And yeah, I think there are other works and advantages on multipartite. There are very interesting things by the group in Switzerland on things you can even have classical indefinite causal order, which is very confusing when you go to three and up parties. Yeah, there is a lot of work in that area, so I will not try to summarize it all here. We've got time, have we? You want to give another talk? You want to give another talk, Javier? No, better not. Lucien. Yeah, when I was thinking about indefinite causal structure, which is so many years ago, I had a sort of a broader idea, which was that you might have things like superpositions of space-like and time-like. Space-like and time-like. So the indefinite causal order is sort of a superposition of A before B plus B before A, something like that. And this morning, Julio mentioned something that also went beyond this. So the question is, does anyone have ideas of how you might explore notions of indefinite causal structure which go beyond simply thinking about indefinite causal order? Yes, again, there is work by Charles Lov and Adrian Fakes on that. So, this one I think I have directly. Actually, there is more work on that. There is work by Rob Speckens and Katya Rider and other people, which is phrased slightly different, specifically about the way Lucien asked. I think this work by Fakes and Bruckner is particularly Is particularly of the type, so you can do. I mean, the simplest thing you can do is the same you do as with the switch. You have a control system, and depending on the control, you have a space-like or time-like. Interesting thing, in the case of a space-like and time-like, you can do away with the control. So you can have such a superposition without the control. Why for the causal order, you cannot really do that. So, there is a I have a paper on that, but yeah, so there is a I will point to this paper in the chat for um uh one. One example of superposing space-like and time-like. I mean, the question is: are there other applications, so speeding up, or any hint about something which takes advantage of this kind of anything like this, Fabio? Yeah, so this I'm not entirely sure. So there is the work by Speckens and Katieri that claims some advantage in identifying and discovering causal structure. Now, I don't remember exactly. That's true, yeah. Of course, yes. That's true, yeah. Of course, yes, but it's not now. The the thing that is uh makes the thing a little unclear is that from the point of view of information theory, a superposition of a space-like and time-like means a superposition between a non-signaling and the signaling channel. And that boils down to having just a signaling channel. So, in a way, it doesn't give us anything that is in a way fundamentally new from the point of view of quantum circuit or quantum computation, is a type of quantum circuit. Quantum computation is a type of quantum circuit, and I apologize for the birds that are being very loud. So we can barely hear. Okay, yeah, good, good screen filter from Zoom. So for that reason, I think the talking about advantage is a bit unclear because maybe it's not so easy to distinguish to frame it in the right way. In the sense you can phrase those type of situations using your ordinary quantity. But yeah, so maybe there is more to look at there. Is it true that those two things are equivalent? That a superposition of no signaling and signaling is equivalent to signaling? Or do you still pick up some sort of cross terms through the two branches? Well, you do pick up cross-terms in the sense you can analyze things in that way. It's just that in the case of something like the switch or in general indefinite causal order. The switch, or in general, in definite causal order, you have a situation that you cannot formalize even using a quantum circuit with definite order. While in the case of a space like non-signaling, signaling, this is a sort of ordinary channel. So, even though you can analyze, you can interpret it in that way, in a way you are not forced to. This is one of a kind of ordinary type of channel that is perfectly valid and well understood using ordinary. Valid and well understood using ordinary quantum circuits. But yes, you can still, within quantum circuits, you can still identify those superposition terms. And yes, if you can make the right type of comparison, so classify your quantum circuits in the right way, I guess you can come up with some tasks for which that gives some interesting advantage. Thank you. And Julio? Yeah, I have a small clarification about two of the things that have been mentioned. So, regarding the question of Lucien of the advantage of different type of causal structures, I think, I mean, this is a very interesting question. And the work by Rob and co-authors actually doesn't really fully, I mean, doesn't really address that point, because what they show is an advantage of quantum strategies versus Of quantum strategies versus classical strategies in distinguishing the causal structure is not that this superposition plays out as a benefit there. It's the problem that they try to solve. It's more like doing a tomography of that superposition. So I think there is room actually for looking into the question that Lucien was posing. And this would be an original work that, as far as I know, has not been done by anyone before. Second, about the advantages of multiple order, as just. The advantages of multiple order, I just wanted to add a little small result that may be interesting here. Like, in the same way as Andrew showed that we can improve the communication by combining two noisy, completely noisy channel in a superposition of orders, a curious result that we found quite recently was that if you combine many, many completely noisy channels in a superposition of cyclic orders, when the many Borders. When the main is sufficiently enough, we can even transmit quantum communication, which is something that I found surprising because, I mean, it was fine to do it with classical communication, but the fact that we could even send the state of a quantum bit through a completely noisy channel was something that I found kind of somehow unexpected. So, yes, these were the two little comments that I wanted to contribute to the discussion. Thank you very much. Does anybody want to reply to these comments? No, I just want to say I agree with Julio about with the comment on Rob's work, which is really about finding a problem about causal discrimination that is, yeah. So I agree that it's not an advantage in the same sense as the other type of advantages. And yeah, there is definitely room for some interesting work. Thanks. So, maybe a question that I have, and for all of you, but also for the panelists, but it's actually for everybody, for everybody who would like to give an answer, is what about going beyond the quantum superposition of causal orders? Because that's basically all we can do now. But especially like what Fabio talked about today made me think that what if Think that well, if we want to go towards general relativity and to like to have really a space-time, well, not a space-time because we don't want to use space-time, but a description of quantum processes which goes more towards quantum gravity. Then maybe at some point the superposition principle breaks down. And then, well, it would be interesting to see what this means fundamentally, and also if this has. Also, if this has some potential implications for advantages, and also if something like that could be realized experimentally with some trick. I don't know. So no one wants to answer. So I think I've been able to get it. Sorry, Fabio. Okay. No, yeah, I can make a short comment about superposition principle breaking down. I guess there are different ways I can interpret that. One will be so one that I think I can say something about is that, yes, so we say colloquially, we talk about superposition of causal order and superposition of processes. However, most of the examples, so those that, for example, with So, those that, for example, with the quantum switch, what's going on really is quantum control or correlations between something we call a control system and order of events or something else. So, this is something that seems to be a universal possibility, at least theoretically. But superposition of processes is such, so if you don't have the control system, it is more restricted. So, I have a work on that. So, in that sense, the superposition principle does not apply universally. Position principle does not apply universally to all kinds of things and not to all processes and not to causal structures as such, unless you interpret it in that way as adding a control. I guess the second way one could interpret the possible limitations of the superposition principle is thinking if really the quantum formalism as such starts to break down. So, even not just conceptually thinking about superposition, but really the description of things using operators and states and so on, if that at some point has. And so on, if that at some point has to break down. And so I don't know about that. Of course, there are a lot of speculations. Most of the work I know is based on the idea that somehow you have to preserve classical space-time, that somehow it has to win, and then you will have some coherence. I personally don't think that's a very prominent direction, although certainly worth considering. However, yeah, so it is possible that one might have It is possible that one might have to revise the quantum formalism itself. So, one possible hint, at least from my very limited work on that, is what I was mentioning about at the very end when I was talking about this super selection rule that emerges when you talk about invariant processes, where the individual terms are not valid processes. That seems to hint at some. Seems to hint at some kind of fundamental tension because, on one hand, we would expect that you should be able to talk about, say, a symmetric process that lives entirely in the symmetric space. But then, if you try to apply the quantum rules by the book, then it somehow doesn't work out. So, that's a very small indication that, besides any consideration about classical spacetime or anything like that, that there might be a tension there. And, Flaminia, to answer. And Flaminia, to answer the question on: Could you think of an experimental technique? Leading on from Philip's talk last night, where he was just looking at the superposition of photons, probably going to be a negative result when they built it. It'll be very beautiful. It'll set some lower limit. But if you had two of those and then you were to set them in indefinite causal order, you might get a more sensitive probe or at least a different probe of the superposition principle. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, to answer to Fabio, I I meant the control superposition of Cozalerts. Lucien, you want to say something? Yeah, so there's a sort of general question: you know, how do you know where you are? And I asked one of my daughters this question when they were much younger, and she thought. Much younger, and she thought about it for a little while. She said, I look and see what's around me. And I think that's the right answer. The way you know where you are is by looking and seeing what's around you. And so I think this has a bearing on the different talks here. So in the case of Fabio, the way you knew where you were was by looking at a reference frame. Whereas in the other talks, it was the way you knew where you were by looking at the pieces of experimental apparatus that told you what was meant to be happening, so to speak, at a given, what was supposed to be regarded as the same event in some sense. And so that's just a sort of general question that I think is worth discussing. So in your case, Fabio, a sort of criticism of the reference frame point of view is that typically we don't have a reference That typically we don't have a reference frame around us. We make do with the stuff that's around us rather than sort of actually laying down the reference frame. Like, if I look around this room, I kind of know, I can identify different points just by looking at what they're next to without actually specifically saying that one object is the reference frame. And so I wonder if you sort of might comment on that from the perspective of your talk. perspective of your talk. Yeah, actually I fully agree. And my work in fact, so the reference frame is only one aspect that if you want to recover definite causal structure, then you introduce the reference frame, but you don't have to. So the whole point is to construct a formalism that is invariant under permutation and we can do it. And there is in the general framework you have these systems, these events, potential events, and there is no distinction of what is a reference frame and what not. Of what is a reference frame and what not. The point is that it's important to know how to recover the description relative to a background reference frame because that's a description we do use. So we have a situation where we say, well, there is Alice that sends a signal to Bob or Bob to Alice. And we want to be able to describe those things because these are operationally very meaningful and things that somehow we think exist and are part of reality. So the reference frame is only useful. So, the reference frame is only useful if you want to recover that picture, but it's not fundamental. So, fundamentally, the framework will have this general description of processes that are invariant under permutations, and the systems that make up those processes are completely oblivious to whether they are systems or reference frame. They don't care about that. Okay, good, good. Does anybody have any other questions or comments? Yes, Tim. Maybe just coming back to the point of advantage coming from different causal orders and different structures, I think it's very important to. To make sure we're counting resources correctly in these situations. So when we have these control switches, as we were sort of discussing with Laura, that switch, that control qubit, if you're distributing it over different locations, is going to be entangled itself. So you're kind of granting yourself an additional. An additional resource, which, so when you when you're you know thinking about how is this an advantage, I guess you need to take into account these sorts of things. Not exactly sure how, but yeah, I don't know how to you know take it into account more than at least in this situation. Least in this situation, my situation, more than we already did. I mean, it's entirely possible that there's something happen. I mean, the control being there is what gives you the advantage, but it's not directly coming from it. So how do you draw that line? Yeah, I guess it reminds me of things like hyper-entanglement, where the system is entangled in two different degrees of freedom at the same time, and you can get advantages through that. And you can get advantages through that. Maybe there's something like that going on. But that sounds plausible. So, Tim, when you say it's entangled, do you mean in the sense of, you know, a single photon after a beam splitter is entangled? Well, I mean, it depends how you're doing it, but I guess the picture will. The picture was that we have a control that is, you know, either switching one on later and the other one on earlier, or vice versa. So physically, there would have to be some degree of freedom or an actual qubit that was itself entangled, which could then mediate that switching. So, I guess I'm not saying. So, I guess I'm not seeing why that has to be itself entangled. If we think about the experiment we did, the polarization qubit is just a superposition. It's not entangled, it's separable from the other degree of freedom. In your switching experiment. I mean, it isn't tangled in the sense that a single photon after a beam splitter is definitely in an entangled state. So, in that sense, yes. I was thinking more of Laura's thought experiment, rather. Laura's thought experiment rather than the quantum switch. But I mean, when you start talking about using quantum switches in teleportation protocols and things, then I would think you have to be careful that you haven't like added another source of entanglement or something to the back or something like that. So, I guess I'm just saying, I think this needs you need to be careful about quantifying these. About quantifying these things when you get advantages. If others haven't got a question, then maybe just to Andrew, again, so you were describing the advantage of the quantum switch sort of in terms of cancelling of interference between noise terms, because you're basically sampling the same noise in the two paths. In the two paths. Yes, yeah. And you're assuming that during your AB or BA time, the noise hasn't changed. So the noise is slow compared to your transit time. So that makes you wonder whether there is a classical version of this? So that's what Philip Volta and his group. Yeah, that's what Philip Volta and his group did. They had a paper that came out beginning of this year. A paper that came out beginning of this year, very comprehensively looked at the classical version and the three different quantum versions I showed on that second or third last slide. And they found that the version that I showed there was the optimal version in terms of being able to send information through. I wish Philip was on the call. He could go into more detail on this. But yeah, the classical version has a hard boundary. And then similarly, actually, with Jeff Pride's work with Jem A. Pen. With Jem A Pan, they had a different classical protocol where once you got above a certain dimension, you picked up an advantage that you just couldn't get. I think that was 11 dimensions or something like that. Okay, thanks. Thanks, Tim. Anybody has questions? Students, especially. We haven't had a single question from students. Be brave. I might be asleep. Who knows? It's only 8 p.m. here. It's 10 o'clock here. My students don't often get in till midday. Okay, maybe I have kind of a fun question. What's the next thing we're going to put in a superposition? So, causal order is interesting, right? I mean, we have this classical notion of it. We put it, you know, we ask these quantum questions about it. So, what's the next cool thing we're going to put in superposition? Theoretically or experimentally? Like concept? I think there's work being done on putting space-times in superposition. Position, at least in the entanglement harvesting scheme. So, yeah, space-times themselves, backgrounds. And following up on that, I mean, entanglement is a superposition of superpositions. So you could nest these switches. You can look out for temperature. Hopefully, that could come out soon. That's true. I mean, there is a finished draft apart from supervisor having to sign it off. So maybe a bit more to the point. So as I was mentioning, the type of superposition we are talking about here, which is having a controller for some whatever parameter or thing or process, I will say that's completely universal. Universe, but whatever funny thought that passes through your mind, and another thought, you can put a control system that is correlated with one or the other, and then you put the control system in superposition. I will say that as long as the quantum mechanics doesn't break down, that's absolutely universal. It's a different story if you want to do things without the control. I think that's also interesting. What can you do with where uh you can genuinely put things in position without relying with the data system? So that that's harder. It's harder. And the experiments for that are much harder, too. As Fabio will recall, that's where we started many years ago. We looked at it like, oh no. But we might go back there. Yeah. Yeah, thanks. I think this was a very nice remark. And now our time is off, actually. And it was a good point where to go. A good point where to conclude the discussion. And I would like to thank you all for participating and contributing. And I'd like to thank the organizers for the chance to come. This was a great session. Thank you. Thank you. This is very well done. Sorry, before everyone goes, thank you. Sorry about that. Can everyone put their screen? I'm going to take another shot because the last one, another picture, I showed up. I forgot to put myself. I forgot to put myself out of the camera and I am in the picture and I am not supposed to be in the picture. So, if you guys can just put your camera back on, you need an antennas as well. I have to unspot you. Remove spotlight. Please, for the love of God. Okay. Okay, everyone is there. Okay. I think. I think I got this one right. Sorry about that, guys. Okay. Oh, okay. You showed up. Hold on. Hi, Sylvan. Perfect.
