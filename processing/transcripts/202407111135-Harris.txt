Projects I've done during my PhD, which is about the head button. And the idea is that I'm going to take you through sort of the work we've done, and then sort of toward the end, we'll sort of link it into some of the other topics and looping network scenarios that you see during the conference. So that's the outlook. So we're going to be looking at these guys today. So over here on the left, we've got the Emperor Penguin, and over here on the right, we've got videos of king penguins, just one with them on that. Just bothering them on that. And one of the important things about these is they've got no fixed nests. So these penguins are free to move about wherever they want. They just take their young with them on their little flips there. And as you can see, they're very fluffy. And they need to be very fluffy and feathery because both of these species live in Antarctic regions where it can get very cold. But sometimes just their layers of feathers aren't quite enough. And that goes onto the problem we're looking at today. So, in cases of strong winds and blizzards, what we see is that the penguins all huddle together for warmth, essentially. And this is a video in the top right there, which I'll play now. Obviously, this is a sped-up video, but they're not going that fast. But what we notice is the huddle doesn't just sort of stay in the middle there. Over time, this huddle is sort of propagating up and to the right, top right of the. To the right, top right of the video screen. And so the question is: why is it doing this? And how does it do this? So we suspect these sort of huddling phenomena, they're to do with heat conservation, right? So we sort of consider the heat processes going on in this scenario. The first one is the wind itself. It's a very cold wind, so it's cooling down all of the members of the penguin hub, which penguins don't like. And then you've got the penguins. They're doing two things, they're generating their own. Two things. They're generating their own heat through metabolism. But we also see that the penguins in the huddle are constantly reorganizing themselves within the huddle to try and help spread the heat out. So they're quite nice like that. They reorganise themselves in the huddle. So it's these two sort of heat transfer mechanisms which are at play here, and that's probably we suspect is what's causing this hubble to propagate. And so that's the goal, is can we model this hubble propagation? And in particular, we use a continuum model here. And in particular, we use a continuum model here. So we could do a discrete model where we track each penguin individually. And a similar model was actually done in 2012. But because we're thinking of the collective motion of the penguin model, we're going to treat it as a continuous blob of penguins and see how that blob moves over time, essentially. So let's start setting up the model. Now, there's a lot going on here, but we'll sort of take it through slowly. So on the left, we've got this sort of mathematical diagram. Sort of mathematical diagram of what's going on with sort of a real-world analogue over here on the right. So we identify two regions. There's the region R, which is our interior Huddle region, that's where all the penguins are. And then you've got the wind region, this exterior omega where there are no penguins at all. And we're interested in the Huddle boundary gamma, which is this closed curve, and in particular, its normal velocity Vm, because if you can find the velocity at the Huddle boundary, The velocity of the huddle boundary, you can then see how the pigment huddle moves. And obviously, this boundary is free to move wherever it wants, thus, we have the free boundary problem. And obviously, we're going to be looking at the temperatures. So, we denote the interior and the exterior temperatures, exterior, interior. This is all made non-dimensional, it's all non-dimensional here. But just a quick note that the hottest temperature in the centre of the hub can get very hot in the centre, so up to about 37 degrees Celsius, which can actually cause pain. Which can actually cause penguins to overheat. So, this is another reason why the penguins want to reorganise their position in the huddle because in the centre it's far too hot for them. And we make a few assumptions. We assume our huddle is sufficiently large, such that we can treat our problems 2D, which is always nice. And we assume we have a tight huddle such that no wind is flowing into our huddle region. So the wind is exclusively in the exterior region. And then we've got a couple of other assumptions here, but the other important one is that we're assuming no penguins leave or join the huddle once this huddle has. Leave or join the huddle once this huddle has started. Why is the temperature constant? That is an assumption we make. We're assuming the temperature is constant. In reality, yes, probably members that are facing the wind. Yeah, for the purposes of this model, you've got sort of large temperature variation between the far-filled wind and the centre. So for us, we've just fixed it as a consequence. Can you think about it in that way that we need to call it? Yeah, you think on average it would sort of end up such that the temperature on the boundary ends up as constantly. Yeah, yeah, because they're going to be sort of moving along this boundary anyway as well. But yeah, you're right, it is an assumption that we make. We're not shying from that at all. Yeah. So let's look a bit more at this huddle boundary because that's what we're interested in, really. And immediately we can create an equation for our normal. Create an equation for our non-velocity. And we've got some quantities and parameters that are going to be popping up along the way down here. And this is a modelling assumption. We've sort of just created this equation. But the three terms on the right are actually the three effects that we sort of want to see in our model. So this first effect here involves the exterior temperature, T omega. So this term represents the exterior cooling by the wind. It creates that effect. Similarly, the second term represents the wind. Similarly, the second term represents the heating and the reorganization of the pigments. And then the last term on the end there, term number three, that's just an area conservation term. Again, with our assumption that no pigments are leaving or joining with the Hubble. And this is simple enough to solve, and just to sort of finish off our Hubble boundary, we've put on some suitable boundary conditions as well. And you'll notice there are two parameters here. We've got the Peclet number, PE, and this beta. The Peclet number sort of represents the strength of the wind, so that's the strength of. Represents the strength of the wind, so that's the strength of this first effect. And beta, we call it the sort of penguin heating parameter, represents the strength of this second effect here. But as you can see, essentially, we want to solve equation number one. We're going to have to solve for exterior and interior temperatures, so we've got to look at the hubble exteriors and interiors as well. Sorry, sorry. Yes, yes, go for it. The velocity of the wind, probably I miss it, but the velocity of the wind is a constant, or it's associated to a profile. We've got to solve for it. We've got to solve for it. So, the velocity of the wind, the wind flows in the exterior region, and so we're about to do a couple of new equations for the middle. Okay. Is there another question? Yes, yes. Yes, sorry. And about the top. So, how is the energy transferred through the top of the hill? Yeah, that's a good question, because obviously all the penguins will be losing some heat vertically. But our thinking is that because all penguins are going to be losing an equal amount of heat. An equal amount of heat vertically upwards, that's not going to affect the 2D shape of the hub, if that makes sense. So we ignore it essentially. I mean, you could just, you know, take it, you know, you could take off some constant terms that it took e constant vertically, but yeah, we sort of ignore it in that way. Makes sense. You said that TRA outside constant? Well, yeah, so sorry, yeah, maybe I should have explained that more. This is just some point, this is the hottest point in. The hottest point inside the huddle, essentially. So, at some point in the huddle, you're going to have the hottest possible temperature, and in dimensional units, that's about 37 degrees Celsius. Yeah, TR varies across this whole, yeah, yeah, across this whole interior region. Yeah, and again, we'll derive a governing equation for that in a second. But we'll look at the exterior first, which is the wind flow. So, this probably answered the question, which is over there. We're assuming that our fluid is incompressible and irrotational. It is incompressible and irrotational. It doesn't matter if you don't know what that means. Essentially, our wind velocity is the gradient of some temperature phi, which solves the mass equation, which is super nice. And essentially, what it means is that then our temperature is transported through the fluids by the steady eviction of the VR. And it's steady because we're assuming the wind is flowing a lot faster than Hubble Projects. And finally, we could put on some suitable file fit models there as well. There as well. And then the interior temperature, yeah, so this is, you know, we're going to need to model this, the temperature in the interior. And essentially, we find that the Poisson, this Poisson equation best models temperature sort of transfer in the interior and the sort of motivation behind that. So this left-hand side represents the diffusion of temperature inside, and that represents how the penguins are all reorganising themselves to help spread the heat. But this is forced by this constant tongue on the right, which represents the The right, which represents the heat that's being generated by heat. So, this diffusion of heat is connected to the movement of the beams, or just with the fact that heat from one beam and goes to the other? Yeah, we're assuming it's due to the movement of the pen, because that's what we're modelling here, essentially. And then this sort of forcing term is representing. Yep. Any other well actually we're going on to this final slide which is putting them all together essentially here. Is friction between pigments important? That's a good question. Yeah, maybe I suppose that's going to slow their motion down and maybe generate some heat along the way. Yeah, interesting actually. I hadn't thought about that. Yeah, we haven't, nothing here what's explicitly says about the friction between penguins. Maybe it's subtly included in this diffusive term, but that's. In this diffusive term, but that's a good point, actually. We haven't considered that. Yeah. But this, for now, is our full-dimensionless model of the Pingman-Huttle problem. Which essentially we need to solve equation one, we need to find the normal velocity of the Hubble boundary. And in order to do that, we have to solve the remaining six equations as well. And to do that, we're going to do the method of informal mapping, which Hansior talked about earlier on in the week. But I'm just going to quickly go over what exactly Quickly go over what exactly the method we're using here is. So, the issue is we're over here in this physical plane, which hopefully you can all see this. And the issue is that our penguin-huddle boundary is constantly changing, and it's probably some weird and wacky shape. And so it's very difficult to solve our system, certainly analytically, but also numerically, in this sort of framework. So, what we do is we say, well, why don't we transform to a simpler geometry? So, instead of this weird shape, So instead of this weird shape, we just transform it to a simple disk. And the nice thing is that doing this transformation, our exterior governing equations, which govern the temperature flow through the wind, they're actually unchanged, which is super nice. So we actually end up with the same problem over here on the right, which we can then solve for exactly. And then all we need to do is transform our solution over here back to our physical space so we can actually see what's going on. Actually, see what's going on. And the nice thing, which the Riemann mapping theorem says, is that such a transformation always exists. There is a caveat, which is in yellow here. This transformation is only mapping one domain to another. So it only maps the exterior of the huddle to the exterior of the disk. So the interior temperature, we're going to have to solve a different way. I won't go through the details here, but we do it, it's fun. But essentially, our problem, instead of solving it all here in the physical space, our problem is now to find this group. Our problem is now to find this conformal map from the unit disk to our Hubble boundary at a time t. Essentially, what it means is our main equation one and the system of six equations following it, we can rewrite it in terms of the conformal map, and we end up with a single equation now that is satisfied here. So we only have one equation, which is super nice. There are two new functions that have been made here: this is sigma and omega. Sigma, that involves the exterior temperature. Sigma, that involves the exterior temperature, which we can find with conformal mapping. Again, we don't need the details here. And this little omega sum involves the interior temperature. We use the AAA least squares method, which is a direct way you can just work directly in the physical plane. Yeah, again, we won't talk about the details here, but if anybody has any questions, you can ask at the end. We've also got some references here. So Tony and Fjotra actually did some work on finding the Sigma. So if you have any questions about Sigma, we'll answer Frank because I'm sure. About signal velocity. But essentially, all we have now to find is the conformal map itself, and then we found how our bubble propagates over time. So, how do we do this? Well, we're going to assume that our conformal map can be written in the following form. So, for example, if the initial shape of your penguin hubby is this slanted ellipse, sorry if you can't see it at the back, this is going to be our form of the conformal map. And obviously, these coefficients. These coefficients, these functions in time are going to change as the thing becomes more close. So that's a bit better. We're getting closer to solving for this map, but it's still in terms of z's and t's. So what we do numerically, we pick a certain number of points around the zeta plane, and we see how these are transformed into our physical space. In other words, we set our zetas essentially, plug this back into our main equation. We end up with a system of ODEs in time to solve for these coefficients. And we just use a map of ODE. And we just use a MATLAB OBE cell board to then do that. And then we've found our hubble propagation. So now, some pictures. So we're going to get a lot of pictures like this. Essentially, this shape over here on the left, this blue shape, is the initial shape of a penguin huddle. So in this case, a circle. In all of the pictures, our wind blows from left to right. And these contours are how the penguin huddle changes over setting points of time. And if you remember, we're setting some certain values of the parameters. Values are the parameters, so we've got the Peclet number, the strength of the wind, beta, the strength of sort of King Wind heating interior effect, and these are just set over here as representative balance. Essentially what we find from our conclusions, the huddle travels downwind over time and eventually the shape of the huddle stops changing. So obviously it starts changing from a circle to this sort of egg shape. But after a certain amount of time, it just stays in some fixed egg shape and then just propagates as that egg shape. Egg shape and then just propagate as that egg over time. And how do these results look? Well, they match pretty well with the work from Walters and colleagues from 2012 who did the discrete version of the model, so they match pretty well with them. And they sort of agree with real-world observations. So we don't have any nice experimental or observational data to compare with. But if you sort of look at sort of these still images and sort of squint a bit, this huddle sort of looks quite egg-like. You know, this hubble sort of looks quite egg-like. So that's probably reached its egg-like steady shape. So, you know, we're not getting anything too drastically different from what we see in nature. Do you have an idea of the mid-direction? Yeah, I don't know. It was a still image. I mean, based on the fact that the eggs were this way, I'd imagine this way. But yeah, we don't know. This is just a still image. I think on them. They didn't provide the wind egg of it, sadly. Would they want to put the flag there? Yeah, right, yeah, if they had a flag in the picture, that'd be great. Should I be correct? That's the most annoying thing with finding data online, is that no window over the wind is like, you know. But yes, then we can look what happens if you increase the wind and increase the strength of the penguin heating effect. So first, what happens if you increase the wind strength from sort of one through 100 values of the Peckwell number? And you compare the final steady shapes of all of these experiments. What we see is a higher Peckwell number, a stronger wind strength, you get a more streamlined. Strength, you get a more streamlined, more sort of teardropped steady shape. What happens if you increase the interior effect, the effect of the penguins on rearranging themselves, and you compare those steady shapes as well, what you find actually in this case is that you get a more circular steady shape in the state. And finally, what happens if you change the starting shape of the penguin hubble? So, for now, we've just been looking at circular hubbles, but what if you use any weird and wanky shape? All of these initial shapes are of the same area as well, which is important. As well, which is important, and then you compare their final steady shapes. What you find is that, irrespective of the styling shape of the huddle, the penguin huddles will always end up in the same steady shape, which implies that there's some optimal penguin huddle shape that you need to coalesce to if you're huddling, essentially, which we thought was pretty cool. So, just to summarise, what have we done? We've made a continuum model for penguin huddle propagation, and we see that it travels downwind and approaches the central shape of the world. What can we do in the future? Well, obviously, this is all deterministic. In reality, there's going to be a bit more randomness. So, we could incorporate some stochasticity into our model, which would make things harder, but it is directional going. And we could consider more complicated scenarios. So, what if there's an obstacle in their path, or what if you've got multiple penguin hubs that are sort of coming together? How does that work? But, sort of the other big sort of extension: is this just exclusive to penguins? Because penguins are lovely, but maybe there's some more real-world scenarios. But you know, maybe there's some more real-world scenarios we could look at. So let's focus in on our main equation here. By inclusion and exclusion of these three terms on the right, what we actually end up with is seven possible free boundary problems that we can model with our current setup. Problem number seven is trivial, so we won't talk about that. Problem number one was actually a problem done by Tony and Piotzra, and Tony actually put some very similar features to this in Picaster. And we can produce, you know. And we can produce, you know, we can reproduce those results, which is pretty nice. You've got some sort of other fluids problems up here on the top, especially this sort of melting and freezing problems, which sort of just pop up everywhere. And then you've got some sort of other huddling problems down here on the bottom as well. And you've got some suitable references here if you want to read more. But can we do more? Obviously, this is just looking at exactly the same equation that we had. What happens if we change the form of our normal velocity equation or our The form of our normal velocity equation or our governing equations, a little bit, what we do then. And just a little shout out to my other research area, which my main area of research is about wildfire spread and modelling that. And it started from the fact that you see these sort of real-world pictures of these sort of finger-like formations spreading across a landscape, which like viscous fingering and the sort of branching networks covered here. And you see, we've made a model which can sort of incorporate those fingering-like structures. Incorporate those fingering-like structures. We've compared our model to real-world results, which match pretty well. And then this one over here on the right, this is a circular Wi-Fi spreading around a lake. And as you can see, the Wi-Fi sort of splits into two, and it's very close here to meeting up again and forming a loop. So this is the one loop of the torque. So loops, and obviously similar thing with penguin others, right? They can sort of go around an obstacle. So related to loops as well. And obviously, finally, there is. And obviously, finally, there is a load of other problems that we could apply the methods and techniques that we've seen here, and obviously some suitable references down here at the bottom as well. And obviously, there's probably even more that these sort of techniques could be used for. And with that, I'm going to end now. Thank you very much. No, no, no, just a curiosity. Isn't the height of the penguins higher than that of the turbulent boundary layer of the wind? I don't know. Any truthy question? Because in the turbulent boundary layer, maybe there was some... Yeah, well. Because the wind here we've just assumed is inviscid. So we're not looking at any viscous boundary layers at all when we're. Yeah, there is a relationship with that. That would be nice if the boundary layer is sort of up there. If the boundary layer is sort of up there, then we don't have to. But yeah, at the minute, we've just assumed inviscid flow, so we can do this conformal mapping technique. Ah, okay, because if you want to apply the controller button, you need that kind of a problem, right? Yeah, you still need some nice potential flow. Yeah, I think it's sort of de-viscous flow and involve these boundary layers, which just sort of connect to the problem hard. So yeah, for that, we just neglect it, but that's another area of the extension. Or if the boundary layers are a bit above the frame, that would be perfect. I feel there's probably something in the surface level that has to be accounted for. Surface level that has to be accounted for. Good question. So I would like to ask about this final shape, right? Because you were showing that no matter how you begin, you are getting this final shape. If you will add to your equations, the equations that the shape just translated, can you then derive this final shape directly without deriving the entire evolution? Yeah, well, yes. I mean, we've done some work where for SEPA. work where for set values of the peclet number and and beta we've sort of tracked we've tracked a graph which is the aspect ratio of the of the final shape so if somebody if somebody comes to you and said oh there's some penguins huddling uh the pec plane number is 10 and you know that is consistent but there was another thing you got a formula like a submotay of peckland oh okay yeah financially it would be whatever or rather cosine or something or something do you think it's possible maybe yeah i i hadn't thought of sort of deriving this sort of actual reality Deriving this sort of actual real element rather than just falling on a graphical thing. I hadn't considered that. It may be possible. Yeah, that would be pretty cool. So, yeah, just know exactly what the final shape is, but we haven't looked into it, but yeah, it's certainly possible. I was doing a paper of chipboards for 313. But I have the impression that uh something great um yeah um so maybe yeah I couldn't Yeah, I mean, all I can talk about is wildfires, where it doesn't seem like there's a steady shape because they're expanding and growing and sort of changing constantly. I've not, you know, yeah, nothing comes to mind at the minute with stuff that reaches a steady shape, but if you're saying there is stuff, it would make sense that I think Tim, somebody said to beware of optimisation, but you know, it makes sense that there's some sort of optimal shape for some of these problems, which once they've reached it, they would just stay there. They've reached it, they would just stay there, right? It's like stable equilibrium. Yeah, it's interesting. Maybe there's a lot of other scenarios in nature as well. We have to chat about that within the corporate. One more question. To the same end, it might be worth looking at how the heat flux varies over the surface. Because an analogy to the dissolution, I could imagine that it finds a shape where the heat flux is constant out of all the sides. Yeah, but what's this public? Uh yeah, but is it the dissolution? Yeah, the dissolution, since you also have the gear to the boundary condition. No, you don't. Oh, it's mixed. More models. What about the final shape and we can do a link with the media analysis and final bring in the pink? That's really good. I can't think of a mechanism where for some reason it would just develop this thing because it it feels like every you know that the the normal velocity equation we impose sort of forces it to become this shape but I can't see a scenario where it would sort of branch off and make these weird shapes I feel I feel it would look to stabilize it back down into this egg but maybe with some slight modifications to the you know certainly in other problems with you know similar free boundary problems you would then get it sort of branching off into these mid-fingery shape but I can't If it's completely finger reaching, but I can't see a scenario where that would happen. But I don't know, maybe, but
