It's a huge pleasure to have Lauren Williams joining us for the last talk of the meeting. So, Lauren, over to you if you're ready. Sure. Yeah, thank you so much. Thank you to all of the organizers for putting together this really nice conference. I'm going to be speaking about joint work with Dong Hyun Kim, who is going to be applying for postdocs this fall. So keep him in mind. So here's a brief outline of my talk. I'm going to talk about the exclusion process on a ring and then describe some conjectures and results to do with the stationary distribution and Schubert polynomials. And then I will talk about monomial factor conjecture and evolution. Conjecture and evil-avoiding permutations. So, for this audience, this introduction may be unnecessary, but I thought I'll just give some very general background on the ASEP, which I know we've already heard about in several previous talks. So it was introduced by biologists in 1968 and independently by a mathematician, Spitzer, in 1970. And in the ASEP, particles hop on a one-dimensional ASEP, particles hop on a one-dimensional lattice with at most one particle per site, and particles could have different weights which affect their hopping rate. And the lattice could be a line with open boundaries, or it could be Z, or it could be a ring. Today I'll be talking about the case of a ring. And it's been cited as a model for traffic flow and translation and protein synthesis. And there's been a great deal of work on the exclusion process. And in particular for ASEP and TASEP on a ring, I know many people in this audience have worked on it. Let's see, I have a list of names which could be incomplete, but we heard a talk by Svante Linesen earlier this week about TASEP and variants, and we also heard a talk by Ole Menderstam about not quite About not quite ASEP, but a sort of version of ASEP where you can have multiple particles per site, the TASERP. Okay, so let me define the inhomogeneous TASEP on a ring. So we're going to be fixing a lattice of n sites around a circle, and every site is filled with a particle of one of the weights one through n. One of the weights one through n. And we could allow particles to have repeated weights, but for the purpose of making the connections to Schubert polynomials most clear, I'm going to restrict configurations where I have one particle of weight one, one of weight two, and so on. And then I'm going to identify the states of this Markov chain with permutations. And I'll do that by And I'll do that by choosing some fixed but arbitrary place to cut open my circle. And then I'll just read off the weights of the particles I see to obtain a permutation. And in this Markov process, we're going to have transitions in which neighboring particles can exchange places. I see already that I have a And I see already that I have a typo in my slide. This should be a J and this should be an I. So basically, if you see an I and a J next to each other on the circle with J coming after I in clockwise order, and this is where I is less than J, then our transition rate of going from this state to the same state, but with J and I swapped. j and i swapped will be x i minus y j. And here x1 through xn and y1 through yn will be some constants fixed at the beginning, which I normally would just think about as variables. And if i is greater than j, then I'm not going to allow i and j to swap. So this rate will be zero. The rates are not negative either, right? I mean, is that some restriction? Yeah. I mean, is that some restriction? Yeah, the rates should be non-negative. But generally, I just don't worry about that and just think about them as these algebraic quantities. But you're right, I should think about them as non-negative. Okay, so on this circle, I allow, since I see 4 is bigger than 1, and also 4 is clockwise of 1, I allow these particles to swap at a rate. These particles to swap at a rate proportional to x1 minus y4, and similarly for these transitions here. And so a natural question is, what are the steady state probabilities? And so if w is a permutation, I'm going to let psi w be the unnormalized steady state probability of being in state w. Being in state w. And so when I say unnormalized, what I mean is, you know, we'll solve for steady state probabilities. We'll find the left eigenvector with eigenvalue one of the transition matrix. And probabilities, of course, need to sum up to one. But since all my probabilities will be written as polynomial in x and y divided by polynomial in x and y, what I'm going to do is find What I'm going to do is find a common denominator and then so put everything over a common denominator and then forget about the denominators, and psi sub w will be what's left, the numerators. Okay, and so then my steady state probabilities are going to be polynomials in the x's and the y's. And of course, we have this circular symmetry in the model. And so the steady state probability of state 3. Steady state probability of state 3124 is the same as the probability of 1243 is the same as the probability of 2431 and 4312, and so on. So if we're looking at steady state probabilities, we can just restrict attention to the permutations w, whose first letter is one. So that's what I've done in this little table here. So there's n is four, and there's six permutations starting with a one. Starting with a 1. In this table, for simplicity, I set all the y's to be 0. And so my unnormalized probabilities, psi sub w, are polynomials in the x's. And what we observed was that these probabilities are all monomials times some Schubert polynomials. So I'll define Schubert polynomials in a moment. Um yes, okay, so um some main questions here are find combinatorial formulas for the steady state probabilities. And here there's these beautiful objects, multi-line cues introduced by Ferrari and Martin. And so those are what wind up being the relevant combinatorial objects. And then a second question is to A second question is to figure out those monomial factors and the relationship to Schubert polynomials. And going back to this data, if we pay attention just to the monomials, then we see that the monomials and x's are all distinct. There's six different monomials and x's, and then apart from that, what I'm seeing is Schubert polynomials. Okay, now just to back up a little bit, there's several versions of the exclusion process on a ring, and I think the more commonly studied one, well, people can correct me if I'm wrong, but the one that I've seen more papers about, which I'm referring to as the usual multi-species ASAP, is the version of the ASAP where particles can hop. Particles can hop both clockwise and counterclockwise, but the transition rates are either one or t, depending on whether the bigger one is clockwise of the smaller one or not. And in this setting of the usual multi-species ASAP, one can give formulas for steady-state probabilities in terms of multi-line Q's. And this was first understood by James Martin and then in a And then in a work with Cortiel and Mendelstom, we gave some slightly different but related formulas in terms of multi-line cues with a different style of proof. So this is on the side of the usual multi-species ASEP. Now what I defined for you earlier was the inhomogeneous TASEP where particles are only hopping in one direction, but there's more complicated hopping rates. And in the And in the case that y sub i is zero, there's a formula for probabilities in terms of multiline q's. And this, I believe, was first conjectured by Ier and Linison, and then was proved by Arbita and Malik. But there's no formula in the case of general y not zero. Okay, so this is about combinatorics of stationary distributions for the usual multi-species ASEP and the inhomogeneous ASEP. And so interestingly, So interestingly, despite the fact that these models are quite different, one can use multiline queues to understand steady-state probabilities in both, but the statistics that one looks at in the multiline queues are different. Now, both versions of these models are connected to interesting families of polynomials. So, for the usual multi-species ASAP, they are connected to McDonald polynomials and more. Polynomials, and more specifically, the partition function of this model, so that common denominator, if you like, is equal to a McDonald polynomial after specializing almost everything to be one. So this was proved by Cantini, De Guerre, and Wheeler. And a refinement of that is the statement that every steady-state probability is a specialization of a probability is a specialization of a permuted basement McDonald polynomial which we shared with Cortiel and Mandelstrom and one sort of cool application of the fact that the multi-species ASAP can be understood using multi-line cues and is connected to McDonald polynomials is the fact that one can use multi-line cues to give formulas for all McDonald polynomials. So that was the main result of this work with Cortillan. Result of this work with Cortile and Mandelstrom. Okay, so that's on the side of the usual multi-species ASEP, the connection to McDonald polynomials. But now, on the other hand, if we switch to the inhomogeneous TASEP, this model, well, it's much less understood, I would say, but it's connected to Schubert and double Schubert polynomials. So in 2012, Lam and I wrote a four-page paper about this model in the case Y Sabai is. About this model in the case y sub i is zero, where we basically just observed that steady-state probabilities looked related to Schubert polynomials. So we have a four-page paper with a bunch of conjectures and we didn't really prove anything. But then four years later, Cantini proved that n of the n factorial states do have a probability which is proportional to a product of double Schubert polynomials. And it was all. And it was also Cantini who realized you could add Y's into the parameters of the model. So then, in this recent work with Dong Hyun Kim, we extended Cantini's result, but now we understand roughly this many states and have explicit formulas for each of this many states. We have a precise formula that the steady state probability looks like. That the steady state probability looks like some kind of monomial times, some product of Schubert's. And we conjecture that every other steady state probability cannot be written as a product of Schubert's, but can be written as a non-trivial positive sum of Schubert's. Okay, so that's how these two versions of the usual multi-species ASEP and inhomogeneous ASEP are connected to McDonald's polynomial. Connected to McDonald polynomials and more speculatively to Schubert polynomials. Okay, so now I should probably define Schubert polynomials. So they're defined using some operators called divided difference operators, del i. And this is an operator which acts on polynomials as follows. As follows. So if p is a polynomial in n variables, then deli p will be a new polynomial obtained by taking p, subtracting off the related polynomial obtained by swapping xi and xi plus 1, and then dividing by xi minus xi plus 1. Okay, so that's the divided difference operator del i. And now if SI1 through Sierra is 1. Now, if SI1 through SIM is a reduced expression for a permutation w, then del I1 through del IM, this concatenation of operators, actually depends only on the permutation w. And so you can denote that operator by del W. Okay, so we're going to define Schubert and double Schubert polynomials inductively using these operators. Lauren, can I just ask, are these SI transpositions? Yes, yes, yes. Sorry, I should have. Yes, yes, yes. Sorry, I should have said that. SI means the simple transposition swapping I and I plus one. Thank you. Other questions? I'm not good at monitoring the chat, so if I'll keep an eye on and I'll shout if something comes up. Okay, sounds good. So now if X and Y If x and y are two sets of variables, we'll let delta of x, y be this product of linear factors xi minus yj. And then to every permutation w and sn, we associate a double Schubert polynomial. This was first done by Lescu and Schutzenberg. And the double Schubert polynomial associated to W is defined by starting with Starting with this product, delta, and then acting by the divided difference operator corresponding to w inverse w naught. And here I should explain my notation again. W naught means the permutation which takes 1 to n, 2 to n minus 1, 3 to n minus 2, and so on, down to 1. Okay, and the divided difference operator is only acting on the x variables. The x variables. Okay, and the double Schubert polynomials, if you specialize all the y's to be zero, give back what are just normally called Schubert polynomials. So to say a few facts about Schubert polynomials, when W in Sn is a Grassmannian permutation, then the corresponding Schubert polynomial is just a Schur polynomial. Polynomial is just a Schur polynomial. So actually, both McDonald and Schubert polynomials generalize the Schur polynomials. And there's a geometric significance of Schubert polynomials in terms of the cohomology of Schubert varieties in the complete flag variety. There's also a geometric significance to double Schubert polynomials, and there's been quite a lot of work on the Schubert polynomials. Okay, so now let me go back to our inhomogeneous TASIP on a ring and show more data. This is what the steady state probabilities look like when n is 5. Okay, so again, because of the circular symmetry, we only have to look at permutations starting with 1. And now we can look at the monomial factors. The monomial factors. And if you look again at these monomial factors in front of the steady state probabilities, oh, sorry, I should say x to the 5, 2, 0 is shorthand for x1 to the 5, x2 squared, x3 to the 0. Okay, but now one observation is that these monomial factors are all distinct. And then when you look at most other steady-state probabilities, what you see is a What you see is a product of Schubert polynomials. But in a few cases, you see a non-trivial sum instead. But it is a positive sum. So there's these four cases where our probabilities look a little bit more complicated. Okay, so let me mention a conjecture which came from our 2012 paper, which is the monomial factor conjecture. And it's a precise conjecture for what those monomials should be. And I should say also, the data I showed here was when the y sub i's are all zero, and the monomial factor conjecture is made in that setting. Made in that setting. Okay, so let's let W be some permutation and I'm going to let R and S be the positions where I see the letters i plus 1 and i. And now I'm going to define a number alpha sub i of w by counting how many integers are greater than i plus 1 among the following set of letters. Among the following set of letters. And so, what I'm going to do is on my permutation, which I'm viewing as a permutation of an arrangement of particles on a circle, I find my i plus one, and then I start moving clockwise, and I keep going clockwise around my circle until I get to i. And I look at all those letters that I see along the way, and I count how many are bigger than i plus one. That's what alpha i of w is. Okay. Okay, and then the theorem is the following explicit formula for the monomial factors that one sees. Okay, so we consider the inhomogeneous TESP on Sn and for W in Sn we're going to let eta of W be the largest monomial that can be factored out of psi sub W. And then the statement is that eta of W is this. W is this product. So the so it's a product of all the xi's raised to some power. And to find the power that xi is raised to, I add up alpha i of w plus alpha i plus 1 of w, dot dot dot, all the way up to alpha n minus 2 of w. And another way of thinking about it is that I'm going to find I'm going to find, so starting on this side to calculate this number, I would find the n minus 1 on my circle, and I would start traversing clockwise until I get to n minus 2. And I count how many numbers that I see are bigger than n minus 1. And then I go from my n minus 2, and I keep traversing clockwise until I get to n minus 3, and I count how many numbers I see which are bigger than n minus 2. And I keep going in this way until I get to i. Until I get to I. Okay. And then the other statement is that if two states are, well, if two states have the same monomial factor, then W and W prime must be cyclically equivalent. Okay, so for example, if W were the permutation 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, so then my configuration of particles is 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, then Then to count alpha 1, I would, so I'm looking at this definition, I find my two, and then I start moving clockwise until I get to one, and I count how many numbers are bigger than two, and both three and five are bigger, so this is two. Okay, and then similarly, I can compute alpha two and alpha three, and so my monomial factor will be eta of w 2, which will be x. Which will be x1 to the 4, x2 squared. And so this is the permutation 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, which is this one. And so here we see the monomial factor is x to the 420, which is exactly what we got from this recipe. Okay, yeah. Okay, yeah. Please interrupt if there's any questions. Okay, so now let me say something about pattern avoidance. So we say that a permutation W avoids the pattern. So I'm sort of defining it by one example. We say that W avoids the pattern 2, 4, 1, 3 if there's not four positions in a row. Four positions in a row, IJKL. Sorry, not in a row, but in order, but they don't have to be like consecutive. So there's not four positions, IJK, and L, such that Wi, WJ, WK, and WL are in the relative order 2, 4, 1, 3. So as an example, this permutation W, if you look at the red letters, these red letters have the relative order 2. have the relative order 2, 4, 1, 3. And so we'd say that this permutation W contains the pattern 2413. But on the other hand, this permutation avoids the pattern 2413. It has no instances. Okay. Okay. And now, so then we define this class of permutations called evil avoiding. And evil avoiding means that W has to avoid W has to avoid the pattern 2413. And as a kind of a mnemonic, I'm associating 2413 to the word evil, where I identify one with I and two with E and three with L and four with V. But we also have to avoid three more patterns coming from these anagrams of evil. So vile under the same Vial under the same translation between letters and numbers will be 4, 1, 3, 2. And then the other anagrams we have to avoid are veil and leave. Okay, sorry. And leave is, this one is a little bit of a stretch, but this is a Scandinavian name. So that was the best. Sorry, this was the best I could do. Okay, so evil avoiding means you avoid these four patterns. Okay, so now, how do evil avoiding permutations enter into this story? Well, what we realized at some point after staring at lots of data was that whenever W is an evil avoiding permutation representing a state of the TASEP, and without loss of generality, recall W1 is one. Then, as long as you're evil avoiding Uh, as long as you're evil avoiding the unnormalized probability is proportional to a product of double Schuber polynomials, and the number of Schubert polynomials in your product is going to be the number of descents of W inverse. So we'd been staring at the data for n equals five and six and seven and trying to figure out for which states of the TASEP is your steady state probability. Steady state probability, monomial times Schubert polynomials. And it took us a really long time to sort of figure out what was going on, but eventually realized that it was all the states avoiding those four patterns, which had these beautiful multiplicative steady state probabilities. So, Noah, can I ask if you because everything should be oh, I see, so we're fixing one to be the first. Yes, that's right, that's right. Yes, that's right. That's right. Yes. So that's why we wouldn't have to avoid shifting. Yeah, okay. Right, right, exactly. Yeah, so it's a little bit asymmetric how it's stated, but we're breaking symmetry in order to make the statement. Okay, so again, if we go back to this n equals five data and you look at the four states where the study States where the steady state probability is more complicated is a non-trivial sum of Schubert's, then those four states contain these four bad patterns, right? The one, three, five, two, four, if you throw away the one, the remaining letters form the pattern two, four, one, three, which is evil. And then similarly, these three correspond to the other three bad patterns. And then the other three. And then the other thing, the other content of that statement I wrote was that for all the other permutations, if you want to know how many Schuberts are on the right-hand side, and there can be one or there could be two or there could be three, that number can be read off of by taking the inverse of this permutation and counting decents. Any question? Sure. I'm confused about the lack of circular symmetry. Lack of circular symmetry. Oh, yes. Maybe this is related to what James was saying. Because if I've got a really long polynomial, you would think it really wouldn't, I mean, it really wouldn't matter where it starts, whether or not it has an evil in it or not. I mean, some of them wrap around, of course, but why do you... Why are your rules not sort of circularly symmetric? Or did you try to make a circularly symmetric definition? We didn't. We didn't. Yeah, I guess because we were looking already at the permutations starting with one, it was natural to make this assumption, only look at the ones starting with one, and now try to characterize the permutations with the good steady state probabilities. The good steady state probabilities. Yeah, but it would be interesting to try to find a circularly symmetric way of stating it. And actually, okay, actually, that's going to be related to an open problem that I pose. So yeah, there may be a way to answer it. So of course, once we came up with this definition, we were trying to figure out if other people had studied these kinds of permutations. Of permutations, and we counted, you know, of course, we put in the sequence into Sloan. So, if E of n is the number of evil-avoiding permutations in Sn, this sequence of numbers appears as Sloan, well, this sequence. One can easily find an explicit formula for this number. And there's a whole bunch of references in Sloan for this numerology for the sequence, although we couldn't find any. We couldn't find any reference to permutations avoiding these particular four patterns, but I'll just mention a few other interpretations of the sequence. E of n counts rectangular permutations on 1 through n, which are those avoiding these four patterns. And so, of course, the obvious thing to try to do is figure out if somehow there's an easy, easy map between those. Easy map between those avoiding these and those avoiding these. And we didn't try for very long, but we didn't find a bijection. So, anyway, I just leave it as an open problem since I know many of you are experts on this kind of thing to find a bijection between these rectangular permutations and the evil-avoiding ones. Another way of describing these permutations, sorry, of giving Sorry, of giving another permutation interpretation to this sequence. So, this is not a way of describing evil-avoiding permutations, but it's a class of permutations with the same cardinality, is the permutations in Sn such that for each j, there's at most one i less than or equal to j with pi of i bigger than j. And there's a way to rewrite this. Rewrite this statement in a sort of a non-crossing partition-ish type way. And so I think this set of permutations has more circular symmetry. So it could be that mapping these to these might give some insight on a more circularly symmetric way of describing the good states. Yeah, so anyway, so it's an open problem to find a bijective proof between evil avoiding primary. proof between evil avoiding permutations and any of the other objects counted by counted by the same sequence. Okay, let's see. Yeah, so the way I stated the theorem before was sort of vague. So I'll just refine my statement now. So if W in Sn is an evil W in Sn is an evil avoiding permutation representing a state of the TASEP, and let's say it has K, its inverse has K to sense, and without loss of generality, W sub 1 is 1. Then the statement is that there are partitions lambda 1 through lambda k, which I can construct in a moment. And then if you then define mu to be this vector minus the sum of all of these lambda vectors, The sum of all of these lambda i's, viewing each partition as a vector, then your steady state probability psi sub w looks like x to the mu times the following product of Schubert polynomials. And s lambda i here with this notation here is a Schubert polynomial, which is actually a flagged Schur polynomial. And one way to define this This flagged shure polynomial is to write down the generating function for all semi-standard tableau of shape lambda i. But now the extra complication is that your entries in row j are bounded above by this number. So the class of Schubert polynomials that we're seeing are actually flagged Schur polynomials and can be described using semi-standard tableau. Tableau. Okay, and okay, maybe I won't go through the explicit recipe, but using the Lemur code of W inverse, there's an explicit way to write down those partitions lambda one through lambda k. So anyway, so if you want to see the explicit recipe, you can see it in my slides, which hopefully are online by now. And then again, for simplicity, And then, again, for simplicity, I stated this theorem in the case when y sub i's are zero, but we have a version of this theorem when the y sub i's are non-zero and with double Schubert's instead of ordinary Schubert polynomials. Okay, so this here is just a little table of essentially the same data but rewritten. Now I've Now I've sorted the states, the evil-avoiding states, by numbers of descents of their inverse, and then I've written down the corresponding sequence of partitions associated to each one together with the steady state probabilities. And again, the recipe for constructing monomials is to sort of take a constant vector 631 and then subtract. Vector 631 and then subtract off the two partitions associated. Okay. Okay, so here I've just rewritten the theorem. And of course, as we know, when the y sub i's are all zero, there's a combinatorial formula for the stationary distribution in terms of multi-line q's. And conjectured by Iron Linison and proved by Arita and Malik. And proved by Arida and Malik. And in this case, so in the y sub i a zero case, and additionally, if k is one, one can go from the multi-line q formula to our theorem by mapping multi-line q's to semi-standard tableau. Okay, so we can do a combinatorial proof of this theorem when y sub i's are zero and additionally when k is one. But to prove the theorem for general y's and k, For general y's and k, we first of all don't have the multi-line q formula available. And also, when there's products of Schubert's on the right-hand side, we have no idea how to map the terms on our right-hand side to multi-line Q's. Okay, so instead, what we use in that case is a result of Cantini, which introduces some auxiliary parameters Z1 through Zn. Auxiliary parameters Z1 through Zn into the picture. So it wasn't bad enough to have X's and Y's. We're going to throw in some Z's as well. And essentially what he writes down gives a recursion for psi sub w's after throwing in these auxiliary variables. And I'll just show, I'll okay, so let me try to just unpack Cantini's results a little bit. So what he does is sort of Is sort of introduce new parameters z1 through zn and introduce some new quantities psi sub w of z. They are defined recursively. Your base case, when your permutation is the identity permutation, the base case looks like this huge product. Some factors look like have x's and y's, some have z's. Have X's and Y's, some have Z's and X's, some have Z's and Y's. And then to go to the other size of W of Z's, where W is arbitrary, there's a sort of isobaric divided difference operator, which takes you from psi sub W of Z to the related state where instead of having a W, we have W multiplied by a simple transposition. Multiplied by a simple transposition. And this isobaric divided difference operator looks as follows. So you take your quantity g of z. So it's probably a rational expression in x's, y's, and z's, but we're thinking of it as an ex as an expression in z's. And you, well, this basically looks like a divided difference operator, but we. Looks like a divided difference operator, but we also have these factors in terms of x's, y's, and z's as well. Okay, so okay, so he introduces these sort of upgraded steady state probabilities side w of z and shows that the leading coefficient of each one with respect to z recovers the steady state probability. So he's basically using integrability to throw more parameters into the picture and then express. Into the picture, and then express these sort of generalized steady-state probabilities to basically write down a recurrence for them. Okay, so yeah, so anyway, anyway, so I so this is a main tool, a main tool in our proof of the connection to Schubert polynomial stuff is to sort of use this recurrence and then show that leading. And then show that leading coefficients of his psi sub w of z's look like products of Schwartz. Okay, so a conjecture, which seems pretty hard, is that if w is not evil avoiding, then the steady state probability psi sub w looks like a monomial, this monomial we understand, times a positive sum. A positive sum of Schubert polynomials. So, what's left is to understand these other steady state probabilities, these sort of four complicated ones in the case n is five. And another related open question would be to find some kind of geometric interpretation of steady state probabilities. So, can you understand these expressions and maybe give an interpretation in terms of state state? And maybe give an interpretation in terms of cohomology of some sub-variety of the complete flag variety. So that's all I wanted to say. You can find everything I said in this paper on the archive. And I think I'm the last speaker of the conference. So I want to give everyone the opportunity to thank the organizers for a really nice conference.
