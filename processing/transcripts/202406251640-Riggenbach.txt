Things out one prime at a time and rationally, completely. So I'm yeah, I like Naka Ama's lemma, and I'm not afraid of doing this because of fracture. Yeah, but I don't want to get into that. Yeah, but I don't want to get into that because I haven't defined any of these words. But yes, yes, yes. Thank you. Yes, sorry. Thank you so much. Okay, great. Okie dokie. I'm doing about right how I thought I would do on time, which is badly. Okay, great. So the upshot of what I'm trying to convey. Of what I'm trying to convey over the last however long I've been talking is that I don't just want to consider PHH by itself. I want it with a filtration. Right, if I'm going to understand THH, I want to keep in mind this filtration. I want to remember that it has this even filtration. And so if I think about THH in some context, I don't just want to be thinking about THH. I want to be thinking about it as a filtered gadget. Okay. So that's one way to understand THH. understand THH, the filtered way. Another way you could go about understanding THH is a bit of a more categorical way. So we have THH by definition, it's a functor which goes from E infinity rings in spectra to E infinity rings in spectra with an S1 action. Okay, and the reason I motivated starting looking at this is that you have At this, is that you have a map from K-theory to THH taking traces, and just because taking a trace is cyclically invariant, this is actually an equivariant map. And so this will factor through where you take the trivial action here. And so this will actually factor through something called T C minus, which is THH blank homotopy S1 fixed point. Homotopy S1 fix. So you take the homotopy fixed. Okay. And so this was an approximation. This somehow by definition will be a better approximation. You can ask how good of an approximation this is. And the answer is rationally, this is an extremely strong approximation. But as soon as you're in mixed or positive characteristic, this is a poor approximation. This misses a lot of this information. This misses a lot of those information. And one of the things you're missing is what's called a cyclotomic verbini. Okay, so you have a bit of extra structure on THH, which is the so-called cyclotomic frobenius, phi sub P. This is an S1 equivariant map. This is an S1 equivariant map from THH of blank to THH of blank. And you take the take CP fixed points. Here, CP sitting inside of S1 are the roots of unity, pth roots of unity. Roots of unity. This thing has an S1 action by definition, and this thing has an S1 mod CP action, which An S1 mod CP action, which is the same thing as an S1 action, because those two groups are. Okay, and so you ask for an equivariant map like this. And maybe just to say the reason that this is called cyclotomic Frobenius is because you can look at R, this has a map to. R, this has a map to TH of R. And then you can apply the cyclotomic for Benius to get THH of R KCP. And then THH of R has a canonical map down to R, right? If you look at this cosimplicial diagram I wrote on this board two boards ago, you can just map down to the last degree. And so this gives you a map from THH of R tate CP to R tate CP. To R tate CP. Okay, and this is, if R is a discrete ring, this is a map from R to, well, pi zero of this will be R mod P. And this is exactly modding out pi P and taking the P power. So this is a Frobenius. This deserves to be called a Frobenius. And in fact, this analogy goes much deeper, as Nick Wash and Scholtze noticed. You can, in fact, You can, in fact, build this thing out of various power operations. But anyway, I think that's all I'm going to say about the construction of this map. The point is that you have T C minus of a ring R, and you have two maps to you take THH blank H CP. Blank HCP and HS1. The first map is you think about THH of R H S1. This is the same thing as THH of R H C P H S one and then you Just one, and then you map by the canonical map from the homotopy fixed points to the take construction. And then the other map is applying the homotopy fixed points to the cyclotomic probenians. So these are usually called can HS1 and 5P HS1. And the point is that when you equalize these things, You get a new invariant called Tc. K-theory factors through Tc. And in fact, this is an extremely strong, an extremely close approximation. And so, for example, yesterday we saw examples of these motivic filtrations constructed by Elmonto and Moro and also Bui. Thank you. Good. Okay. And various pieces of these motivic complexes were decorated with the letters TC. And they come from here, this object TC. And the reason that these approximate K-theory so well is because this is such a close approximation. And so we want to understand this gadget TC. And one thing to And one thing to ask is: well, THH had a filtration. Do these other things have a filtration? Right? Can we understand these TC minus this thing, which I'll call TP? It's a bit of a lie, but it's a lie I'm willing to tell. And TC, do these things have filtrations? And the answer is yes. And the answer is yes, and you define them in a very similar way. So, okay, so you also have the even filtration on Tc minus of R. And this will be the inverse limit over E in calj even, but also we're going to ask. But also, we're going to ask for there to be an S1 action on E. And this will have a map from R. And you take the double speed Postakov power of E homotopy pixel. Okay, and you get a similar one for TP, and this leads to a filtration on TC, a filtration on TC that we've already seen this. On TC, that we've already seen the associated gradients of. Okay, so THH has this extra structure, and we have those filtrations on the board. Let me put aside those filtrations for a moment. They'll come back to haunt us. For a moment, they'll come back to haunt us in a minute. But let me just put them aside. So I think I opened up this section, started talking about THH as a functor from here to here, where it lands, what's the extra structure. I opened it up with the header that this was studying THH categorically. Okay, so THH of a ring. So, THH of a ring doesn't just have this structure, it has this extra k-valued for Benius. And so one way to study THH is to think of it as a functor landing in objects with that structure and to study the whole category of objects with that structure. And so, this is a definition due to. And says that the category, read infinity category of cyclotomic spectra is the infinity category of objects X together with the map phi P from X to From X to X H C P where X is a spectra with S1 hexam. And so, a consequence of the ideas I've been sketching on this board is that pH is actually a functor from calge of spectra to six spectrum. One consequence of this. This equation, if you sort of, you know, this is not really a definition. Nicholas and Schulze gave a real definition. And if you look at their real definition in terms of a lax equalizer and look at what that says about mapping spectra, one consequence of that description is that you can describe Tc of a ring R will be equivalent to actually maps in cyclotomic spectra from Spectra from the sphere into CHH of R, where here this sphere has the trivial S1 action. And so you can look at the identity map from the sphere to the sphere. And this will factor through the fixed points because the action is trivial. And then you can just apply the canonical map to get your probing. Another way of saying that is cyclotomic spectra is a symmetric monoidal infinity category. This is the unit in that symmetric monoidal structure. And so these are like the points of THH. And so once you have a lot of different things, you can see that the map is a very good thing. Once you have this category of cyclotomic spectra, once you have a home for THH, you can start breaking things, right? You can start abusing the home, right? Hitting the category and see what falls out. I'm a bad house guest. I don't know what to tell you. Anyway. Anyway, one of the key features, the key feature of a theory is its examples, right? And so you can start asking, well, THH is an example. What are some other examples? And so here's a theorem by Nicole. Oops. Oops. I know how the alphabet goes. Are there some other examples? Well, there is a nice p-structure on cyclotomic spectra. Okay, with just a With just a ton of properties beyond just the niceness, you know. Let me see, what were the ones I wanted to mention? A left complete accessible T structure compatible with the monoidal structure such that, okay, first of all, the connective objects are the cyclotomic spectra. Atomic spectra with connective underlying objects. But this isn't, you know, this isn't literally just take the Posnikov structure on spectra and lift it to this category. For example, two is that. Two is that th is actually in the heart of this t structure for k a perfect fp algebra and its heart is quite nice as well. So the the hard Quite nice as well. So, the heart of this t-structure is what they call Cartier complexes or Cartier modules. So, basically, a module together with an F and V operator that behave like they do on the bit vectors. And so, one consequence of the fact that this do data is in the heart, and that's what the heart looks like in general, is that, sorry, V complete R T A modules, is that if you take Is that if you take a P a formal P divisible group over K omp this embeds into cyclotonic spectra over THH modules over THK? Over THH, modules over THH. And so, sort of the starting point for me getting into this subject, getting into our result, which I'm about to state, was twofold. The first is, okay, we have these two ways of studying cyclotonic spectra or THH. One is with this filtration, and one is this categorical approach, right? It would be nice if we could merge them together. If we can merge them together, right? And also, if you looked at the filtrations I defined, the filtration that I erased here, so I don't know why I'm pointing, but the filtration on TC minus and TP was not apply homotopy S1 fixed points and the take instruction to the filtration on THH. It was something more complicated. You needed to first take the homotopy fixed points and then do a new filtration, do the even filtration at that level, right? And those operations don't commute. Right, and those operations don't commute. Right, if you take, for example, the group cohomology of a discrete thing, you do not always get a discrete thing back. This is not the exact. Okay. And so one question was, can you put THH into a category with its filtration and remembering all this extra structure we have floating around? Such that the filtration you get on homotopy fixed one. The filtration you get on homotopy fixed points is the right one. On orbits is the right one. You only have one filtration. Yeah. Sorry, no. You really need formal PDF perfect FPA algebra. To get the do donate module to be be complete. Right. So it's the Right, so it's the heart is V Atic complete your donate modules. So you need the V addict complete. So, yeah, you do need them. And the other question I wanted to ask myself, the other sort of dream I had, dreams of Doudonet theory, are quickly becoming Doudonet nightmares, is what if you replace K with a smooth algebra over K? Can you also live? Over K, can you also lift the Doudonet module to cyclotomic spectrum? Right, and there's some evidence that you can. One of the key pieces of evidence is somehow this key structure, this identification of the heart, goes through TR, which is connected with like the window frames approach to Doudonet theory of like linger and zinc. But there's another approach to Doudonet theory that goes through prismatic homology, things like T. Through prismatic homology, things like T C minus and T P. And so there should be some connection between these two approaches of due donet theory, which I think has been formalized in the literature. But I'm not an algebraist. I'm only pretending to be a person over here. I want a topology. I want an infinity right here. Okay. So that's the motivation. Okay. Questions, comments, concerns? Okay, maybe while I'm erasing, you know, I said that a lot of this work was inspired by the work of Arpon Rakset. Arpon constructed this category in the case when you're working over Z. So in which case you don't have the cyclotomic probenius. So it's a little easier. Which category did he construct? That's a great question. The category of synthetic cyclotomic spectra in that case. But you have no Frobenius. So this is, he called it the category of, was it filtered modules with filtered S1 action? Okay. No, okay. Actually, maybe that's a good excuse to take a break from my plan and to say what synthetic things are. So, you know, what is this word synthetic doing? You know, I've been talking about constructing a category where filtration on THH lives. And so maybe let me define what the synthetic category. So for me, when I talk about effiltration, When I talk about effiltration, I mean it in the most sort of infinity categorical way I know of it, which is that the derived filter category of any category, but let's just take spectra, for this I mean take the infinity category of functors from z op to your category spectra. Okay, and so what this means in practice is that an object here will be Here will be a collection of objects for each integer f greater than or equal to one of x, together with maps like that. And that's all. No like injectivity, something, something, just things like this. Okay. And then the associated graded is the co-fiber and it converges to the co-limit. It converges to the co-limit of this diagram, and it's complete if the limit of this diagram is zero. Okay, so this is what I mean by filtered spectra. And there are a lot of very interesting examples of filtered spectra. So first of all, you can take the even filtration on any E infinity ring R. And by this, I just mean it's the same formula I wrote down before. So you take the limit. So you take the limit over E in even R algebras of the double speed Postagov tower of E. Right, so this is a filtered gadget filtered by star. Okay, and so in particular, you get the even filtration on the sphere, which is sometimes called the synthetic analog of this. The synthetic analog of the sphere, or sometimes called the Adams-Novikov filtration on the sphere spectrum. So, if you've heard of the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, the one associated to this filtration. Okay, and so this will be an object in the dry filter category of spectra. And so, for me, a synthetic spectrum is just a modules over this filtered ring, where the symmetric monoidal structure on this side is the day convolution. Okay. So that's what synthetic spectra are. And so one way to think about them is that if you take a spectrum X and you tensor it with this filtration, you get the Adams-Oberkoff filtration on X. And so elements of here look like spectras together with their Adams-Nobrikoff filtration. And so this is historically why people first started looking at this category. First, I started looking at this category, but it's turned out to be a very convenient place for a lot of other reasons as well. So this is what a synthetic spectra is. And when I was going through the definition of the cyclotomic spectra motivated by THH, the first thing I did was move from spectra to spectra with S1 action, right? With S1 action, right? And so we want a notion of an S1 action here that somehow respects the filtration. Okay. And so the idea, which was suggested to us by Raxit, was, well, what if you look at the following gadget, which I'll call T even, which is take the even filtration on On the grouper. Okay. So it turns out the even filtration is lacks symmetric monoidal when you consider it as landing inside of synthetic spectra. And so anything with an S1 action, if you take its even filtration, it'll naturally be a module over this gadget. Okay. And so in particular, the even filtration on THH of any ring will naturally be a module over this. Will naturally be a module over this ring. Okay. And what's more, so this is a lemma that represents months of work because we kept on getting confused and myself is that T is not just a ring, but it's actually a bicommutative bi-algebra. Algebra and what's more, if you look at its dual, you actually get a shifted copy of this thing. This thing as the even modulus. So it's self-dual equivariantly over itself, and it's not just a commutative algebra, but it's in fact a commutative co-algebra as well in a compatible way. It's in fact a Hobb algebra. In fact, a Hop algebra. We don't need the Hop algebra structure, and we didn't want to write it down. Okay. But maybe one thing to say that this buys us is: first of all, if you have an element which is An element which is a module over this gadget in synthetic spectrum. Then you can form its fixed points. This is just by definition maps of even modules from the trivial module to To f greater than or equal to X. Okay. You can also talk about orbits, which will just be f greater than or equal to star of X tensor over this module with SMU. Okay, for this, you don't need this full structure. Okay, for this, you don't need this full structure, you just need the augmentation. But what this self-duality and this co-module structure buys you is you actually have a map. Like this, the normal. Form map. And so you can form Tate. Okay. So maybe Or are homatically quasi-syntomic, you can look at this functor even. This lands in even modules. And you can forget the even module structure. Take f infinity, f greater than or equal to minus infinity everywhere. Infinity everywhere. There's a functor like this. Okay, maybe I should say in here. There's a functor like this to spectra with S1 action. Okay, and this is the even filtration on THH. And when you apply these various fixed points, you get a filtered spectra. And those filtrations are the filtrations they're supposed to be. Okay. And the filtrations. And the filtrations on T C minus and T P are correct explanation Okay. For the sake of time, let me not go through in detail. Well, okay. Let me first explain what I'm not going to explain. So, we have synthetic spectra with a synthetic S1 action, filtered S1 action. Action filtered S1 action. Now the question is: How do you get cyclotomic spectra? Well, what piece of data are you missing? We're missing a filtration, a filtered map, THH to THH blank. Let me add the filtrations. We're missing some filtered HCP construction. H CP construction. No, no, no, no, no. So if you plug in a QRSP ring, then this should be the double speed Posnikov. This better be the double speed Posnikov, right? Because you want GER I to be the like BMS dude. You want GER0 to be Prism mod I. We want Ger0 to be Prism mod I, right? If you drop this filtered and just did the tate CP pointwise, then yeah, you would need to shift by P, but then this still wouldn't be, yeah. That's what makes this problem hard. You get the wrong filtration when you apply the construction point-wise. So let me not fully explain for the sake of time how you construct this filtered take construction. This filtered take construction. Let me just say what you don't do, which is you don't construct a filtered CP group. So, or at least that's not how Antio and I did it, Ben and I did it. We tried. We tried our hearts out, and it just kept on becoming more and more of a nightmare. Nothing was working. We eventually got something. We eventually got something that gave the right orbits and fixed points. And this sense I gave the right filtration. But the thing is, it wasn't self-dual in any natural way. It was an extremely complicated construction. And it also only gave the right thing if everything you're plugging in was P-complete, which isn't too bad to draw back. So instead, Instead, you filter S1 mod CP, the sphere adjoint, as an S adjoint S1 mod. Okay, and then you use this self-duality to actually relate when you replace. When you replace SMU with the filtration on S adjoin S1 mod CP, you end up getting a filtration on the homotopy fixed points and the take instruction in the orbit. So this turns out to be the right thing to do. So let me just state our theorem. The next theorem and myself, it's that there exists a, well, okay, a presentable, presentable, stable, symmetric monoidal. Enriched over filtered spectra. Well, in fact, synthetic spectra. Am I missing any nice words that usually are attached to infinite categories? I don't think so. Oh, I'm sure I'll come up with some, which I'll call Sixen. Thank you. Which you can form as the lax equalizer of bless you, even modules to even modules. Okay, where one is the identity functor and one is this filter table. identity functor and one is this filter tape instruction. And a lift half greater than or equal to star th of r in this category. Again, for our chromatically quasi-syntomic. So this isn't the empty category. In fact, it contains all of our friends and it satisfies all the desired compatibility if you've Desired compatibility if you forget the cyclotomic structure and just remember the even module structure. Okay. In my last negative two minutes, let me just also say that we have also reconstructed not just one, but several cyclotomic synthetic T structures on this category. Basically, if you give me a t-structure on synthetic A T structure on synthetic spectra, which isn't awful, then I can cook up one for you. We can cook up one for you on cyclotomic synthetic spectra. Okay. Thanks for listening. All right. I'm done. Any questions? So, in the original anti-Linux story, one of the most concrete things was second. Concrete things was psychotomic honor because the THH of Ray is the drumway. Oh, man, you're such a good guy. So, what's that? Yeah. I should pay you more money. You're such a good plant. Okay. So. So let P be the positive T structure structure. So I think, so f greater than or equal to star of X is connective if and only if f greater than or equal to I of X is I connective. Connective. That's what the Postakov T structure is. Okay, so this is one of those T structures on SYN spec that doesn't suck. And so it gives you a T structure on synthetic cyclotomic spectra. And if A is a smooth, let me just say smooth FP algebra, then this depends on work of my. This depends on work of mine and Micah Darrell. If you feed in what we do and what Micah and I do, then what pops out is that high I of the even filtration on THH of A is the ith. I think what's the how do you denote the dumb filtration? Let me just say this. Omega star of A over F P. And so in particular, if you take I equals zero, it is the Drombit complex. And so maybe I should say that the heart of this T structure looks like Cartier modules. Like Cartier modules. Yeah. So think about the heart of the positive t structure. It's graded abelian groups. And then if you look at what pi naught of the filtered even circle is, it's z adjoin eta and a differential. And so that's how you get the differential. And so it's like Cartier complexes with an F and V operator. F and V operator. And yeah, this is the, I don't know how you're done of langer. Any other questions?
