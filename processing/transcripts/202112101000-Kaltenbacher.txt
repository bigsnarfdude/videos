So, thank you very much. So, thanks a lot to the three of you for organizing this. So, it has been a great idea and it was also a great experience. And it seems to, I mean, some people might be skeptic about these women-only workshops, but they just simply work. And so, I experienced this already with women in optimization and other things. It's just a good atmosphere. Just a good atmosphere to talk and exchange, and I enjoyed it a lot. I learned a lot during this workshop, and so it's my great honor and pleasure to be somehow the conclusion to at least talk-wise to this. So, the topic I'm going to talk about is about wave equations. We encountered them several times during that workshop. And the special emphasis I would like to put on here is fraction. On here is fractional models for modeling attenuation of wave equations. So there's actually two applications that I would like to go a little bit into more detail about. And both of these things are papers with based on papers with Bill Randel. So I would also like to acknowledge funding by the Austrian Funding Agency, FWF, and especially in the framework of our graduate school. Okay, so the first part of the talk will be about a bit about deriving such damping models, especially in ultrasonics, where they play quite a big role. And then there's two inverse problems, as I mentioned. One of them is photoacoustic tomography with fractional attenuation, and also a new topic, namely imaging of the non-linearity parameter in ultrasonics. So So, first of all, about modeling, but very first of all, not about modeling in ultrasonics, but modeling in mechanics, because that's somehow historically the first place where these fractional derivative models appeared. And they appeared in the context of modeling viscoelasticity. So, first of all, it's just elasticity that you are going to see. So, that the usual variables are The usual variables are the displacements, this vector u, then there's the stress tensor, the strain tensor, and also the mass density appearing here. And so in the first equation, you just see the usual equation of motion that you all know, which is basically a balance of forces, or actually balance of forces per volume. And then this is complemented by, first of all, the fact. By first of all, the fact that this train is at first order at least the symmetric gradient of the displacement. So, link to these displacements that appear here on the left-hand side. And then we somehow still have to link the sigma and the epsilon. And that's usually done by constitutive modeling. So, these two equations here are really physical laws. So, there's no way to really change them a lot. Well, actually, the second. them a lot well actually the second one is already a bit of a geometric approximation but that's a law so you cannot bring really bring fractional derivatives in there but in this constitutive modeling a lot of well as it says modeling and also constitutive modeling and fractional constitutive modeling has been taken place so first of all about classical models for stress strain relations first of all how do derivatives First of all, how do derivatives come into play here at all? Well, the basic one is Hooke's law. There's no derivatives. We just have a direct linear relation between stress and strain. That's this one. And this is what would, when being inserted in the upper equation here, would just lead to a wave equation basically. Then, but there's rather soon and rather long time ago already, there were models coming up. Already, there were models coming up that also took strain rates, for example, into account. So, time derivatives of the strain, like here in the Newton model and the Kelvin-Folk model, but also rates of the stress. So, we have here time the first time derivative of the stress in Maxwell's model. And a mixture of this is the Sina model where both the stress rate and the strain rate play a role. And the strain rate play a role besides the stress and the strain itself. And being inserted into the equation of motion along with this strain being written as this symmetric gradient of displacements, here's by the way just in 1D to simplify notation. Well, you have already seen Hooke's law just leads to the wave equation, to the ordinary wave equation, and the other models lead to variants of the wave equation. Two variants of the wave equation. So, and in particular, this Kelvin Feucht model is an example where damping comes into play via this strain rate, because then this leads to a damping term, the so-called Keldin-Feucht damping. So, moving to fractional versions, we can actually, in principle, just replace all these ordinary first order time derivatives that appear down here. Derivatives that appear down here by fractional derivatives. So that's due to basically matching with experimental observations of these stress-train relations. And so we have the possibility of putting the derivative, say, order alpha here and putting a derivative of order beta on the other side. And there's even a general way of A general way of that contains all these models up here, and maybe others as well in a relatively recent book and follow-up publications. But let me point out that this fractional modeling has been done quite early on, actually in the 1960s. And the name Caputo is probably known to everyone who has ever dealt with fractional derivatives. Actually, this type of modeling was an incentive. Of modeling was an incentive for a lot of mathematics around fractional derivatives going on since that time. So fractional derivatives existed actually even earlier on, but they were more or less a subject of interest for pure mathematicians. But with Caputo using these fractional derivatives in modeling, there was an onset of really applied mathematics jumping on this topic. Mathematics jumping on this topic. Well, we actually want to do this in acoustics, actually, in ultrasound acoustics, because there's also these experimental observations that these, so to say, integer order models are not really the right thing to model the truth. And so, in acoustics, what we have, so to say, as a replacement for the Newton's law of motion is this balance. Newton's law of motion is this balance of momentum. So, again, it's some kind of force balance. So, it's actually a balance of momentum, where P is now the acoustic pressure and U is still a displacement. In acoustics, it's a particle displacement. It's derivative, it's the particle velocity, as it appears, for instance, here. So, the second part in terms of physical balance laws is balance of mass here. Balance of mass here. So œÅ is the mass density again, and you maybe recognize that the mass balance is just the change of mass density is proportional to the divergence due to the divergence theorem and so on and so forth. But to link back this O here to the P, there's again constitutive modeling going on. Constitutive modeling going on in the context of acoustics. It's then called the you will see it later on in the slide. So just linear acoustics corresponding to Hooke's law in mechanics is just we put the reciprocal of the square speed of sound here as a relation, as a factor relating P, the pressure, or actually pressure fluctuations to the Pressure fluctuations to the mass density fluctuations. But if one does so, if instead of that just linear and just direct relation, one adds some rate terms, then one can do it in principle similarly to mechanics, so to say, a direct relation between mechanics and acoustics quantities, and one ends up with fractional acoustic wave equations. Acoustic wave equations. So, the models that are quite common in use in the, for instance, in simulation of ultrasound with fractional damping. So, these are some examples. There are more of these models, but these maybe most frequently appearing examples are this Caputo-Wisma-Kelvin damping. So, it's somehow related to that Kelvin-Foyt damping model. Voigt damping model in mechanics. And so you see this damping term that appeared also on one of the previous slides. Now you see where it appears in the wave equation, actually. So the classical Kelvin-Folk model would be, that is maybe familiar to some of you, would be that you have just the first order time derivative of Laplace of P appearing as a damping term with some factor B1. Some factor B1. And with this, as it's also often called strong damping or viscous damping, actually the wave equation that you see here in front loses its hyperbolic behavior, basically. So in terms of, oh sorry, writing it, rewriting it, for example, if one writes this as a first order system with respect to time, then Respect to time, then instead of this hyperbolic behavior and finite speed of propagation and all these things, with the strong damping and that one obtains for beta equals one, so for the strong Kelvin-Freck damping, one ends up with parabolic behavior. So that this first order system that one obtains gives rise to an analytic semi-group and to maximal parabolic regularity. To maximize parabolic regularity, one can also carry over all these nice things from parabolic equations, at least linear parabolic equations, but it's actually somehow bad for physics because it loses, for example, as I mentioned, the finite speed of propagation. And also, somehow this damping would be too strong, usually if beta is one. And so, in between, And so in between values, so actually beta in between zero and one are much more natural and much more reproducing measurements that engineers have been doing and physicists have been doing. So this is not only the case for this Caputo-Wisma-Kelvin model, there's also other ways around of bringing in fraction or the constitutive model. Constitutive model model modeling. So, another example is this modified Sabo wave equation that is related to that fractional Maxwell equation model that I've shown you in the context of mechanics before. So, there it's rather a higher, relatively high-order time derivative that acts as a damping term. So, you see, the highest order time derivative is not the second order one, but it's larger than the second. But it's larger than seconds. So alpha is both alpha and beta, sorry, I missed to put this on the slides, are typically here between zero and one. And there's also this mixture, the fractional Sina wave equation, that is a mixture of both of them. And again, one can go for this general model where one sums up over possible higher than second order derivatives and possible such damping terms that affect, so to say, the Laplace. Effect, so to say, the Laplace applied to P. And also, this gives a class of valid fractional models in acoustics. Now, we want to apply this in the context of photoacoustic tomography, where one of the important sub-problems is to reconstruct the initial acoustic pressure from observations at some trust array at the boundary. At the boundary or away from the region of interest over time. So it's basically boundary measurements that one has over a certain time interval. I will show you more about the model. It's just now about motivation. Well, photocaustic tomography also works in the ultrasound regime and therefore the typical damping that is there for ultrasonic imaging should also be taken into account. Should also be taken into account there. And in ultrasonics, it has been known for a long time that damping is typically frequency dependent in such a power low way. And this, more or less via Laplace transform, translates to fractional derivatives in time domain. And while photoacoustic tomography is usually regarded as a problem in time domain, because one has to recover some initial state. Recover some initial state, so it's not easily transferred to frequency domain, although it's a linear problem, of course. So, without attenuation at all, this is a mildly ill-posed problem. It's going backward in time, which tends to be ill-posed if you think of the heat equation, but since it's the wave equation, it's basically well-co-posed. So, the reconstruction in photoacoustic tomography is only mildly imposed problem. An only mildly imposed problem usually, depending, of course, on how much of information you have. So, how good this transducer covers the boundary. But theoretically, if it covers the whole boundary, then it's just a mildly imposed problem. However, in realistic scenarios, when there's attenuation present, this mild imposedness can quickly become severe. Postness can quickly become severe in postness, and in particular in the context of strong damping, where, as I mentioned, the propagation is rather something parabolic rather than hyperbolic. So it's more like a heat equation, then it's somehow clear that recovering the initial conditions from later on measurements, that's imposed, that's severely imposed, like in the backwards heat equation. Heat equation. It's not the same problem, but it's a related problem to the backwards heat equation. And so there's severe, there would be severe imposedness come into play if we would do a fractional, not fractional damping, but integer with first order damping term. Okay, now the question that we posed to ourselves and that we posed in the paper and try to answer at least to some extent is can unique Can uniqueness and reconstruction for this photoacoustic tomography problem, which is that's why I'm putting TIT also here, which is mathematically closely related also to thermoacoustic tomography. Is this still feasible if we add damping as long as this damping is fractional? And on the other hand, how does this fractional damping to what extent does it does it also influence instability? It also influences instability. We would expect that with first order, so if alpha is one fractional damping, that we are in that shape because then we are in this severely imposed regime. Whereas with a small alpha up here, it might be that we are close to this mild imposedness. And that's actually also visible to some extent in the results. So, just to come to the formulation of the problem. Of the problem. So, photocaustic tomography is just, as you also have seen already here, is just basically an inverse problem for the wave equation, for the acoustic wave equation. So A is just the negative Laplacian. What one is after is U0, so the initial pressure, and what one is given is the pressure values at The pressure values at the boundary, so this some surface which models a transducer array, or an array of hydrophones in some experimental setting. So that's really just the pressure and it's over time. So it's boundary, so it's time trace measurements on the boundary. What we add in here is damping terms, so it's D-like damping. Terms. So it's D like damping or D like differential operators. And the differential operators that we are going to look at are those that you saw in the previous slides in the damping terms. So first of all, in this caputo-Wissima-Kelvin damping, it's basically Laplacian with a time derivative acting on it. So it's a mixed time space derivative. So the classical Kelvin damping would be with Kelvin damping would be with beta equals one. And so the fractional damping, sorry, the fractional damping is now this one here with a top positive damping parameter. The fractional Sina damping with this higher than second order, but just time derivative damping term is this one, possibly also with some additional Caputo time. Caputo type damping term back there. And there's also a kind of mixture here with this space fractional version of a damping term. So instead of making this order beta smaller than one, one could also look at the fractional power of the Laplacian and so put a beta tilde here, which is between zero and one. And that's also in the acoustics literature some. Husband's literature sometimes referred to as the Schenholm model. We can actually mix that Caputo with McKelvin with the Chenholm model and then put betas on both of them. Of course, they can be different betas here as a fractional order of the Laplace operator or a fractional order of the time derivative. Okay, that's actually the models that we have been looking at more closely. Been looking at more closely. And let me just show you a result of uniqueness that we obtained. So, the key assumption that we made there is an assumption actually on the eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator. So, and they depend, clearly, they depend on the domain on which they are considered. And the domain, since we, if we assume for simplicity. If you assume for simplicity that the domain is enclosed by that sigma, then it's also a condition on the observation manifold with respect to the operator A here. That's also something which is quite usual in the context of such uniqueness results in the context of photoacoustic tomography, for example. So, the condition that we imposed is that if there Is that if there's the generate eigenvalues, which happens, does not happen in 1D, but it happens in higher space dimensions of the Laplace operators, then the corresponding eigenfunctions should be linearly independent in this sense. Namely, linearly independent. Well, we know that these eigenfunction functions can be made linearly independent, but they should be linearly independent when restricted. Independent when restricted on that observation surface. So that's somehow an interplay between the operator in the PDE model, in the wave model, and the observation surface. Okay, and of course, the larger this observation set is, the more likely this condition can be satisfied, so to say. Under such a linear Under such a linear independence assumption, one can actually prove the uniqueness of the inverse problems of photoacoustics also in these damped models from time trace measurements. Okay, just as I mentioned, in the 1D case, there's no problem because there's no degenerate eigenfunctions, eigenvalues of the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator. This can be carried over to special geometries that allow basically for separation of variables in the eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions can be written as products of functions. In this sense, it's separation of variables. But more generally, it's a condition on zeros of eigenfunctions. So because if you look at this, you have linear combinations. Look at this, you have linear combinations of eigenfunctions, and you look at the zero set of these linear combinations. So, since all eigenfunctions are linear combinations of these basis eigenfunctions, it's an assumption on the zero set of eigenfunctions. So, it tells us that if we want to recover the mode corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda, then the corresponding Corresponding eigenfunctions. So, the zero set of the eigenfunctions should not entirely lie on sigma or the other way around. Sigma should not entirely lie in the zero set of all these eigenfunctions. Okay. And well, I'm mentioning this because recently there has been a lot of research on zeros of eigenfunctions. Research on zeros of eigenfunctions, and actually, we plan to look closer into this and in order to be able to better interpret our assumption. So, actually, one could also additionally look at specially varying sound speed, which also has been done in photoacoustic tomography. Not photoacoustic tomography. So, looking at a sound speed that is not constant. A sound speed that is not constant in time, usually in path, then one additionally needs a so-called non-trapping condition that is related to that varying sound speed. And one can even uniquely recover the sound speed, at least in 1D, from the same observation. So no additional observations are needed in order to recover the spatially varying sound speed. Especially varying sound speed, in addition to the initial condition. In 1D, one has to say, because it's heavily relying on W theory. So the tools of proof, I think I will not have time to go into detail about this. First of all, separation of variables, namely between space and time. And then with respect to time, we look at a Laplace transformed equation. Transformed equations. So most of the analysis of uniqueness can be done in Laplace domain, namely looking at poles of the observation. So after doing a Laplace transform of the time trace observation, this will have poles and it turns out that the poles uniquely determine the eigenvalues and from the eigenvalues we are And from the eigenvalues, we are then able to recover the initial condition. So I have some slides to show you the idea of the proof, but I think it takes too much time. Let me move on to the second topic, again in the context of ultrasonics, namely imaging the non-linearity parameter. So far, it was about linear wave equations or linear damped wave equations. Wave equations. Now, non-linearity comes into play, and let me just illustrate by means of a picture how it's so to say not only hearably but also visibly comes into play. If one plots pictures of acoustic wave propagation, of course, simulated acoustic wave propagation, otherwise one could not see it. What one sees in case of large excitations and really Of large excitations and really taking this nonlinear wave propagation into account is that the wave changes its shape. So, here it starts over here, it starts with a sinusoidal wave. It propagates, it gets damped a bit, but you also see it changes its shape, so it's not sinusoidal anymore. As at the beginning, it gets these sawteeth profile, as it's often called. Cold, so it steepens up here and it gets a bit flatter over here. And that's really due to the fact that the speed of sound depends on the amplitude. So if you have also on the signed amplitude, if you have a, in this case, it would be a large positive amplitude, then the particles, so to say, they travel faster as compared to the region with the negative. Compared to the region with the negative large amplitude, where they are slower. And you will see, hopefully, on the slide, that really the effective sound speed depends on the state, so on the amplitude of the pressure, which is the state here. Okay, to derive these nonlinear acoustic waves equations, one has to go back to the physical quantities. You have seen some of them in the first part of this talk already. The first part of this talk already. The decisive quantities here are the acoustic particle velocity, the acoustic pressure, and the mass density. And all these three quantities are functions of space and time. There's usually a mean part that is sometimes zero. For example, in the case of the velocity, if there's no flow, then the velocity has zero mean and it just considers or consists of such a fluctuating part. Of such a fluctuating part, so the mean part here is zero for the acoustic pressure. That's not always the case. So, there's, so to say, a mean ground pressure P0 plus a fluctuating part. But this P0 part is just constant, so it doesn't matter so much for the PDE itself. And also, for the mass density, of course, the mass density is never zero, it fluctuates around and non-zero. Fluctuates around a non-zero value whole zero. The governing physical equations, also, this you have seen already a bit, namely the balance of momentum combined with the fact that in these applications, usually the particle velocity is irrotational. The outcome is called Navier-Stokes equation here, and you actually see this also at Paris. Actually, you see this also as part of the Navier-Stokes system that is usually used in fluid mechanics. So it contains the pressure and the velocity, and it also contains some non-linear parts. You see here and here, well, that's not non-linear, but it's higher order. So it's usually skipped in linear acoustics, but it's retained in non-linear acoustics. There's also the balance of mass that you have already seen before. Have already seen before, or also as it's called equation of continuity in acoustics physics. And so that's the, well, the change of the temporal change of mass related to the mass transport due to the velocity. And there's a constitutive model. And the constituent model, as you have already seen before, relates the mass density and the pressure, actually, the fluctuating parts of the mass. The fluctuating parts of the mass density and the pressure. In the simple linear case that we had before, it's just via the reciprocal of the squared sound speed. But in nonlinear acoustics, we have to take further quadratic or also higher temporal order terms into account. So, how do we get the usual acoustic wave equation from this? So, the procedure is, well, Is, well, that's the equations. If you just retain the linear parts of these balance and constitutive equations, then we remain with these red parts. Let me collect them on the next slide and mention that whenever we take a gradient, the constant part, so the mean part, just goes away. So it's really about these fluctuating parts. Parts. And so these are the two equations that we have. First of all, the balance equations from physics. So the balance of momentum and balance of mass, just the linear ones. And then adding the constitutive relationship, also the just linear ones, we can simply derive a wave equation by taking the divergence of the first equation and subtracting it from the time. Equation and subtracting it from the time derivative of the second equation. And this eliminates the velocity completely, as you can easily check. And we end up with the acoustic wave equation for the pressure. Okay, that's just to give an idea how it works in principle. Now, Yvonne goes ahead and does this, basically just taking the diversions of the momentum balance and the time derivative of the mass. And the time derivative of the mass balance, and subtracting them from each other, also plugging in the constitutive model, one ends up with non-linear, so doing it with the non-linear things again, one ends up with non-linear wave equations. And these are the classical models of nonlinear acoustics. So the first of these is Kutznetsov's equation. So you still see the basic second-order wave equation. Basic second-order wave equation here, but there's a non-linear term on the right-hand side. It's a quadratic, basically, non-linearity that you see here. There's also damping involved. That's also due to these higher order terms. And it's actually what you see here is what we have previously seen as the Kelvin-Freich damping. So the integer first-order Kelvin-Freich damping that appears and is. And is naturally always used in the context of this non-linearity here for a Kutznetsov's equation. Otherwise, actually, mathematically, one can prove that this equation does not persist over longer time intervals. So there will be blow-up in finite time without damping, with just a quadratic non-linearity. So that's still an equation for P and V. That's still an equation for P and V. So V is not, the velocity is not completely eliminated. If one does so, so to say, or if one adds the equation for the velocity, one ends up with a closed system. One can also do it with a single equation, a single equation for a scalar quantity by recalling the fact that the velocity is irrotational and therefore has a potential. And so using this potential, And so, using this potential up here, one adds up with this gradient term. And there's also a relation between the velocity potential and the pressure that allows to basically replace the pressure up here by the time derivative of the particle velocity. And so, removing doing this time derivative of the particle velocity, but after that, removing a time derivative overall again, one ends. Overall, again, one ends up with this equation for the psi. Another way to end up with a single equation without the V being contained here is to just more or less skip the V term. So it's not actually skipped, it's replaced by a term that contains the pressure, the P again. That's a quite commonly made approximation. It basically amounts to neglecting. Basically, it amounts to neglecting local non-linear effects, and so this gradient term effects here. And then we end up with just having the p-term with just a modified factor more or less. And that gives us the Westerweld equation, which is also one of the common models of nonlinear acoustics. So, this factor here in front. factor here in front that's also often abbreviated as beta a or this b over 2a they are called non-linearity parameters and that's actually the quantity of interest for us now because as has been observed besides the sound speed over here also that non-linearity parameter can vary in space it is often quite tissue dependent if one thinks of medical images Dependent if one thinks of medical imaging. And so getting the spatially varying nonlinearity parameter gives a means for imaging. So we are further on going to consider this Westerweld equation. So let's have a somewhat closer look at the Westerweld equation now with this non-linearity parameter beta A inside. And actually what one observes, well, there's a second time derivative also on the right. A second time derivative also on the right-hand side. That's basically the same as we have on the left-hand side. So, in order to really get something like a proper wave equation, one should move this to the other side. Well, first of all, one should differentiate. That's done in a later step. But that's the model that we are actually going to look at. And we will also collect, so to say, this complicated fraction of physical. Fraction of physical quantities into a single, so to say, mathematically, constant kappa, which is actually in non-linearity imaging is not a constant, but is a function of space. So it's actually kappa of x that we deal with here. So in that context, it's also nice to illustrate that effective sound speed that depends actually on the state. Depends actually on the state, because if one really does the differentiation, so if one differentiates this u square tt, then it's two times kappa times u times u t and then some lower order term. And from this, from this, we extract a factor. So that's this factor one minus two times kappa u that comes from the first term of the second order derivative of the quadratic. Second-order derivative of the quadratic term that sort of modifies, really modifies the sound speed. So, if one really does the differentiation, there's of course a second term also, namely the square of mu t. If one divides by this one minus two kappa u all through this, all through the PDE, then one gets ends up with a well modified Modified sound speed and modified damping constant, so it's a B tilde, so to say, and the non-linear right-hand side, but actually, the non-linearity of the right-hand side is not that bad. The, so to say, dangerous part is this one here. So, we have this effective wave speed. First of all, it's not only dangerous, it's first of all illustrative because it shows us how the wave speed, the effective wave speed here, the The effective wave speed here, the C tilde, changes depending on the state U. So if U is large, then the denominator will be close, might even be close to zero, and the effective wave speed can get very large. Whereas if U is large and negative, then the effective wave speed will be smaller than the constant one. And so, but on the other hand, it's also somehow denser. On the other hand, it's also somehow dangerous to divide by something which can become close to zero, or maybe even can become zero, because then this will not be really wave equation anymore. And in particular, what one also sees is mathematically, this is a PDE with a singularity containing a singularity, a potential singularity here. And so that also has to be taken care of in the Also, it has to be taken care of in the analysis of these PDEs. But we don't want to do PDE analysis here, we want to solve an inverse problem. And this is just to recall that our parameter of interest, the non-linearity parameter, that is a function of the space variable x, appears inside here. So we don't just have the wave equation with some damping here, but we also have this. Also, have this non-linearity parameter, and that's actually the parameter that we want to recover. The observations are typically the same as before. So, we have an array of piezoelectric transducers where we can measure the pressure. And this is represented by surface sigma, or say boundary part sigma, and we do so over a time interval from zero to t. From 0 to t. Okay, and again, we can employ our fractional damping models in order to get a realistic model up here. Okay, now just some comments. The challenge here is the nonlinearity of the model, of course, and the fact that the nonlinearity really appears in the highest order with respect to time derivative term. And also discover that this is a specially varying parameter, whereas the data that we have varies over time, so to say, so in an orthogonal direction. And this is usually known to lead to ill conditioning and even severe ill conditioning of the inverse problem. So, inversion of the forward map F. So, just to mention some results. So, just to mention some results, I will not formulate a theorem here. What we managed to show in this paper is that the forward operator, so the mapping that takes the fractional damping parameter, not the fractional, the non-linearity parameter into the observations within the fractionally damped models. So, that's where fractional comes into play. That's a well-defined forward operator that's more or less PDE. That's more or less PDE analysis. We also proved that it's Frechet differentiable because we wanted to apply Newton's method. And then for the inverse problem, we were not able to prove uniqueness of the whole inverse problem, just of its linearization. And actually, the proof technique is quite similar to the photoacoustic setting. It's again based on the separation of variables, on doing Laplace transform. In Laplace transform, on looking at the poles of the observations and on assuming that linear independence condition on the eigenfunctions. And we also did some reconstructions by Newton's method, and that's actually what I would like to show you at the end. So, this is just a 1D setting, just to illustrate that it works, and mainly also. Mainly also to illustrate what the influence of the fractional damping here is. So, recall that we expect the problem to be less ill-posed if the damping is weaker, so if you are closer to an undamped weight equation, because through an undamped weight equation information propagates into the domain more easily and losslessly, so to say, than with a damped model. Than with a damp model like the heat equation, or a strongly damped fractional wave equation. And you see this in the fractional orders here. So this is with small noise, very small noise, I should admit here. But it's just to illustrate because these were the pictures where one most clearly sees these differences. So if one has really strong damping, so Kelvin-Foeck damping, so basically. Damping, so basically parabolic behavior of the equation, then one sees that there's large deviations from the true solution, even with this small amount of noise. And as the damping becomes milder, so to say, we can recover more and more of the picture, so to say, of this space-dependent non-linearity parameter. This is now again with large um This is now again with larger noise also comparing reconstructions with different damping levels, so to say. So this is again stronger damping, this is weaker damping. And again, we are in better shape if the damping is weaker. This is also visible in the so the degree of ill-postless is of course also visible in the singular values of the linearized forward operator. linearized forward operator and you see here uh maybe let's first of all look at the left picture sorry at the at the left picture where you see the difference in terms of again different levels of damping it just wants to finish somehow but i don't want to finish yet so different levels of damping so stronger damping gives uh stronger decay faster decay of Decay faster decay of the singular values, which is of course bad for inversion. So, this is a log-scale picture, and these black dots correspond to strong damping. The weaker the damping becomes, the more well-behaved the problem is. So, the slower the singular values decay. And so, you can basically read off how many Fourier modes you can recover. Fourier modes you can recover with a certain level of accuracy. It also depends on how pronounced the wave propagation is. And the wave propagation depends on the wave speed. So that's the constant C. So if C is larger, then the wave propagation is more pronounced as compared to the damping again. And so you see in principle it's the same picture, but it's more, well, it's more. Well, it's more masked by the larger C-value. So you see a dependence on the damping order, but the dependence is less pronounced because the propagation of wave is more pronounced due to the larger wave speed. Okay, and that's it basically from my side. Let me thank you very much for your attention.
