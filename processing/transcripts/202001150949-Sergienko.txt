This is about pretty much visiting what Christian did about more than a decade ago. It's a mine unconfined mine ice sheet, the main ice stream to be specific, flowing into an unconfined ice shell. For probably quite a few of you, those equations will be familiar to those who are not that familiar with them. Not that familiar with them. This is the vertical integrated mass balance. It's the top equation. We consider the steady state problem. So the mass balance is steady state, the momentum balance. The first term is the divergence of the longitudinal stress, and there is basal stress. And the last term is the dragon stress, corresponding boundary conditions at the divide. So there is no flow, and as well, there is no. And as well, the retinal driving stress. And because the eye shall unconfined, we can laterally integrate it and get the Calvin front boundary condition right at the grounding line condition. This is the stress condition over here. So another condition that should be satisfied at the grounding line, that the thickness at the flotation. So it's about to start floating. And on the grounding part, the isolation. On the grounding part, the eye thickness should be greater than that radiation cognition, meaning it's grounded. So, and again, as Christian did, we use the sliding law parallel law of sliding with exponent one of n. And delta is the buoyancy parameter. It's the difference between water density and the ice density. So, this profile is an actually computed profile. Computer profile, the balance between these two terms, they are kind of of the same order, so you have that. And just to keep in mind, the path profile is actually cosine. It just waving it fall down, but just kind of give you an idea. To non-dimensionalize this, we have same terms. This order one, there is epsilon, it's a small parameter, everything else is. Parameter, everything else is order one. All terms are order one. So epsilon is a small parameter associated with the ice deformation or longitudinal deformation. In this case, it's a small number. And the buoyancy parameter is given to us by nature. We can kind of fetch this one, but not much this one. Density of ice and density of water, they are determined by physical properties of those. Properties of those. So it's 0.1. Now, this is a small parameter, these are 1, that's fine. But then we come to the stress conditions at the ground line, and there is a problem because these are slightly different order. So what to do and how to choose the order. So we can treat delta as order one, then it's definitely problem to the stress condition. Problem to the stress condition. This is a very small number. It's kind of, you can assume zero. And to balance it, that means that the high sickness at the ground alignment should be very close to zero. And that's pretty much directly following what Christian did exactly. So to resolve this issue with this condition, one, as Christian did, has to introduce the boundary layer. So to deal with that inconsistency. With that inconsistency. And that's exactly what we are going to do. Treating delta as order one parameter, then we introduce a boundary layer near the grounded line. We scale everything. One assumption that goes into it is that the bad slope near the ground line is small, so we can assume that the bad topography varies on scales, and we get to this momentum balance, the same longitudinal trend divergent trend. Longitudinal strength divergent term and assume that the ice flux is constant in that boundary and everything is order one, it should be delta is order one. So this is the boundary layer problem. Now, and if you do computational calculations, so all numerical calculations are done with Comsol. When I'm showing terms of the momentum balance, they are all from Comsol, and meaning solving the four. Meaning, solving the full problem with all terms included, everything included. So, what we, and for some particular sliding parameter, we get that looks something like this. So, the dominant balance between the driving and basal stress, and this is the longitudinal stress divergence, and indeed there is some sort of indication of the presence of a boundary layer, but then when you look at magnitude. But then when you look at magnitudes, the whole stress divergent term is about two order of magnitude smaller than any other. So, an obvious question, why? Let's focus for a moment on these two terms of the boundary layer. It's very easy to write an expression for issuance and velocity. It satisfies all conditions, and this solution satisfies the, or rather, produces exactly. The or as it produces exactly the same flux relationship that Christian came up with. Now, this is only part of the momentum balance in the boundary layer, and the divergence of longitudinal stress is the residual. We can read it. So, we can compute it from these two expressions. Everything under one, and here is a multiplier. If you stare at it for a while and recall the n as you can. n, recall then n is usually 3, m is 1 of n, then it's quite small number, one names. And also if m plus 3 minus n equals 0, this term is precisely 0. So let's compute what it looks like if we take that combination of m and n is exactly 0. So the same balance between longitudinal, oh, I'm sorry, between longitudinal. Longitudinal, oh, I'm sorry, between driving and basal stress, and this is the divergence of longitudinal stress. No indication of boundary layer whatsoever, and this term is seriously, seriously small than other, like almost five orders of magnitude. So pretty much under using this set of parameters, we get the divergence of the longitudinal stress, which is pretty much literally negligible everywhere. So we are not always console, doesn't care what these numbers are. Let's run something more interesting and simpler, whatever you want. So n1, this term is 3. You run simulations with delta 0.1. Yes, indeed, we get a slight indication of the boundary layer, but I can tell you this is an order of magnitude smaller than the other two. Than the other two. So we assume that delta is order one, let's make it bigger, 0.5, why not? And this is more or less kind of a proper boundary layer, if you wish, at least it looks more like boundary layerish behavior. So point one, if by chance we have that this term is quite small, then the divergence of stress is small pretty much here. You know, dress is small pretty much everywhere. And another point, delta is point, or rather point one, is a small number. So it is not a large number in this set compared to epsilon, but rather is a small number. So, sorry, an alternative obviously to then trigger delta the small parameter and assume that there is no boundary layer whatsoever, there is no Layer whatsoever. There is no problem at the grounding line for the stress condition. This condition is order one, and we already have deduced from previous parts that the divergence of longitudinal stress can be neglected. This is what I call an approximate problem. So it still has to be computed. There is no analytic solution here for Solution if for web elevation, or as if for web topography, it has some calibration, so it still has to be computed, but it can be done like just numerical integration. It's not exactly the coupled problem with a second-order ODE in this case. So, just comparing numerical, and by numerical again, I mean come solve solutions, solving for everything all together, everything is there. Together, everything is there. With approximate, it's just that problem that I showed. There are two sets of lines here. You hardly can distinguish them because they are within two meters and under a meter per year for a wide range of sliding parameters. And then in parentheses, they give you a sense. Sorry, what are the deltas? Deltas, the difference between. Delta, the difference between numerical and approximate. So, this is the difference. So, they look quite good, meaning the approximate problem and approximate solution is very, very close to numerical, so we can stick with that, meaning throwing out that term. From the momentum balance, the divergence of the longitudinal stress is not accounted, so it's not questions what is the flux. So the next question is what is the flat at the ground line? So this is the expression. It depends on bed slope, local bed slope at the grounded line, and accumulation rate at the grounded line. So what you're looking at the left plot, this is the bed elevation. And just to give you a sense, the amplitude is 250 meters. Mean bed slopes are extremely, extremely small. It's very, very gentle sort of like cycle pose kind of. Like cycle hose kind of thing. So these symbols, again, there are two sets of them. They represent positions of the grounding line because this expression determines the location of the grounding line. The grounding line is the root of this implicit expression. So it is satisfied only when such that the I see. The eye thickness is equal to fluctuation conditions that determine the position. So, all these dots, these are positioned for the ground line for a particular sliding parameter. What's varied is the accumulation rate. So, the size of the symbol tells you how large or small the accumulation rate is relative. So, and for different positions, and again, as I said, there are two sets. Diamonds are roots of this expression, and there are circles here. And there are circles here. It's numerically computed with some soul. So the flux i thickness relationship for two different parameters. And again, you can see the symbols larger. Again, the SQL with the accumulation rate. They overlap quite well. I have to say that the difference between location computed as a root and numerical question? Yeah, I have a question. So the Yeah, I have a question. So the you're contrasting two different cases. And if I remember correctly, the difference is that you have an accumulation rate term in this. If you omit that, you actually retrieve the same formula as you get for the epsilon is much less than delta case. So it will be on the next slide, just a minute. So this is these are fluxes that These are fluxes that result from this expression for eye sicknesses and again they computed numerically and computed from this expression. What to observe here is that there is that dependence on the bad slope and accumulation rate. And I can tell you right away, even bad slopes are small, neither of these terms can be dropped because the differences between approximate solutions and Solutions and microsolutions, the console becomes quite large. So, another point that you have this you can potentially have more, it's a kind of multivolid function, meaning you can have the same flux for two different thicknesses. All the way around for the same thickness, you can have two different volumes of flux. So, going exactly to your question, right? So, here is the expression. So here is the expression. And the only difference, these two terms. So if you kind of stare a little bit at that expression, is that so this term and this term, they exactly end up in this expression. So those two terms are missing. And the plot is showing the ratio between the two. Again, because bad slope, as I said, it's quite small, 10 minus 3 or something, the differences are. Something, the differences are kind of, at least they can be plotted as a ratio between, in this case, for five something and one. So, and another thing to note is that as the C increases or basal shear increases, the difference between the two curves becomes smaller and smaller. And for value that about 100 kilopascals, the difference is within like 10%. Is within like 10%, but there are still two branches that come from that dependence on the bat slope. So if we in a paper that was published late last year, we did a similar exercise but for much smaller values of flighting parameter. So the same kind of shape of the relationship between the eye thickness and flux, and by the way, this should. I thickness and flux, and by the way, this shape is because of that cosine bad shape that I had, because you had you couldn't can have the same eye thickness or the same bad elevation, but for two different slopes. So that what is the indicator here. The difference is this is the log space now. So for obviously for C equals zero, we can have a finite flux which does not exist for. Which does not exist with Christian's expression. And for much smaller values of C, these lines, these are expressions computed with Christian's expression. So the differences are within two, three, two orders of magnitude. And again, they progressively decrease as the flighting parameter increases. Christian, did that answer your question or not? Answer your question or not? I think so. I can talk to you later. Can I ask a quick question? This thing that written here, relationship between QG and HG, is specific to the particular choice of the bed that you're using. Does the bed change the shape? The shape of this curve? Yes, it is. Because it depends on both the depth and the slope. Exactly. So, but the expression for the But the expression for the case where the basal sliding is on the same order of divergence of longitudinal threads, this is the case. The expression is much more complicated. For the case of balance between driving and basal stress, the expression is a place that fits one line. So yeah, now coming to Now, coming to a question about the stability of the grounded line, so this whole thing about marine ice sheet and stability is buried, roughly speaking, in this expression. So the grounding line position is stable if the accumulation integrated over the whole ice sheet, that flux, is equal to the flux going through the carving line, equal to this expression. Line equal to this expression. So, and if this flux through the grounding line is an explicit monotonic function of the eye thickness, then if you perturb a little bit the position of the grounding line, then the length of the eye sheet is slightly, say, you move it back slightly. Then the length of the eye sheet is slightly shorter, the accumulation, the flux because of the accumulation is much. Of the accumulation is much smaller, a little bit smaller than flux that goes through the grounding line and then it keeps retreating because if on the downflow bed, I thickness will increase progressively. And going, if you consider perturbation in the upstream direction of the stable position of the grounding line, it will continue advancing because you cannot balance those fluxes. Now, because the flux A The flux A is now an implicit function of the I thickness. And on top of that, it has this quite complicated form. It is not entirely obvious what the A stability condition and how B, how it will behave. So again, just to do the usual stuff, and by usual stuff I mean linear stability analysis. I won't bother you with all kind of details of mathematics, but the point is that x tilde g is That x tilde is a perturbation, small perturbation from the position, from the stable position of the grounding line. It depends exponentially in time with some exponent lambda. So in the grounding line, position is stable if the lambda is less than zero. So this is two-line expression for a condition where lambda is less than zero, and again, it depends. Zero and again it depends on the slope, on the curvature, and also on the spatial gradient of accumulation rate at the grounding line. So all those simulations that I showed you with constant accumulation rate, I haven't tried because it's already complex and complicated enough. Now, the question is: can we get away with something much simpler that fits on one line? And the condition is. One line, and the condition is that the derivative of the flux through the grounding line should exceed the accumulation rate in order to for the grounding line to be stable. Again, a little bit complicated. So this is the bed elevation. Symbols show the position of the ground lines for all different parameters. This is a compilation of all those points and symbols that you Points and symbols that you saw in the previous plots. They all plotted here. Open signs are unstable positions, field signs are stable positions. So for all stable positions, the two conditions agree, those field ones. But for unstable, this one is sort of a rogue one. According to Christian's condition, it should be stable, but according to that one. But according to my condition, it is unstable. And just to make sure to test and verify whether it's true or not, I did the time-variant simulation. So what I did, I just moved a little bit the ground aligned position for one kilometer. It's that position. And then let it evolve it, keeping everything else function. So this is the, if you wish, The, if you wish, instability. So the ground align tries to get to its stable position and then moves away. And it is not possible to compute the form analytically, but I just fitted an exponential line with some parameter, and I can tell you what the number is. But the point is that for say about 10 kilometers, 12 kilometers, indeed, it behaves actually. Indeed, it behaves exponentially. The point, though, it takes about 700 years to do that. And again, bed slopes are gentle and that behavior is for this fairly kind of 15 kilopascal value. So now going back to the left panel, what colours show is the reciprocal of this parameter lambda because it has a notion. Lambda because it has a notion of effolding time. So, and this is effoling time shown in colors. And for this magnitudes of sliding parameter or for the range of basal shear between 15 to some 400, 500 kilopascals, it ranges from, I think the smallest one was 87 years in the largest like In the largest like more than 10,000 years. So the point being, even in these circumstances, when the bed slope is gentle and the basal shear is on that order, it takes awfully long time for a perturbed position from its either stable or unstable to return or to retreat away. So there is, I think, quite a bit of, well, There is, I think, quite a bit of value in considering these characteristic time scales. Ian, any questions on that? Yeah, I never seen, so the difference between the shoof is that you are accounting for the gradient of accuration. The gradient and accumulation rate in the. But how sensitive is it to this? What is the gradient? It's the bad gradient. It's 10 minus 3, that's what I'm saying. Accumulation, it varies from few centimeters to a meter because all those different positions, for given sliding parameter, there can be many different positions for different accumulation rates. And so uh for yeah, the a range of accumulation rate from centimeters to a meter. Meters to a meter. So they have meters meters. So they still travel. Yeah. Oh, as you move away from the low driving stress limit towards higher driving stresses. Yeah. The time scales would get smaller, or would get shorter, right? For much smaller values, the time scales are much larger. I'm sorry, much smaller. I'm sorry, much smaller. So it moves much faster. It behaves responsible. And another thing, again, I emphasize that what I'm showing it for small slopes. If I increase the slope, and I did previous calculations, but I didn't want to kind of, it's already complicated enough to add. So the magnitude of slope matters. So and it's not trivial to say that it will go much, much faster, much slower, but it changes quite a bit. Changes quite a bit. So, yeah. So, you talked about the delta approximately delta treated as a small number case, or epsilon approximately delta. And what I didn't get if there was an analytical solution for that case, but I'll talk to you about that later. My question is, it pertains to basically the talk that David gave yesterday. There's situations where effective this data, I forget what the parameter is called, FD or something, but effectively, it's like you're saying. Effectively, it's like you're saying delta is becoming smaller by including buttressing, when buttressing is included. No, I haven't mentioned that. No, no, no, I didn't say you mentioned that, but you could see it as equivalent. It's making. No, I do not think it is an equivalent. And a simple reason being that what you are suggesting would imply that there is a m either additive or multiplicative th uh nature of buttressing on the floods. On the floods with the ground in line. No, no, not on that, but in but changing regime in terms of buttressing. Oh, I see what you're trying to do. Okay, no, I did no. I think buttressing has completely different effect in terms of the two-dimensional, the fact that the ground line is a line, it's not a point. So if there is a two-dimensional, there are two dimensions, not one, and there are additional stresses, they will change. Stresses, they will change the picture substantially. I do not have a sense how, but I believe it's not just a scalp. Simple amendment of what necessarily delta or anything over here at all. Other questions? Yeah, Jimmy. So, you do these numerical simulations and it just revalidates, and I think that's great if the goal is to just. That's great if the goal is to just show that the analytics is compatible with that. But as Jeremy mentioned yesterday, the grounding line really isn't necessarily a vertical straight line, right? Well, and that's precisely what we were talking about. Right, but not only about the buttressing, but also in terms of the thermal processes and the current. So with an America model, we could do a lot more than just looking at sort of what is the balance of stresses and how does that relate to the geometry and how does it relate to the cyclical. The geometry and how does it relate to the stability of the surface, right? Well, yes, you're absolutely correct, but that was not the goal of this particular exercise. The goal was to get the sense how things work in this particular kind of form. And that's great, but I guess I'm asking whether you think like whether you think this is representative of most what's happened in the field or like the answer is no, I do not think The answer is no, I do not think this, yes, this is the answer. So I'm not trying to say that these solutions are the answer to all problems that we have, by no means. So and very one quick comment. Everything what I showed you, it was subject to that particular formula sliding law. And people probably would like to use something different. And this is again a form. And this is again a form like you can choose any it and by theta I mean any parameter you can come up with or whatever you like any combination. So it's arbitrarily I have no idea what it is. The only condition or I assumed or at least I used it's not reflected reflected here, but that the that form is continuously differentiable with respect to all those parameters. All those parameters. You would save a lot, hello for a lot of effort if you don't put discontinuities over there. So, if and if, and again emphasize only if you're absolutely sure with this sliding lower, the divergence of longitudinal stress is still negligible, then all this applies. So, and I'm not saying that the divergence of longitudinal stress is negligible everywhere. Stress is negligible everywhere and always. Only in conditions when this is true, it is possible to get to a similar expression on the plots at the Granden line. So here is the functional form. If this theta depends on the velocity, then again it is an implicit function. If you can come up with a sliding law that You can come up with a sliding law that does not depend on velocity, then you are in much better shape, but good luck for that one, I think. Then it is an explicit function. And the ground and line stability condition, if that sliding law depends on velocity, then again only sine can be determined. There is a condition on sine. But if the sliding law does not depend on the velocity, both the sine On the velocity both, the sine and the value of lambda, it's possible to determine analytically. So, and these are much less of conclusions, more like summary or discussions, pretty much just to summarize what I showed. If the longitudinal stress divergence is small, meaning the driving stress and basal stress are balanced, then a boundary layer near the grounding line.
