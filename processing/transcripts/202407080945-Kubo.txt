Thank you very much for the introduction. So, well, this talk, well, actually, the professor Koboyashi already discussed about the symmetry breaking operators. And then from this talk, also, I would like to talk about some brief ideas about symmetry breaking operators and F method. So let's see. So first of all, so let me fix some assumptions. So in this talk, we are going to see G, G prime, H and H prime couple of times. So basically, we assume that G and Basically, we assume that G and G prime are real V groups, and H and H prime are both subgroups of G and G prime, respectively. The aim of this talk is to look over some ideas about symmetry breaking operators and F method. If time promised, then I'd like to also discuss about some recent results of mine on this topic. All right. All right, so now let's go slowly about that metric branding operators. So we know some ideas about these operators, but well, so let me go slowly and let's check my under our understanding. So let's see. So the viewpoint is a bit different from what Professor Kuber discussed previously. So first of all, let's say we have Say we have g and g prime this pair, and now we have h and h prime here. Of course, one can think of the function spaces, but basically we're going to discuss about the induced representations, but just we're going to do slowly. And now, so let's say V and W are the representations of the H and W. Then we're going to consider the associated bundles. The associated bundles, and now, well, so we consider small sections here and here. So, for brevity, so let me just say I of V for this induced representations for G and J of W for the induced representation for G prime. Of course, well, so this is an induced representation for G, so G can act on here. g so g can act on here and also here well so this is a induced representation of g prime so g prime acts on this space well and moreover so let's look at this condition so g prime is a subgroup of g so that here well basically g prime also acts on this space therefore on this side and this side well g of the both This side for G of the both sides G prime act. So it is natural to consider the G prime internal to annual breaker from here to here or maybe here to here. And then, well, so this case, so originally the G acts only here and then the G prime action comes from the restriction of the G action only here. And then in this case, well, so G prime. In this case, well, so g prime intertwining operators are called symmetric breaking operators. And in the previous talk, the professor Kobayashi also discussed about the holographic operator. And the holographic operator is the other way around. So from here to here is called the holographic operator. And now we consider from here to here. So these operators are called symmetry breaking operators. Operators. So far, we do not achieve anything about the relationship between H and H prime. So now, oh, sorry about that, before that. So, well, in this one, I considered the sections, but of course, there's no harm to consider the holomorphic sections if, well, G mod H and G prime mod H prime have complex structures. Of course, Of course, one can consider L2 sections if there is some suitable measures and so on. Yeah. All right. So now, well, so far, we haven't assumed anything about the relationship between H and H prime. So now let's assume that, well, this H prime is also a subgroup of H. So what is important in this setting? Important in this setting. So, in this case, well, this space is also a subspace of this space, the quotient space. That means that there exists a morphism between here and this and that. So, why this is well interesting and why this is important. So, in the previous talk, Professor Koboresi discussed some definition of differential operators between two different operators. Between two different manifolds. And then to define the differential operators between two different manifolds, we need a morphism. So in this case, so we have a morphism from here to here. So if we have a morphism here, then we can consider the differential operator. So there is some subspace of this whole space for the differential operators. And Operators and the differential operators here are called differentials that are in breaking operators. So the each algebraic close subgroup. Yes, so in the it's arbitrary all subgroups. Yeah, big thing is okay for the definition. Yes. All right. So this is a very some big framework. So now, well, so well, this is the definition. Well, so well, this is the definition. Then, to have more concrete feeling, so let me show you some very concrete examples. Any questions? Okay. All right. So, well, so basically, so we're going to see the ranking book and brackets that which are also showed up in the previous talk. So, yeah, so in this case, let me take In this case, let me take G to be the product of SL2R and H to be the product of SO2. And then G prime and H prime are the diagonal subgroups of G and H, respectively. In this case, well, H prime is also a subgroup of H, so that one can think of differential operators. Then now let's do the same business. So first consider the quotient. Consider the quotient. In this case, the G mod H is the product of two upper half planes, and the G prime H prime is the upper half plane. All right, so well, then next thing is to consider the representations of H and H prime. And here, K1, K2, and K3 are all integer parameters. All right, so let's consider the associated bundles. So in this case, we consider the line bundles and consider, well, the holomorphic sections, right? Then in this case, well, so we want to consider the space of all intertwine the symmetric breaking operators and the space of the differential symmetry breaking operators. So, symmetric original predictors. All right. So, now, so by using this example, I would like to show some concrete results. And basically, so this example is from the paper by Professor Kobarashi and Professor Pipsner. All right, so first the result in the setting is that, so, well, of course, no, this. So, well, of course, this homospace is the all symmetry breaking operators. And this space is for only the differential symmetry breaking operators. So this space is basically smaller than this one. But interestingly, well, in this setting, so both these two species are the same. So in this paper, so they show that in this kind of setting, so this. This kind of setting, so these two spaces are equal, and then that means that all differential, all symmetry breaking operators are local vectors. So they call such a theorem local net theorem. And I think in tomorrow, the Nakahama is going to give some talk about asymmetry breaking operators or maybe the holographic operators. And then in his talk, he's probably going to discuss about. Discuss about this, he's gonna use this kind of setting for his talk. All right, so now let's focus on the differential symmetry breaking operators. All right, well, so this is just a part of the previous slide, and now we want to understand this phase of the differential symmetry breaking operators. Differential symmetry breaking of breakers. And well, so roughly speaking, well, so understanding of this space means probably a lot. So many of us asked probably the different questions. And then, so let me just mention two probably standard questions. So the first one is for the classification. So basically, this space is not always non-zero. So oftentimes, this zero so oftentimes this is zero so first of all we would like to classify the parameters such that this space is non-zero and then further of course we want to determine its dimension as well and also the next the question is the construction we would like to construct the generators of this space so basically we want to construct all We want to construct all differential symmetry breaking operators in here. Let's see. So then let me start with this first question. So in the next slide, I would like to show the result of this classification of the honidaries and also the dimension. Okay, so here's the result. Well, Result? Well, the following three conditions of the parameters are equivalent. So, interestingly, well, so this space sometimes has dimension two, so not always one. Thus it's kind of interesting. And well, anyway, so that those three conditions are like if this is non-zero, then the dimension is one or two. One or two, and the parameters satisfy this condition. And further, the dimension is two if and only if those three parameters satisfy this external condition. Say it's a similar condition. And then the question is: how to prove this kind of theorem? And then the idea is to use the X method. And then, so I'm going to talk about the F-method. And then, so I'm going to talk about the method later. So, first, let me move on to the next result for the construction part. So, for the construction part, so well, since we have two cases, so dimension one or dimension two, so let me discuss these two cases separately. And first, let me focus on only the dimension one case. All right, so to define differential operators, so first let me remind us about the situation here. So this gm of H is the product of two upper half plane. So that means that the section here has two variables, Z1 and Z2. And here, well, this is this G prime of H prime. This g prime of H prime is the upper half plane, so this has one variable. So let me just write Z1, Z2, and Z here. All right, now, well, so the rocking token bracket show up again. So it looks different from the one in the previous talk, but basically the same thing. Yeah. For this parameter, Then for this parameter, we define these by differential operators as follows. So basically, we just take the derivative with respect to z1 and z2 in certain way. And then we have very nice, some non-trivial properties in here. And then we add them all. And then such bi-differential operators are called ranking coconut brackets. And as Professor As Professor Pobertsi mentioned in the previous talk, so these operators are studied in the theory of modular forms. So like, so in this talk, we just write the capital F, but like we have the pensive product of F1 and F2 with weight K1, K2 for modular orbs. And then this RC of And this RC of the F1 tensor F2 is another modular form of weight K3. So this is kind of nice differential operators. All right, so why do we consider this marketing broken? Well, because this theorem holds. So suppose we have this We have this arbitrary condition, which means that the space of the differential symmetry breaking of breakers is non-zero. Then, if the condition A is not satisfied, that means that the parameter does not satisfy the singular condition, then this space is one-dimensional and which is spanned by only the ranking open project. So, well, this is. So, well, this is pretty nice. Well, and then let's see. So, this is already very nice, but let's observe this by differential operators more carefully. Well, so to understand this differential operator, or more or less, to understand this non-trivial coefficient. This non-trivial coefficient very carefully. Let me define, also, let me just say, say, let me just use the Jacobi polynomial. Say P to the alpha beta sub L of D is say the Jacobi polynomial, which is some hypergeometric polynomial. And when we inflate this polynomial of one variable into a polynomial of two variables. Two variables in this way. So, why do we want to do that? Well, because this is kind of amazing that, well, they show that basically this bracket is given by the Jacobi polynomial. So, somewhat for the differential osymmetric grating operators, the sum orthography polynomial shows. Some orthogonal polynomial shows up. So, this is a kind of striking connection between that theory of symmetry breaking operators and the theory of some orthogonal polynomials. Well, then by using this Jacobic polynomial, let me define three more differential operators or three more polynomials. So, let's say G1 tilde. So let's say g1 tilde, g2 tilde, g3 tilde are the polynomials as follows. So the alpha and are some appropriate parameters. And then we inflate those polynomials into the polynomials of two variables in the same way. Then define differential operators out of the out of this polynomial of two variables. So you just insert this derivative into here and just insert this derivative into here. So why? Well, so the interesting thing is that they show that if the parameters satisfy the singular condition, The singular condition, then this space of differential symmetry breaking operators is spanned by those three operators. Well, so I said that, well, in this case, the dimension of this space is two, but now we have three here. But well, this is not a contradiction. Well, in fact, we have a linear relation between the relation between these three operators so in fact only yeah so two of them is enough to span all of them all of them so the dimension is really two well so well now we have the all generators for dimension one case and dimension two case and then so we have nice description of runtime cooking bracket Running cooking bracket. But well, we see. So we have this definition for these differential breakers, but it is not clear what these are. So we want to understand some more nature of these differential breakers. So, well, for the purpose, so let me discuss about some factorization identities that these operators satisfy. Satisfied. So let's see the factorization identities. Let's see. So, well, let me just briefly discuss about factorization identities in a more general setting. This is, well, not so complicated, but this is kind of interesting. So these are our basic quadruple, G G prime, H prime. So G and G prime are just real V groups and H. just well v groups and h and h prime are equal subgroups and we have h representation and h prime representation so far the same all right so now let's just consider another pair of h representation and h prime representation say d2 and w2 then we're going to do the same business from top and bottom so So, we consider the quotients and the associated bundles, and then we're going to consider the similar sections for four of them. Then, now we're going to consider those four spaces. For the yellow side, so these are G representations, and then for the green side, these are G prime representations. Presentation. Let's see. So now we're going to consider this kind of situation. So suppose we have the symmetry breaking operator from here to here, and diagonal. Then in this case, one can think of the factorization of this T as follows. So first, one can consider this upper right corner. Upper right corner. So there exists another symmetry breaking operator from here to here. So this is the G representation originally. Then this is a G prime representation. So from here to here, it's a symmetry breaking operator. And then from here to here, it's just a standard G prime, well, say, just a G prime intertwine. And then the factorization identity leads back, the decomposed. means that the decompose this T as the composition of this T1 and JW. Also, so of course we can consider this lower left corner. So here, so this is just G intertwiner and this is the symmetric breaking operator. So this is another factorization identity. And of course if the situation is lucky enough then we can The situation is lucky enough, then we can consider both of them. So, one may decompose this T in two ways. So, these are the factorization identities. Then, with this in mind, let's go back to our ranking forecast case. So, recall that this DJ is defined in this way, and we want to understand what these are, and then we have. These are, and then we have these four spaces. And basically, these two look the same, but we're going to change the parameters. All right. So interestingly, the date show the following. So these two, three operators are decomposed as follows. And let's see. So, first of all, for D1, so D1. So V1, so here this decomposed as this operator and this operator. Strictly speaking, we need to put the tensor product on this and the identity operator because here we consider the product of SL2R, but just I omit the identity part. So this DZ1 is the SL2R. Is the SL2R intertwiner? So, this is a kind of SL2R intertwiner, and this is again the ranking blocking bracket. And here we have Z1, K1, and we have D1 here. And then the next one is D2. For D2, basically the same, but here we have Z2, K2, and then we have 2 minus K2. So this is because, well, if this. Well, in this setting, G is the product of SL2R. So we have, say, SL2R on the left and SL2R on the right. So this is why we have D1, D2 here. And D3 is the upper right polar. So first we apply the ranking booking bracket and then after that apply this SO2 intertwine. Intertwin. Yeah. So these are kind of, you know, more explicit problems of these three differential predators, some similar differential predators. Let's see. So far, we have seen so many results. So the beautiful results on the ranking book and brackets and these three operators. The next question is: how we showed We showed such theories, such ideas, how to get such results. All right, so in this situation, the presentation is really useful in this case. Oh, yes, yes, the point is here. Any other questions? Yes. So now let me consider the following question. So how do we classify and construct symmetry breaking operators and differential symmetry breaking operators? So one answer for the symmetry breaking operators is to apply the To apply the cover space theory on invariant differential kernels, invariant distribution kernels. So basically, Professor Kubayashi discussed about it in the previous talk. And another one is another, so one answer for the differential symmetry breakout breakers is to apply the so-called ethnic one. So far, since we Well, so far, since we have seen the differential symmetry breaking of breakers closely, so let me just focus on this fantastic method. Yeah. Then for the rest of this talk, we consider those settings. So previously, we just said g and d prime are real v groups, but now from now on, let's consider Now, from now on, let's consider the pair of real reductive groups. And we consider the probability subgroups of G and G prime respectively. Then maybe we add I of V for the induced representation of G and J of W is for the induced representation of G prime. All right. So, this method is invented by Professor Kuboya Shi around 2010. And the Naium idea is to classify and construct the differential symmetry breaking operators while solving a system of PBEs via the so-called algebraic free transform. So, interestingly, well, so our goal is to say construct. To say construct differential operators, and to do so, we're going to solve differential equations. So, this is kind of interesting. And here is some idea. So, some brief idea. So, basically, there exists a linear isomorphism between the space of differential symmetry breaking operators and the space of polynomial sections and polynomial solutions to a system of certain PDEs. System of certain PDEs. And here is a sketch of this isomorphism. So first of all, one can apply so-called duality theorem between the space of differential symmetry breaking operators and the space of G prime P prime homomorphisms between the generalized Barma modules. So I didn't define what these are. Define what these are, but basically, so W check and V check are the duals of V and W. And this is the generalized Vermont module corresponding to this induced representation, and this is the generalized Vermont modules corresponding to this induced representation. And by the pervadionet respiratory, basically, this phase of moralism is isomorphic. space of momorphism is isomorphic to the space of L prime homomorphism between and from w checks to the n plus prime invariance of general module the key part is here so n plus prime invariance of this phase so now let's focus on what these are well so to understand this one well So to understand this one, well, so one may realize to generalize Barner models as the space of the check value distributions on n minus supported of the identity. So this n minus is the opposite numerical of the probability subgroup P in consideration. And so that means that we have the linear isomorphism from here to here. And well, so this space, so the distribution supported at identity on A minus, so this space is basically generated by the derivatives of Dirac delta and Dirac delta distribution. So one can apply the Fourier transform on here to obtain the space of polynomial functions on n plus, tensor v check. So here, this is the Fourier transform. Frey transform. And then this whole procedure, the composition of these two isomorphisms, is called the algebraic Fourier transform of generalized Paranormal module. So now during the algebraic Fourier transform, this part is given by this n plus prime invariance of the polynomial. polynomial functions on n minus. Then, so the question is, what is the n plus prime action on here corresponding to the action on here? Surprisingly, this n plus prime action here, here, the Fourier transform, is given by differential breakers. So therefore, this invariant, computing this invariant means that the means that the solving the differential equations by differential breakers here so in the previous slide and here just i write this whole thing as the whole sort of pde so this is kind of rough sketch of the example well then let's go back to our runtime cooking page To our ranking cocaine case. So, roughly speaking, for the runtime cocaine case, it's not remote P or like more like remote K. But well, so via the grill embedding, one can apply the method for harmonic symmetric spaces, which that are the condition for this ranking-booking case. So, one can apply the method for this case as well. Therefore, As well. Therefore, the space of the differential symmetry breaking operators is isomorphic to the solution space of certain PVE, which is a polynomial solution. And in this case, this solo PVE is essentially given by the polynomial solutions to the Jacobi differential equation. And this is why we have this expression. So the So the runtime-boking bracket is essentially given by Jacobi polynomial, and this is basically from this idea. And I think this afternoon, the Victor is going to give us some talk, and then he's going to use that method to construct and classify certain interferential symmetry breaking operators in his setting. All right. So, well, so now I have six more minutes, I think. So, so let me just probably I can finish here as well, but still I have some time. So, let me just give some results, recent my results on this topic. Yeah. All right. So, let's see. So, in this case, just I consider SLN plus. just I consider SLN plus 1R and SLNR and these are maximum probabilities. Now of course we can consider GL instead of SL since the SL has less parameters. So let me just use SL for this call. So by the way on Friday Dr. Quintin Labru is going to talk about differential Is going to talk about differential synthetic breaking operators for GLN plus one R and G L N R. And just then I just asked him a couple of days ago and I asked him about the specific city of his call. And he told me that, well, he's going to consider GL, GL, but minimal parabolics. So basically, there is no overlap between his talk and my talk in this state. Talk and my talk in the setting, and then basically, we so I use the if method for this talk, but he told me that he's gonna use a different method. So, basically, there is no overlap in many sense between his talk and my talk. So, well, so I'm yeah, I'm looking forward to listening to his talk. So, that's good. Nobody hurts. Okay, no one in part. All right, so let me just you know go briefly about this setting. So let's say, so g is a n plus one r, say n is greater than or equal to two, and then p is a maximal power point of g such that g mod p is the projective space. And then let me write p as m a n, and in this case m is the sl. plus minus nr in this case the set of equivalence classes of our example irreducible representations of irreducible finite dimensional representations of p is given by those data and for a g prime well so i take the subgroup g prime as follows so which is isomorphic to s. So, which is isomorphic to SLA1. And then take, then define P prime, M prime, A prime, M plus prime similarly. And then the finite dimensional irreducible representations are parameterized as follows. In this case, so the aim of this study is to classify and construct all differential symmetry breaking operators. differential metric breaking operators from the wine bundle to the vector bundle. So for the domain side, I consider only the wine bundle, but for the target side, I consider also the vector bundle. And then here are two problems. So first, so basically what I want to do is the same as what we did for the one important case. So basically, first we want to classify all the parameters such that the space is not zero and also determine the dimension. And also we want to construct generators here. And of course, you know, I don't have enough time to discuss both of them. So let me just focus on the classification part. All right. Maybe here are some results. Here are some results. So the situation is different between n equals 2 case and the higher ground case. For n greater than or equal to 3, we put some parameters set, this one and bound one, and this has some complex parameters, and this has more restrictive. Then let me write the union as lambda sub n. Lamb sub n and here is the result so the following query conditions are equivalent well known zero dimension is one and the parameter is in here and then the reason why we have two parameter sets is that although the dimension is always one as far as the space is non-zero the asponding differential operators are different so this case is uh case is given by normal derivative and this is something different or then the n equals two case so in this case sl3r to sl n r so we have again two parameters set but in this case well since it's so since we have sl2r the target space is also a line bundle so therefore in this case well this small this Well, this small set is a subset of this set. Then, in this case, well, as for the ranking organ case, well, so this dimension could be two. And then the dimension is two if and only these parameters is in this senior set. All right, that's all for my talk. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. For attention, thank you. So last example is a splotic interchange or the okay, so which one? Info? Okay, two. This is not spladding. Yeah, that is a very interesting question, I think. So yeah, so for this case, so. So far, so yeah, so for some some cases, so I might so the point is like for this part, so if the parameter is in here, then we have the normal derivative for that case. We already know that. So this differential operator is the residual operator for sure. And then the question is, how about this singular parameter set? Singular parameter set. And so far, we haven't had the exact result on this case. But I asked several people about if this differential breakers is a residual breaker of some non-local breakers. And then it seems like it's yes. And then basically, so this is kind of interesting part. So when we discuss. Interesting part, so let me discuss with you after this talk. So, what is the intuition work that can be seen from the label from? Ah, so intuition, yes. Ah, okay. Okay, I see. So, basically, they are so we have okay, hold on a second. So, here, so we have two parameters, and then one of them is the normal derivative, and then the other one is something different. And then the other one is something different, right? And then this something different is the composition. So these differential operators is the composition of normal derivative and the SLNR intertwining differential operator. Yeah. So the nature of differential operators between these two are different. And if n is greater than or equal to three, then these two differential operators are very different. The one of them is one bundle to one bundle. Bundle to line bundle, the other one is line bundle to text a bundle. But if n equals three, this operator is also from line bundle to line bundle. That's why we have two differential operators for n equals two case. That is kind of idea. Can you remind us what is the meaning of sporadic? Yeah, sure, sure. Yes. Okay, so basically, so first of all, let's consider the not to. So first of all, let's consider the Napoleon operator, and then we consider the residual operator of the Napoleon operator. And then the residual operator is a differential operator. So the sporadic operator is the differential operator, which are not from the residual operator. Yeah, that is kind of good. Yeah. But if it is differential. I'm sorry. It is still differential. It's still differential operator. Yeah. So for instance, so let's. For instance, so let's consider this case. Okay, let's see. All right, so let's consider this pair, G and P. And in this case, let's forget about G prime. Just let's consider from G to G and this probabilistic subgroup. And in this case, there is no Lapstan operator in the city, but still we have. But still, we have G intertwining differential operators. Yeah. So in that case, it's a scoratic operator. I'm sorry. For that case, there's no non-local operators. There's only differential operators. Yeah. Yes. But if n equals 2, then we have Napoleon operator. So the So the extra differential operators could be also the residual operator of the differential operator. The aco polynomial is the polynomial that satisfies the partial field. But the converse is not true. The commas is not true because there exists uh very positive parameters, yes, that there exists for example such the parameter is exactly the same parameter for which the module of the case of that is true. Yes, and in this case, that uh we also found another case. Under the case, the branching makes the three cases tool. Do you have such an interpretation like some classical polynomials? Yeah, class of polynomials. Differential equations. Okay. You also have different interpretations of this classical analysis. Okay. So in this setting, a differential equation is basically the product of two differential operators, and one of them is Euler operator. One of them is Euler operator, and the other one is some is coming from the normal derivative. So, for that case, it's not apparent to me that you know some orthogonal polynomial business work in our case. And then, yeah, I'm sorry, but so this, so what Professor Pogresi mentioned is exactly this case. So, actually, So actually, these, okay, hold on a second. So let me just. Okay, here. So these are not Japovi polynomials, but these are also the solution of Japovi differential equations. So Jacobi polynomial is a solution of Jacobi differential equation, but the solution of Jacobi differential equation is not necessarily Jacobi polynomial. It's just maybe. I see. I actually have a question. I actually have a question. Yes. I mean, from this Jacobi polynomial, somehow you get a polynomial of two variables. Yes. Why the sort of the law of x, y are not the same, are not symmetric. I mean, you have two x over y plus one. It's like that. Okay. Both positions, second position. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So actually, so of course we can just flip x and y. And then the point, the y, we have this. So, why we have this in fact. So, here I have the expression for this Jacobi polynomial in this way. But if we express this determinant of hypergeometric polynomial, and then we have, say, x minus 1 over 2. Yeah, and then just we want to make we want to just substitute the, so that's why we have plus one here. And that's why we have type two and any. Type two. The multiple by two. This is the kind of expression of hypergeometric polynomial. This is one answer. So this here? Yes, this is a free association question, so I apologize for it. But so you have an instance on some situation of the classification operators where sometimes it's sometimes dimension one, sometimes I mentioned two, you're working and yesterday. You work in an SLM and you are inspired by the work of Kabal Yashi and Person in SL2. Is there a direct connection between your construction and the SLM, some induction that comes from their phenomenon? I see. So again, so I haven't thought about the literal thing, but I haven't thought about the But I haven't thought about it. Yeah, and then so their case is the Penza product called SL2, and then my case is not. So it's not, but maybe something, but like yeah, yeah, but that is interesting. Yeah. It's whether you want to learn. It's whether you want your series. Yeah, sure. So slightly aside. So slightly aside, but oh, so these operators, these are salts that show up. You mentioned that they were coming from modular forms, and then I saw you fully motivated that they came from these Jacobi differential equations and so forth. And I'm wondering, is the relationship to modular forms something real or is it an accident? Is there somewhere in the story that we could say, oh, it's all about modular forms? Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. So what I know is that, so Rank King, I think, so basically they try to construct. Basically, they try to construct modular forms out of two modular forms. And then, so they seem like, so first they differentiate it, but it doesn't work. And then the next try, next one is to try to differentiate, but some different, some combination. And this just they compute it by hand out of scratch. They found that this folder works fine. Yeah, this is kind of in terms of your story. Do large other forms show up in your story, in the story? Okay, so why we mention that much at all? What is the role of the modular form in my story? Okay, okay. I see the modular form. Actually, the module form is the idea. Okay, so actually, yeah, that is an interesting question. So, multiple form here. So, basically, we consider the some sort of some sort of a sort of a um invariance of some some group of g right then if so we're supposed to say so let's see so the point is here the modular form to have a modular form we don't need a g prime we just need a subgroup of this g prime then the inter so intertwining then the intertwiningness of this G prime or subgroup is just equivalent to the considering the symmetry breaking operators. So considering the operator between two modular forms or two species of modular forms is just the same as considering the symmetry breaking operators. So basically more or less the same thing. But for the modular form, we need some subgroup of G prime. But in that case, interestingly, I think That case, interestingly, I think the VA showed that if the subgroup, if the space has the intertwining unit of that subgroup, that is automatically show that that space also has the intertwining of the whole group. That is kind of amazing, in fact. Yeah. Did I answer your question? Take care. Any questions about this part of the book? I think we're both in my back. Okay, so let's thank you very much.
