You have to be able to have a radio number and it's also difficult to quantify the gradient numbers for who is like the one you you mentioned. But they they shouldn't have to be reasonably hard for us to identify inertial effects. But they might be very simple. But I think it's possible to quantify if you postering them appropriately. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right, our second presentation this morning is Estima. Morning everyone, thanks very much for staying around. This last leg of the workshop. Indeed, I'm going to talk to you about some toy modeling that I'm doing for this non-nutrient flow through fractal force media. This a collaboration with Marcus Truci√≥n and Antonio Manero from National University of Mexico. From National University of Mexico, and my postgraduate student, Goani Gonzales Garcia, which is the one doing this work. Yeah, I want to give you an outline of what we are going to do. So basically, it's the motivation of this work, which is a contact with the industry and people from the Mexican government and Cape Mexico, which is the old company, Mexican company. Then I'm going to show you some results on the analytical solutions. Some results on the analytical solutions that we can provide with this model, and some numerics that we do increasing the complexity of the fluids itself. To finally wrap up. Okay, so what's the motivation? Really, with very nice illustrations that I could get from the workshop itself, they were exposed here. And basically, what we can see is the phenomenon of channelization, which goes through tortoise pack. Which goes through tortoise paths, which is one of the main features of multiple media, and this kind of networking that Ian and Steam has been doing some lately. Really it comes from what we've been doing lately on complex flow of complex fluids, which is kind of flow through obstacles, contractions, cross slots, some uh pores and flow and flow through powers and flow and flow throws, etc., that we've been doing for the last years on computational biology side more in the benchmark flow modeling more than in the forum so in these talks that we had with these industrial partners they said okay this is very rich but it's very complicated so we don't need that kind of such a detail and their question was could this be a lot easier for Would this be a lot easier for us, a lot handier for us, say, that we can have one equation bringing in all these kind of ideas. That was their question, so it's a very difficult question to answer. And well, my first answer was, okay, this is going to be very difficult to answer, straightforward. But the first thing I thought about was precisely the permeability, in which, well, this is Darcy's law, in which we have the permeability itself. In which we have the permeability itself that has all the ingredients, all the rheology of the unit and the porphology of the system in itself. So I said, well, maybe that's the way to go. Let's see what we can do. So that was more or less the idea that spawning this work. So I started looking at some ideas of simple flows through the vorus media. And this is one illustration coming from Science's work back in 2016. Work back in 2006, in which he does this cartoon of a pore of medium, in which you can see the tortoise path that the smid follows. Obviously, this is only one illustration of one pore, but you can have many as large as your medium is. So, really, there's two lengths there. The macroscopic length of the sample, which is L0, which I have there, and the tortuous path of fluid element follows, which would be L T. So, he bases So he bases his analysis on this, and that's what I'm going to do in this presentation. So basically, what we want to really look at is the channelization through the porosity and the tortosity of the poros meat with the ingredients of generalized non-neutral fluids. So, something simple, trying to get a toy model for continuous prediction of the permeability to. Ability to look to some specific pores maybe. So, this is a cartoon that we created trying to shape this industrialist. So, what's the idea? Basically, well, we have this pores going around, maybe more churches than others, and it depends on the material itself, of the rocks or the samples they put. And if you see this traversally, I mean you see the cross-section, what you would see is like. What you would see is like pores. So, this would be like the production going this way of the sun. So, we have two arrangements there: the distribution of pores and the torposity of the pore, the length. There are similar approaches. This is not basically new. There are similar approaches. As I said, SANS approach in 2016 and June's approach in 2008 working on this. So, I decided just to go through them and see what we can do as a novel. Do as a normal work on that. Right, so these are basically a bundle of tube models in which you have the porous medium analyzed as a collection of charges tubes, right? And they are distributed in the sample. The distribution of pores and distribution of the length follow a fractal scaling. So, this first is a fractal scaling for the length. As you can see, it's a kind of a As you can see, it's a kind of a power law combination in which you have the macroscopic length L0 with an exponent dt, which would be our fractal scaling for tortosity. And there's also a functionality with the radius of the tube, etc. So what's the limits of this scaling? DT1 would be a straight channel, whilst D2 and the progressive augmentation of DT would be this transition from a straight channel. This transition from a straight tube into something that goes wobbly until getting into basically a plane. That would be the first scaling for the tortosity. And the other would be the number of pores in the sample, which again follows a power law functionality with the maximum radius in the sample and the actual radius of each pore. Then, what's the Then, what's the functionality? Df would be an orderly distribution like this, df1, sorry, and then the progressive augmentation of this would give you some self-similarity into the mean, right? DF shouldn't reach values of 2 because there's some indetermination in the model. I will show you. So, those are the two fractal scales that we are using. And basically, we want to treat this problem as a flow. We want to treat this problem as a flow in a tube, but now the tube is going to be outweighed in length because of porcupity. We are going to impose a pressure gradient, as usual, and try to see what we can get from there through the analysis of the permeability. So, this is the basic set of the questions we're going to solve. We are going to simplify them strongly, but you have the nominal balance there for the non-material fluid, you have incompressibility through mass balance, you have Balance, you have the generalized non-tonal squid constitutive equation in which we are going to plug in there some functionalities for viscosity. And well, this is just a measure of the rate of deformation, shear rate measure. Okay, if we take these equations and simplify them into a straight tube hanging a postal flow, very simple, genital coordinates and crippling flow, you would find that expression. You would find that expression that you see on top. Then, coming back to the tortosity, this is the scaling. I just told you what the functionality is there and what's the limiting values of this kind of scaling, fractal scaling. Then, why don't we recast the problem instead of any length? It would be the length of the tortuous path, because that's the one that is following and feeling the element of the portrayal. Feeling the element of the coordinates. Using the chain rule, differentiating that expression of the tortoise length, we can just arrive to this idea. As you can see, we just recasted the model, particularly the pressure drop, in terms of this macroscopic length L0, but you have the pre-factor coming from the porous medium itself. So you will have something. So you will have something that is augmented with length, but still remains in the real Hotelian Poisson flow. Okay. So there we have that one. Then we assume, as always, that pressure drop is constant, so that we can just convert that equation into an ODE for solving, usually. And then we can just solve that equation for stress. This, if you consider that the tortuousity is one source. Consider that the tortosity is one source structure comes back directly to what we know from transfer phenomena. So this maps well with conventional theory. Now, to get in into non-Newtonian representation, we just need to plug in here our generalized Newtonian flow and start giving functionalities to beta, gamma dam. Obviously, this gives us a differential equation for the velocity. Differential equation for the velocity that we should solve under non-slip boundary conditions and then integrate to get the flow rate in a single tortoise tube. Recall that we have already now the information for tossing. So by integrating that, we will get the flow in a single tortoise tube. So what we would do, then integrate it again over the number of oars and get the total flow rate in some, but we will show that later. We'll show that later. Okay, so let's see now the rheology that I'm going to consider. Nothing fancy at this point. Well, you know, this is a bit of an obvious slide. Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids passing through power law, Bingham, Hersel Bookli, right? Just to cover all the phenomenology basic in porous media, no elasticity at all. It's a the second step that we're going to take. This is just staying on on viscous and viscous Staying on viscous and viscoplastic fluids at this point. So these are the considered equations that we use to viscous flows, basically the Newtonian case as a base case, and shear thinning and shear thickening behavior through overlaw. Why these two? Because they have analytical solutions. So we want to have the base cases at hand to test our numerical methods, achieve medical symptoms of good affected. complicated at this point. Then for viscoplasticity, we will use three of them. Binga still has an analytical solution. Herschel Bookley we use them because these people, the other papers, they use it as a base case so we want to compare with them. And then the last one which is kind of a mixture of caro√±a soda with bingam we use it for the purpose of trying to get well the critical pressure drop for flow The critical pressure drop for flow inception. So, as I say, there's analytical solution for those cases, an operator for the other two. Right? Okay, so coming back to the point of how to calculate the flow rate in the sample, well, we take this definition in which we have the idea again of the pores distributed in the sample. We have the number of pores, and we can just have this differential of the number of pores. This differential number of force to plug it in into the equation. And then this is going to include in the system this fractal scaling for porosity. Again, well, this is one, but there may be another here, another here, another here. So we need to do the summation from the smallest port to the largest port to get the whole flow rate in the sample. Flow rate in the sound. Okay, so with that, we have already now nearly everything for calculating the permeability. We have the total flow rate, we have the viscosity, well, it says mu there, that should be eta lambda dot anyway. We have the pressure drop given, and we need the area coming in from, again, the the characterization of the of the porous medium, which is coming again from this measure of the portrosity. So we Of the portrosity. So we just do these integrals, we get through the definition of porosity with our fractal scaling this area available for us. So we have everything. Here I show you the solutions, analytical solutions for Newtonian fluid. What it is notable here is the polynomial on the denominator that comes from That comes from fractals and the fractal scalings. Here is a power location which starts to be a little bit long, but anyway, it comes back to the Newtonian case with n equals 1. Maybe you can note that this is not there. This dt over 1 would be this one, and this d over 1 would be the second. So it's coming back nicely. And also for the Bingham case happens the same. Also, for the Bingham case, it happens the same. If R0, the radius of the Gilbin radius is 0, then this drops and it comes back nicely to new. So we will take these three solutions as the base cases for a simple, very simple algorithm to solve the differential equations that we just saw, and also integrating over the region of flow to get Flow to get the total flow rating sample. I don't show that because that's all, it's just a rubber metal method, nothing fancy and simpson rule for integration. It's really easy to do. What I want to show you is what happens with the comparison between the analytical solution with our model and the solution from numerics. So, as you can see, everything goes. So, as you can see, everything goes okay. I mean, there's no complication at all. You can see that for the three cases, analytical and numerical evolution just average, no problem at all. So, the position of our method is proven there, just graphic there. I can give you some more evidence if you would like in terms of numbers. But, okay, from here, I'm going to show you just what's happening with the predictions coming from the numerics of the Coming from the numerical solutions. And, well, we can just start extracting some physical information from here. As you can see, the permeability for the Newtonian fluid is higher than for the other two cases. Why? Because we are just plotting there a shear thickening over law and a viscous plastic material. So everything is physically sound, physically sensible sensible. So Sensible, so let's just carry on. Then, with this information, I want to show you some comparison with experiments. These experiments are coming first for anatomium fluid. This is a porous medium studied by Sang again, which is sintered coupled by this first packing, and water is flowing from that. It's not complicated. You can see here the comparison between our predictions in red. Our predictions in red, theoretical, with their predictions in green. You can see there's a notable difference between the numerators of the permeability for them and us. We have basically a polynomial and dt and df that is of higher order than for them. So that's basically explained why the red curve, which corresponds to our predictions, lies below the ones. Below the ones of them. That's okay. But now, the comparison with experiments, those three points given by Chen back in 2000, you can see that our model somehow kind of represents well the slope and even it's a little bit closer to experiments here. Beyond this porosity, say around 0.55, these models under predict the Models under predict the experiment. So there may be the need of some more physics there, but anyway, it goes okay, it looks more or less fine. So let's see what happens after. I got to say that these fractal values are coming from the work of Chen. Again, he determined them, so you just took them, plugged into the models, and produced this data. Okay. Okay, so then switching back into other non-Newtonian characterization, I just left the Newtonian values there for reference, but really, I mean, it's now irrelevant in case of the non-Newtonian case. Here we again compare the predictions of our model with the SANS model for a power law fluid. As you can see, if we think we Can see if we think we have a larger permeability, what we expect, and if we thicken the materials, we have a lower permeability. But this is bringing in some interesting features there. As you can see, also the slopes are changing. So if you have a thinning effect, you have a slope that goes larger and basically seemingly as this goes. Obviously, this comparison is not fair because this would be an Is not fair because this would be a chair-to-noon fluid, whilst this is done by an alternate fluid in the packet bed, as you just said. So, I think, well, there should be some non-alternate effects that we need to include, for example, this plasticity in terms of thinning, to start from getting some of this kind of rising trends in the permeability itself. So, this is just a basic This is just basically what I have just said. Then it has a higher probability and steeper slopes, and thickening is the other way around. Okay? Now, paying attention to plasticity, this is a measure that June, in part in 2008, proposed for the critical pressure for clone section. As you can see, our model and the one from June, they differ again in the order of. In the order of the polynomial of dt and df, now on the denominator, because we needed to do some maps to get the same shapes. And well, this is what is illustrated here, that our model just predicts larger pressure drops for flowing session. So now switching to non-Newtonian shear thinning fluid, and I would say physical elastic problem. And I would say p-scholastic, because we don't have information for that. We have some solutions, not for linear field cellulose solutions, PMC in short, which have been proposed and analyzed by Sokkin back in 2010. He started looking at them using the Herschel-Booking model. You can see, this is the parameters of the Herschel-Hersha-Book model, giving a good result in characteristic tweets as you can. In characteristic tweets, as you can see graphically. So, this seems a very good model for the sheer thing in phase, but this should be definitely viscolas. So, this is the only information we have got, so we cannot do anymore. We've been trying to get uh the full uh characterization that it seems to be reported in the previously uh thesis of uh of Soki, seemingly. Of SOCI, seemingly, but we haven't haven't got reach of that. If you haven't, it would be really useful for us to have a full characterization, visco-last characterization of these PMC solutions. Anyway, we wondered we need some viscosity characterization, but let's just carry on. Uh this is uh the predictions of of our model against uh Sohi's model, right? Our model is continuous lines. Our model is continuous lines, his model is dashed lines, and this is experiments. Symbols are experiments. So basically, we have two solutions of different PMC, PMC 25 for 0.3 and 0.5 weight concentration, and PMC 400, 0.3 and 0.5 weight concentration. So as you can see, the concentrations provokes the shifting of The shifting of the adarcy velocity curve to higher pressure drops. You can see also some change in the level of velocity attained when you have the critical pressure drop again there. So basically, none of our models mine was obvious with each experimental data. The only thing that I can see that is more or less acceptable is our model, this continuous line, for the less. For the less viscous sample. Here, nearly there is the QT open drop predicted and more or less the slope in the very first chunk of the sample. But from there, everything goes a mess. So we started thinking of that. Well, we said there should be something. Something related either to dysplasticity, as I was saying, either to elastic dissipation, as Sujit and his group suggest, or some kind of instability that we are not able to capture with this model. So the question is, how can we just drop these kind of ideas into a simple model like this? By my premise, talking with Nintendoists, they want something simple, they don't want to go and lose. Something simple. They don't want to go and do CFT. They want to have an equation and plug it in somewhere and just work alone. So that's the challenge. It's a very strong challenge anyway. So we started thinking about this and it seems that we need extra reality. So let's see. This is just an illustration of my data against experimental data. So for you that you can see that we hit this little corner there that we are missing. This little corner there that we are missing, all the other stuff, right? Okay, extra rheology. We said, okay, what's the problem of Personal Hooky that it hasn't got the limited, the two-neiltoni plateaus? And what happens in the flow inception point? Well, you have a very thin layer feeling the pressure drops and starting movement. So it may be that it. So, it may be that it experiences a high shear rate. And we are at high shear rates, we are in the bounds where no viscosity bounding is. So, you have a diminished or underpredicted viscosity, maybe concurrent booming. So, what we said is just bringing a Karoya Suda model, right, and putting some ping up functionality there. It's just kind of a Frankenstein model, anyway, but I said, okay, let's try it. Okay? This is the This is the rheological characterization of the same data with this model, right? So it does okay. No viscoelastic again, but anyway, let's see what happens. That happens. You can just spot critical pressures. But through this model, we lose the charge. So So we can be just trying to get some other models into it, but I don't think it's about it. I think it's about some more physics really related, as I was saying, to this plasticity or other characteristics of the material. I don't know. That's the comparison with our model and the one from Socky again, which doesn't do much well. Sorry. Yeah. So. So we started to reflect on this work and I think from these five days of workshop I have a lot of information now to try to comply with, bringing in some rheology, bringing in some physics. And really the question for me is how do we put all this richness into simple models? Maybe not Tarsilomi, because this is Tarsilomi, something different. Because this is our zooming, something different, Coseni or whatever, comes up. But I think what one of these kinds of questions coming from industrialists can be very challenging to us. So this is my first goal on that work, and hopefully next workshop I can come back and tell you that we've done better. And with this, looking forward to your questions. Ten seconds. My team, Axio Govani Gonzalez-Garcia is the one working on this work. That's my, well, part of my group, some of them. We also work with Jamie Tamadon at Trans University, Octavio Malero in Mexico, Marco Lero in Spain, but in Spain. Some acknowledgements that we need to do always. Funding, and with that, And with that, looking forward to the questions.
